<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Sports Facilities</FONT></H3>
The University has a good range of sports facilities, including
squash courts, a multi-purpose sports hall and fitness gym at
Woodland  House, a swimming pool at the Students' Union, an athletics track and numerous
sports pitches and tennis courts (both indoor and outdoor)at Coombe Dingle, near the Stoke Bishop Halls.<P>

<IMG SRC="squash.gif"><P>

In addition the Halls have a generous provision of squash
and tennis courts of their own, both in Clifton and at Stoke Bishop.
<P>
Each Hall has several sports teams, providing the opportunity
to become involved in both competitive and friendly sport at all
levels. In addition, the Athletic Union has around 50 clubs which
offer a wide range of sporting activities.<P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#000080">Transport</FONT></H3>
The Halls at Stoke Bishop are about two miles from the University
precinct and are on a regular bus route. In addition the Students'
Union organises an evening shuttle service between these Halls and the Union, the Arts and Social Sciences Library and the city centre. The Clifton  Halls are within easy walking distance of the Union and the precinct. Many students use bicycles, and
most residences have bicycle racks or stores.
<P>
Car parking is difficult, and students are discouraged from bringing
a car to Bristol. There are no parking facilities for students
in the precinct or at Student Houses, and only limited provision
at the Clifton Halls. The Stoke Bishop Halls, however, do have
reasonable parking facilities. It is a condition of residence
that students in University accommodation do not bring a car to
Bristol unless they have been allocated an off-street parking
space (see regulation 15 of Terms and Conditions on the <A HREF="contract.htm">Contractual Arrangements</A>) page.  
Annual charges are payable for both car and motorcycle parking permits at Halls.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><H3>Computing Facilities</H3></FONT>

All nine Halls of Residence have computer rooms equipped with PCs and 
printers which (with the exception of Badock and University Halls) are accessible 
24 hours a day. These PCs are linked to the University computer network , enabling 
students to access email, the World Wide Web and a variety of software and learning resources.
<P>
In addition students living in Halls and most Student Houses who have their own PC may, for a set annual fee, subscribe to the residential networking (ResNet) service, enabling them to access all the facilities listed above from their own study-bedroom. Application forms are issued prior to arival, or see <A HREF="http://www.resnet.bristol.ac.uk/">http://www.resnet.bristol.ac.uk/</A>
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><H3>Telephone Facilities</FONT></H3>

Study-bedrooms in Halls of Residence and Student Houses
are equipped with telephones. The service is managed by World<U>x</U>Change Communications.
<P>
Calls may be made by registering with World<U>x</U>Change Communications or by purchasing appropriate pre-paid calling cards. Whether or not the telephone is used to make chargeable calls it remains available for incoming calls and for internal calls within the University free of charge. Each telephone has a voice mailbox for callers to leave messages if the telephone is unanswered.<P>

<FONT COLOR="#000080"><B>Students' Union shops</B></FONT><BR>
The Students' Union operates two shops, one in the Students' Union building itself and the other at Hiatt Baker Hall, serving students on the Stoke Bishop site. Both stock a good range of groceries, snacks, fresh fruit and vegetables, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as newspapers, magazines, stationery, entertainment tickets and clothing and memorabilia displaying the University logo.
