I have a third grade class and I hope to use Camp Internet to motivate my students and to differentiate the curriculum.  I am active in our school garden but also teach local history.  I can see the GPS having a fantastic application as we explore our town.  Camp Internet will now have a third grade class as well as a second grade class.

I am the computer teacher at Solana Vista School in Solana Beach School District.  My students (K-3) enjoy the internet on a regular basis and we have already done internet scavenger hunts on different topics.  I just arrived Verde Valley School in Sedona Arizona today to this camp internet class and am excited to learn more that I can do with kids and the internet.  Arriving Sedona today has been an adventure as this whole camp internet experience is and will continue to be.  I am now getting a better picture of what I might do with all this knowledge.  I especially like the idea of getting outside and experiencing nature and then logging what I have seen onto the computer to share with others. I hope to  do some of this with my students in the future.

Hi out there!  Weíre here in beautiful Sedona, Arizona or should I say the little village near Sedona.  It is just beautiful out here!  Iíve never been to Arizona, but now I am planning my next yearís vacation to come to this very spot on our way through to California.  The hills are just beautiful and red!  The rock formations are spectacular and for anyone who is interested in hiking, this an awesome place to hike.  Some of our group did a hike this very morning at 5:00 A.M.  We saw some cool things like a deer just waking up in the tall grass near a creek we hiked to.  There were huge fish down in the creek as well as a cute rabbit.  It seemed like one of the most peaceful places that I have ever been.  If youíve never been to Sedona, you need to make it a point to stop through on your way to sunny New Mexico where I live!

Camp Experience to date:

 

<IMG SRC ="http://www.campinternet.net/~camp02/sedona_photos/cd_teachers3_320.jpg">

Arrived Sedona approx. 4 p.m. on Wednesday, June 26, 2002, full of anticipation of what the Camp Internet experience was going to be like.  Got out of the car (it was hot!) and found out where our rooms would be.  Next, we found the Camp Internet People and enjoyed some appetizers and relaxation in Brady Hall.  From then on I had the feeling that I was definitely at camp.  This place kind of reminds me of a camp my kids have gone to with a summer program and now I get my turn!  Camp food has been good, and so has the hike.  The computers are working great and we are learning how we can communicate with people from various places.

We are at Camp Internet at Verde Valley School near Sedona, Arizona.  The school is in a beautiful setting of red rocks and forest.  The school was started in 1949 as a place where students from many cultures could come to study the arts and the environment.  The architecture is Spanish adobe.  The buildings are white with natural beams, large windows to take in the beautiful views, and huge stone fireplaces.  The cook has provided us with delicious food.  For instance, last night we had fish tacos and salsa that was very hot!  Wonderful!

This morning at 5:00 am, six of us went on a hike to Red Rock State Park.  The views were spectacular.  The earth is a true terracotta color that stains your socks and shoelaces.  It will be a souvenir of an early morning adventure that took us to a creek, teeming with wildlife.  We even woke a sleeping deer in the clearing.  We are using our GPS systems to orient ourselves and find our way home.  Tonight another hike is planned-for the evening cool.

<IMG SRC ="http://www.campinternet.net/~camp02/sedona_photos/cd_deer1_crop.jpg">

Six of us met at 5 am at the courtyard.  It was still dark and the moon was still out.  We had to use our GPS to navigate our way to Red Rock State Park where Oak Creek Runs through.  On the way there, we found tracks of different animals (rabbits, deer, horses) and some bike trails and people tracks too.  We saw 2 beautiful homes built on the red rock and some hot air balloons far to the north.  When we arrived the bridge, we saw the deerís ears in the marsh and we woke it up!  We noticed that the deer was limping!  We also saw big fish swimming and a rabbit too.  There were a lot of different kinds of birds too.  We noticed while we were walking that we would hit warm pockets and cold pockets of air as we went up and down hills.  The only bad experience about the hike is that Jane slipped and skinned her shin enough to need to be cleaned and bandaged.  We used the GPS to find our way back.

The Lab

Our initial experience in this computer lab occurred near dusk.  The north side of the lab is mainly window so the sunset was incredible.  Inside the computer lab room was hanging a papoose cradle that was hanging upside down.  Now, Jane, being Navajo, immediately noticed this and strongly recommended that the cradle be hung in the correct position.  Now, the papoose cradle perfectly accents the varied artwork, the large, large stone hearth, and the entire southwest dÈcor of our computer lab (which is also the schoolís library).  A picture of this area is on todayís agenda.

NOTE for FRIDAY FIELD TRIP: An alternative field trip site - if you all feel you have seen enough of Red Rock, for tomorrow, is Montezuma's Castle National Monument about the same distance driving south. They know you may be coming, so decide what you want for Friday 9a-1pm. If you choose Montezuma, the likely time for a ranger tour is 11am according to their regional coord Sherie Wood (but tour is not guaranteed) and there is a good interpretive trail and actual ruins to see. Up to Carl and you all to decide!<BR CLEAR=left><P>

A Little History - The people who lived in Walnut Canyon were the Sinagua.  Sinagua is the Spanish word for ìwithout water.î  These people lived in the canyon more than 800 years ago.  They hunted for small game, gathered the native plants and farmed on the canyon rim.  What is amazing was their ability to farm without a ready source of water.  Instead, they had to carry water to their plants from a distance.  The Sinagua lived in the surrounding cliffs of weathered limestone.  The cliffs have natural recesses, which the Sinagua used for their dwellings.

Today, I went on a field trip to Walnut Canyon National Monument.  I had a wonderful time and learned so much about the Native Americans of the Southwest.  The tribe that once lived in this area is called the Sinagua.  We took a great hike to see the ruins of this once flourishing culture.  The terrain seems completely inhospitable.  The GPS coordinates for Walnut Canyon are N 35.17164  W111.50842.  The canyon is filled with limestone ledges and the drop to the canyon floor is over 500ft.  You begin the hike at the rim (altitude 7000 feet), loop around to view 25 pit dwellings, then climb 240 steps back up to the visitorÅfs center.  My field trip was enjoyable not only because of the spectacular scenery, but also because of the lightheartedness of our group.  We had a tremendous amount of fun and shared much from our experiences.  The chef of Verde Valley School prepared a fabulous picnic.  To commemorate our Camp Internet experience weÅfve taken lots of digital pictures.

The Sinagua Culture
The Sinagua Indians are also called the Western Anasazi.  They received their name from the Spaniards.  Sin Agua in Spanish means without water.  They lived in an area between Phoenix and Flagstaff Arizona about 700 years ago.  Several hundred people called Walnut Canyon their home for about 100 years.  They disappeared by 1400 A.D.  for reasons that are still unclear.

Dwelling
The Sinagua  lived in a dwelling called a cliff dwelling. It is believed that the women built these dwellings. They usually faced east and south to take advantage of the warmth of the sun.  The women used the shallow caves in the cliffs and built a wall to enclose the space.  This method took much less time than other dwellings because they only had to make one wall.  A special feature of this home is the small t-shaped doorway.  The narrow bottom allowed fresh air in while a hole over the doorway helped the smoke to escape.

Food

The Sinagua were used dry farming techniques to grow corn, beans and squash.  They planted mostly on the canyon rims. Their plants needed very little water-these specially adapted plants are called drought resistant.   Water was conserved by making small dams where water trickled down to the canyon.  Where the water gathered, they also found they could collect soil, which was as important as the water.  These people followed the seasons year after year.  In the winter, water was abundant.  This was a time to store as much water as possible.  From March to June, when little rain fell, the Sinagua were busy planting and gathering.  They needed the native plants of the region as much as their crops to survive. Hunting was difficult, but the Sinagua caught deer and other small animals.

History

The Sinagua lived for a short time in the area, only about 100 years.  The Hopi tell stories about their ancestors who joined them.  ItÅfs possible that the climate changed  and the Sinagua joined their neighbors, the Hopi, on the mesas.  Archeologists have used bits and pieces to tell the story of the Sinagua.  There are few examples of Sinagua pottery-but they most likely made useful containers from baked clay for water and corn.

	Wow!  It has been a wonderful experience for me to see some absolutely beautiful sights!  Today we went to Walnut Canyon, which is located East of Flafstaff, Arizona.  I have never been in a canyon with Indian dwellings and I was just amazed with how the Indians used to live at that time.  For instance, we saw what looked like a room; Carl told me it was used as storage for their corn crops.  It had black marks in it, which was from a fire that they would use to burn out all the bugs in order to, store their new crops for the season.

We also learned that a Yucca Plant had many uses for the Sinagua.  For instance, the fibers from the Yucca Plant were used to thread together for sandals, ropes, and other things that were needed.  The root of this plant is very dangerous and cannot be eaten, but it was used as soap!  The plant also has three parts that can be eaten.  New Mexico has many Yucca plants all around the state, but I never knew that it had so many uses!  I hope this is helpful for some of you that know what a Yucca plant looks like.  There were also a few other plants and trees that were essential to the Sinagua.  For instance, the prickly pear cactus has edible pads-spines removed-and sweet, juicy fruit.  Also, there are pinyon pines located in this canyon, which provide firewood, timber, black sap for dye and adhesives, and nutritious nuts.

Field Report-Friday June 28, 2002 ........ This day began with another beautiful sunrise.  We had a great breakfast, packed the lunches and water in the trunk of the car, and headed out for a short 35-mile drive to Walnut Creek Canyon, on the other side of Flagstaff, AZ...............
	We paid the fees that are required to go into the park and tour/hike and parked the car.  We began the hike by listening to the rangerís talking tour about the area, the Indians and the canyon below.  This would be the beginning mark, using the GIS that we all had with us.  This position mark would help us know the point of our start and help us to get back, should we become lost. ........ (N35.17230-W111.50787-Elevation 6,733 ft) ......... The Sinagua Indians were cliff dwellers and had lived in the canyon for many years, but down inside the walls of the canyon. They are descendants of the Hopi Indians.

The Sinagua lived in homes that were built into the cliffs of the canyon.  As I looked at this dwelling, it made me wonder, ì is their home any different than ours?  Are there similarities and differences that we can list and talk about?î As we continued down into the canyon, so many things just seem to pop out at us.  It is hard to see it all.

As I reach the patio of the visitorís center, I notice a garden has been planted.  It looks a little different from my own garden.  I wonder why?  Is there anything different about a garden you might have?

We left Verde Valley School at approximately 9:30 in the morning and drove just past Flagstaff off of I-40 where the Cliff Dwellings are.  What an amazing place!  These dwellings which are sheltered caves on the cliff face were the home to the Singagua people more than 800 years ago.  The name Singagua means in Spanish, ìwithout waterî and their name is a tribute to them as they were able to survive in a such dry region.  In our talk with the Ranger at the lookout before we made the desend down, we learned that these people would hike 8 miles out of the canyon to get water in their baskets several times a week.  Looking from the lookout and imagining where they had to go made me feel somewhat exhausted and extremely hot!

Looking down the canyon at the rock formations was amazing.  After the talk with the ranger, we began the trek down into the canyon to cliff dwelling homes.  It was quite a steep walk down 185 feet (240 stairs) We took our time, stopping for pictures, shade, and to identify plants.  We saw plenty of pricklypear cactus, yucca, and pinyon pine trees which all provided food for the ancient people who lived there.  We also saw a three sisters garden (beans, squash and corn) at the beginning of our decent down.

Next, we got down to where we could actually go into some of the dwellings.  We walked the loop around and took our time as we enjoyed going into the ones that we could.
These buttons will show you some of what we saw and did.  The Sinagua lived in these dwellings for more than 100 years but had to depart for reasons that we donít realy know. In 1915 Walnut Canyon became a National Monument.  I highly recommend if one is traveling on 1nterstate 40 to stop there and see these.  Being able to imagine this canyon alive with people living there is amazing.

Walnut Canyon °≠°≠.This canyon is an area that at one time housed the Sinaqua Indians.  While they not longer exist, their descendants are part of the Hopi tribe.  Several hundred people lived in about 100 homes in this Walnut Canyon village.  The cliff dwellings were their homes and storage areas.  Our group descended about 800 ft. into the canyon and walked around a loop that the forest service created. The trip down was an easy walk but going up was slower especially for those of us who are still getting our bodies in shape.

The Indians use all the area°Øs natural resources, such as yucca seeds, pinyon nuts, big horn sheep, deer, elk, and Arizona black walnut.  For example, the wax currant berries were used as food and as a medicine for stomach aches while the hardwood branches were shaved for arrowheads, digging tools and house tools.

The T- shaped entry to the cliff dweller°Øs homes were very fascinating to me.  As shown is the picture, the opening was small, minimizing heat/cold air loss.  A second function of the opening was to vent the home.  To eliminate smoke build-up created by the cooking fire, the entrance°Øs T-shape was upside down creating a lower intake valve for cool air entry.  At the top of the home, directly above the entry, a small, u-shaped hole was carved out of the 2-foot wall, creating an exit for the warm, Smokey air.  Thus, this engineering design is a forerunner to the modern ventilation system.

The ruins demonstrate that the Sinaqua Indians were inventive, industrious, and conservative environmentalists.  Unfortunately, because they were not an aggressive people, their properties were absorbed by another stronger, probably more violent tribe of people, the people scattered and incorporated into other tribes, and their culture eliminated. What does this tell us about life°Øs cycle and the human nature? What can we learn from this culture that increases our survival chances?  And finally, what can I do to inventively, industriously, and conservatively improve this culture?
