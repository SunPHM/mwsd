  <p><img border="0" src="../photos/Parkeinthecorner.jpg" width="322" height="334" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Although 
    the Feb 1 computer rankings show that Simon Parke has slipped from 3rd to 
    4th world ranking, to any rational observer Parke is clearly the world #3 
    and knocking on the door of greater heights. To achieve that in 2001, he will 
    need consistency and a touch more creativity in his game.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Simon Parke is quiet and introspective 
    off court, but approaches his battles on court fearlessly. He has been ambitiously 
    lurking just behind the top two, Power and Nicol, waiting for them to falter</font><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">. 
    Parke, who has been followed by the English fans since he was a junior, put 
    it all together last year in the 1999 SG Cowan US Open when he defeated Nicol 
    and Power on successive nights to win the most important event of his career. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Parke would say later,&quot;I felt that 
    I played my best squash ever in Boston. I've been studying it, trying to replicate 
    my performance there. He almost did that at the Equitable Life Superseries 
    Finals in London last June, just falling short after holding a lead late in 
    the fifth game against Peter Nicol.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The climax proved to be one of the 
        squash highlights of 2000 - an exhilarating 98-<img border="0" src="../images/profiles/smGRydingSParke19.jpg" width="327" height="287" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">minute 
        display of squash at its world best, witnessed by the British Minister 
        for Sport Kate Hoey and <a href="http://www.squashtalk.com/videos/superseries/index.htm">described 
        by Nicol as "one of the toughest matches I've played in years."</a> The 
        Scot ultimately survived 13-15 15-9 15-12 12-15 15-12, but both players 
        were given a five-minute standing ovation by the exuberant crowd as they 
        collected their trophies.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>PARKE'S PRECISION</b><br>
    Simon Parke's game is deceptively simple. His biggest strengths are his precision, 
    patience and endurance. At the SG Cowan, Parke came back 18 hours after playing 
    a 2-hour no-holes barred slugfest against Nicol to play another 1 1/2 hour 
    marathon against Power. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Parke's view: &quot;I'd like the opponent 
    to feel that no matter what he does, I'm not going to get tired out there. 
    It's a psychological advantage for me.&quot;<img
                border="0" src="../images/profiles/smParkeBW1.jpg" align="right" width="256" height="386" vspace="10" hspace="10"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>SIMON'S TRIALS</b><br>
    Simon Parke has experienced the very best that life can offer - and almost 
    certainly the worst. The highpoints of his glittering squash career include 
    winning the world junior title and five British Junior Open trophies; becoming 
    England No1 and the British National champion; leading England to two world 
    team championships titles; maintaining an unbroken nine-year presence in the 
    world top twenty; and recently beating the world's top two players en-route 
    to clinching the prestigious US Open title. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">His low point came in December 1995 when 
    he was diagnosed as suffering from testicular cancer. Brought up in Yorkshire 
    in the north of England, but now based in Nottingham in the east midlands, 
    Parke first turned professional in August 1988. He made his top 100 debut 
    in July 1989, breaking into the top 50 in January 1990. In May 91 he leapt 
    into the top 20 at 16 (from 37), but not until January 95 did he make his 
    top ten debut, coming in at 7. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Despite his withdrawal from the circuit 
    in early 96, he maintained this top ten status<img border="0" src="../photos/parkairborne.jpg" width="238" height="386" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
    before achieving his career-best No4 position in March 1997. 1996 was an extraordinary 
    year for the Oakham-born player - one which started with surgery for testicular 
    cancer on the 2nd January, then treatment which included chemotherapy, and 
    ended in December with his reinstatement as No1 in England and a triumphant 
    return to the world's top five. Parke's determination - coupled with his natural 
    talent & flair - meant that he was back on the practice court within weeks 
    of his surgery and made his comeback in May in the spectacular Al-Ahram International 
    event in Giza, Egypt, where he beat Irish star Derek Ryan to reach the quarter-finals.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> "I spent time with many others in the 
    hospital who were battling greater challenges than I was, and I realised how 
    lucky I was to have the chance to return to play top-level sports. I am looking 
    forward to taking a little longer now at every event to appreciate what part 
    of the world I am in and to enjoy the experience," said Parke at the time. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>PIVOTAL 2001 CAMPAIGN<br>
    </b>2001 will certainly be a pivotal year for Simon Parke. He has proved to 
    himself that he can best Nicol, Power and Barada. The question is, will he 
    reach those heights consistently enough to move into the top two?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Parke starts off the 2001 campaign in 
    New York with every opportunity to move upwards. </font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b></b></font></p>
