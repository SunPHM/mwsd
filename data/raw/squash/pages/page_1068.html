        last second debate about not keeping the guests waiting versus not
        letting a late arrival miss the start of the ceremony ensured that when
        Peter finally walked up the aisle he was pale enough for many guests to
        honestly believe he was about to pass out.&nbsp; However, when the
        processional which we had worked so hard to time properly ended at
        exactly the right moment, Peter was able to finally take a few deep
        breaths and worry only about marrying Brandon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fighting to
        hold back tears as the ceremony processed we were both very grateful we
        had chosen not to try to memorize our own vows!&nbsp; After all those

        every bit as profound for us as we had hoped it would be and far more
        emotional for many of our guests that we had ever imagined.&nbsp; As
        anxious as Peter may have been about the details of the wedding, there
        was never a moment of doubt about the purpose.&nbsp; The way Brandon
        reassuringly rubbed Peter's hands as he struggled to get </font>

        <font face="Arial" size="2"> walking back down the aisle, this time as a newly

        relief that everything had </font>
        <font face="Arial" size="2"> gone well and that he could start truly

        headed over to the&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> Half Way House inn.&nbsp; Since we had expected the
        family photography to take longer, we were planning to rejoin our guests
        only when we made an entrance at dinner.&nbsp; However, we decided to
        take advantage of being ahead of schedule by catching up with some of
        our friends and relatives before they headed in for cocktails.&nbsp; After everyone was
        seated, our MC Robbie started off the evening with a funny and heartfelt
        toast to the grooms (which included the first of many jokes that evening
        regarding Peter's
        tenacity for details).&nbsp; This was followed by a toast by each of the
        grooms to each other and to their families.&nbsp; We had decided to
        deliberately keep the toasts short and sweet (how are you ever going to
        sum up how you feel about your loved ones anyway?) which was lucky for
        Peter as he was as choked up with emotion then as he was exchanging his
        vows!&nbsp; This was followed by toasts
        from the best men and then dinner (a slight variation of our schedule
        which readers of our planning comments may have noticed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

        Peter had been able to enjoy the meal during the tasting part of the
        wedding preparations because he was still so pumped up with adrenaline from earlier jitters that he couldn't eat a
        thing!&nbsp; Everyone else, however, had no problem enjoying the
        delicious butternut squash soup, Boston bibb and grilled</font><a href="156M4A.jpg"><img border="0" src="156M4A_small.jpg" alt="156(M4A).jpg (118063 bytes)" align="right" width="297" height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a>
        <font face="Arial" size="2"> peppers,
        Chicken Supreme and chocolate caramel dream flan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Before dessert we were treated to the most enjoyable toast of the night
        from Peter's college friend Randy, an amateur comic if there ever was
        one.&nbsp; His theory of how Peter's homosexuality had helped make him a
        better straight man not only had everyone in stitches but was also a
        perfect bridge between the two groups of people attending the
        wedding.&nbsp; In order for our ceremony to be taken seriously we
        probably went so far in presenting it just like any other wedding that
        straight guests were likely unsure of how to address its uniqueness if
        at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when they witnessed a straight man standing
        up to not only acknowledge the participants' sexuality but to also make
        good-natured jokes about it, they surely realized that it was okay to do the same and
        to just be themselves.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
        <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">Soon
        after the toasts were done we made the rounds to say our goodbyes to
        guests who would not be coming to the after-party, realizing how much we had to say to all our friends and how little time we
        had to do it.&nbsp; We then climbed into our limo (a standard black
        stretch variety this time) and headed home to change for the final
        portion of the day.</font><a name="after-party"></a><b><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#666666">

        a quick pit stop to freshen up and change, we headed down to Joe's Elbow
        Room.&nbsp; With the formality of the day over, we could finally take
        time to talk to our friends and - at least for Peter - eat for the first
        time since breakfast.&nbsp; We were thrilled to see that so many of our
        family members came out as well as many other friends who we were not

        chance to really talk to our guests while Joe's (the best man, not the
        restaurant) compilations of our
        favourite songs were playing away in the background.&nbsp; Peter had
        some interesting conversations in particular.&nbsp; While our straight
        guests had been quick to express their feelings about the ceremony, many
        of his gay friends had continued to subtly tease him for his traditional
        desires as they had since he had announced the engagement.&nbsp;
        However, as the party progressed, the alcohol revealed that their good natured
        cynicism was actually masking far more profound feelings.&nbsp; More
        than one of them confessed that they had been deeply moved by the
        ceremony with one person going so far as to say that the wedding had
        become a template for his own relationship goals.&nbsp;&nbsp; It gave us tremendous satisfaction to hear that we have been able to inspire
        others particularly in a gay community like Toronto's that seems to
        reward materialism and superficiality and reject good men who strive for
        something more substantial.</font>

        THE DAY AFTER</font></b></p>
        <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%"><font face="Arial" size="2">When
        you are engaged, the wedding becomes the focal point of your
        life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day for months or years it looms on the horizon
        whether you are actively preparing for it or not.&nbsp; And the closer
        you get to it, the more society shares your excitement which only boosts
        the event's prominence in your life.&nbsp; Then, abruptly, it's all
        over.&nbsp; Your days that were filled with appointments and planning
        are suddenly wide open.&nbsp; That instant rapport you established with
        other fiancés at parties quickly withers.&nbsp; People react far less
        enthusiastically to a recent marriage than to an impending one.&nbsp; We
        knew this and planned for the emotional come-down by committing to a
        honeymoon immediately after the wedding, even if it were no more than a
        couple days in Montreal.&nbsp; What we didn't plan on was the gap
        between the wedding night and the departure of our flight late the next
        afternoon.&nbsp; Luckily for us Peter's parents had to come in to town
        to return something to his sister so they all joined us for
        brunch.&nbsp; It was a great time to talk about the previous day's
        success and to thank them again for all their help.&nbsp; Without their
        company it probably would have made for a depressing morning on that
        rainy day!</font></p>
