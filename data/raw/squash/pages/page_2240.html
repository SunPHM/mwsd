	continental U.S., though we frequently take it for granted. We have the 
	luxury of a climate that changes dramatically season to season. It is like a 
	sampling of the different environments provided on Earth. And yet, even the 
	best of us can falter, and have wishes of living in a place where it's 72.5 
	degrees Fahrenheit year round, a place where 'freeze' is something the 
	refrigerator or computer screen does. After all, in a climate like that, 
	your gardens would look good all year long. You would have something 
	interesting to view outside your kitchen window, even in January. You would 
	not have to live in this barren winter wasteland that is your landscape now. 
	Here in the temperate zone, nothing can look good in your gardens this time 
	of year, right?</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1"><br>

	don't have to call your realtor just yet. Thankfully, you don't have to move 
	so you can have an interesting landscape throughout the year. Many plants 
	that look their best, even during the most dreary parts of the freezing 
	winters here, can be found at many gardening centers. Whether you are 
	looking for greenery, winter blooms, architectural lines, or fragrance in 
	your garden, there is a plant out there that offers it's best show during 
	the worst of the cold weather. All you have to do is look.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1"><br>

      </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">To make your landscape put on a 
	show no matter what the season, take a page out of a financial advisor's 
	ledger and diversify, diversify, diversify. A sweeping vista of azaleas will 
	look amazingly colorful in spring, but what about the rest of the year? The 
	colorful vista would fade painfully into the background during the other 
	eleven months, leaving nothing to tantalize your eyes for three long 
	seasons. However, if you take out a few of those short-flowering azaleas and 
	replace them with a mix of shrubs that are at their peak at different times 
	of the year, your vision will be treated to a spectacle no matter what month 
	you look.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1"><br>

	select from. Granted, the farther south you live, the more choice you will 
	have, but unless you call the tundra home, there is a plant for you.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1"><br>

      <font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">One of the easiest plant finds for your 
	winter garden are evergreen plants, or plants that retain their leaves</font><font color="#800080"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3"> 
	throughout the year. Some readily-available plants of this type are hollies 
	(Ilex spp.), junipers and other coniferous shrubs, evergreen azaleas, and 
	cherry laurel (Prunus laurcerasus varieties). These plants offer a solid 
	mass of green all year round. However, to get the most out of your winter 
	landscape, green mounds are not enough. By using evergreens as a background 
	to set off other, more colorful plants, you will be able to make your 
	gardens as eye-catching as any other time of the year.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1"><br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Adding a plant that provides 
	blooms or berries in winter is a great way to add beauty to your landscape. 
	The hard part is finding such a plant. Though the majority of available 
	shrubs and flowers do bloom during the more favorably-conditioned warmer 
	months of the year, there are those plants that put on their show during the 
	stark winter.</font>

      <font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Another lesser-used method to add 
	interest to the winterscape is by using the architectural characteristics of 
	a plant in it's winter state. There are many trees and shrubs that, though 
	they have lost their leaves for the winter, can retain a very artistic look 
	to them throughout the colder months. For example, let's say you have a 
	nicely-branched Japanese maple in your garden. During spring, summer, and 
	fall, it fills your landscape with colors of green, orange, and red. But 
	what about in winter, when there are no leaves at all? If presented 
	correctly, the branching habit of this small tree can be absolutely 
	breathtaking.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1">&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">First off, observe the 
	background behind the tree. Is it one solid color, like an evergreen hedge 
	or stuccoed wall? Having a background that is not visually chaotic or busy 
	will show off the tree's structure more aptly. Secondly, is there any sort 
	of light accenting the tree during the evening hours? Since there are less 
	daytime hours in winter, providing a nighttime lighting source will make the 
	tree an accent in your landscape day and night. Try experimenting with 
	different lighting techniques, like uplighting or backlighting. Lastly, 
	don't forget about location, location, location. No matter what month of the 
	year it is, if your accent plant is not placed in a noticeable spot in your 
	garden, it is not an accent plant; it is a plant that attracts attention to 
	a less desirable area of your landscape. Make sure your prized bit of flora 
	is residing in the location that is best suited to it, both culturally and 
	visually.</font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="1">&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      </font><font face="Arial Narrow" size="3">Once you've got your accent 
	shrubs properly highlighted and your plant selections properly sorted out, 
	you will have a landscape that will form a fantastic composition no matter 
	the season. A diversified landscape that always has a bit of something at 
	it's peak at any given time can be more vivid than a landscape where all the 
	plants are at their most intense all at once. So don't despair during the 
	winter months with daydreams of tropical horizons. Embrace your temperate 
	zone privilege and create an all-year landscape.</font>

		</font>1. Stale coffee and coffee grounds make great organic fertilizer. They 
		provide many trace minerals and low, gentle levels of nitrogen, 
		potassium and phosphorous.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>2. Remember that a good soaking of water less often is better 
		than a light sprinkling every day ~ for veggies and for your lawn.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>3. If your neighbor has a plant you particularly like, ask for a 
		cutting, instead of going to the nursery and buying one. Maybe you could 
		trade a cutting from one of your own plants.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>4. To easily water a tomato plant, bury a bottomless coffee can next to 
		the plant and pour the water into the can. This allows the water to go 
		straight to the roots.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>5. Plant marigolds in your vegetable garden. They will attract insects 
		that eat aphids and other pests.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>6. My husband bought some used carpet at a garage sale, cut it 
		into wide strips and laid it down between the rows in our garden. Now we 
		can pick peas with getting our shoes muddy.<font size="1"> <br>
		<br>
		</font>7. Use grass clippings as mulch around your vegetable plants to keep 
		moisture in and weeds out. Just don't use the clippings right after you 
		have fertilized your grass or treated for weed control.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>8. If you have access to them, pine needles make excellent mulch.<font size="1"> <br>
		<br>
		</font>9. A natural, frugal garden pest spray:&nbsp;
		mix 1 tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap and 1 cup of cooking oil. 
		Use 3 tablespoons of this mixture to
		1 quart of water and spray on plants.<font size="1"><br>
		<br>
		</font>10. In the herb garden, to keep plants like mint from taking over too 
		big an area, put it in a clay pot and simply plant the whole pot!</font></td>
