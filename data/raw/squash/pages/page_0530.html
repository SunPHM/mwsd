            <P><b>Mell&aacute;r of KSH: Playing catchup on Information Highway</b>
            <P> Dr. Tam&aacute;s Mell&aacute;r, President of the KSH (Hungarian Central Statistical Office) (<a href="http://www.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs">www.ksh.hu/pls/ksh/docs</a>) was guest speaker at this month's luncheon hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce. <br>
              Mell&aacute;r summarized Hungary's economic trends and figures for 2001, and gave his outlook for 2002. Last year saw a slowing down of the monthly GDP growth rate to 3.8% at year-end from 4.4% in January 2001.
            <P>
              <img src="../media/articles/Mellar77.jpg" width="144" height="180" align="right">AmCham members questioned the wisdom of Hungary following a system different from those of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations, for measuring budget deficits. It would, they argued, be a much larger figure than that quoted by the Government. "It is an open-ended question," admitted Mell&aacute;r, "and we hope in the future we can solve this discrepancy."<br>
              Mell&aacute;r also spelled out the future plans of the Statistical Office. Regional offices will be reduced to seven, he said, and in April "we will open our data warehouse to the public, and try to catch-up on the information highway", he concluded.

The building was designed by Ms. Marina Annus and Mr. Ferenc Annus, architects at Iparterv Kft. The-newly constructed Nagykov&aacute;csi campus is a state-of-the-art middle and high-school facility which was completed in 14 months, opening its doors to students in 1999. One of the prerequisites for the Niveau Award is that the building be operational for at least 1 year.

              <img src="../media/articles/Bokros01.jpg" width="180" height="201" align="left">The Hungarian economy is performing very well, especially when compared to neighboring countries, said Lajos Bokros, guest speaker at AmCham's Business Breakfast on March 18. Hungarian Minister of Finance during the former government, Bokros is currently one of the directors at the World Bank. Bokros praised the rate of economic growth and the sharp decrease of inflation and unemployment as the most significant accomplishments of the Hungarian economy during the last 4-5 years. His criticism was directed at the budget deficit, which - according to EU and OECD-compliant calculations - stands at 6.5% - 7%. "Although GDP growth was more than satisfactory, the government should keep a closer eye on expenses because the budget deficit is too high," said Bokros. <br>
              Instead of launching various programs to aid small and medium-sized enterprises, the Government should concentrate on lowering the taxes levied on these businesses, according to Bokros. The speaker also emphasized that the privatization process should be completed, which Bokros said has not yet come to an end.

               On March 20 the American Chamber of Commerce hosted a breakfast at the Kempinski hotel, with guest speaker Dr. James B. Irwin Sr., Founder and Chairman of the IMPAC Corp. (<a href="http://www.impac-systems.com">www.impac-systems.com</a>), a worldwide productivity engineering firm. IMPAC works on over 600 projects annually for clients' corporations and institutions in more than 60 countries. 
            <P>
              <img src="../media/articles/Irwin16.jpg" width="128" height="180" align="right">The theme of the lecture was "Saving the world is not your duty in the 21st century, saving your corporation is!" - a surprising theme for a man honored by the U.S. National Task Force for Children, the American Cancer Society, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and many other charitable organizations around the globe.<br>
              "We are all struggling with the definition of corporate responsibility," said Irwin, "and we have to keep in mind that the primary goal of a corporation is to make lawful profits."<br>
              Irwin reminded the audience that "Social policies are the responsibility of governments, not the board of directors." Irwin concluded that corporations should be aware that while this responsibility does not rest on their shoulders, they have the potential to bring heavy influence to bear on economic changes and thus social changes.

            <P><img src="../media/articles/Muegy_konf0123.jpg" width="180" height="118" align="left">AmCham's Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Committee organized a workshop on Venture Capital Financing on March 12. Sponsored by the Hungarian Innovative Technology Fund (HITF), the seminar offered a unique opportunity to both member and non-member companies to learn more about the venture capital financing process from a variety of perspectives. <br>
              Vikt&oacute;ria Zombory, President of the Hungarian Venture Capital Association, gave an overview of the current state of venture capital financing in Hungary. According to Ms. Zombory, venture capitalists have in the last 10 years invested more than USD 1 billion in 500 companies in Hungary. HITF's Ferenc Bersz&aacute;n presented the different stages in the venture capital process itself, including the seed financing stage in which the HITF is an active investor. 
            <P>
              The workshop identified the major characteristics of successful high-growth companies, a key focus of a recent Deloitte  &amp; Touche study presented by P&eacute;ter Szabadhegy. Philippe Cros of Adexis Hungary expanded on the critical importance of management to the success of a venture capital investment. &Aacute;kos Resszler of ScanSoft Recognita shared his first-hand experiences of venture capital from a corporate perspective.<br>
              This workshop was the first in a series that will focus on issues impacting the sector, including SME development, supplying to a multinationals and outsourcing.

This year organizers and company representatives were delighted when 1100 students - nearly twice as many as last year - came to the fair in search of internship and employment opportunities. The Internship Fair has become a traditional AmCham event, attended not only by graduating university students, but also by students and young professionals.  With Hungarian and international students attending from over thirty educational institutions throughout Hungary, it is clear that there are a tremendous number of qualified potential employees and interns available.  The fair attracted students from all fields of academic study, including among others economics, technical fields, business and social sciences.

            <P><b>U.S. CHAMBER'S CHIEF ECONOMIST OPTIMISTIC</b>
            <P><img src="../media/articles/US_Chamber_of_Commerce01.jpg" width="180" height="118" align="right" alt="U.S. Chamber of Commerce Building, Washington DC ">Martin Regalia, the U.S. Chamber's chief economist, feels good about the U.S. economy. "Things are changing fairly rapidly for the better," Regalia told the European Council of American Chambers of Commerce at their March meeting in Washington. "The recession-that-never-really-was is over." "The economy spent the last months weathering a two-edged attack- reductions in both inventories and investment- which was, of course, complicated by September 11," Regalia continued. "It has snapped back. In the fourth quarter of 2001 we actually had growth, and our estimate of 2.4% growth for the first quarter of 2002 looks like it needs to be revised upwards."
            <P>
              The reasons for the quick bounce back are numerous, but Regalia pointed out two events of major significance. First, he cited the monetary stimulus package introduced by the Bush administration and, second, he highlighted the low price of oil. The large increase in government expenditure after September 11, Regalia noted, offset the reflexive drop in personal consumption.<br>
              He also explained that the ongoing turmoil in the stock market did not have a widespread impact on the country. "Most holders of stock are higher income families- almost 90% of stock is held by these families- and they made no noticeable change in their consumption habits," Regalia explained.
            <P>
              The US Chamber is currently forecasting GDP growth of slightly more than 3% in 2002, with a high of 3.9% in the third quarter. The growth is driven by personal consumption, which accounts for "two-thirds of the economy," said Regalia. "If it grows, we grow."There was a 6% spike in personal consumption in the fourth quarter of 2001, the highest increase since the second quarter of 1998. It was fueled in large part by the Bush tax rebate. "That clearly is not sustainable," Regalia said. "The question is how much it will retract, and the indication is that it will not retract as much as initially expected."

              Instead of the 1.7% prediction of personal consumption growth in the first quarter of 2002, Regalia said the growth will more likely be somewhere in the 2.5-3% range. "That is miles away from 1.7%" said Regalia. "We now run the risk of growing too much."
              Behind the growth in personal consumption lies growth in real disposable personal income, which benefited from the Bush tax rebate. Having more money, Regalia said, more than offset having less confidence. "You have to look at what people do, not what they say," he advised the audience. "Housing and car sales went to record numbers, and now we are reaching the beginning of a new cycle in equipment and software."

              American companies are also in good shape when it comes to inventories. "The ratio of business inventory-to-sales in plummeting," Regalia emphasized. He believes the radical reduction of inventories that took place progressively throughout 2001 has reached its inflection point. By mid-2002, Regalia predicts, companies will be building inventory again. 
              He continued to be sanguine about the trade deficit, despite his prediction of it growing larger in the near future. "The trade deficit may boost growth abroad," Regalia said. "Those economies may carry us through a slowdown in 2003."

              The trade deficit, he told the 20 Chambers present in the U.S. Chamber's headquarters, can be attributed to the strong U.S. dollar. There is not much to do about the dollar, he added. "The dollar gets its strength from the weakness of other currencies," Regalia explained. "Since 1997, we have had rolling crises around the world. This created a flight toward a stable currency, and the most stable currency has been the dollar."

              <img src="../media/articles/Donohue_Tom021.jpg" width="180" height="157" align="left">U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donohue hailed the U.S. House and Senate passage of an economic stimulus package as instrumental to boosting the U.S. economy.  The bill passed the full House by an overwhelming 417-3 vote on March 7.  The bill passed the Senate by a tremendous 85 to 9 vote on March 8.  The stimulus plan, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, provides for a reduction of taxes on businesses, such as the acceleration of depreciation and increased expensing.  The bill also extends vital programs that include Welfare-to-Work, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, and the Archer Medical Savings Accounts for two years and extends exceptions for active financing income under subpart F for five years.

              <b>PRESIDENT BUSH IMPOSES SAFEGUARDS ON STEEL IMPORTS</b>
            <P>
              <img src="../media/articles/Bush_portrait02.jpg" width="180" height="228" align="right">President Bush imposed a mix of temporary tariffs and quotas on steel imports to give the U.S. steel industry time to restructure.  In a statement released by the White House on March 5, one day before the deadline imposed on the president by Section 201 of U.S. trade law, Bush said that relief will help the industry adjust without harming the U.S. economy.  The President said that a surge in imports resulted in bankruptcies, serious dislocations, and job loss.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick championed Bush's decision by stating that imposition of import duties on foreign steel offers temporary protection to the U.S. steel industry and can be adjusted if conditions change.
