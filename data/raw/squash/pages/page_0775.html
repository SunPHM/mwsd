         Feature: Summer Squash</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>It's not just about zucchini, although we are growing some
        fine zucchini varieties (also known as courgettes in France,
        marrows in England, or cocozelle in Italy-the word &quot;zucchini&quot;
        is derived from the Italian word meaning sweet).</P>
        <P>The squash family is divided into four species but all the
        summer squashes are grouped into the same one, Cucurbita pepo.
        This group also includes pumpkins, and some winter squashes,
        like the ever-popular &quot;Acorn&quot; and &quot;Delicata&quot;,
        and pumpkins. Flavor-wise, summer squashes have little in common
        with the winter varieties, even nutritionally they're different.
        Summer squash is a diet food, being low in sodium and calories,
        and high in vitamins C and A, potassium, and niacin.</P>
        <P><B>Meet our Squashes:<BR>
        Peter Pan: </B>This variety is a pale green-skinned &quot;pattypan&quot;,
        or &quot;cymling&quot; with white flesh. Best when no bigger
        than a muffin.<BR>
        <B>Costata Romanesco:</B> A ribbed heirloom Italian zucchini
        that is striped dark green and white. I think these taste best
        at about 6&quot; long-not as babies, like others. <BR>
        <B>Gold Rush: </B>A hybrid yellow zucchini with beautiful color
        and creamy white flesh<BR>
        <B>Magda: </B>A hybrid middle-Eastern zucchini that is pale green
        flecked with white<BR>
        <B>Ronde de Nice: </B>A French heirloom zucchini that is green
        flecked with white and round like a ball-best before they're
        tennis ball-sized. <BR>
        <B>Sunburst: </B>a cheery, tasty hybrid gold-skinned pattypan
        with white flesh.<BR>
        <B>Yellow Crookneck: </B>A pale yellow, sometimes warty, heirloom
        that has a bulb shape at one end, and a gracefully-curved neck.
        These have a nuttier flavor than the others, like popcorn.</P>
        <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
        <B>HOW TO CHOOSE </B>- The stem end of a squash will tell you
        how fresh it is. Ideally, there should be a little juice coming
        out of the stem, indicating that it was recently harvested. Steer
        away from limp or very scratched squashes. The skins should be
        tight, shiny, and brightly colored and will scratch easily with
        a fingernail if fresh.<BR>
<BR>
        <B>HOW TO KEEP </B>- Keep squashes in a plastic bag in the warmest
        part of the refrigerator. If buying baby squashes with blossoms
        attached, refrigerate them in a plastic bag but leave it open
        so they can get air.<BR>
<BR>
        <B>HOW TO EAT </B>- Non-organic squashes should be rinsed and
        dried with a towel before using. Otherwise, rub any dust off
        with a damp towel. Don't wash the squashes in a lot of water
        because they will absorb it and become mushy. Trim the stem and
        flower end with a knife before proceeding with your recipe. The
        simplest way to cook summer squash is to cut them into evenly
        sized pieces, then steam just until tender&shy;a few minutes.
        If the squashes are quite small, you can leave them whole. I
        like to saut&eacute; them in fairly hot olive oil until the sugars
        caramelize and brown. Try eating little zucchinis like this with
        eggs for breakfast.</P>

        <H2><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660033">Get in the Fruit Loop: Organic
        Apricots</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>We'll be driving to Wenatchee next week for delicious organic
        Tilton Apricots-I can't wait. Tiltons are a small variety, but
        all the flavor of a big apricot is concentrated in every one
        of these little fruits. They truly are the best variety, but
        no one plants the trees anymore because the fruits are too small
        for commercial markets. Tiltons are also the best variety for
        canning or freezing because they have firmer flesh than newer
        varieties. Order soon to be sure we bring enough home. $2.50
        per pound, or $45.00 for a 20-pound box.</P>
        <P>Terry's Berries should blueberries for us in the next week
        or two as well. We'll check in with her closer to the weekend.</P>
        <H2><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660033"><HR>Fresh Basil</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>The basil has been given lots of water and is producing well
        now. Mike is happy to finally be harvesting big leaves. We'll
        be giving subscribers basil bunches in your boxes, but you won't
        be getting enough to make a big batch of pesto. We will be selling
        basil by the pound in a few more weeks, though. You can buy it
        at the farm stand, or at our market locations.</P>
        <H2><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660033"><HR>Fresh Organic Fryers</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>Our next batch of eating chickens will be arriving on the
        27th of July-about 60 percent of the 110 birds are sold already,
        so be sure and let us know if you are interested in any. They
        will be butchered in late September, so you have plenty of time
        to get ready for them.</P>
        <P>Those who bought our first batch have already told us how
        good these birds tasted-fresh flavored and juicy, and large-they
        averaged 5 pounds dressed!</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">I've been chatting with farmers around
      the country about the weather-what a strange year! It's been
      raining so much in the northeast, they haven't been able to grow
      much of anything. They can't plant, then it's too cold and wet
      for most things to grow.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">The southeast is doing well, but it's
      cooler than normal. And up here, it's been too much like California
      to grow all the things we were hoping for. The only rain we got
      last week was a sprinkle that settled the dusty driveways. So
      we just keep moving our sprinklers.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Unfortunately dry heat hits the greens
      the hardest. Even though we did put them at the top of the water-priority
      list, we've lost our salad mix and mustard greens, and the kale
      and swiss chard just aren't making very many new leaves. We've
      planted new patches of all the greens, and the lettuce and salad
      mix are in a spot where they can be watered more frequently,
      but we probably won't be harvesting salad for at least three
      weeks.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Luckily the squashes are all planted
      in what has turned out to be the wettest part of the farm, because
      the plants are lush and green-and huge! And they're pumping out
      little squashes faster than we can keep up with picking! Try
      grilling or saut&eacute;eing them and tossing them in a pasta
      salad with basil. The green beans are producing already, and
      we should have lots next week for the second picking. The first
      time we harvest beans (and peas) we don't find much, just one
      pod here and there. But the plants are just loaded with tiny
      pods full of promise! The artichokes are producing buds already-it's
      only July! We've never had artichokes before September before.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">All the early potato plants are dying
      back already from the dry heat, but they have produced well so
      far. So try a potato salad in place of leafy salad.</FONT></P>
