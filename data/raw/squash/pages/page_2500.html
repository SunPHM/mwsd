Mike Miller and Del. Tony O&#146;Donnell, show off big money.</b></i></font>									<p><i>Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.<br>									</i><tt>&#151;Ralph Waldo Emerson<br>									</tt></p>									<p>The scene in Calvert County&#146;s Appeal Elementary auditorium would have tickled that philosopher of America&#146;s 19th century. Enthusiasm was so strong your cheeks hurt from smiling.<br>									</p>									<p>Enthusiasm has gotten the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America through 140 years of serving the young people of our communities. Now 50-some boys and girls squirmed with enthusiasm to get a look at the guests on hand to present the club a check for $105,000.<br>									</p>									<p>With that money, the club will build a new home to replace its cramped quarters in the elementary school. While the southern branch builds on land just west of the school donated by the Calvert County Board of Education, the North Beach branch will begin a new building planned for the Fourth Street Park.<br>									</p>									<p>The northern club now meets once a week at the town community center. With their own home, they, too, will have daily hours.<br>									</p>									<p>Man of the hour Congressman Steny Hoyer sat among the children, while other Democrats sat side by side with Republicans, both putting aside differences for the cause. Countians from the north and south put aside their competition for scarce school dollars to celebrate in harmony.<br>									</p>									<p>&#147;Where Boys &amp; Girls Club is concerned, we are one community with an interest to provide a positive place for our youth,&#148; said Chris Giggy, head of the Calvert County organization. The club&#146;s after-school program gives children from six to 18 a place to hang-out, do projects, play sports, work on their homework, learn chess or talk with mentors and volunteers about their day,&#148; Giggy said.<br>									</p>									<p>The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Calvert County began in the fall of &#146;99. Already they have enrolled 379 children. Thirty-seven adult members sit on the countywide board.<br>									</p>									<p>Many of the VIPs who spoke were there not only on behalf of the state but also as alumni of Boys &amp; Girls Club.<br>									</p>									<p>Sen. Thomas V. Mike Miller, president of the Maryland Senate, recalled his eight years in the Eastern Branch of the Boys &amp; Girls Club in Washington, D.C. &#147;Some of my best times were spent there,&#148; Miller said smiling at the many youngsters wearing T-shirts that proclaimed &#145;The Positive Place for Kids.&#146;<br>									</p>									<p>Hoyer recounted memories at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Cocoa Beach, Florida. &#147;I was 11 years old and would ride my bike three or four times a week to the club. When my family moved to Maryland, I joined the club in District Heights and played football for them,&#148; the congressman said.<br>									</p>									<p>The children&#146;s eyes widened, for suddenly the tall, distinguished VIP had become one of them.<br>									</p>									<p>&#147;I was surprised that someone like Mr. Hoyer was like me once, and that he was in the same club I am in,&#148; said nine-year-old Michael Owens. &#147;Maybe I&#146;ll grow up to be a congressman one day.&#148;<br>									</p>									<p>The $105,000 check comes from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, written on the account of the U.S. Department of Justice. This year, Congress appropriated $50 million for the 2,700 Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across the country.<br>									</p>									<p>&#147;This money will help fund our new locations,&#148; Giggy said. &#147;Seventy-five thousand dollars will be spent in North Beach, $25,000 will stay down here in the southern end, and the remaining $5,000 will help with board development and training.&#148;<br>									</p>									<p>A United Way Agency, the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Calvert County employs two full- and five part-time staff. &#147;We&#146;re always looking for volunteers,&#148; Giggy hinted.<br>									</p>									<p>After the check was signed, young and old mingled over cake and punch. Retired state Sen. Bernie Fowler chatted with several children. Del. Tony O&#146;Donnell shared a chuckle with others, while Congressman Hoyer fielded questions.<br>									</p>									<p>Enthusiasm was plentiful as VIPs, past, present and future proved you can have your cake at Boy&#146;s &amp; Girls Club &#151; and eat it too.<br>									</p>									<div align="right">										<p><i>&#151;Lori L.

There, in the long spread of a pair of open-sided barns fragrant with the honey smell of white alyssum, Anne Arundel County farmers lay out a banquet of all the season has to offer.<br>									</p>									<p>This time of year, Nature is serving up her early bounty: lettuces and asparagus fresh-harvested only hours earlier. Tender lettuces remind you what it means to be in our salad days. Take home heads for your bowl &#151; as County Executive Janet Owens was doing when we bumped into her &#151; or fast-growing plants for your garden.<br>									</p>									<p>Toss your salad with your choice of many herbal vinegars brought to market along with home-made jellies and jams.<br>									</p>									<p>Just jumped-up asparagus bought here and cooked the same day will ruin your taste for any other. Fortunately, it&#146;s as common as weeds this time of year, so you can eat your fill before saying good-bye to the real thing for another year.<br>									</p>									<p>The veggies you buy at the supermarket travel an average of 1,500 miles, Maryland Department of Agriculture farm market planter Tony Evans reminds us. You&#146;ll be the third or fourth owner of the veggies you buy there.<br>									</p>									<p>Even in May, you can find tomatoes, squash, peppers and all of summer&#146;s bounty at your farmers&#146; market. Except for such hot-house-grown rarities as farmer Gordon Wirth&#146;s cukes &#151; you can&#146;t have those goodies and eat them<img height="200" width="166" src="images8_20/farmersmarketgirls.jpg" border="2" align="left"> too. Take home your choice of county-started veggies to flourish in your garden. Herbs, on the other hand, can go in the garden and in the salad bowl &#151; so long as you don&#146;t snip too much. You&#146;ll find thriving herb plants here in early abundance.<br>									</p>									<p>Of flowers, you can have all you want, both in the pot and on the stem. Peonies and early roses, both newly burst forth, appeared last Saturday &#151; just in time to make many mothers&#146; day.<br>									</p>									<p>Of course you won&#146;t be the only shopper loading up on spring bounty.<br>									</p>									<p>&#147;I brought 150 three-to-four-foot iris stems, armloads of peonies, asparagus and tons of herb plants. I couldn&#146;t even unload them from my truck before they were snapped up,&#148; said farmer Jeanne Grimes, the new owner of Two Hollies organic farm in Shady Side.<br>									</p>									<p>Early birds will find the market, at the intersection of Riva Road and Truman Parkway, open at 7am. By noontime closing, pickings are slim. The Severna Park Market runs the same hours. Markets in Crofton (Sat. 8-11am) and Piney Orchard (Wed 2-6pm) open in June.<br>									</p>									<p>Next year, if early plans flourish, the county&#146;s fifth market will open in Deale. A meeting with Evans last week drew organic, veggie, herb and flower farmers, plus a fiber and yarn producer.

Former teachers have donated local memorabilia along with photos and journals. Included, too, are textbooks that were handed down, out-dated, from white schools, before federal integration of public schools in the 1960s.<br>									</p>									<p>The exhibit will tour the area over the next couple of years, but you can be one of the first to view it during the Family Days.<br>									</p>									<p>As well as history, the day will be filled with music, food, children&#146;s activities, families and friends, all in a beautiful, tranquil spot.<br>									</p>									<p>Included in the fun will be a visit from national recording artists The Orioles. &#147;We are so excited to have them come and perform for us,&#148; Reid says. &#147;Their hits &#145;It&#146;s Too Soon to Know&#146; and &#145;You Saw Me Crying at the Chapel&#146; have put them into the R&amp;B Hall of Fame.&#148;<br>									</p>									<p>&#147;Everyone&#146;s taste buds will be tickled,&#148; says Reid. &#147;We&#146;ll have grills going, pots simmering and, of course, refreshing items to keep everyone cool.&#148;<br>									</p>									<p>Family Day continues from 11am to 5pm at Jefferson Patterson Park, on Mackall Road in Calvert County: 410/586-8501.<br>									</p>									<div align="right">										<p><i>&#151;Lori Sikorski</i></p>									</div>									<p>									<hr>									</p>									<p><font size="6">For Calvert Literacy, Spelling BEEs Attack<br>									</font></p>									<p><font color="#696969"><i><b>Bee winners spellcheck.calm: Vic Conellier, Linda Fadeley, Malane Silver and Joe Rooney.</b></i></font></p>									<p><font size="6"><img height="150" width="250" src="images8_20/beewinners.jpg" border="2" align="left">W</font>hat are the hardest words to misspell?<br>									</p>									<p>Ferociously and acrocyanosis.<br>									</p>									<p>For those are the words that stung the first and final teams in Calvert Literacy Council&#146;s Third Annual</p>									<p>BEE for Literacy.<br>									To sting, be stung and look smugly on, 150 spelling bees and would-bes swarmed the American Legion Hall in Chesapeake Beach last week.
