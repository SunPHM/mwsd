Highs in the 70's F and lows in the 50's F were a nice change from the heat.  Joe Boggs reported that Cincinnati had a record low night temperature of 47F last Thursday.  The record was 51F.  <br><br>Precipitation, on the other hand, has been scarce.  All BYGLers said that "it is dry."  Cincinnati has had 1.5" of rain in June, which is 1.16" below normal.  Lawrence County has had 0.42" for the month and is 2.7" below normal.  In Springfield, Pam Bennett reported 1" below normal for the month and 7.63" below normal for the year.  Jack Kerrigan reported that Cleveland area is 1.5" behind for the month and 2" below normal for the year.  And finally, Randy Zondag, affectionately known as "the Randall of Arabia," said that Painesville area is 6" below normal for the year.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT THE DROUGHT?</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90>&nbsp;</TD><TD>Although we gripe and complain about dry conditions, there is something good that comes from a drought.  Dry, arid conditions result in fewer diseases to infect plants.  Bright, sunny days create excess photosynthates to increase plant growth, sugars and help ripen fruits.  Clear, cloudless, and sunny days with warm temperatures mean that some great fruits and vegetables are on their way if they are irrigated properly.  The sunny, hot, and dry conditions have made California one of the best produce growing states!  But under these "fabulous" growing conditions, irrigation is critical and makes the difference between success or failure. <br><br>Following good irrigation practices will increase the success of vegetable gardens, fruit trees, and flower beds.  The best time to water is from dawn through the early morning hours, until about 10 A.M.  This allows time for the foliage to dry.  Extended periods of wet leaves create ideal conditions for infections by many fungal pathogens.  Intense sunshine may also damage leaves when water droplets act as a magnifying glass to overheat leaf tissue.  The least desirable time to water is at night when the moisture will remain on the leaf all night.  Apply 1" to 1.5" of water with each irrigation every 5 to 7 days.  This will help keep the roots down deep in the soil rather than up near the surface.  To check the amount of water applied, place an empty can in the sprinkler or spray pattern.  When 1" of water is collected in the can, 1" of water has been applied to the area.  Mulch can also help decrease water loss from the soil around the plant.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>MANAGING TURFGRASSES UNDER DROUGHT CONDITIONS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/4000/4020.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD>Lawns across the state are of pretty poor quality at this time.  Bill Pound noted receiving calls regarding brown patches in lawns.  He said that different types of turfgrasses responded to drought stress differently, i.e. fine fescue is less drought tolerant than tall fescue. <br><br>John Street emphasized the following good management practices for turfgrasses under drought conditions: Increase the mowing height to 2.5" to 3".  Do not mow during the heat of the day.  Keep mower blades sharp.  Do not fertilize stressed grass and if it is a must, water in thoroughly.  Do not apply herbicides if lawns are stressed; there is greater potential for turf damage and herbicide efficacy will decrease.  If irrigation is a must, prioritize the area of lawn that need it the most such as the front of the house and high traffic areas.  <br><br>John said that we are not in a critical condition yet.  If we go 6 to 8 weeks with temperatures in the 80's and no rain, one should irrigate with at least 1/2" to 1" of water in order to keep grass crowns alive.  Lawns should not go more than 4 to 5 weeks with temperatures in the 90's without getting 1/2" of water.  <br><br>Finally, much to his chagrin, Bill Pound said that if water is scarce and one is forced to choose between watering trees and ornamentals or lawns, the trees and ornamentals should come first.  It is more costly to replace a tree than it is a lawn.  Joe Boggs added that trees and ornamentals do not have the ability to go dormant in summer heat like turfgrass does.  If one keeps the crowns alive, the turfgrass will likely survive the dry weather.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>CROWN ANTHRACNOSE ON ANNUAL BLUEGRASS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ksu.edu/plantpath/extension/facts/turf1.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/l187/l187_3.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD>Barb Bloetscher reported that Joe Rimelspach received a sample of annual Kentucky bluegrass with crown anthracnose from a golf course in Cincinnati last week.  Normally, anthracnose infects grass leaf blades.  The symptoms are irregular shaped patches from 2" to 10' to 20' in diameter.  Initially, areas are a reddish-brown.  As the disease progresses, color fades to light yellowish tan.  The pathogen can also get into crowns of turfgrasses and kill them, especially where soil drainage is poor.  Annual bluegrasses infected with crown anthracnose will not recover.  This disease also attacks bentgrass.

When used with a surfactant at a rate of 1% volume to volume, that chemical can be very effective.  Dimension also should be used with a surfactant.  A surfactant is not necessary when using Acclaim.

The rabbit ate leaves and parts of the developing fruits.  He also noted a bumper crop of rabbits in the park where he jogs in the morning.  Dave Dyke commented that rabbits may have benefitted from the drought by not having any diseases and youngs not getting drowned in their nests.<br><br>Gardeners can discourage rabbits by removing their cover.  This may involve regular mowing, cutting, and removing unwanted brush and undergrowth.  Wire barriers also provide excellent protection.  Enclose small garden areas with l-inch mesh chicken wire, two feet high.  The trunks of young fruit trees and other susceptible woody plants can be protected with cylinders of l/4" mesh hardware cloth.  Live-trapping is another control method.  Purchase a live-trap from a garden center, hardware store or a mail-order firm.  Put the trap in a place that rabbits are known to frequent, and bait it with pieces of apple, carrot or cabbage.  Promptly release trapped rabbits several miles away in a rural area.

Blossom-end rot can also be a problem in cucumbers, squash, melons, and peppers.  A dark, sunken, leathery patch can be found on the blossom end of the fruit.  Blossom-end rot is not caused by a parasitic organism but is a physiologic disorder associated with a low concentration of calcium in the fruit.  Calcium is required in relatively large concentrations for normal cell growth.  When a rapidly growing fruit is deprived of necessary calcium, the tissues break down, leaving the characteristic dry, sunken lesion at the blossom end.<br><br>Blossom-end rot may result from low calcium levels or high amounts of competitive cations in the soil, drought stress, or excessive soil moisture fluctuations which reduce uptake and movement of calcium into the plant, or rapid, vegetative growth due to excessive nitrogen fertilization.  Control measures include maintaining proper soil pH (around 6.5), using nitrate nitrogen as the fertilizer nitrogen source, avoiding over-fertilization as side dressings during early fruiting, avoiding drought stress and wide fluctuations in soil moisture by using mulches and/or frequent irrigation.  Foliar applications of calcium, which are often advocated, are of little value because of poor absorption and movement to fruit where it is needed.  Be very cautious with the rate and timing of the calcium application since drought-stressed plants can be injured by the spray.

With this event looming on the horizon, Randy Zondag expressed a word of caution regarding tree guards used by nursery managers to prevent damage to tree trunks during shipment or by deer rubbing.  Gypsy moth caterpillars that are about to pupate typically seek out sheltered areas such as under tree bark or beneath logs.  Tree guards may also serve as ideal pupation sites.  Since the adult female moths do not fly, they often mate and lay eggs near where they had pupated.<br><br>Nursery managers in infested areas are urged to closely inspect beneath tree guards for collections of larvae and pupae, or later in the season, the moth's tan colored egg masses.  Randy noted that some nurserymen are actually removing tree guards during the pupation and egg laying phase of gypsy moth development to prevent accidental shipment of infested stock.<br><br></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2><P ALIGN=right>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../images/disease_digest2.gif" WIDTH=559 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>ANTHRACNOSE ON DECIDUOUS TREES</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="Anthracnose"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="Anthracnose">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/3000/3048.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1727/jpeg/cd1727-27.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1727/gif/cd1727-27.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Nancy Taylor received several samples of ash, maple, and oak infected with anthracnose.

Upon closer inspection, that white, puffy marshmallow-looking thing turns out to be a leaf, flower or shoot tip!  The greenish-white to white, fleshy gall is more of a fascinating fungal novelty rather than a "destroying disease" as it first appears.  This fungus survives winter in buds from which infected plant parts develop.  Spores released from a mature gall (marshmallow) can germinate on wet surfaces and may cause new infections of young, late-developing stems and leaves.

SURPRISE, WRONG!!  Powdery mildew spores need hot, dry weather with humid nights or heavy dew to germinate.  In fact, too much rainfall will inhibit germination of the powdery mildew spores.  When does that type of weather typically happen?  Normally around the end of July and the first of August.  The last two weeks were exactly August-like conditions.  So does that mean mildew is on its way?  Pam Bennett reported powdery mildew on beebalm while Joe Boggs received several samples with powdery mildew.<br><br>Powdery mildew is very host specific.  Powdery mildew infecting lilacs will not spread perennials or roses in the garden, just other susceptible lilacs.  To control powdery, spray regularly with a labeled fungicide at the first sign of the disease.  Plant susceptible plants in a sunny location and do not crowd them.  Prune away surrounding shade-producing vegetation.  Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day or at night.  Thin plants if needed to improve air circulation to speed up leaf drying.  Refer to OSU Extension Bulletin 614 "Disease Control in the Landscape" for more information.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2><P ALIGN=right>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <IMG SRC="../images/bugbytes2.gif" WIDTH=560 HEIGHT=150 ALIGN=bottom></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>CICADA UPDATE</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="cicada"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="cicada">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2137.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd2699/jpeg/cd2699-24.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd2699/gif/cd2699-24.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Several BYGLers provided updates on the emergence of Brood of the periodical cicada in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  One of the most interesting observations was made by Jim Chatfield, during his vacation trip this week to raft the Youghiogheny river in southwestern Pennsylvania.  Of course, Jim's report provided a pronunciation challenge.  The periodical cicada is pronounced: suh-KAY-duh.<br><br>Jim noted that dieback of branch tips, or "flagging," in southwestern Pennsylvania is extensive.  He noted that dieback of branch tips, or "flagging," in southwestern Pennsylvania is extensive.  He noted that early leaf symptoms strongly resemble leaf scorch.  Although cicadas are sucking insects, the leaf scorch and flagging occur because the cicadas damage vascular tissue as they thrust their ovipositors into twig bark for egg deposition.  Erik Draper described the rather meticulous arrangement of stab wounds as looking like the cicada used a sewing machine! <br><br>In southeastern and southern Ohio, Dave Dyke reported that flagging is now heavy in Washington and Jackson counties, but the event is nearing an end and adults are becoming harder to find.  In northeastern Ohio, Erik Draper noted that oviposition remains in full swing in Geauga County, and flagging is just beginning to appear; however, populations remain spotty.  The same is true in Cuyahoga County, according to Jack Kerrigan.  Jack indicated that the northern part of the county has virtually no cicadas while the southern end is getting "hammered."  Randy Zondag reported that populations are relatively heavy throughout Lake County and nursery stock is being severely damaged.  He also noted that carbaryl (e.g. Sevin) is providing the best protection of woody nursery materials.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>FALL WEBWORMS??</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="fall webworm"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="fall webworm">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2026.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd0052/jpeg/cd0052-61.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd0052/gif/cd0052-61.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Although summer has just officially arrived, fall webworms (Hyphantria cunea) have already arrived in southern Ohio.  Joe Boggs reported observing first and second instar larvae beginning to construct nests in southwest Ohio.  Dave Dyke indicated nests have been under construction for the past two weeks in southeast Ohio.  Considering the insect's common name, this may seem unusual.  However, fall webworm eggs typically hatch in early July in Ohio, so the insect is not too much ahead of schedule.  <br><br>There are at least two generations in Ohio and eggs hatch occurs over an extended period of time in both generations.  Larvae of both generations shroud leaves in webbing, but unless limited by disease and/or parasites, the nests produced by the second generation are usually much more numerous than those produced by the first generation.  Their appearance late in the season tends to support the notion that is a "fall" insect.  If nests are few in number and easily accessible, the best approach to control is physical removal.  Otherwise, there are several effective materials listed in the OSUE Bulletin 504 "Control of Insects and Mites of Woody Ornamentals and Herbaceous Perennials" for the control of this insect.  However, insecticides may also limit the impact of naturally occurring parasites.  In past seasons, parasites have proven to be very effective in reducing populations of this defoliator. </TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>JAPANESE BEETLE UPDATE</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="Japanese beetle"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="Japanese beetle">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2504.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://persephone.agcom.purdue.edu/AgCom/Pubs/pdflinks/ID-217.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1726/jpeg/cd1726-11.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1726/gif/cd1726-11.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Last week, we reported that the first Japanese beetles of the season had started to appear in southern and central Ohio.  This week, Pam Bennett noted that adult beetles are now showing up in Clark county, in west-central Ohio and Jack Kerrigan reported that adults have been found in Cuyahoga County, in northeast Ohio.<br><br>Adults are a brilliant metallic green, oval in outline, 3/8" long and 1/4" wide.  The wing covers are a coppery color and the abdomen has a row of five tufts of white hairs on each side.  They feed by skeletonizing foliage, leaving a lacy, brown "skeleton" of leaf veins.  Flower buds and fruit can also be attacked.  The beetles are general herbivores and feed on over 400 species of plants, though only about 50 are preferred hosts.  Favorites include rose, linden, grape, raspberry, and plum. <br><br>The first beetles to emerge seek out suitable plants and begin to feed.  These early arrivals release an aggregation pheromone (odor) that attracts additional adults.  Newly emerged females also release a sex pheromone to attract males.  After feeding and mating for a day or two, the females burrow into the soil to lay eggs.  Females lay one to five eggs before returning to plants to feed and mate again.  This cycle of feeding, mating and egg laying continues until the female has laid 40 to 60 eggs.  Most of the eggs are laid by mid-August, though adults may be found until the first frost.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LOCUST LEAFMINERS ACTIVE</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="locust leafminer">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ext.vt.edu/departments/entomology/factsheets/locleafm.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd2699/jpeg/cd2699-01.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd2699/gif/cd2699-01.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>BYGLers from three corners of the state report locust leafminer damage....ranging from extensive, very pronounced browning of black locust foliage in Lawrence County; to moderate browning in Hamilton County; to slight foliar damage in Lake County.  Black locust is the preferred host for the larval stage but the adults can be found feeding on apple, oak, birch, beech, elm, cherry, and hawthorn.  The adult is a small flattened beetle that is about 5 mm to 6 mm long.  The head is black and the thorax and the outer margins of the elytra are orange.  It has a prominent black dorsal stripe running down the middle of the back.<br><br>The locust leafminer should be familiar to travelers of Ohio's interstate highways.  The primary and most conspicuous damage is caused by adults of locust leafminers.  Feeding activity by this insect produces the captivating reddish-brown leaf coloration that usually radiates from black locust in mid to late July.  Overwintered adults lay eggs in May on the leaves of black locust.  Larvae feed as leafminers and form a "glove-shaped" blotch mine.  In late June to early July, new adults emerge and begin to skeletonize leaves causing most of the damage soon to be seen on black locusts growing along interstate highways.  Adults are an elongated flat beetle with a black head, orangish-yellow wing covers and a distinct black wedge-shaped pattern running down the back. </TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>SQUISHED SQUASH?  </B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="squash vine borer"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="squash vine borer">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2153.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://ctr.uvm.edu/ctr/el/EL83.HTM"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd0953/jpeg/cd0953-58.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd0953/gif/cd0953-58.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Joe Boggs reported that late last week he observed a pair of SQUASH VINE BORERS (Melittia satyriniformis) mating on leaves of his summer squash in southwest Ohio.  This means that egg laying and the hatch of the larvae, which bore into stalks causing the vines to weaken and collapse, are not far off.  This is a clearwinged moth and the adults slightly resemble wasps.  The moth's thorax is greenish-black and their abdomen is reddish-orange with a dorsal row of black dots.  Their front wings are metallic dark green and their hind wings are clear.<br><br>Aside from squash, this insect will also infest pumpkins and gourds.  Management strategies include: catching and destroying moths before they lay eggs, since moths tend to rest on leaves in the late afternoon; hand picking the dull red eggs from main stems before they hatch; wrapping stems in strips of old nylon to prevent egg laying; or excavating larvae from infested stems.  Of course, standard insecticide applications can also be used, but multiple applications are usually required and this action could also kill natural pollinators.  For more information, refer to OSU FactSheet, HYG-2153-92, titled "Squash Vine Borer." <br><br>Joe also noted that SQUASH BUGS (Anasa tristis) are laying eggs on the leaves of squash plants in southwest Ohio.  Adults are dark gray to grayish brown, flat-bodied and measure about 5/8 inch long.  The elliptical, reddish-orange to reddish-brown eggs are laid in clusters on the underside of leaves.  Nymphs are light gray and have black legs.  Early instars may superficially resemble aphids.  Both adults and nymphs suck plant sap and cause plants to wilt and leaves to die.  They frequently attack developing fruit, stunting or killing it.  The insect attacks pumpkins, gourds, and melons as well as its namesake.  Though not officially a "stink bug," this insect does emit a foul odor when disturbed.  Management options include hand-picking eggs, adults and nymphs from the plants, and insecticide applications.  Be careful, adults can deliver a painful "bite" with their sucking mouthparts!  </TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>COMMON STALK BORERS DESTROYING TOMATO PLANTS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/icm-fact/fc-13.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD>Dave Dyke received a call from a home gardener; who reported that caterpillars had bored into the base of several of his tomato plants and then bored up through the stalk....killing them.

The egg stage of the common stalk borer overwinters on a variety of plants, especially grassy weeds.  In May or June the eggs hatch and larvae develop on their host, passing through a number of stages -  generally 7 to 9.  When the larvae are small, they may be found feeding on the foliage, but the bulk of the larvae development takes place in the stalk.
