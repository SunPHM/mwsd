<h3>
<a name=dist>Distribution</a></h3>
Melonworm,  <i>Diaphania hyalinata</i> Linnaeus, occurs throughout most of Central and South
America and the Caribbean.  The United States is the northern limit of its permanent range, and
wintertime occurrence generally is limited to south Florida and perhaps south Texas. 
Melonworm disperses northward annually.  Its distribution during the summer months is
principally the southeastern states, though occasionally it disperses north to New England and
the Great Lakes region. 

<h3>
<a name=life>Life Cycle and Description</h3>

The melonworm can complete its life cycle in about 30 days.  It is present throughout the year in
southern Florida, where it is limited mostly by availability of host plants.  It disperses northward
annually, usually arriving in northern Florida in June and other southeastern states in July, where
no more than three generations normally occur before cold weather kills the host plants.   
<p>
<b>Egg:</b> Melonworm moths deposit oval, flattened eggs in small clusters, averaging two to six eggs
per egg mass.  Apparently they are deposited at night on buds, stems, and the underside of
leaves.  Initially they are white or greenish, but soon become yellow in color.  They measure
about 0.7 mm in length and 0.6 mm in width.  Hatching occurs after three to four days.

<p><b>Larva:</b> There are five instars.  Total larval development time is about 14 days, with mean (range)
duration the instars about 2.2 (2-3), 2.2 (2-3), 2.0 (1-3), 2.0 (1-3), and 5.0 (3-8) days,
respectively.  Head capsule widths are about 0.22, 0.37, 0.62, 1.04, and 1.64 mm, respectively
(Smith et al. 1994).  Larvae attain lengths of about 1.5, 2.6, 4.5, 10, and 16 mm in instars one
through five, respectively.  Newly hatch larvae are colorless, but by the second instar larvae
assume a pale yellow-green color.  They construct a loose silken structure under leaves which
serves to shelter them during the daylight hours.  In the fifth instar, larvae have two subdorsal
white stripes extending the length of the body.  The stripes fade or disappear just prior to
pupation, but they are the most distinctive characteristic of the larvae.

<p><b>Pupa:</b> Prior to pupation, larvae spin a loose cocoon on the host plant, often folding a section of
the leaf for added shelter.  The pupa is 12 to 15 mm in length, about 3 to 4 mm in width, and
fairly pointed at each end.  It is light to dark brown in color.  The pupal stage persists for nine to
10 days.  

<p><b>Adult:</b> The moth's wingspan is about 2.5 cm.  The wings are pearly white centrally, and slightly
iridescent, but are edged with a broad band of dark brown.  Moths frequently display brushy
hairpencils at the tip of the abdomen when at rest.  Melonworm moths remain in the crop during
the daylight hours.  While they are generally inactive during the day, they will fly short distances
when disturbed.  Smith (1911) provides a detailed account of melonworm biology.

<h3><a name=host>Host Plants</a></h3>

Melonworm is restricted to feeding on cucurbits.  Both wild and cultivated cucurbits may be
attacked.  Summer squash and the winter squash species are good hosts.  Pumpkin is of variable
quality as a host, probably because pumpkins have been bred from several <i>Cucurbita</i> species. 
The <i>Cucumis</i> species, cucumber, gerkin, and cantaloupe, are attacked but not preferred. 
Watermelon is a rare host.
<h3><a name=damage>Damage</h3></a>

Melonworm feeds principally on foliage, especially if foliage of a favored host plant such as
summer or winter squash is available.  Usually the leaf veins are left intact, resulting in lace-like
plant remains. However, if the available foliage is exhausted, or the plant is a less preferred
species such as cantaloupe, then the larva may feed on the surface of the fruit, or even burrow
into the fruit.  Growers sometimes refer to these insects as "rindworms" because they cause scars
on the surface of melons.  In a study of melonworm damage potential to summer squash
conducted in south Florida, melonworm caused a 23 % yield loss due to foliage damage (indirect
loss) and a 9 to 10% yield reduction due to fruit damage (direct loss) (McSorley and Waddill
1982).  Kelsheimer (1949) considered this insect to be the most important pest of cucurbits in
Florida.

<h3><a name=natural>Natural Enemies</a></h3>

Among the common natural enemies of melonworm are <i>Apanteles</i> sp., <i>Hypomicrogaster
diaphaniae</i> (Muesebeck), <i>Pristomerus spinator</i> (Fabricius) (all Hymenoptera: Braconidae),
<i>Casinaria infesta</i> (Cresson), <i>Temelucha</i> sp. (both Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), and
undetermined trichogrammatids (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) (Pena et al. 1987b,
Capinera 1994).  However, additional species parasitized melonworm, including <i>Gambrus
ultimus</i> (Cresson), <i>Agathis texana</i> (Cresson) (both Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) and an
undetermined fly (Hymenoptera: Tachinidae).   The tachinids known from melonworm are
<i>Nemorilla pyste</i> (Walker) and <i>Stomatodexia cothurnata</i> (Wiedemann).  Studies conducted in
Puerto Rico (Medina-Gaud et al. 1989) reported levels of parasitism reaching 24%.  Generalist
predators such as <em>Calosoma</em> spp. and <i>Harpalus</i>  (both Coleoptera: Carabidae), the soldier beetle
<i>Chauliognathus pennsylvanicus</i> DeGeer (Coleoptera: Cantharidae), and the <a href="../../urban/ants/red_imported_fire_ant.htm">red imported fire ant</a>
<i>Solanopsis invicta</i> Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) have also been reported to be mortality
factors. 


<h3><a name=management>Management</h3></a>

<p><b>Sampling.</b>  Pheromone production by female moths peaks at about sunset (Valles and Capinera
1992).  The sex pheromone has been identified (Raina <em>et al</em>. 1986) but is not available
commercially.  Moths are not attracted to light traps.  Therefore, checking plants for early stages
of leaf damage and the presence of arvae are the most effective ways to monitor crops.

<p><b>Insecticides.</b>  Historically, melonworm was considered to be a very damaging pest, but because
it feeds preferentially on foliage it is easy to control with a variety of insecticides.  In temperate
areas, and especially in commercial vegetable production areas, it is treated as only a minor pest. 
In insecticide-free cucurbit production and in home gardens, melonworm can cause serious
damage. 

<p>Pollinators, particularly bees, are very important in cucurbit production, and insecticide
application can interfere with pollination by killing honeybees.  If insecticides are to be applied
when blossoms are present, it is advisable to use insecticides with little residual activity, and to
apply insecticides late in the day, when bee activity is minimal.

<p><b>Biological control.</b>  In addition to chemical insecticides, <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> is commonly recommended for suppression.  The entomopathogenic nematode <i>Steinernema carpocapsae</i>
provides only moderate suppression because the nematodes do not survive long on the foliage,
where larvae are found resting and feeding (Shannag and Capinera 1995). 

<p><b>Cultural practices.</b> Row covers can be used effectively to exclude melonworm adults (Webb
and Linda 1992).  Intercropping of corn and beans with  squash was shown to reduce damage by
melonworm (Letourneau 1986).  Since melonworm prefers squash to most other cucurbits, trap
cropping has been suggested, and of course destruction of crop residue which may contain
melonworm pupae is recommended (Smith 1911).  Early plantings, except in tropical areas
where melonworm overwinters, often escape serious damage.
