<strong><center><a name=corn>Sweet Corn</a></center></strong>
<br><b>Su</b><br>- Su varieties are the normal sweet corn types that have the best quality if picked
and cooked the same day.  It's the standard corn that's been grown for years.
<br>
<br><b>Se</b><br>- While keeping the same tenderness and creamy texture of standard varieties,
se (sugary enhancer) of the corn raises the content of sugar above the standard su's.  These
varieties can hold sweetness longer and are better for local or one day shipping.
<br>
<br><b>Sh2</b><br>- These varieties of corn have the shrunken-2 gene.  This gene block the conversion  of sugar to starch and therefore can hold sweetness longer that the se or su varieites.  These supersweet hybrids require warmer soil but are ideal for 2 to 3 day shipping.
<br>
<br><b>SB</b><br>- The Sweet Breed Varieties are available only from Harris Seeds and Harris Moran.  They combine the seed quality of an su, the flavor of an se, and the good shelf life of an sh.
