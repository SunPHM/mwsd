                  <h4>The Garden<br />
  May 2003</h4>
                  <h4>A summer's m&eacute;lange</h4>
                  <p>Flying saucers, billiard balls and saxophones - summer squashes 
                    come in an exciting and varied range of shapes and sizes. 
                    Lia Leendertz finds that these rampant growers produce one 
                    of the sweetest crops in the summer kitchen garden</p>
                  <p>Images: Tim Sandall</p>
                  <p>Thinly 
                    sliced, courgette &#8216;Jemmer&#8217; with its yellow, flecked 
                    skin will make an attractive and interesting addition to any 
                    salad.</p>
                  <p><img src="images/squashes.jpg" alt="A selection of summer squashes" width="250" height="173" align="left" />In
                    preparation for the feast is squash &#8216;Patty Pan&#8217; 
                    being cut into thick slices. Others awaiting similar treatment 
                    (from top to bottom) include: the rotund form of courgette 
                    &#8216;Eight Ball&#8217;, bottle-shaped summer squash &#8216;Yellow 
                    Crookneck&#8217; and serpentine summer squash &#8216;Tromboncino&#8217; 
                    separating dark-skinned courgette &#8216;Black Jack&#8217; 
                  from yellow-skinned courgette &#8216;Taxi&#8217; </p>
                  <p>Summertime must bring some of the sweetest, most tender vegetables 
                    to serve the kitchen and table, and those that can be plucked 
                    from the plant, cooked on the barbecue and eaten within minutes 
                    are at a premium.</p>
                  <p>Among the best vegetables that carry these characteristics 
                    are summer squashes. They can be eaten raw in salads with 
                    fresh herbs or thickly sliced and lightly grilled. Barbecued, 
                    they form a perfect vegetarian side dish or warm salad. They 
                    can even be picked when tiny and popped into the mouth whole 
                    as a snack during a long bout of weeding.</p>
                  <p>Plants that can be treated as summer squash include courgettes, 
                    marrows, pumpkins and winter squash: if they can be picked 
                    young instead of being left to mature, they qualify. This 
                    is much to the gardener&#8217;s benefit as the smaller the 
                    fruit are when cropped, the more dense and sweeter the flesh 
                    is to the palate.</p>
                  <p>It is important to choose the right cultivars - those that 
                    start to form fruits early in the year and respond to picking 
                    by producing more fruits are best. Go for cultivars with a 
                    bush form, rather than a vine. These can be planted closer 
                    together, will stay compact and tend to be more prolific fruiters.</p>
                  <p>The only real difference between summer squashes and their 
                    adult forms is in the time of harvesting. They should be picked 
                    early and with a military regularity or they will soon develop 
                    into tougher fruits for storage rather than fresh fruits for 
                    immediate eating. By growing a combination of a few different 
                    cultivars, it is possible to produce fruits of many shapes 
                    and colours.</p>
                  <h4>Wide-ranging choice</h4>
                  <p>A demonstration at RHS Garden Wisley in summer 2001 proved 
                    that some cultivars are more suited than others to this treatment.</p>
                  <p>The Patty Pan types of winter squash, all of which can be 
                    left to develop and mature for winter storage, seemed to work 
                    particularly well when harvested young. The fruits are not 
                    unlike flying saucers with flat, round fruits and wavy edges. 
                    Undoubtedly the best of these was the cultivar &#8216;Sunburst&#8217; 
                    which produced many small, bright yellow fruits.</p>
                  <p>Among the ordinary courgette types, pale green &#8216;Clarita&#8217;, 
                    yellow &#8216;Taxi&#8217; and mid-green &#8216;Early Gem&#8217; 
                    all performed well when picked young. &#8216;Black Jack&#8217;, 
                    although no different in form, was conspicuous in showing 
                    off its extremely dark green skin.</p>
                  <p>A far more interesting shape was found in &#8216;De Nice 
                    &agrave; Fruit Rond&#8217;, with pretty, compact, pale green, 
                    completely globular fruits. Less attractive and more difficult 
                    to manage was &#8216;Eight Ball&#8217;. Its highly vigorous 
                    growth makes it hard to keep up with once cropping begins 
                    so the dark green, round fruits had a tendency to grow too 
                    large.</p>
                  <p>Acorn squash &#8216;Table Ace&#8217; works well for summer 
                    harvesting. Its characteristic pear-shape with a long neck 
                    is formed early on.</p>
                  <p>Some crook-necked types were also tried, but it was felt 
                    that they were better left to develop as winter squash. Their 
                    interesting characteristics, such as the circular shape formed 
                    by the length of the fruit and the warty skin, just do not 
                    develop early enough to make them worth growing as summer 
                    squash. The long, skinny and straight fruits were also awkward 
                    to cook easily.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps surprisingly, squash &#8216;Tivoli&#8217;, also known 
                    as vegetable spaghetti, was successful when cropped as a summer 
                    squash. Because the spaghetti-like strands of the flesh only 
                    form when the fruit is fully mature and ripe, when harvested 
                    at an immature stage it has a normal squash texture.</p>
                  <h4>Sowing and growing on</h4>
                  <p>In mid-spring, sow two to three seeds per 5-7.5cm (2-3in) 
                    pot and place in a propagator or maintain temperatures of 
                    at least 20&deg;C (68&deg;F). After germination, thin to one 
                    strong seedling and keep plants at 15&deg;C (60&deg;F) until 
                    they are hardened off. Plant out in early to mid June, when 
                    two strong leaves have developed and a third leaf is forming.</p>
                  <p>Alternatively, plants can be sown in their final position 
                    in late May to early June as soon as the soil feels warm to 
                    the touch. Choose a sunny spot for direct sowing and transplanting, 
                    and lightly mulch around the plant to maintain soil moisture.</p>
                  <p>Summer squashes hate the cold, so watch out for chilly, windy 
                    or wet weather and cover plants with fleece. They may sulk 
                    a little after planting, but will soon pick up once the weather 
                    warms.</p>
                  <p>Although they are hungry plants, squashes produce lots of 
                    leaves and few fruit if given large amounts of organic matter. 
                    Position rows about 90cm (3ft) apart and plants about 45cm 
                    (18in) apart within the rows. Protect from slugs during the 
                    first couple of weeks.</p>
                  <p>One of the more difficult aspects of squash growing is watering. 
                    When first planted out, plants can quickly deteriorate from 
                    stem rot if given too much water. However, once they are actively 
                    growing they need plenty to prevent one of their biggest problems. 
                    Squashes are stalked by powdery mildew, and the instant there 
                    is a check in growth, perhaps caused by a dry spell, it will 
                    make its presence known, severely affecting the plant&#8217;s 
                    ability to produce fruit.</p>
                  <p>As wet foliage can also cause mildew, avoid splashing the 
                    leaves, and water early in the morning to prevent water sitting 
                    on the leaf overnight. An organic mulch should provide all 
                    the nutrients the plants require, as they are harvested so 
                    early in the year.</p>
                  <p>The real secret behind successful summer squash growing is 
                    harvesting. It should begin around eight weeks after sowing, 
                    when the fruits are just a few inches long. Many will be so 
                    young they will still have petals attached to the ends when 
                    they are ready for eating. From the first pick onwards, it 
                    is essential to harvest at least two or three times a week. 
                    Any longer and fruits will grow too large and become tough 
                    to slice, and will need to be baked or boiled like pumpkins 
                    or marrows.</p>
                  <p>Provided you can keep up with the frantic pace of picking, 
                    growing a few cultivars of summer squash will lead to a glut 
                    of fruits in midsummer. So why not gift the excess to curious 
                    friends and neighbours to try - they will undoubtedly prize 
                    the sweet and tender flesh and shapely, multicoloured forms.</p>
