    Bronstein</i></b></font> <br>
    </font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Although White now flies the Scottish 
    flag, he was brought up in Queensland, Australia where his parents owned a 
    squash club. Not surprising then that he became a squash player, turning professional 
    in 1991 at the age of 18. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">But his rise was anything but meteoric: 
    he admits that he didn't enjoy the circuit too much then, the probable explanation 
    for his slow rise up the rankings. It took the tall, lean White six years 
    before he started to attain the sort of results that would turn him from just 
    another top 100 player into a top ten contender. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">When John White is playing at his most 
    confident, he can take your breath <img src="../photos/usopen/White%20lunge_small1.jpg" width="283" height="205" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">away 
    with the ease of his stroke play and his audacious winners from anywhere on 
    the court. But as with most shooters, White tried to shoot his way out of 
    trouble, the sort of self-made trouble caused by lack of mental and physical 
    fitness.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> Things began to fall in place in 1997 
    when he won his first two PSA titles, two smaller tournaments in Italy. Nevertheless, 
    he had mounted the winner's rostrum and together with reaching the final in 
    three other tournaments, White began his climb to the top. In 1998 he won 
    the Flanders Open and the Mega Italia Open, reached the quarter finals of 
    the British Open and by the end of the year had broken through to the top 
    20. But 1999 was a disappointment managing only two <img src="../photos/pncopen/JWhite1.jpg" width="245" height="302" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">semi-final 
    placings. Not that he played badly - his losses were mostly in five and he 
    must have ended the year beating his brains for a way to win the fifth game. 
    He lost to Paul Johnson (then ranked fourth) 8-15 in the fifth in Hong Kong; 
    he lost to Mark Chaloner 10-15 in the fifth in the Al-Ahram; he lost to Ahmed 
    Barada 13-15 in the fifth in Heliopolis but then beat Barada 17-15 in the 
    fifth in the US Open where he went on to beat Paul Johnson in five in the 
    quarters, losing to Power in the semi-final. His final tournament of 199 was 
    the last-minute British Open in Aberdeen where he lost to Omar Elborolossy 
    11-15 in the fifth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Nevertheless, White had done enough to 
    move up the rankings to number ten. White started 2000 in great form with 
    a semi-final appearance at the Greenwich Open and making the quarter-finals 
    of the Tournament of Champions. In March of that year, White had broken through 
    to the top ten for his highest ever ranking of 8. But the fifth game bug haunted 
    him; he lost to Marshall, Byron Davis, Power, Ong Beng Hee (twice) and Simon 
    Parke in <img src="../photos/greenwich/JWhite01.jpg" width="279" height="324" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">five 
    game tussles. A back spasm put him out of one tournament, but was looking 
    for a way to get rid of his jinx. In April he moved from Amsterdam to Nottingham, 
    mostly for family reasons. (He now has two children, Kyra, 6 months and a 
    boy, Tyler, 2) But it was in Nottingham that he found what he was looking 
    for in the form of fitness expert Vaughan Williams at Nottingham University. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"He gave me a programme of Plyometrics 
    and strength work. Plyometrics is jumping over boxes and stepping up on to 
    them. Always on your toes ready for the next jump and you're getting that 
    explosive power all the way up from your Achilles to your hips. I was seeing 
    Williams two or three times a week before I went to the States.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> The result is that going into the fourth 
    or fifth game I still have that explosive power which allows me to still play 
    at a quite a high pace. If you don't have <img src="../photos/usopen/powerwhite1sm.jpg" width="343" height="277" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">that, 
    you lose that half a second going for the ball or reading the game," White 
    explains.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> The results speak very loudly for themselves. 
    White won the Greenwich Open beating British Open champion David Evans in 
    four. In the preceding rounds he had beaten Walker in four, Boswell in three 
    and Nick Taylor in five. A week later he was in New York for the Tournament 
    of Champions and yes! he beat Peter Marshal 15-12 in the fifth. He met Nicol 
    in the second round - that's the luck of the draw - and lost in four. But 
    revenge was not long in coming and a week later in Antwerp he beat the world 
    champion in four in the semi-finals before going on to win.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> White spoke exclusively to Squashtalk 
    about his victory:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"I'd beaten Nicol a few months ago when 
    I played him in the German <img src="../photos/psa%20players/DRyanJWhite3_small.jpg" width="285" height="200" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">Bundesliga. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">&quot;All that fitness training, endurance 
    and strength work that I did for a month and half before I went to the States 
    all came into place when I played Nicol. Even though I had beaten Beachill 
    17-15 in the fifth a couple of days before, at the start of the first game 
    against Nicol I felt OK. I told myself to be a lot more patient than I would 
    normally be. Keep the ball tight and keep him to the back and not go for any 
    silly shots. I told myself not to try and get myself out of trouble by trying 
    to hit winners left, right and center."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <i><b>But aren't winners are part of 
    your game? </b></i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"Right and I still hit quite a few winners 
    against Nicol because he gave me a lot more opportunity than he normally gives 
    me when we play each other. So if the ball was in the middle of the court 
    and I felt comfortable, I'd go for it, but if it wasn't there, I'd just keep 
    the rallies going and hopefully he would make the errors and he did make a 
    few unforced errors at the vital part of each game, which is not part of his 
    normal game. This gave me more confidence.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> "It was like a role reversal with him 
    normally keeping the rallies going and me making the errors. I was up 11-7 
    in the first and he came fighting back and I lost 12-15. Coming up for the 
    second game, I told myself 'if you get a lead to take one point at a time 
    - don't think about being three points away from game ball or match ball'. 
    I followed my own advice and everything fell into place and as the game went 
    on I felt as strong as I did at the very beginning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"I didn't think I was going to win until 
    16-all and then I got the stroke and Jack Allen, the referee, said 'match 
    to Mr White.' When I heard that, I got goose bumps to start with and then 
    I put my hands and yelled 'Yeah;! Then I shook Peter's hand and the crowd 
    went wild because I had a lot of supporters in the crowd which made it even 
    more exciting."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <i><b>You've now beaten a player who 
    is very mentally strong. </b></i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"That's what makes Peter Nicol so good. 
    Even if he loses the first game he's twice as hard as his opponent and when 
    he gets into the fourth or fifth game he can pick the game up another notch, 
    starts looking for volleys and puts you under more pressure and if you can't 
    go with it, a lot of balls are going to get past you and behind you so you 
    end up retrieving everything. But now I could stay with him and when I felt 
    like pushing him up a notch I could do it and it paid off big time."</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <i><b>You've been up as high as eight 
    in the rankings and you are now 12. Where do you think you should be ranked? 
    </b></i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Definitely top four. I've played everybody 
    above me and beaten 75% of them. I've proved myself against Barada, beaten 
    him three out of five. I've got a good record against Parke. It's two each 
    against David Evans and now I've beaten the world champion, it gives me a 
    lot more confidence. I've won my first Super Series event beating the world 
    champion in the seminal...you can't ask much more than that!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"Now I've got to string the results together 
    and stay even more focussed. Doesn't matter whether you've got a good draw 
    or bad draw, you've got to beat everybody." </font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b><i>You are approaching your 28th birthday...is 
    that getting old or are you still coming to your peak? </i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"No I feel I'm getting stronger and getting 
    to know the game better. I feel strong minded and just as keen to keep on 
    playing the tour."</font></p>
