are the days when leaves, or grass for that matter, could be bagged and picked
up by trash services.&nbsp; The quantity of material entering landfills was too
great and current state law bans leaves from landfills and burning facilities.&nbsp;
Most people return grass clippings to the lawn effectively recycling this
material.</span></font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; tab-stops: .5in"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">The
vast majority of leaves have fallen now and need to be handled in some
appropriate manner.&nbsp; Recycling in certainly an option.&nbsp; Your community
may have a recycling facility accepting leaves.&nbsp; The waste hauler or city
should know.</span></font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; tab-stops: .5in"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">If
you would rather save a trip to the drop-off site and use this material at home,
there are options available.&nbsp; Using a lawnmower with a bagging attachment,
dry leaves may be picked up as the grass is mowed.&nbsp; A benefit of this
technique is the leaves are shredded, significantly reducing the volume.&nbsp;
In addition, mixing leaves and grass clippings is a good mix for starting
compost.</span></font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; tab-stops: .5in"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">If
the leaves in your yard are too thick for the lawn mower, they can be raked into
piles and shredded with a shredder/chipper.&nbsp; These machines are available
for rent.&nbsp; Be sure to use them safely.&nbsp; Shredding increases surface
area helping the composting process and is best done when leaves are dry.&nbsp;
If you will not have grass clippings until next spring, bagged leaves will keep
over winter until you are ready to start your compost pile.</span></font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; tab-stops: .5in"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Shredded
leaves may be used as a mulch around trees, shrubs, or in vegetable and flower
gardens.&nbsp; They help reduce weed germination, help retain moisture, and
after they break down, add organic matter to the soil.</span></font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; tab-stops: .5in"><b><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">If
the leaves remaining on the lawn are very few in number, they may be shredded as
part of regular mowing and left in place.&nbsp; This needs to be done with
caution because if the leaves are too thick, they will mat down over winter
causing grass dieback and providing a good disease environment.</span></font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>On this Thanksgiving, some of you might be having sweet
potatoes as part of the Thanksgiving meal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It might have crossed your mind whether you could grow your own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>The sweet potato is a tender warm-season vegetable
requiring a long frost-free season to develop useful roots.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This would explain their widespread commercial growing in the
southern United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you
would like to work a little to provide the conditions they need, sweet potatoes
may find a place in your vegetable garden next year.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sweet potatoes are related to the morning glory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yams and sweet potatoes may be used interchangeably, but they are not the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>True yams grow only in the
tropics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sweet potatoes grow on
trailing vines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bush varieties are
available if space is limited.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>In the spring after the last frost, plant the
“slips” about 12 to 18 inches apart and with three to four feet between
rows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Always buy plants certified
disease-free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Black plastic as a
mulch will help you capture as much of the sun’s heat as possible, plus the
amount of weeding is reduced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
the rows can be elevated from the surrounding soil, these will warm quicker in
the spring.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Keep them moist but not soaked.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Avoid watering for three or four weeks before harvesting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They grow underground like common potatoes, so dig carefully to avoid
damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideally the roots should be
allowed to dry on the ground for two to three hours and then cured at 85F and
85% humidity for 10 to 14 days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Try
to come as close as possible to these conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Storage is best around 55F.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
they bruise easily, be careful when handling the roots.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>If a hard frost is coming, cut off the vines to prevent
any rot from reaching the roots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do
not allow the roots to freeze.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
do not store well for long periods, so plan to use them early.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Some varieties to try include:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Beauregard, Porto Rico, Centennial, Georgia Jet, and Jewell.</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Now is the time of year to make sure we have everything
ready for winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are a few
last minute reminders listed here just in case they might have been overlooked.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>If you have been using your garage to cure vegetables
such as squash for winter storage, bring them indoors for storage unless your
garage is heated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any vegetable
that has been nipped by frost should be used first as this will not keep long
after brought inside.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Liquid fertilizers, herbicides, or insecticides that
have been kept outside should be brought in because they will not survive
freezing temperatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Read the
label for any specific additional storage instructions, and be sure to keep them
in a location safe from children and pets.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Granular or powdered formulations of these chemicals
will not be damaged as long as they are kept completely dry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If there are any doubts, check the product label.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, grass seed kept dry will not be harmed by freezing
temperatures.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>This is also a good time to make sure your garden tools
are in good condition, or if necessary, make any needed repairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Removal of all soil or plant material, perhaps followed with a light
spraying of oil (for example, WD-40) will help prevent rust and let tools last
longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For hoes, spades, or other
tools that rely on a sharp edge, sharpening now will have them ready to go to
work in the spring.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Gasoline-powered equipment will also need to be
winterized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The manual that came
with your equipment should have specific instructions regarding draining the
fuel tank or using a fuel stabilizer, cleaning the air filter, lubrication, and
oil changes.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>With these final steps completed, you can relax and
enjoy your winter-time interests, knowing that you are prepared to start the
season come spring . . .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>or at
least until we get the gardening bug again when the seed catalogs begin to
arrive . . .</b></p>
