<P> Here is one of the first pictures taken of Nathan in the 
<A HREF="baby/Nathan_web0006.jpg">hospital</A>. Here he is with 
<A HREF="baby/Nathan_web0005.jpg">mom</A> in the hospital after we 
had a few days to bond. We took pictures with 
<A HREF="baby/Nathan_web0004.jpg">bubby and big brother, 
Joshua</A> and with <A HREF="baby/Nathan_web0002.jpg">saba</A>. 
Joshua thought the baby's bris was his own party and he even got 
<A HREF="baby/Nathan_web0003.jpg">trains</A> as a gift from 
Nathan. Here, Nathan is reading with

Joshua had a lot of fun in Houston. He got to meet a lot of family members. Here are pictures of him with his <A HREF="baby/family0001.jpg" ALIGN=left>gram</A>, his <A HREF="baby/family0002.jpg" ALIGN=left>bubbie</A>,  <A HREF="baby/family0004.jpg" ALIGN=left>momo</A> (his great grandmother) and <A HREF="baby/family0003.jpg" ALIGN=left>Becky</A> (his step-grandmother). Unfortunately, the batteries in the digitial camera ran out and we didn't have a fresh pair with us. That is why we don't have more pictures with family members. We also have pictures of Joshua with <A HREF="baby/imhof0002.jpg" ALIGN=left>Tania</A> , <A HREF="baby/imhof0003.jpg" ALIGN=left>Heather</A> and <A HREF="baby/imhof0001.jpg" ALIGN=left>Sheila</A>. Aside from meeting family and going to all the family gatherings, Joshua also got to go to the butterfly museum, which is one of the best places to visit if you are ever lucky enough to be in Houston. Here he is with his mom outside the museum where they have the <A HREF="baby/hmns0001.jpg" ALIGN=left>garden</A>. Here he is by the <A HREF="baby/hmns0002.jpg" ALIGN=left>waterfall</A> inside the greenhouse rainforest. Here he is with his dad in front of the tree that houses the <A HREF="baby/hmns0008.jpg" ALIGN=left>poisonous tree frogs</A>. They're always delightful. Here we are on the <A HREF="baby/hmns0003.jpg" ALIGN=left>stairway</A>  Here we are at the <A HREF="baby/hmns0004.jpg" ALIGN=left>top floor</A> of the three floor butterfly complex. Here we are in front of some <A HREF="baby/hmns0005.jpg" ALIGN=left>butterflies</A> and <A HREF="baby/hmns0006.jpg" ALIGN=left>beetles</A>  at the traditional exhibit. And here is another <A HREF="baby/hmns0007.jpg" ALIGN=left>picture</A>. We also ate at <A HREF="baby/hmns0009.jpg" ALIGN=left>Kim Son</A>, another Houston tradition. 
</P>
<P>
But, the fun didn't end there. When we got back home in Seattle, Joshua played with some of the toys he received. He loves his <A HREF="baby/toys0001.jpg" ALIGN=left>radio</A>. It is currently the only toy that will encourage him to roll over in order to play with it. He also like to <A HREF="baby/toys0005.jpg" ALIGN=left>read</A>  and  <A HREF="baby/toys0004.jpg" ALIGN=left>eat</A> his animal farm book. Here he is in the his <A HREF="baby/toys0002.jpg" ALIGN=left>saucer</A>. He loves this <A HREF="baby/toys0003.jpg" ALIGN=left>toy</A>. We were able to purchase this with gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Joshua is also eating solids. Here are his first spoonfulls of rice cereal. <A HREF="baby/rice0001.jpg" ALIGN=left>First spoonfull</A>, and <A HREF="baby/rice0002.jpg" ALIGN=left>all done</A>. Joshua likes rice cereal, oatmeal and bananas. He does not like potato. This week he will try butternut squash and avocado.

<IMG SRC="baby/birth.jpg" ALIGN=left>Joshua Dov Britt</A> was born on August 23, 2002. He weighed 7 lb 6 oz and was 20 in. long. <BR CLEAR=left>
<p>
Click on these these links to see pictures of Joshua with his <A HREF="baby/check0003.jpg">father</A> and <A HREF="baby/check0002.jpg">me</A> on the day of his <A HREF="http://www.brismilah.com">bris</A>. </p>
<p>
Here he is in his <A HREF="baby/check0004.jpg">pop up play gym</A>.
<p>
Recently, we went to a corn maze and pumpkin patch at the Biringer farms. Here is a picture of Joshua with <A HREF="baby/pumpkin0001.jpg">me and a scarecrow</A>. Here is a picture of Joshua with his <A HREF="baby/pumpkin0002.jpg">dad and some pumpkins</A>.

Here are pictures from week 8. First, here he is in a sweater that his great Aunt knitted for him. <A HREF="baby/week80003.jpg">1</A> <A HREF="baby/week80004.jpg">2</A>.
Here are pictures of Joshua raising himself up! <A HREF="baby/week80001.jpg">1</A> <A HREF="baby/week80002.jpg">2</A>
<p>
Week 9: Joshua had a doctor's appointment. He weighs 12 lb 2 oz and is
22 in long. We're beginning to put him in his 3-6 month clothing as his
0-3 month clothing appears to be getting tight. Thank goodness for all the
gifts we recieved, or I'd be out shopping like a mad woman. The fall her is lovely, so hopefully I'll have some new pics up on the web. But never
fear, his professional photos just came in and we'll be sending out pics
soon! 
</p>
<p>
Joshua also learned cause and effect: On Friday, he learned that if he kicked the side of his pop up gym, the hanging toys would sway. He enjoyed this for about an hour.
</p>
<p>
Week 10: Joshua had his first <A HREF="baby/smiles0002.jpg">baby 
sitter</A> 
while his parents celebrated 
their one year anniversary. We're very glad that we were married on day light savings day, that way we always get an extra hour to celebrate!
Joshua also slept for a record 7 hours on Monday night! If only he would repeat this wonderful trick.
</p>
<p> And let's not forget <A HREF="baby/smiles0004.jpg">Halloween</A>. 
Joshua looked so cute in his <A 
HREF="baby/smiles0003.jpg">outfit</A> 
that Gram bought. 
<p>
Week 11: Joshua has now turned over twice from his front to his back.
We also got some great pictures of him <A 
HREF="baby/smiles0006.jpg">smiling</A> in the <A 
HREF="baby/smiles0001.jpg">morning</A>.  
</p>
<p> We also had visitors this week. First, his <A 
HREF="baby/smiles0005.jpg">Loca Tia Tania</A> (also known as my best 
friend) came. We 
went to the zoo for the first time with Loca Tia Tania. Tania also babysat 
while the parents got stuck in football traffic trying to get to the 
University Village, which is ordinarily just a 2 minute drive, but turned 
into about 20 minutes.
</p> 
<p> Our second set of visitors were my <A HREF="baby/smiles0008.jpg">Aunt 
Mona</A> and <A HREF="baby/smiles0007.jpg">Uncle Stephen</A>. It 
rained most of the time they were here and I had car trouble. But, we did 
get to go to the space needle and look at the haze that is Seattle.
</p>

<p>
Week 12: This week, Joshua slept a record 10 hours through the night. Unfortunately, he has not repeated that trick. But, there are no complaints here since he goes to sleep at night fairly easily and he has been sleeping more than 7 hours before waking to eat. We also got our first professional family photo taken. I'll be picking those up in December. It was also the week that Kevin was sworn in as a lawyer. Unfortunately, he was very sick that evening, so Joshua and I stayed home in order to reduce Joshua's exposure to his daddy :(
</p>
<p> Week 13: Joshua earned his keep! He participated in an infant vision study, earning $7. He was succesively shown a purple circle and a white cirlce in random locations on a black background. He looked at the purple circle 38 out of 60 times. I couldn't resist determining if this was random. If we are interested in knowing wether Joshua was more likely to look at the purple cirlce than the white circle, the p-value is .03. If we were interested in whether or not it was completely random, the p-value is 0.05. This indicates that it is likely that Joshua can see the color purple and prefers it to white when both colors are on a black background. 
</p>
<p>This week, Joshua also purposefully reached out to play with one of his toys on his swing. <A HREF="baby/hands0001.jpg">Picture 1</A>, <A HREF="baby/hands0002.jpg">Picture 2</A>
</p>
<p>Week 14: We are now trying to regulate a nap schedule for Joshua. He is taking to it very well. No pictures since we don't want to disturb his sleep.
</p>
<p>
Weeks 14, 15 and 16: Joshua went through a massive growth spurt, so I have not had the time to update the web page. Here is a list of things that he has done: He is napping very well, he has giggled, he rolls over consistently, he brings his toys to his mouth, and he has become much more alert. Thanksgiving weekend was wonderful. Kevin and I took him to the aquarium and he loved watching the tropical fish. We also had a Hannukah party, but he slept through most of that.
</p>
<p>
Here are three recent pictures of tummy time! <A HREF="baby/tummy0001.jpg">Picture 1</A>, <A HREF="baby/tummy0002.jpg">Picture 2</A>, <A HREF="baby/tummy0003.jpg">Picture 3</A>
</P>
<p>
Week 17: New Developments! Joshua now holds his toys with <A HREF="baby/week170002.jpg">two hands</A>, occasionally. He has also started passing toys from hand to hand. Here is another <A HREF="baby/week170001.jpg">cute picture</A>. His napping has improved leaps and bounds. Until now, he would only nap with me, but today he has napped twice in his crib!
