<B>The Sweet and Savory Sides of Winter Squash</B><br>
<br>
<I>Learn to highlight the flavor of winter squash in gratins, pastas, salads, and pies</I><br>
<br>
BY RIS LACOSTE<br>
<br>
 Mother Nature is a pretty smart cookie. She gives us the green vegetables 
  of spring &#150; asparagus, peas, and artichokes &#150; when you can practically 
  taste the grass and smell the dew. The blazing sun of summer brings the fiery 
  reds and yellows of tomatoes, corn, peppers, and summer squash. And then those 
  reds and yellows mellow into the sweet golden orange of fall. The leaves begin 
  to turn, the days grow shorter, the air is cool and prime for football, and 
  you just know the bright-orange pumpkins are out there in the patch, waiting 
  to be picked. That&#146;s when I know I&#146;m ready to put winter squash on 
  my menu at 1789 Restaurant in Washington, D.C.<br>
<br>
  I try to follow the seasons when making my restaurant menus, mostly because 
  flavors are at their best but also because I like to keep my cooking in sync 
  with local rhythms. When vegetables are eaten in season, their nutrients are 
  at a peak. And when it comes to winter squash, that genius Mother Nature makes 
  cooking seasonally especially easy. With its sweet, nutty flavor, squash lends 
  itself perfectly to the meats of autumn &#150; duck, venison, pork, turkey &#150; 
  all of which I love to have a little something sweet beside them. And squash 
  has a savory side, too, which makes it a versatile vegetable in the fall. I 
  use my favorite varieties (see &#147;Squash have different looks, different 
  personalities&#148;) in dishes as diverse as gratins, pastas, salads, and bread 
  puddings. My pastry chef loves winter squash in pies, too. The possibilities 
  are endless, provided you first learn to baby squash a bit so it releases all 
  its potential.<br>
<br>
<B>Roast to enhance flavor; then use it as a base</B><br>
  While winter squash can be steamed, saut&eacute;ed, or microwaved, I prefer 
  to toast squash whenever possible, especially before using it in other dishes 
  calling for squash pur&eacute;e (see the master method). Roasting helps reduce 
  the moisture level (winter squash is 89% water), which intensifies the flavor 
  and also gives me the opportunity to season the squash while cooking it. After 
  cutting small squash in half or larger squash into pieces, I season it with 
  maple syrup to enhance sweetness, orange juice to heighten flavors, and butter 
  to add richness.<br>
<br>
  I roast the squash in a baking pan or on a rimmed baking sheet flesh side down, 
  which allows the most flesh to caramelize. I never peel squash before roasting 
  it &#150; when raw, squash is notoriously difficult to peel, but when cooked, 
  the flesh is easy to scrape out.<br>
<br>
  Once the squash in cooked, cooled, and separated from the skin, it&#146;s a 
  terrific base for soups, puddings, pies, breads, biscuits, or ravioli filling. 
  The cooked squash has a much creamier texture than you&#146;d expect from a 
  fibrous vegetable. It also reheats beautifully and freezes well. I like to freeze 
  it in serving sizes to use later in a variety of recipes or as a side dish.<br>
<br>
  If I want to use well-defined squash pieces in a recipe, like in a pot pie or 
  in salad, I&#146;ll first peel it and then dice, slice, or julienne the raw 
  squash and roast or saut&eacute; it just until done. I never boil squash, as 
  its delicate flavor would be lost.<br>
<br>
<B>Squash&#146;s subtleties need the right seasoning</B><br>
  The sweet and savory sides of winter squash both benefit from subtle flavor 
  boosts. Traditional autumn and winter spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, 
  and ginger are a good place to start, but there are smoother ways to highlight 
  the delicate flavors of squash.<br>
<br>
  I like to focus on the two major characteristics of winter squash flavor &#150; 
  sweet and nutty. Sweetness balances spicy food. You go to the sweetness on a 
  plate for soothing refreshment &#150; when eating a spicy curry, for instance. 
  A roasted sweet dumpling squash is fabulous filled with a curried rice mixture 
  and topped with yogurt. Sweetness also balances smokiness; just think of bacon 
  and maple syrup, or ham and pineapple. Bacon, prosciutto, sausages, and ham 
  of all kinds match very well with squash. You can add squash to lentil or bean 
  soups. And squash works very well with truly savory flavors such as tomatoes 
  and sharp, salty cheeses (see the gratin recipe).<br>
<br>
  The other side of squash &#150; its nutty flavor &#150; helps it bond with buttery 
  recipes, baked goods, and rice. Wild rice, basmati rice &#150; eve risotto &#150; 
  all have a nutty side to them. I especially like walnuts with winter squash, 
  but pecans are a bit sweeter and work well, too. Try pistachios and almonds 
  in a curry dish with winter squash. And the nutty side of squash also makes 
  sherry and bourbon great partners for it, as these spirits have their own sweetness 
  and a special affinity to nuts. Plus, they&#146;re great flavor heighteners. 
  In the squash ravioli recipe included here, I&#146;ve dressed the ravioli with 
  a sherried onion cream sauce, crunchy walnuts, tart-sweet cranberries, and salty 
  Parmesan cheese &#150; all to bring out the range of squash flavors.<br>
<br>
<B>Handle squash safely</B><br>
  Squash skin is very tough, and it can be a struggle to cut. To keep things safe, 
  work on a flat surface and, to secure a solid base, trim a sliver from the bottom 
  or one side of the squash and let it sit flat. Use a large, sharp knife and 
  keep your fingers out of the way. Insert the tip of the knife into the side 
  of the squash and cut down, rather than attacking the squash with the full breadth 
  of the blade.<br>
<br>
  I usually don&#146;t peel any squash other than butternut because the contours 
  are so unruly. When peeling butternut, you can use a vegetable peeler, but you 
  might want to wear gloves, as there&#146;s a green, gluey substance under the 
  skin that gets on your hands and seems to stay there forever.<br>
<br>
Master method for roasting squash<br>
<br>
  The squash roasts in a 400 &ordm; oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until the skin 
  is blistered and browned and the flesh is tender; lift the squash with tongs 
  and poke with a paring knife to check. When cooled, the skin will peel off easily.<br>
<br>
To evaporate moisture and concentrate flavor, as for a ravioli filling, the 
  roasted squash (and any cooking juices) may be saut&eacute;ed in a dry pan for 
  a few minutes.<br>
<br>

<B>RECIPES</B><br>
<font color="660000">Squash, Ravioli with Sherried Onion Sauce, Walnuts &amp; Cranberries</font><br>
  My sous chef Michelle Giroux developed this delicious dish as a vegetarian entr&eacute;e 
  for our menu, but it would also make an elegant Thanksgiving starter. We make 
  our own pasta dough, but wonton wrappers (or &#147;pasta wraps&#148;), found 
  in the grocery produce section, give excellent results and are quick and easy 
  to work with.<br>
<br>
  Yields about 40 ravioli.<br>
<br>

FOR THE FILLING<br>
  1 large or 2 small butternut squash or &frac12; cheese pumpkin (2 &frac12; lb. 
  total), to yield 2 &frac12; cups cooked pur&eacute;e<br>
  5 to 6 Tbs. unsalted butter, softened<br>
  1/3 cup maple syrup or 2 Tbs. brown sugar<br>
  &frac14; cup orange juice<br>
  &frac14; cup ricotta<br>
  1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
<br>

FOR THE SAUCE<br>
  2 large onions (14 to 16 oz. total), thinly sliced<br>
  3 Tbs. unsalted butter; more if needed<br>
  1/3 cup sherry<br>
  1 &frac12; cups heavy cream<br>
  1 &frac12; cups homemade or low-salt canned chicken or vegetable stock (or a 
  total of 3 cups stock if not using cream)<br>
  2 Tbs. finely chopped fresh sage<br>
<br>

TO ASSEMBLE RAVIOLI<br>
  Cornmeal for dusting<br>
  80 wonton wrappers (&#147;pasta wraps&#148;)<br>
  2 eggs mixed with a dash of water<br>
<br>

FOR THE GARNISH<br>
  &frac12; cup finely chopped toasted walnuts<br>
  &frac12; cup finely chopped dried cranberries<br>
  2 Tbs. chopped fresh chives<br>
  3 oz. Parmesan cheese, shaved with a vegetable peeler into shards<br>
<br>

 To make the filling &#150; Follow the master method for roasting squash (above) 
  using the amounts for the squash, butter, maple syrup, and orange juice above. 
  After peeling the cooked squash, put the flesh and any juices from roasting 
  into a large heavy-based saut&eacute; pan and cook over medium heat, stirring 
  frequently, about 10 min., to further dry out the mixture and intensify the 
  flavor. To smooth out the squash somewhat, break up lumps with spatula, a potato 
  masher, or the back of a wooden spoon. Put the squash in a bowl and set aside 
  until cool. When cooled, mix in the ricotta and grated cheese and season with 
  salt and pepper. The mixture can be made a day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.<br>
<br>
  To make the sauce - Saut&eacute; the onions in 3 Tbs. of the butter over medium 
  heat until very soft and golden, 20 to 25 min. Add the sherry to deglaze, raise 
  the heat to medium high, and cook until all the liquid is evaporated. Add the 
  cream and stock (or all stock, if you prefer) and the chopped sage, and reduce 
  by half or until the sauce is the consistency you like. You&#146;ll have 2 to2 
  &frac12; cups sauce. Season with salt and pepper. It using stock only, whisk 
  in 1 to 2 Tbs. butter at the end to give the sauce a bit of body. (If making 
  the sauce ahead, reserve the butter until reheating. If using cream, reheat 
  the sauce very gently.)<br>
<br>
  To assemble the ravioli &#150; Lightly dust your work surface with cornmeal, 
  lay out the wonton wrappers (10 to 12 at a time) and brush half of them with 
  egg wash. Place 1 scant Tbs. of the squash filling in the center of each piece 
  of egg-washed pasta and flatten slightly (a pastry bag works well here). Quickly 
  and gently cover each with a second wrapper (without egg wash) and with the 
  tips of your fingers, press tightly around each mound and out towards the edges 
  of the pasta to create a tight seal. (Start pressing around the filling first 
  to avoid creating air pockets.) If you like, trim the ravioli with a cookie 
  cutter or knife. (Alternatively, if using homemade pasta sheets, space the filling 
  3 inches apart on first sheet, cover, seal, and crimp as desired.) Arrange the 
  filled ravioli in a single layer on a sheet pan lightly dusted with cornmeal. 
  Cover and refrigerate or freeze until ready to use.<br>
<br>
  To cook and serve ravioli &#150; Warm the sauce and have the garnishes ready. 
  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add a touch of olive oil, and drop 
  in 4 to 6 ravioli at a time. When they rise to the surface, boil for 4 min. 
  and then remove them with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a strainer (or 
  a cooling rack set over a pan) to drain. Arrange 3 or 4 ravioli on a large plate 
  for an appetizer (6 for a dinner portion), cover lightly with the sauce (about 
  1 Tbs. per ravioli), and sprinkle with the walnuts, cranberries, and chives. 
  Add a few shards of Parmesan and serve.<br>
<br>

<font color="660000">Roasted Butternut Squash Salad with Sherry Maple Vinaigrette</font><br>
  If you can find it, try the Westfield Farm goat cheese from Hubbardston, Massachusetts, 
  in this salad. I like to include the optional bacon because I think its meaty 
  smokiness adds great contrast. Serves six as a starter.<br>
<br>

&frac12; cup raisins<br>
  &frac12; cup ort<br>
  1 butternut squash (about 2 lb.)<br>
  1 small red onion<br>
  2 Tbs. olive oil<br>
  2 Tbs. maple syrup<br>
  Salt and freshly ground pepper<br>
  2 medium heads endive<br>
  1 small head fris&eacute;e<br>
  &frac12; small head radicchio<br>
  3 cups loosely packed spinach leaves, stemmed<br>
  Sherry Maple Vinaigrette (see recipe)<br>
  6-oz log fresh goat cheese<br>
  1/3 cup chopped toasted walnuts<br>
  4 slices cooked bacon, crumbled (optional).<br>
<br>

 Cover the raisins with the port and let sit overnight.
  Heat the oven to 400 &ordm; F. Cut off the bulb end of the squash; reserve for 
  another use. Peel the cylinder end and cut into &frac12;- to &frac34;-inch dice. 
  Thinly slice the red onion. In a bowl, combine the squash, red onion, olive 
  oil, and maple syrup. Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine thoroughly. 
  Spread the squash and onions on an oiled sheet pan and roast, stirring occasionally, 
  until the squash is just cooked through and the squash and onions are browned, 
  20 to 25 minutes.<br>
<br>
  Cut the endive into &frac12;-inch slices. Cut off the stem end of fris&eacute;e, 
  separate the leaves, and cut them into smaller pieces. Core and roughly chop 
  the radicchio. Combine the endive, fris&eacute;e, radicchio, and spinach in 
  a non-reactive mixing bowl; toss with &frac12; cup of the vinaigrette. Arrange 
  the greens on six plates.<br>
<br>
  Heat the broiler. Slice the goat cheese into 6 rounds and arrange on a baking 
  sheet. Broil until just soft, 2 to 3 min. Top each plate of greens with the 
  still-warm squash and onions. Drain the raisins and sprinkle them, the toasted 
  walnuts, and the bacon, if using, around the plate. Garnish with a round of 
  warmed goat cheese. Drizzle a few teaspoons of the remaining vinaigrette around 
  each plate and serve. Reserve extra vinaigrette for another use.<br>
<br>

<font color="660000">Sherry Maple Vinaigrette</font><br>
You can use walnut oil for some of the peanut oil. Yields about 1 &frac12; cups.<br>
<br>

1/3 cup sherry vinegar<br>
  1 tsp. Dijon-style mustard<br>
  2 Tbs. maple syrup<br>
  1 Tbs. finely chopped shallots<br>
  1 cup peanut oil<br>
  Salt and freshly ground pepper.<br>
<br>

 Combine the vinegar, mustard, maple syrup, and shallots in a bowl and slowly 
  whisk in the oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br>
<br>

<font color="660000">Butternut Squash &amp; Potato Gratin with Walnut Crust</font><br>
  To vary this gratin, add tomatoes, caramelized onions, or other vegetables. 
  It&#146;s wise to put a sheet of foil on the bottom rack of the oven to catch 
  any cream that bubbles over. Serves nine.<br>
<br>

1 butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled<br>
  2 Idaho potatoes (about 1 &frac14; lb. total), peeled<br>
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
  6 Tbs. grated Parmesan cheese<br>
  1 cup heavy cream<br>
  &frac12; cup finely chopped walnuts<br>
  &frac12; cups fresh breadcrumbs combined with 2 Tbs. melted butter.<br>
<br>

 Heat the oven to 350&ordm;F. Grease an 8x8-inch (2-qt.) glass or ceramic baking 
  dish. Cut the squash in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds and fibers. 
  Slice the squash and potatoes about 1/8-inch thick (use a mandoline if you have 
  one). Line the bottom of the baking dish with a layer of squash (overlapping 
  slightly), season lightly with salt and pepper, sprinkle with a little of the 
  Parmesan, and drizzle with a little of the cream. Cover with a layer of potato 
  slices, season with salt, pepper, cheese, and cream. Repeat with the remaining 
  squash and potatoes until the dish is full, ending with a top layer of squash, 
  seasoned and topped with any remaining cheese and cream. (You may have extra 
  squash.) Press down lightly to distribute the cream and compact the layers. 
  The last layer of squash should be just sitting in the cream, but not covered 
  by it. Cover the dish with foil and bake until the vegetables fell tender when 
  poked with a thin, sharp knife (check the middle layer), about 1 hour and 10 
  min.<br>
<br>
  Combine the walnuts and buttered breadcrumbs. Remove the gratin from the oven, 
  sprinkle with the breadcrumb-nut mixture, and bake until the top is lightly 
  browned, 5 to 10 min. Let sit in a warm place for 20 min. before serving so 
  that liquids will set and tighten the gratin. Cut into 9 squares and serve.<br>
<br>

<font color="660000">Brown Sugar Squash Pie</font><br>
  This pie is a favorite of my pastry chef, Terri Horn. She likes to use the best 
  ingredients she can &#150; farm-fresh squash and high butterfat cream. She recommends 
  eating this pie within a day of making it as the custard filling makes the pie 
  soggy after that. Serves eight.<br>
<br>

FOR THE SQUASH PUR&Eacute;E:<br>
  2 to 2 &frac12; lb. Hubbard or butternut squash, to yield 2 cups pur&eacute;e<br>
  3 Tbs. unsalted butter, softened<br>
  2 Tbs. firmly packed dark brown sugar<br>
  3 Tbs. orange juice<br>
<br>

FOR THE CUSTARD:<br>
  &frac12; cup firmly packed dark brown sugar<br>
  3 large eggs<br>
  &frac12; cup heavy cream<br>
  &frac12; tsp. allspice<br>
  &frac12; tsp. ginger<br>
  &frac12; tsp. cinnamon<br>
  &frac12; tsp. salt<br>
<br>

FOR THE PIE:<br>
1 unbaked 9-inch p&acirc;te bris&eacute;e pie shell, chilled (see recipe)<br>
<br>
Pie leaves or other decorations, baked separately (optional)<br>
<br>
 To make the squash pur&eacute;e &#150; Follow the directions for the master 
  method for roasting squash, using the pur&eacute;e ingredients above. Put the 
  cooked and cooled squash in a food processor and pur&eacute;e until smooth. 
  For a very smooth consistency, put the pur&eacute;e through a food mill as well. 
  Measure out 2 cups.<br>
<br>
  To make the custard and bake the pie &#150; Set an oven rack on the lowest position 
  and heat the oven to 375&ordm;F. Combine the pur&eacute;e with the brown sugar, 
  eggs, cream, spices, and salt and whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture into 
  the pie shell and bake until the custard is puffed up but still has a small 
  wet spot in the middle, 50 to 60 min. Let cool a bit before serving. Garnish 
  with separately baked pie decorations if you like.<br>
<br>

<font color="660000">P&acirc;te Bris&eacute;e</font><br>
  Once the shell is made, it can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated up to 
  24 hours before filling and baking. This recipe makes more dough than you&#146;ll 
  need for the squash pie. Save the extra to use for pie decorations or a small 
  tart. Yields 17 &frac34; ounces.<br>
<br>

9 oz. (2 cups) all-purpose flour<br>
  &frac34; tsp. salt<br>
  &frac34; tsp. sugar<br>
  6 oz. (12 Tbs.) cold unsalted butter, cubed<br>
  &frac14; cup ice water<br>
<br>

 In a food processor, combine the flour, salt, and sugar and pulse once or 
  twice. Toss in the cubes of butter and coat lightly with the flour mixture. 
  Process just until the texture is pebbly. With the motor running, add the ice 
  water through the feed tube just until the dough begins to form a ball. Turn 
  the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape into a ball, kneading 
  once or twice if necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 
  at least 1 hour before rolling.<br>
<br>
  When the dough is chilled, reserve one-quarter of it for any decorations. Roll 
  the remaining three-quarters into a round between 1/8 and &frac14; inch thick. 
  Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate and crimp and shape the edges. Cover and chill 
  for at least 1 hour.<br>
<br>
  To make pie decorations - Roll the remaining pie dough &frac14; inch tick. Use 
  a small cookie cutter or a paring knife to cut out shapes. Set on a parchment-lined 
  baking sheet, sprinkle with sugar, and bake at 350&ordm;F until lightly browned, 
  about 12 min. Let cool.<br>
<br>

<B>Squash have different looks, different personalities</B><br>
 Over the years, I&#146;ve played around with many winter squash varieties. 
  Here&#146;s a list of favorites, based purely on flavor.<br>
<br>
  In my opinion, acorn squash is the best squash to just bake and eat; the flesh 
  is golden yellow, dry, and sweet, with a definable but pleasant texture. Butternut 
  squash is very versatile and easy to handle. Its orange flesh is thick, dry, 
  fine-grained, and sweet. Because of its density and ease of preparation, butternut 
  is the squash to use when you want to dice or slice or present squash in any 
  form other than a pur&eacute;e or a roasted chunk. Hubbard squash is often sold 
  in pieces because it can grow to cumbersome sizes. This popular New England 
  squash usually has a gorgeous, gray-blue shell, with a fine-grained flesh that&#146;s 
  dry, somewhat mealy, and very flavorful. It&#146;s perfect for pies. A current 
  favorite of mine is an heirloom squash called a cheese squash (or cheese pumpkin). 
  It resembles an old-fashioned flattened cheese box. It&#146;s a good-size squash 
  with tan skin, thick, deep-orange flesh, a coarse texture, and a really sweet 
  flavor. Sweet dumplings are tiny but great for roasting and presenting whole. 
  Sugar pumpkins are good for pies, too, as well as for canning since they have 
  a thick, fine-grained flesh.<br>
<br>
  Stay away from pumpkin pumpkins, whether they&#146;re the classic field type 
  or the original French variety. Carve them, but don&#146;t eat them: they&#146;re 
  tough and bland.<br>
<br>
  Experiment with any new varieties you come across. I love it when my purveyor, 
  Tuscarora Organic Coop in Pennsylvania, delivers a variety of new and interesting 
  winter squash to my door. I like to bake them all and compare them for flavor 
  and texture. You can do the same when serving a wedge of roasted squash as a 
  simple side to roast duck, turkey breast, or pork loin. Pick a few different 
  types at your local farmers&#146; market and see which one is indeed your favorite.<br>
