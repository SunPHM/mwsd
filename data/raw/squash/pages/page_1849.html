    <p><strong>Imagine Wearing a 60lb Wool Coat.</strong> <br /><br /></a><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/sheep.jpg"><br /><br />Has everyone read the story of <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/1069896.html">this poor sheep who just had 60 pounds of wool sheared off of him? </a><br /><br />Apparently he was roaming free in New Zealand and hadn't been shorn in six years. His wool is estimated to be enough for 20 men's suits.  Amazing. <br /><br />I was browsing on the internet earlier when the above photo caught my eye. Poor guy, he looks like a sheep that's about to combust!</p>

    <p><strong>Oh Happy Day!</strong><br /><br />I've been dancing around and grinning like a maniac all day because I finally had a phone call this morning from The Place Where I Would Love to Work.  I am trying not to get my hopes up too much but the Senior Recruiter called me this morning and went over my resume and background, asked me about my salary range, where I lived in relation to the office, and said that she would pass my information on to the hiring manager (the person for whom I left the World's Stupidest Voicemail) and I could possibly be called in for an interview.  I am praying, crossing fingers and toes and trying to think positively. Still, even if I don't get called for an interview, just getting the phone call this morning was a much-needed boost to my job-seeking self esteem. If one person called, why, that means other people should too, right? Right?!?<br /><br />So that was pretty much today in a nutshell, I spent the day happy and excited and trying not to obsess too much.  Trying. Very. Hard. <br /><br />Had a very good weekend, highlighted by Friday's karaoke outing with some girlfriends. We went to Val's, the little gay/redneck/karaoke bar that is quickly becoming my new favorite place. Who needs the good-looking midtown crowd and $8 cocktails when you can buy $2 beers and get up on stage to belt out Sister Sledge's "We Are Family" with the friendly group of local lesbians?  A good time was had by all. <br /><br />Even though I only had about three hours sleep the night before, I was happy to get up Saturday morning and go pick up Andrew, in from a weeklong business trip to Chicago.  We had breakfast at the <a href="http://www.flyingbiscuit.com/">best breakfast place in town</a>, then spend most of afternoon blissfully napping together. Sunday was all about yard work and making a giant mess in the kitchen preparing pan-seared tilapia with almond brown butter. (more like pan-seared tilapia with almond blackened butter. Oops.) <br /><br />So, a very good weekend and now this week is off to a most excellent start. If I get any happier I might explode. </p>

    <p><strong><br />Hypothetical Question. </strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/rsqp10.jpg"><br /><br />If, for instance,  you were going out tonight to a gay/redneck/karaoke bar, what would you sing?  The floor is open for suggestions. <br /><br />All I know is <a href="http://natrc.blogspot.com">Natalie</a> and I are not getting shanghaied into singing "YMCA" again.   Ever. </p>

    <p><strong>Back from my little jaunt to the mountains. </strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/photoS_golf.jpg"><br /><br />We had a great time, did a little hiking, watching a lot of movies, ate some great dinners and did bit of exercise. I took a Water Aerobics class for the first time and although I giggled through the whole thing it was a pretty good workout. I thought it would be a pool full of senior citizens bobbing up and down but this was much more intense. The H2O Aerobics instructor ran up and down the side of the pool, looking down at us in the water and yelling "Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick! Abdominals IN!  ARE YOUR ABDOMINALS IN?  IN IN IN IN IN! Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick! LEAP FROG LEAP FROG!" and so on and so forth for a whole hour. It was like water aerobics as led by Atilla the Hun. Everytime I caught Mom's eye I would start laughing again but it really was fun and good exercise.  I think my abs are a little sore from holding them IN IN IN IN IN!<br /><br />I got home from Big Canoe yesterday and now it's back to searching for new job postings, sending out resumes, and keeping my fingers crossed that something will hit soon. <br /><br />I was so tired of looking at my winter banner that I had yet to change so I did a quick little redesign last night. Probably not permanent but at least it's springtime on my blog now. <br /></p>

    <p><strong>The Vacation Continues..........</strong><br /><br />I'm off for a little mini-vacation, going up to my parents' place in the mountains. Three days of lounging around, reading, going hiking, swimming and hanging out with my mom. <br /><br />I realized last week that I've been jobless for a month now.  Yikes. However, it had gone by so fast, I can't believe it's been that long. And aside from not being able to spend money freely, it's been pretty fun.  Time feels like one long endless vacation but I know it will come to an end eventually and then it will be back to work. So I've resolved to just enjoy it while I have it. <br /><br />So, I'm off to enjoy it! <br /><br /></p>

    <p><strong>"HI! My name is...uh,...my name...oh @#*%!"</strong><br /><br />I just called and left the World's Stupidest Sounding Voicemail on a potential employer's machine. This is for the job where I know someone who knows someone who sent my resume to someone that knew someone else and anyway, I got the name of the hiring manager and have been trying to pysch myself up for about two weeks now to call him and check in.  The position is still posted on the company website and from my previous experience with the company I know that things can take awhile so I wanted to just, you know, check in and see if anything was going on.  <br /><br />I finally had everything I wanted to say all written out in script format, including options for if I got a live person or if I got voicemail and then when I actually called I choked at the last minute. <br /><br />The voicemail was supposed to go like this: <br /><br /><em>Hi, this is Mary Watkins and I'm calling in reference to the job posting for the Writer/Editor position.  I had been in touch with ____ ______ and she told me that she had passed my resume along to you. I had a couple of questions and wanted to see if I could get a few minutes of your time. If you could call me back I'd greatly appreciate it. My number is __ ___ ____. Thank you!" </em><br /><br />Instead the voicemail went something like: <br /><br /><em>"Um, HI! This is MARY WATKINS  (am doing that trick where you smile to sound happy on the phone but it worked too well) and um, I was calling about the posting, uh, the job posting for the Writer/Editor position?  I had been in touch with ___ _____ and uh, she said she was forwarding my resume onto to you.  Um. I had a few questions I wanted to ask, uh, and I wanted to see where you are in the hiring process....uh (pause while thinking) and if you could give me a call back that would be GREAT! (smile trick again). You can reach me at __ __ ____ and again my name is MARY WATKINS. Thanks and (and what?  why did I say "and"?!?!?) and....I hope to SPEAK WITH YOU SOON! OKAY. THANKS!"</em><br /><br />I hung up the phone and immediately pounded my forehead on the desk.  At least it's done and now all I have to do is wait for him to call back. <br /><br />Or not. </p>

    <p><strong>A Cheap Thrill. </strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/budget living.jpg"><br /><br />I was so very happy today when I opened up my new issue of <a href="http://www.budgetlivingmedia.com/index.php">Budget Living magazine </a>and discovered the BL people have books coming out! Joy! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0399529683/qid=1081885466/sr=8-13/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i13_xgl14/104-0489610-9677542?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Budget Living's Home Cheap Home </a>comes out next month and I can't wait to see it. I'm curious if it will just have projects that were featured in the magazine (which I already have filed away) or if it will include new ideas as well. Either way, pretty cool.  They also have a budget party guide coming out in October, sure to be awesome. <br /><br />Gosh. Can you tell how much I like this magazine? It really is the best. <br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p><strong>The Further Adventures of Squash Head Watkins. </strong><br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/cake.jpg"><br /><br /><br />I spent a good part of yesterday making my first "from scratch" cake.  I can now say I understand why cake mixes were invented. Actually, I really did enjoy the process, I love to cook and it was fun to make but talk about labor intensive. And messy. I think I used every bowl and spoon in our kitchen. <br /><br />I was having a few girlfriends for trash TV night and decided it would be fun to try my hand at the <a href="http://www.atlantahomesmag.com/article.cfm?article_ID=1779&mag_ID=2&section_ID=30">Very Good Chocolate Cake</a>, a favorite dessert from local restaurant Watershed.  Oh, it is a Very Good cake indeed. I had wanted to try the recipe for a while. <br /><br />The afternoon went something like this:  <br /><br />Go to the store for cake ingredients, which included things like 1 pound and 4 ounces chocolate, a stick of butter, 2 cups sugar, cake flour, super-strength coffee, a pint of heavy cream, a cup of sour cream, etc. Mmmmmm. Get excited thinking about the Very Goodness of the cake. <br /><br />Return Home. Proceed to "finely chop" 1 lb. and 4 oz of chocolate until hand starts cramping. Call Mom to complain about crampy hand and she says "Why didn't you just stick it in the Cuisinart? It would have taken about a minute."  Oh. Remember the cabinet-full of wedding gift appliances that I always seem to forget I have. Vow to use Cuisinart next time I have to decimate a pound and 4 ounces of chocolate. <br /><br />Hang up with Mom.  Immediately call back to ask how to sift flour since I have no sifter. Stir flour around in a bowl with other dry ingredients. Brew double-strength which is so strong it is a toxic substance. Pull out another bowl for coffee and one for chocolate. And then one for eggs and oil and sour cream. <br /><br />Call Mom back to ask how much flour I need to use to "flour the cake pans." Then butter and flour the pans. Mix everything all together. Call Mom again to ask why the batter looks so liquidy. <br /><br />Mom has now started answering the phone "Cake Hotline" instead of hello. We discuss the liquidy batter but come to no conclusions. I pour it in the cake pans and then "drop them on the counter once to remove air pockets." Neat. I am starting to feel rather like Nigella Lawson, a Domestic Goddess of sorts. <br /><br />Call Mom again to ask what temp I should cook them at because our oven is screwy and the settings seem to be off. Decide on temperature and set timer.  <br /><br />Look around kitchen and realize I have already messed up nearly every mixing bowl I have and I still have to make the frost. Clean up kitchen. <br /><br />Cakes come out smelling fantastic. I feel a swell of Nigella-esq pride at my cake pans. Set them on the counter to cool and call Mom (aka "Cake Hotline") to report status. <br /><br />Began making frosting by melting butter and cream. Add the one pound of finely chopped chocolate. Add sugar. Stir it around. Stick finger in the mixture and make a face. Ugh. It's not sweet at all. It tastes chalky. Something isn't right. Call Mom and say "Bleah. The frosting is off. Something isn't right." Go over recipe again, saying "Yes, it's the right amount of chocolate. Yes, one cup of cream. Yes, I wrote the recipe down correctly!"  Hmmmm....not sure why this is happening. Began adding sugar to the mix but it only gets grainy-looking and still tastes bad. <br /><br />Slap hand on forehead and realize I had used Unsweetened Baker's Chocolate when I was supposed to have used Semi-Sweet Baker's Chocolate. Arrrrrgggh! Stare at grainy-wrong-chocolate-bad tasting frosting and feel foolish. Begin to feel like Domestic Idiot, rather than Goddess. Call Cake Hotline to sheepishly report my error. <br /><br />Call husband to ask him to pick up Semi-Sweet Baker's Chocolate on his way home. When asked how everything is going reply "Oh, just fine! The cake is coming along greeeeat!" <br /><br />Wait for Semi-Sweet Baker's Chocolate to get home. Call Mom while cleaning up the mixing bowls and saucepans. <br /><br />Chocolate arrives home and immediately get tossed in the food processor. Wow. Mom was right, it takes just a few seconds to become finely-grated perfection. <br /><br />Start whole frosting-making process over again. Call Mom to report progress. Frosting mixture tastes much better this time. <br /><br />Take frosting off the stove, put in bowl to let cool and thicken one hour.  Cook dinner. <br /><br />One hour later, check in on frosting. It looks no different. It is like chocolate soup. Call Mom for advice. She is starting to sound weary.  She suggests putting the bowl in a bath of ice-cold water. Fill sink with cubes and water and let the frosting bowl float in it.  Go watch "The Bachelor" on TV. <br /><br />Periodically check on frosting which is getting marginally thicker but still not great. Realize that Mom and Dad have probably gone to bed by now and I can't call. <br /><br />Oh, good! "The Bachelor is a special two-hour episode!"  Continue to check on frosting, giving a stir now and then, things seem to be getting thicker.  "Bachelor" concludes and frosting is finally of perfect spreading consistency. It only took two hours longer than the recipe said it would but nevermind. Start smearing it on the cake. Cake looks Very Good indeed. <br /><br />Thursday morning. Get up and have a thin slice of cake for breakfast. It is all I wanted it to be. It is Very Very Good. Yes! I am Nigella after all!  Call Mom to report cake status. She sounds relieved. <br /><br />Later that night..... <br /><br />Nine girlfriends come over for TV and dessert. Serve cake along with a big dollop of whipped cream. Watch as the cake is scarfed down in less than five minutes.  Smile as friends compliment the cake. Think about telling everyone the Frosting Horror Story but decide it would un-Domestic Goddess like. <br /><br />And still later that night…….<br /><br />Try to decide if homemade cake is worth the effort and decide yes, but only if you're unemployed and your Mom is free to talk on the telephone all afternoon. <br /></p>

    <p><strong>Spaghetti Squash Head. </strong><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/dye job.jpg"><br />(A little Easter humor that my mom emailed me)<br /><br /><br />Here's a little non-secret about me: I highlight my hair. Not much, just very subtly. I've been doing it at home for about seven years with good results. I've had hairstylists tell me that it looks better than many professional jobs that they've seen. <br /><br />I've always used a particular kit that over the years has become harder and harder to find.  So this last time I decided to try a new kit. It was in the same product line and looked really similar so I thought "Hey, how different could it be?"  On the fated day I got out the kit, put the dumb-looking little cap on my head, poked a bunch of holes through the cap, pleaded for Andrew to help poke holes in the back of my head, mixed up the stinky highlight mixture, slopped it on my hair and set the time for 45, my usual time. <br /><br />45 minutes later the timer went off and Andrew walked into the room to help me. His face fell. "Baby! Oh! Oh no! Your hair is.....omigah....OMIGAH....your hair is BRIGHT YELLOW! Run! Run to the bathroom! WE'VE GOT TO RINSE IT OUT NOW!"  <br /><br />At first I thought Andrew was just pulling my leg but I still raced back to the bathroom and OMIGAH!  He was right!  The hair sticking out of the cap was bright yellow! <br /><br />(For reference, I thought it looked exactly like spaghetti squash.)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/spagsquash3.jpg"><br /><br />I jumped in the shower. I scrubbed. I cursed. Andrew paced around in the bathroom saying "Ohhhh no, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! (although he didn't do anything)  Don't worry sweetie, we'll get you to the salon to fix it. It'll be okay. Ohhhh no. (peeking into shower) Omigah, it is still BRIGHT yellow. Ohhh no....."  <br /><br />I combed it out, blowdried it.  Still yellow. Obvious roots. Obvious highlights. Not the natural look I have always gone for. <br /><br /><br />My normally looks like this: <br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/before.jpg"><br />(pic of me taken at Natalie's wedding a few weeks ago) <br /><br /><br />After the highlights, I thought it looked like this: <br /><br /><br /><img src="http://www.maryw.blogspot.com/after.jpg"><br />(pic of <a href="http://website.lineone.net/~a1/jocelyne/lepore/index.htm">Amanda Lepore</a>, likely not taken at a wedding)<br /><br /><br />Sigh. I wondered how we would afford the $200 or so it would cost to fix it at a salon. Oh well, no time to worry. I had a bridal shower to attend that night so I sucked it up, got dressed and tried not to look in a mirror for the rest of the afternoon. I tried on a few hats but nothing really worked.  I decided I wouldn't say anything to Natalie when she picked me up, just see if she said anything.  Nothing. I start thinking "Okay, maybe it doesn't look that bad."  Then I remembered that Natalie is an incredibly kind and supportive person, not someone who would say "Holy crap, what happened to your hair?!" <br /><br />We arrived at the party for Katie and Josh. Katie greeted us at the door and yelled "Mar, look at your hair! I love it! You look great!" I explained the mistake and lifted my hair up to show off my obvious roots and groaned about how bad it looked. All my girlfriends were super nice about the hair and kept telling me it looked good. <br /><br />I stared in the mirror when I got home and told myself, hey it doesn't look that bad. Maybe the roots are fabulous in a "Sarah Jessica Parker Obvious Roots" kind of way. Hmmmm....maybe not. I decided not to shell out for the salon visit right away and to give it a few days.  <br /><br />Either it looks slightly better or I've just gotten used to it. The highlights still look obvious and kind of fakey but they're not as yellow as the were before. I'm going to try to use some kind of semi-perm rinse on my hair to help even it out. (this is based on extensive internet research on "bad at-home highlights")<br /><br />For anyone who colors their hair at home - have you ever had a bad experience?  Turned yourself into a spaghetti squash head? Any haircolor horror stories would be strongly appreciated during this difficult time.....<br /></p>

    <p><strong>I'm A Detail-Oriented Self-Starter...... </strong><br /><br />Hmmm....it's been a week since I last blogged. Not good. It seems every time I sit down at the computer I get caught up with job searching and the next thing I know I've been on the computer for two hours and it's time to go start dinner. This is why housewives in the 1950s were so productive, no internet to distract them. <br /><br />No news really on the job front. I've been trying to just send my resume out for jobs/companies that I'm truly interested in, haven't gotten desperate enough yet to send the onslaught of resumes to anything and everything that's posted.  What's funny to me is that, for the first time, I actually feel very qualified for all the jobs I'm applying for. I think I should hear back from at least one of them, I guess it just takes time. <br /><br />There seems to be some good stuff out there, you just have to shuffle through all the crap jobs to find them. I'm amazed at all the job postings that start out like: <br /><br /><em>"Head Hurt from Hitting the Glass Ceiling?!?" <br /><br />"Top Gun Needed" <br /><br />"BORED? Train for a career in Marketing?" <br /><br />"Spinach Dip Stains? Be a Marketing Manager instead!" </em><br /><br />And so on and so forth. Who actually applies for these jobs? <br /><br />I get bummed out every time I check my email/voicemail and there are no new (job-related) messages. But then I also get excited when I see a posting for an awesome -sounding job and I send my resume off. Then I get bummed out again when I go to the grocery store or Target and I think about how I'm not making any money. <br /><br />But then I read my horoscope for the day and somehow everything seems like it will be alright. <br /><br /><em>Today you might find yourself worrying a little about all the money you've spent lately, Mary. Don't waste too much energy on this; funds will soon be flowing in again and you'll be able to live the way you normally do. You might also find yourself in a creative mood, feeling the strong urge to express your feelings in some way. Don't hesitate to reach out in a creative area that you've never explored before. Go for it! </em><br /><br />Obviously things are bound to start looking up.<br /></p>
