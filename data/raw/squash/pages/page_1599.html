      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> <b>WHAT HIT ONG BENG HEE?</b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smBengHeeRicketts430.jpg" width="300" height="338" align="right">Anthony 
        Ricketts served notice that he was ready to eat the world in one bite 
        last week when he beat Joe Kneipp in Pittsburgh. Kneipp said he'd never 
        seen Ricketts play so well and at such a high pace. Ricketts, ranked 18, 
        continued at the same supersonic speed today in causing the first upset 
        of the main draw by beating the seventh ranked Ong Beng Hee in three games.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> I would love to know what Ricketts 
        has for breakfast because I want some of that. He was as pumped up as 
        any player I've seen, thumping the ball with incredible power and competing 
        for every point as though his entire career depended on it. For the first 
        two games Ong played the same game and the sound of the ball cracking 
        off the front wall could be heard all over Grand Central Station. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">It was only when he was two games 
        down did Ong use his brain and start to slow the ball down. It had the 
        desired effect and they fought point for point until 14-all when Ricketts 
        called one point. It could have gone either way but it went with Ricketts 
        and he now has a very good chance of a quarter-final place - as well as 
        ensuring a spot in the Australian team for the Commonwealth Games. The 
        point should be made that even if Ong had won that third game, could he 
        have withstood the constant Ricketts barrage? I don't think so</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> <b>SHORT AND SWEET</b><br>
        Amr Shabana arrived in Grand Central Station intent on a short commuter 
        trip rather than a grand journey. Ranked 29 in the world, he was faced 
        with the world number nine Paul Price of Australia and from the start 
        felt he would win or lose by using his incredible range of shots. Shabana 
        is probably the best overhead-into-the-nick player on the circuit and 
        hits some jaw-dropping winners. Price is no slouch himself when it comes 
        to slotting the ball into the nick - he hits forehand straight nicks with 
        his eyes closed- so he knows what to expect. Shabana led at 10-8 and then 
        never got another point as the errors streamed from his racket to give 
        Price the first game. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The proposition in the next two games 
        was quite straightforward: either Shabana hit an outright winner or he 
        lost the point. That, more or less was the story except to say in the 
        third game, Shabana was either nursing a leg injury or was too stiff from 
        his qualifying matches. After losing the second 7-15, the third was over 
        in six minutes, 15-6 in Price's favor as Shabana could not wait to get 
        off the court after a match that lasted a mere 31 minutes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>THE ENGLISH PATIENCE</b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smTaylorWalker28.jpg" width="300" height="271" align="left">The 
        next match was everything squash should be with Chris Walker, at 34 the 
        grand old man of squash, Nick Taylor, also from England, demonstrating 
        beautifully what the word athleticism means. There was a time when two 
        English players got on court they could bore you to death rallying up 
        and down the left wall. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">These two players, Walker ranked 11 
        and Taylor ranked 26, were having none of that. They used the entire court, 
        especially the height. Regardless of how low Taylor's drops were, Walker 
        could get under them and send them soaring to the back of the court. While 
        neither of them could slam the ball into the nick, they could do almost 
        everything else with the ball - and most of the time in one of the four 
        corners. By rights Taylor, with the younger legs should have won this 
        match, but Walker has been around so long and he knows every trick in 
        the bookâ€¦some of them he even invented.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> There was much discussion with the 
        referee, who got flustered at one point after seeing a spectator moving 
        during a rally and requested that "participants remain seated during the 
        rallies." </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Walker sat on the floor within a nanosecond 
        of the announcement. Taylor won the first game 15-12, lost the second 
        16-17 and was 8-2 ahead in the third, the game almost in the bag. And 
        then some bad choices allowed Walker back in to take command and lead 
        13-9, a bad lapse on Taylor's part. Walker did not make the same mistake 
        and took the game 15-10 with the match now 64 minutes old. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">In the fourth Taylor finally put space 
        between him and Walker to lead 14-10. Walker still fought to get to 13-14, 
        but Taylor finally evened the match when he was awarded a stroke. The 
        fifth saw both players still jumping, leaping and darting around the court 
        as though they had just started and it was only at 8-8 that Taylor's fatigue 
        showed in the form of mental lapse and Walker went on to win 15-11 after 
        one hour and 44 minutes of superb gripping and entertaining squash. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>POWER IN CONTROL </b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smParkePower260.jpg" width="269" height="350" align="left">Simon 
        Parke has the ability to cause an upset, but his four months break from 
        the circuit because of ankle surgery is still evident in his game. Against 
        Jonathon Power he only found decent length in the third game, but by then 
        Power had run him ragged. At one stage the referee ordered Parke, who 
        was taking too long to receive service, to resume playing. For the first 
        two games Power had been in total control, hitting fine length and dropping 
        the ball low and tight, forcing Parke into constant movement, too hurried 
        to take that minute amount of extra time to hit length and put Power into 
        the back corners.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> Although he started to achieve this 
        in the third, he could still only manage nine points. He can console himself 
        somewhat with the thought that he kept Power on court for 50 minutes, 
        but for a player of Parke's calibre, that is small consolation. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>SMALL CUT - LONG BREAK </b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smKneippInjured222.jpg" width="232" height="300" align="right">David 
        Palmer's meeting with Joe Kneipp was just shaping up into a first class 
        battle when Kneipp ran into the butt of Palmer's racket and sustained 
        a small cut above the right eye. Rules are that a player must leave the 
        court and stop the bleeding before resuming play, being allowed as much 
        time as needed. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The call went out for the tournament 
        physician and nobody responded. (They still don't make house calls in 
        New York).A couple of plasters were applied and after about 20 minutes 
        the play resumed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> But the rhythm had been interrupted 
        and Kneipp never quite back into his groove of trying to exploit Palmer's 
        forehand. Palmer had started quickly and ran over Kneipp 15-5 in the first 
        game but then Kneipp got into his stride in the second and Palmer simply 
        did not know what to do to regain the initiative.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> There was definitely a plan by Kneipp 
        to keep the ball away from the Palmer backhand and it seemed to work. 
        These are two well matched players but Kneipp's ball control is quite 
        effortless and there were passages I'm sure when Palmer wondered what 
        he would have to do to get a point. Kneipp won the game 15-9 and an upset 
        became a distinct possibility.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> In the third the two players had 
        got to know each other's moves - which is a lot to know: there isn't a 
        lot that they can't do at any speed from any part of the court. Palmer, 
        ranked two in the world, has been playing at this level for a year or 
        two, while Kneipp is just on the way up again and had to qualify for the 
        main draw. Palmer kept up the pressure, Kneipp faltered a little and suddenly 
        it was 11-7 for Palmer which is when the injury occurred. After the 20 
        minute break, they continued but it was plain that Kneipp was losing ground 
        and Palmer took the game 15-10 to go 2-1 up.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> Kneipp did not give up in the fourth: 
        he simply could not maintain the pace that Palmer set and while there 
        were some wonderful rallies which displayed skill of the highest order, 
        it was always going to be Palmer who would go through to the second round. 
        He won the game 15-7 and it was obvious that his month off, due to fatigue, 
        was a very wise move. </font></p>

        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smBeachillElBorrossy72.jpg" width="215" height="300" align="left">Usually 
        it is the Egyptian making the winning shots and the Brit doing the chasing. 
        Lee Beachill reversed all that by outshooting Omar El Borolossy all over 
        the court to win the first game 15-8. In the second game, Borolossy started 
        shooting and suddenly Beachill was doing the chasing. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Beachill was to say later that he 
        had simply lost his length and gave his opponent to much room to use his 
        shots. Borolossy won the game 15-13 and I wondered whether Beachill could 
        get back into the match again. He won the first two points of the third 
        and then lost the next six as Borolossy read him like a book and picked 
        his points off as easy as picking apples from a tree. Beachill stopped 
        the rot and levelled at 7-all after which they took point for point all 
        the way to 13-all. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Beachill kept his head, got a stroke 
        to reach game ball 14-13, Borolossy lost his and hit the tin to lose the 
        game 13-15. Beachill seemed to be swinging between wonderful insight and 
        mindless hitting but at 7-7 in the fourth he got his sights and mind in 
        order and using his entire arsenal of shots and reading his opponent perfectly 
        went on to win the 61 minutes match by taking the final game 15-9. </font></p>
