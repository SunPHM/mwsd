		<h2 style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">by Alicia Sky 
		Varinaitis-Kunerth</font></h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><i>“You have a brain tumor.”</i></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">At age 30 and 
		eight months pregnant with my first child, it was the last thing I 
		expected to hear out of the doctor’s mouth. I had never been sick or 
		dizzy. Had never felt nauseous or woozy or had headaches. One day, 
		without explanation or forewarning, I began to have grand mal seizures. 
		Mark, my husband of two years, was the one who found me in our home 
		office, seizing. He called 911 and I was rushed to the emergency room. A 
		pregnancy condition called Eclampsia was first suspected, but after two 
		brain scans we were told that the cause of the seizures was a golf ball 
		sized tumor in my left frontal lobe. I remember thinking, “This isn’t 
		happening. This can’t be real.” </font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">I was 
		immediately admitted into the High Risk Pregnancy Ward at Encino-Tarzana 
		Hospital, where I stayed for six weeks until the birth of our beautiful 
		daughter, Ashlyn Pearl. Seven days later, having recovered enough from 
		the c-section delivery, I was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Hospital for 
		brain surgery. A wonderful surgeon, Dr. Keith Black, did an amazing job 
		removing the tumor. Afterwards, he told my husband that surgery had gone 
		“very well” and that he was confident he had “gotten everything he could 
		see.” </font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">One week later, 
		Mark and I were in Dr. Black’s office to review the tumor’s biopsy 
		results. With hopes of “please let it be nothing” floating around in our 
		heads, we were floored by the results. The tumor was classified as a 
		Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme. The doctor’s exact words were, “These 
		types of tumors are incurable…” My first thought was, “I won’t see my 
		daughter take her first steps.” Sorrow, grief, heartbreak, despair – 
		it’s hard to accurately describe what we were feeling. To their ultimate 
		credit, the doctors handling my case were always extremely positive and 
		quick to remind us that although the tumor wasn’t curable, it was highly 
		treatable. I was young, in good health and a woman – three factors that 
		put me way ahead of the norm in terms of life expectancy. The ordered 
		course of treatment: Seven weeks of daily radiation done concurrently 
		with monthly oral chemotherapy. </font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">Even though I 
		knew that the radiation and chemotherapy would be hard, I was extremely 
		surprised at how much the treatments drained me. The medications I was 
		taking made it unsafe to nurse my daughter and they also made me too 
		tired to stay awake through a single bottle-feeding. I was spending most 
		of my days knocked out in bed just trying to keep down chicken broth and 
		crackers. And, due to the intense radiation treatments, I was losing my 
		hair. I still remember the day I was in the shower and chunks of my hair 
		just began falling out. I didn’t even have to pull. That was the day it 
		hit me, “I’m truly sick.” I was weak, exhausted and overcome by 
		depression. Despite all the books I read about positive mind over 
		matter, I couldn’t find the energy or the will to even begin to battle 
		the cancer. The “Western Medicine” approach to my disease was slowly 
		obliterating my life. It would take something powerful to turn my life 
		around. That was when a friend told me about the Tao of Wellness.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">My friend was 
		being treated by Dr. Mao for an especially severe case of lymphoma. I 
		will readily admit I was a skeptic of Eastern medicine, including 
		acupuncture. I didn’t see how small pins poked into the skin could 
		amount to anything substantial. So, I don’t know exactly what it was – 
		perhaps my friend’s copious enthusiasm or perhaps I was just too tired 
		to protest – but I am so enormously grateful I agreed to meet with Dr. 
		Mao.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">The Dr. 
		Mao-prescribed combination of healthy diet, herbs and acupuncture helped 
		tremendously (and immediately) with my never-ending fatigue and nausea. 
		I was able to keep food down, which meant I started to gain weight, 
		which in turn helped me to grow physically and emotionally stronger. I 
		learned to meditate, which cleared my mind for powerful healing 
		suggestions. I found I was no longer held hostage by the fear of dying. 
		I couldn’t necessarily quantify my positive reaction to the treatment in 
		physical, easy to see terms, but I felt better on the inside. And that 
		made all the difference in the world.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">About three 
		months after I started with Dr. Mao, I had a follow-up exam with my 
		radiation oncologist. I thought that after the radiation treatments were 
		complete, my hair would return. The hair not affected by the treatments 
		had started to grow, but I still had a very large, noticeable bald spot 
		on the left side of my head. It was funny how much I resembled my infant 
		daughter – both of us had a ring of hair around the base of our skull, 
		but the top of our heads was smooth. During the exam, I asked when I 
		should expect my hair to return. She paused, I think cautious of my 
		fragile emotional state, and said gently, “The radiation levels your 
		tumor required were very intense. The hair follicles in that area are 
		most likely destroyed.” </font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">Looking back, I 
		should have hit my knees in thankfulness for the technology that could 
		burn away any remnants of cancer cells that surgery had left behind, but 
		in truth I was devastated. It’s hard to gauge the progress of your 
		healing unless you can look at yourself and see actual positive changes. 
		Without my hair, I looked sick. Since I looked sick, I felt sick. My 
		doctor was saying my hair would never grow back. Who was I to dispute 
		her educated assessment?</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">Later that day, 
		Dr. Mao walked into the treatment room to find me sitting on his table, 
		weeping. I could barely speak, I was crying so hard. Upon hearing what 
		my doctor had told me he said, “You must never listen to doctors – not 
		even me. Every single person is different. No one can tell you what your 
		body will and will not do.” He then brought in a small bottle of herbal 
		liquid and told me, “Scrub this on your head with a toothbrush twice a 
		day. It will make your hair sprout.” I took the liquid home and did what 
		Dr. Mao had told me to do. About three weeks later I couldn’t believe my 
		eyes. There were actual “sprouts.” My hair was growing back! About six 
		months later I returned to the oncologist that had deemed my head a 
		barren wasteland and she was stunned. She even wondered out loud 
		(jokingly, let’s hope) if she had administered the correct dosage of 
		radiation. Six months after that I had my first real full-head-of-hair 
		haircut. That was a great day.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">Dr. Mao’s 
		advice not to take everything a doctor says to heart was profound. And I 
		truly believe the brown herbal formula he prescribed regenerated my hair 
		follicles. But it was a simple story he told that day that gave me the 
		inspiration to start reliving my life. He told me to be happy because I 
		looked like a Buddhist monk. I wasn’t in a place where I could joke 
		about my baldness, but Dr. Mao insisted he wasn’t teasing. He asked, “Do 
		you know why Buddhist monks shave the top of their heads?” I did not. He 
		told me, “It makes them closer to God.”</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><i>Closer to God.</i></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">That was what I 
		had come to Dr. Mao to hear. Instantly, all my sadness and fear about 
		being bald for the rest of my life melted away. It was what I had been 
		praying for all along. I needed to hear that God was by my side, 
		battling my disease with me. I accepted, truly for the first time, God’s 
		will instead of my own.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px" align="left"><font size="2">In July of this 
		year, I will be two years cancer free. I believe I am cured. If ever an 
		MRI shows any tumor regrowth, I feel confident I will beat it. And if I 
		don’t and it is my turn to pass from this life, I will not fear the 
		unknown. I will embrace it. Thanks, in large part, to Dr. Mao.</font><p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">

		<h2><font size="5"><a name="2">Avoiding Environmental Toxins</a></font></h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<b>
		<font size="2">By Heather Schiffke</font></b></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Many of us are concerned about the adverse health effects 
		of environmental pollutants such as agricultural pesticides and 
		industrial chemicals. In recent years, there have been bans on certain 
		chemicals, as well as ongoing research into the effects of others. The 
		federal government took a major step when they implemented national 
		standards for organic produce in October 2002.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">While the specific health effects of most pesticides and 
		environmental toxins have not yet been established, the research to date 
		indicates that low dose exposure to industrial chemicals and pesticides 
		does present a significant risk to human health. </font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Endocrine and nervous system disorders, as well as many 
		cancers, are just some of the health problems that have been linked to 
		long term, low dose chemical exposure.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">The idea that organic produce is healthier than produce 
		grown with agricultural chemicals has mostly been based on the absence 
		of environmental toxins rather than a higher nutritional profile. But 
		could organic produce also have additional health benefits that produce 
		grown with pesticides is missing? According to UC Berkeley, a recent 
		study found organic fruits and vegetables to have more phytochemicals 
		than conventionally grown produce (produce grown using pesticides.) 
		Phytochemicals are naturally occurring plant chemicals that have 
		numerous health benefits. One theory behind this interesting discovery 
		is that phytochemicals act as the plant’s natural pesticides. When 
		synthetic pesticides are used, the plant has less need to produce its 
		own defenses and thus produces less phytochemicals.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">In a perfect world we would eat only organically grown 
		foods with their abundance of healthy phytochemicals and absence of 
		toxic residues. Unfortunately, it may not always be possible to choose 
		organic produce. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit 
		environmental research organization, has developed the “Shopper’s Guide 
		to Pesticides in Produce.” This is a handy guide to which produce items 
		are highest and lowest in pesticides, so that if you are unable to buy 
		organic, you can at least make informed decisions about the 
		conventionally grown produce that you consume. For more information

		<font size="2">In addition to awareness of chemicals in your produce, 
		there are many other simple steps you can take to avoid exposure to <br>
		environmental toxins:</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Reduce your consumption of processed foods. Processed 
		foods usually contain additives and preservatives as well as being lower 
		in nutrients than their whole food counterparts.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Reduce your consumption of meats and high fat dairy 
		products. Because toxins accumulate as you go up the food chain, 
		replacing meat and animal products with whole grains, beans, soy 
		products, fruits and vegetables will also reduce your exposure to 
		environmental toxins. This is not to say that you need to follow a 
		vegetarian diet, but consider reducing your overall intake of animal 
		products.<br>
		<br>
		Microwave your food in glass or ceramic containers rather than plastic 
		to avoid leeching of chemicals into the food.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Reduce the number of household cleaning products that you 
		use. Look for the biodegradable alternatives widely available in health 
		food stores. Use non-toxic cleaning products, such as baking soda, that 
		are already in your home. Many companies that sell 
		environmentally-friendly cleaning products have great cleaning tips on 
		their websites.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Reduce the number of personal care products and cosmetics 
		that you use. These products may contain harmful chemicals. You can also 
		look for products that contain non-toxic alternatives. However, be aware 
		that the term “organic” is not regulated on non-food items and “natural” 
		doesn’t always indicate a better product. Read the labels and see how 
		many ingredients you recognize. </font></p>

		<font size="2">By</font></b> <font size="2"><b>Dr. Xiaomei Cai</b></font></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">We have all experienced some physical accidents in our 
		kitchen, which need immediate assistance. Sometimes we have to suffer 
		from them because we have very little self-rescue training ideas that 
		can prevent injuries from worsening or help them heal faster. The 
		following are some home remedy secrets I want to share with you.</font></p>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Burns</font></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">For minor burns, I suggest applying a few drops of sesame 
		oil to the affected area, sprinkling some salt on top of the oil. Leave 
		it on for a few minutes. If you still experience a burning sensation, 
		re-apply oil and salt mixture to the burn. This mixture stops the 
		burning pain and helps decrease swelling to prevent blistering from 
		occurring. For large, severe burns go to the emergency room.</font></p>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Food Poisoning</font></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Some food poisoning symptoms include nausea and vomiting. 
		Mung Beans are very helpful in alleviating these symptoms. Cook 1 cup of 
		mung beans in 6 cups of water for 30 minutes or grind 1/4 cup of mung 
		beans and stir into 2-3 cups of distilled water then strain the tea and 
		drink several times a day. If you have stomach pain or cramps, cook 10 
		slices of ginger root in 2 cups of water for 5 minutes <br>
		then drink it all.</font></p>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Common Cold</font></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">When you are exposed to a very cold environment or feel 
		chills, to prevent from coming down with a cold, cook 5 slices of ginger 
		and 2 whole, uncut stalks of green onions in 2 cups of water. Cover the 
		pot and cook for 5 minutes on a medium flame. Drink tea hot and if 
		possible, take a nap afterwards. Slight perspiration should be expected 
		to disperse the cold.</font></p>
		<h3 style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Chronic Diarrhea for Children</font></h3>
		<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px" align="left">
		<font size="2">Since adults bodies are much more complex than children, 
		the following remedy is most effective for children. Simply stir fry 1 
		cup of dry, white rice in a skillet, stirring constantly until golden 
		brown then add 6 cups of water and simmer for 30-40 minutes on low heat. 
		Have children eat a small bowl of porridge daily for 2-3 days. For 
		younger children, feed them the broth portion of this porridge only.</font></p>
