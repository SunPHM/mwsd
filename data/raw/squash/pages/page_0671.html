Viruses cause mosaic patterns (light green, dark green) in leaves, puckering, 
leaf distortion, stunting, shortened internodes and misshapened fruit. <A HREF="Images/cant6.jpeg">See 
symptoms on yellow squash.</A> Infected yellow squash and pumpkin produce fruit 
with green blotches of varying degrees. It is impossible to diagnose specific 
viruses based on symptoms. Often two or more viruses are detected in a single 
plant. Cucurbit viruses generally overwinter in weed hosts. Avoid late season 
planting and control weeds around fields. Insect control has not proven effective. 
Development of resistant varieties using biotechnology techniques is underway.
