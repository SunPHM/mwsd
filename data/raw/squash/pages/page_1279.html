<p align="center"><strong>Cabbage Moth - <img src="../images/cabbmoth.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="73" HEIGHT="59"></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><strong>As larva these guys do severe damage. They attack all members of
  the cabbage family as well as lettuce. The brownish cabbage looper moths lay pale green
  eggs on the topsides of leaves in the evening. Mature imported cabbageworms are white
  butterflies that are frequently seen around cabbage in the daytime. The female attach
  yellow bullet-shaped eggs to undersides of leaves. Cabbageworms may be present from early
  spring until late fall in the northern U.S. worms spend the winter as pupae attached to a
  plant or nearby object. </strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Control the worms with a powder like Sevin, by Ortho.
  Insecticidal soap, BT, and any insecticide with diazinon or pyrethrins are also effective.
  Adult mothes do little damage except lay eggs for next generation.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Leaf Hopper </strong>- <img src="../images/leafhopr.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="58"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><strong>Leafhoppers feed on many vegetables and small fruits. They
  generally feed on the undersides of leaves, sucking the sap, which causes stippling.
  Severely infested vegetables will become weak and will not produce fruit. Leafhoppers at
  all stages of maturity are active during the growing season. They hatch in the spring from
  eggs laid on perennial weeds and ornamental plants. Even areas where the winters are so
  cold that the eggs cannot survive are not freee from infestation because leafhoppers can
  migrate long distances in the spring. </strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Destroy nearby weeds, especially thistle and dandelions that may
  harbor leafhopper eggs. Use an insecticide with diazinon or pyrethrins. </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong>Hornworm - <img src="../images/hornworm.jpg" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="62"></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><strong>Hornworms feed on many vegetable plants such as eggplant, pepper
  and tomatos. Each worm can eat an enormous quantities of foliage. The adult hornworm moth
  is a large grey or brown creature with yellow or white markings that emerges from
  hibernation in late spring and feeds on nectar from annual flowers. The worms hatch from
  eggs laid on the undersides of leaves, and these young feed for three to four weeks. Then
  they crawl into the soil to repeat the cycle. There is usually only one generation in the
  northern U.S. and up to four generations inthe southern U.S.. </strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Some hornworms have white sacs on their backs. This is a
  parasite wasp egg sac. The wasp enters the worms body and feed off the internal organs. Do
  not remove or treat hornworms with this white sac. The beneficial wasp will multiply and
  kill off other hornworms safely and naturally.</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Like all soft bodied pest a powder usually does the trick. Use
  an insecticide like Sevin or anything that contains carbaryl or pyrethrins. BT is also an
  effective control. BT, <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> is a biological, living organism
  that feeds off of pests.</strong></p>

Slugs <img src="../images/slug.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="98"></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><strong>These pests are mollusks and are related to clams, oysters, and
  other shellfish. They feed on a wide variety of plants, including ornamentals and
  vegetables. Like other mollusks, snails and slugs need to be moist all the time. for this
  reason they avoid the sun and dry places and hide during the day in damp places such as
  under flowerpots or thick ground cover and mulch. They emerge at night or rainy days to
  feed. The one big difference between these pests is the snail has a shell to withdraw to
  for protection. Females slugs lay their eggs on the undrsides of leaves, while the snail
  buries them in soil or mulch. Both produce a slimy mass for the eggs to develop in. The
  young are smaller versions of the parents. I would recommend beer traps, or egg shells.
  Sink bowls of beer into the soil over night and the slugs will be attracted to them. Or
  use clean eggshell fragments around the bottom of plants. The shells act as shards of
  glass that errate the soft bodies of the slug.</strong></p>

      <p align="center"><strong>Cutworm - <img src="../images/cutworm.jpg" align="absmiddle" width="161" height="95"></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><strong>Several species of cutworm attack plants in the vegetable garde.
  Surface feeding cutworms are common pests of young vegetables planted early in the season.
  A single surface-feeding cutworm can sever the stems of many young plants in one night;
  eating the stem just above the ground. Tomato, peppers, pea, and bean plants and members
  of the cabbage family are susceptible. Some cutworms can climb up the stems or trunks of
  grapevines and blueberry, bramble, tomato, and other garden plants to feed on young
  leaves, buds and fruits. Cutworms hide in the soil during the day and come out to feed
  after sunset. Adult cutworms are dark, night-flying moths with bands or stripes on their
  forewings.</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Control with Sevin, diazinon, chlorpyrifos or methoxychlorMake
  collars around the base of plants made from aluminum cans, milk cartons, aluminum foil or
  the like to prevent pests from getting on plant. Like all large soft-bodied worms they can
  be physically picked off the plant and discarded</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Leaf Miner Damage</strong> - <img src="../images/leafminr.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="52" HEIGHT="58"> Tomato Leaf</p>

<p align="center"><strong>These insect pests belong to the family of leaf mining flies.
The tiny black and yellow adult females lay eggs on the underside of leaves or inside
leaves. the maggots that hatch from these eggs tunnel between the leaf surfaces feeding on
internal tissues. The white tunnels in the leaves are called mines. Damaged leaves are no
longer edible. Fruit is usually not effected but multiple generations can reduce yield. </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>When the egg clusters are first seen under the leaves, control
with an insecticide with malathion or diazinon. Repeat applications are usually necessary.
A good fall clean-up will reduce overwintering of eggs.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Grasshoppers attack a wide variety of plants. They eat leaves
and occasionally fruits, migrating as they deplete their food sources. In vegetable
gardens, they are most numerous in the sections that are close to weedy areas. In late
summer, adult female grasshoppers lay their eggs in pods in the soil. The adults continue
to feeding until cold weather kills them. The eggs hatch the following spring. Grasshopper
infestations are most severe during hot dry weather. The insects migrate into green
gardens and yards as surrounding areas dry up in summer heat. Periods of cool, wet weather
help keep these insect populations under control.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Use diazinon or Sevin at first sign of insects.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Flea Beetle </strong>- <img src="../images/fleabetl.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="107"></p>

<p align="center"><strong>These beetles jump like fleas but are not related to them. Both
adult and immature flea beetles feed on a wide variety of garden vegetable and berry
plants. Immature beetles, legless gray grubs, injure plants by feeding on the roots and
undersides of leaves. Adults chew holes in leaves. flea beetles are most damaging to
seedlings and young plants. Seedlings <font size="3">that are chewed are susceptible to
desiccation. Adults survive the winter in the soil or in garden debris. They emerge in
early spring to feed on weeds until vegetables sprout or plants are set in the garden.
Grubs hatch from eggs laid in the soil, and these pests feed for two to three weeks. After
pupating in the soil, they emerge as adults to repeat the cycle. There are one to four
generations each year. Adults may feed for up to two months.</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong>Control with an insecticide containing carbaryl,
diazinon, or pyrethrins. A good fall clean-up will prevent over-wintering of adults. Keep
a close eye on new growth for damage.</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Corn Earworm - <img src="../images/cornworm.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="71"></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>For the corn farmers out there, you already know about these
guys, but for the home gardener watch out for these guys. These worms are the most serious
pests of corn. The insects attack many other garden vegetables and flowers as well and are
also known as tomato fruitworms or cotton bollworms. Corn earworms are the larvae of light
gray-brown moths with dark lines on their wings. In the spring, female moths lay yellow
eggs sigly on corn silks and undersides of leaves. The worms that hatch from these eggs
feed on the new leaves in the whorls. This feeding doesn't reduce the corn yield, but the
leaves that develop are ragged and the plant may be stunted. More serious damage is caused
when the worms feed on the silks, causing poor pollination, and when they feed on the
developing kernels. Worms enter the ear at the silk end, or they may bore through the
husk. there are several generations a year. In the southern United States, wheere these
pests survive the winter, early and late plantings suffer the most damage. Adult moths
migrate into northern areas, where late plantings are severely damaged. Undamaged parts of
infested ears are edible.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Once the worms are in the ears, insecticides are ineffective.
Treat plants with SEVIN or any inseticide with carbaryl if any worms are visible on the
plant.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Cucumber Beetle - </strong><img src="../images/cucbetl.jpg" align="absmiddle" WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="117"></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Cucumber beetles, both dtriped and spotted are common pests of
cucumbers, melons, squash, nd pumpkins. Controlling these beetles is important because
they carry two serious diseases that damage and may kill cucurbits: mosaic virus and
bacterial wilt. Adult beetles survive the winter in plant debris and weeds. They emerge in
the early spring and feed on a variety of plants. As soon as cucurbits are planted in the
garden, the beetles attack the leaves and stems and may totally destroy the plants. Mature
females lay their yellow-orange eggs in the soil at the base of plants. The grubs that
hatch from these eggs eat the roots and stems below the soil line, causing stunting,
wilting, or premature death. The slender white grubs feed for several weeks, pupate in the
soil, emerge as adults to repeat the cycle.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Control with Sevin, diazinon, or pyrethrins.</strong></p>
