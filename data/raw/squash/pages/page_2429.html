<P>We go to our home in Glencoe at the weekends. We have 3 children aged 4 years (Mauragh), 7 (Kennagh) and 10 (Jamie) and love to travel. We like to stay
in comfortable apartments or homes with plenty of space and home comforts. Here
in Scotland our hobbies are good food, wine and walking, biking and sailing. Jim
likes to play squash. The kids just like being with us. We also like to ski but
rarely do that in Scotland although it is possible.

<P>"Crioch" is a modern
11-year-old home. It is situated at the end of a private road in a very quiet bay
in the small village of Duror. The house has three double bedrooms, a lounge,
big dining/kitchen and 2 bathrooms. It also has a beautiful "sun" room which is
an integral part of the house. This room is wonderful spot for evening dining or
morning coffee. There is a largish garden, with a small burn running through and
it backs on to the hillside so you can walk up the hill from there.

<P>To the front there are a couple of fields and then a beach on Loch Linnhe
with an island in front which has a large family of Canada Geese. The house has
a dishwasher, washer, dryer, microwave, double oven and gas cooker, central
heating, and TV/video and hardwood floors downstairs. There is also a fire which
burns wood. The lounge has a bed settee which sleeps two and we have a cot
(crib) big enough for a two year old.
<P>We have a small sailing dinghy, a dory, a windsurfer and several bikes in the
garage. We have two cars and one could be part of the exchange.
Local neighbours would help with horse riding, shooting and fishing(sea and
loch). Mountain guides are available for Glencoe and Nevis range.

<H3>The Village - Duror, Glencoe</h3>
<UL>
  <LI>Glencoe 10 minutes
  <LI>Fort William 30 minutes
  <LI>Oban 35 minutes
  <LI>Glasgow 2 hours 10 minutes
  <LI>Stirling 2 hours
  </ul>

<P>The village of Duror is small but has an active local community with a lot of
activities at the village hall. There are other kids in the area and a small
hotel/pub. The village is about 10 minutes from Glencoe which is one of the most
famous glens in Scotland - it is where the Campbells massacred the MacDonalds.
However, it is extremely beautiful with fabulous walks and climbs. Loch Linnhe
is a long sea-loch which goes up from Oban and Mull to Fort William at the top.
There are many lovely islands on it and we are perfectly situated to travel to
many of the Hebridean islands, possible from Duror with ferries from Oban. Fort
William is near Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Britain and again there are
some lovely walks in this area. Larger boats can be hired, and it is possible to
sail in Loch Linnhe or down to Mull and beyond. Both Oban and Fort William have
sport centres.

<P>The area is also famous for good food with several hotels nearby which are
featured in <I>A Taste of Scotland</i>. However if you want to try local seafood
at home we have a friend who can get you mussels, scallops and prawns fresh from
the Loch.

<P>There is a bus service to <B>Fort William</b> and <B>Oban</b> but we feel a
car is essential. Fort William and Oban have good supermarkets. The local shop
is open at variable times but will get Sunday papers if you order them.


<P><B>Glasgow</b> is only 2 hours 10 minutes away and has a lot of attractions.
It is the home of the Burrell Collection and museum, Art Galleries, Transport
Museum and several Rennie Mackintosh buildings and collections. It has great
shopping and a good public transport system; it is best to park on the outskirts
and take the train or underground into town.

<P><B>Stirling</b> is also a lovely town with its Castle and Wallace monument
and the scene of the famous Bannockburn Battle. It is also regarded as the
gateway to the Trossachs, another lovely area.

<P><B>Glasgow Airpor</b>t is the nearest airport with 10 flights daily from
London, and also transatlantic and European flights. It is on the outskirts of
the city and travel to "Crioch" from there avoids the city centre.

<H3>Car Swap - Special Equipment </h3>
<P>We would be happy to swap our car if it is a simultaneous swap. 
Due to the age of our kids we have cots, travel cots, pushchairs
etc and toys which can be used by visitors.
