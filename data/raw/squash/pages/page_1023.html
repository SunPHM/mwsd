then i was in a room full of people standing in many clouds of weed smoke and a stoned dog furiously walking around the room dying to get out as soon as someone would open the door.<br><br>
armed with only a plastic cup and my charming nature, i was able to scope out some nice booty. *wink*<br><br>

<div style="clear:both;"></div><b>yes, you too can pull a nate.</b><br>
although it really means nothing at all, it's still nice to know my name is still getting used around red robin. i just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/jessiekika">jessica's</a> blog and i laughed at the way marcus told liz to "pull a nate" and get out of there. <br><br>
famous? more like infamous.<br><br>
let me tell you about my day yesterday, which was fun fun fun. first off, it was the niners on monday night! in my lifetime, i've never seen a monday night football game involving the niners, and to make it even better the game was a mile away from me over at the stick. and also there was a buzz around the city. everyone at school was pumped up, people with signs around the city reading "I NEED TICKETS". the funniest one i saw was a man standing by my house with a sign that said "I NEED TICKETS", then when i came back from playing tennis, i saw the same guy with tickets in his hand and with a sign that said "TICKETS FOR SALE". hahaha. only in san francisco. <br><br>
and then i get this phone call from someone i haven't spoken to in a month or so. let's call this person "spontaneous" since the call was flat out spontaneous. anyways, "spontaneous" and i got to catch up on things and even took shots at each other, mostly regarding the past. which is always fun, because "spontaneous" and i will never get over the past. "spontaneous" and i need to go out to lunch or share some kind of activity so we can both live long and happy lives. *wink*<br><br>
let's back track to tennis. freddie shook me with his andre agassi like serve. no joke. i tried to return it on the backhand, but i ended up rolling on my ankle. then i limped around like a fool while freddie chuckled. <br><br>
i'm gonna stuff chicken skins in his hat. payback's a bitch.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>if my blog extended back to the days when i attended gilroy high school, you'd be reading about a lot of "first time" experiences (first time smoking pot, first time getting drunk off my ass, first time i learned how to talk shit to people's faces, etc) which can all be linked to one person. <br><br>
elizabeth lopez.<br><br>
it's safe to say, liz is the worst influence ever in my life. and i don't mean that in a bad way. i'm pretty glad she introduced me to those kinda things or else i would have been bored as hell living in gilroy, california. so i owe it to her. liz, you are the best. let's blaze and go swimming in josh's pool again.<br><br>
today, she flew in from canada and i was the first one in three years to greet her. what a title to have. *takes bow* we hung out at panda express and pretty much caught up with current events and "where are they now?" conversations. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jon_ikan">ikan</a> and eldridge met up with us and we all blazed at the view. ah, being high with liz really brings me back. she's one of the most fun people to be around while high. and on top of all that, the sun was shining beautifully in san jose today. unlike cold, ugly san francisco. <br><br>

windows? i'm in my car!<br><br>
i shot up and wrestled the blanket in a panic. my keys were hanging from my rear view mirror. i had to pee, but that wasn't a concern now. i opened the door to a gloomy morning. i was in <a href="http://www.xanga.com/belly78">joel's</a> neighborhood.<br><br>
i closed the door, sat back and hid under my thin pink blanket.<br><br>

<b>fill me in on last night?</b><br>
i can only tell you what i have heard, not by what i have seen simply because i have no recollection of it. i only have stories from <a href="http://www.dauzmedia.com/blogger">mike,</a> <a href="http://www.xanga.com/belly78">joel,</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jon_ikan">ikan</a>, <a href="http://len-len.cjb.net">marlene</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/jessiekika">jessica.</a> oh yeah, and my favorite white buttondown shirt to be stained with mud. that's when the memory hit me like POW! "why is my shirt covered in mud? ohhh....." yes, i passed out on trini's front lawn. a wet front lawn. oy. then the rest was a story left to be told back to me. in addition to passing out on the front lawn, i smoked out, been schlepped on joel's back, threw up in the middle of the street, been slapped upside the head and almost suffocated. some would call that a brush with death. i call it saturday night. *wink*<br><br>
anyways, with all of the babysitting aside, last night was a damn good time. <a href="http://sioreemode.blogspot.com">sioreemode</a> is still grindin'.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br>

no hard feelings.<br><br>
i've counted. we have 26 days left in the semester. and i'm not really excited because school is going really good for me, but i guess christmas time will be a lot of fun. this week has been really good. i've been waking up on time, kicking ass in the garde manger station in school and i'm coming along well with the movie making. hopefully this feeling will carry me through the next few weeks.<br><br>

although there was a total of about 20 people at the club (including us), we still managed to make it an alright night for us, partly because we were all dressed up, but mostly because i got to stare at trini all night. ooooh wee. we even ran into <a href="http://www.xanga.com/ckrissc">krissie</a> which was nice because i haven't seen her in so long. we went to <a href="http://www.dauzmedia.com/blogger">mike's</a> afterwards and there was throw up all in the lobby and in the elevators. the smell alone almost made me want to throw up. we hung out and smoked the rest of the night and i crashed at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/belly78">joel's</a> house afterwards. the end.
