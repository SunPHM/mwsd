<blockquote><u><font size=+1>Asexual Reproduction</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>Under favorable conditions, conidia are usually produced
within several days after initial host infection. The somatic hyphae produce
many long hyline conidiophores that produce conidia either singularly or
in long chains, depending upon the species of fungus. Conidia will continue
to be produced as long as environmental and host conditions are favorable.
The conidia are one celled, hyaline, and generally oval in shape. This
asexual stage of the powdery mildew fungus is recognized as the form-genus
O<i>idium</i>.</font>

</blockquote>
<u><font size=+1>Sexual Reproduction</font></u>
<p><font size=+1>When production of conidia begins to decrease and eventually
stop, generally during late summer or as the weather turns cooler, the
fungus begins to produce cleistothecia. These fruiting bodies first appear
white, turning yellow, orange, brown, and eventually black as they mature.
The fruiting bodies of <i>Erysiphales</i> are called cleistothecia and
not perithecia (even though they are in the class <i>Pyrenomycetes - </i>the
perithecial fungi) because they are completely enclosed ascocarps with
no ostiole.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Depending upon the species of <i>Erysiphaceae, </i>the
fungus can be homothallic or heterothallic. For sexual reproduction to
occur, the antheridium (male) and ascogonium (female) come in contact,
pressed together, and the antheridial nucleus is transferred to the ascogonium
and karyogamy takes place. A cleistothecium is eventually formed as a result
of this process. Cleistothecia are formed on the surface of the plant tissue
in or on the plant mycelium. They develop throughout the fall and are mature
by spring. In the spring or when conditions are favorable, the cleistothecia
absorb water and rupture expelling their contents (one or more asci). The
asci bursts open and discharges the mature ascospores, which are wind disseminated.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=+1>Conidia or ascospores come in contact with leaves,
stems, flowers or fruit and germinate. Both types of spores react identically
when they come in contact with compatible host tissues. A host that had
been infected the year before, can also be reinfected the following spring
through mycelium that has overwintered in dormant buds.</font>
<p><font size=+1>When conidia or ascospores come in contact with a suitable
host’s succulent new growth they will germinate in a day or two if temperature
and relative humidity are sufficiently high. Each spore will produce a
germ tube that will generate a short, thin hypha that pierces the host
cell cuticle, passes through the epidermal cell wall and enters into the
epidermal cell. This hyphal penetration is accomplished by a combination
of both mechanical pressure and enzymatic activity. Upon entry into the
epidermal cell, the hypha quickly enlarges to form a specialized feeding
organ called a haustorium. Haustoria are simple globous or lobed bodies
that absorb nutrients from the protoplast of the host's epidermal cells.</font>
