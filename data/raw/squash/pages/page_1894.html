Miles Barlogio (born September 30th, 1898) was the first in our family to plant pumpkins along the fertile banks of Jack Creek.  His son, ourselves, and now our daughters continue the family tradition of pumpkin farming and selling direct to customers.	
<br><p>


It is difficult in today's market to make a living growing dryland hay, grain and cattle as past generations of Barlogio's have.  Based on Great-Grandpa's earlier successes with pumpkin farming, we are exploring furthering that concept by diversifying, planting more row-crops and committing more ground to the orchard and farm store project.
<br><p>


Our goal is to create a successful business that can support our children, and down the line their children, while preserving the land around us.  We hope in the process to be able to educate consumers about the health benefits of naturally grown produce.  Supporting local farmers not only results in better tasting food and health benefits, but it helps to grow a vibrant local economy and preserves green space.
<br><p>


We believe in sustainable agriculture.  We use natural based sprays on our crops, untreated seeds and employ organic methods of pest control when possible.  An example is that we use sunflowers planted around our pumpkin fields as a lure crop to attract those pesky cucumber beetles away from our pumpkins and squash.  We use bug zapper lights in our orchards at night and have had good success controlling coddling moths (apple worms).  We use dormant and summer oils as opposed to insecticides, and we use mineral oil for corn earworms.  We use nitrogen fixing cover crops as well as import manure from local ranches so we don't have to use synthetic fertilizers.   We are building owl houses and hawk perches to encourage larger predator bird populations for mice and gopher control.
<br><p>


When it comes to the actual farm operation we don't hire any outside help and do all of the work ourselves.  We couldn't do it without our two teenage daughters Becky and Mandy.<p>

<center><img src="beckyandmandy1.jpg" width="385" height="312" alt="Becky and Mandy at Jack Creek Farms"></center> <p>

They actively help in every aspect of the operation.  From choosing seed and new varieties to plant next year, planting bare roots, pruning trees, painting trunks, staking, hoeing, mowing, laying drip tape, moving	irrigation pipe, harvesting, collecting eggs, caring for the farm animals ... whew! ... every aspect!  It is a never ending year-round project, and we couldn't do it without them. We are
truly a "Family Farm" and we feel blessed to work together doing something we love.  Our facility is small in size, but we make up for it
with the quality and care we put into every item we grow.
								<br>
<p>


We rotate the crops on different areas of the farm, so one year you might see safflower (used for oil) growing in the adjoining field, other years it might be oat hay, seed oats, wheat or barley.   This year oat hay is growing in the field behind us.  The fields to the east are summer fallowed (farm lingo for allowed to rest).  The front pumpkin field is currently planted with a cover crop of vetch and barley.  It will be worked into the soil before we plant pumpkins in early June.  The orchards and row crops have to be	planted in areas closer to our house  or the farm store which both have deer fencing.  Only a few acres are fenced for this purpose, allowing the native wildlife to continue to utilize 95% of the farm.  In the past we planted the creek fields you see to the west of us with pumpkins, as Grandpa did in the 1950's through the 1960's. They do well there as they love the rich loamy soil.  Unfortunately deer adore pumpkins, and will eat every morsel, leaving only the woody stem.  As the deer have become more prolific, and developed a fondness for those tasty "orange	globes", we've had to move the pumpkin and squash project back to the house and protected area adjacent to the farm store.  Deer don't bother Indian corn or gourds, so we still have some options open to us.  It depends though upon the amount of rainfall we've had and the moisture content in the soil.  								<br>
<p>
Currently we have nearly 300 fruit trees on the farm, the majority of which are old fashioned heirloom varieties.  Currently you can pick your own apples and plums from the orchard directly behind our farm store.  In the next year or two the new peach orchard will be ready for harvesting as will be the eating apple orchard and the antique apple path we recently planted.  Overall fruit-wise we have apples, peaches, pears, apricots, nectarines,
Asian pears, persimmons, pomegranate, plums, figs, apriums and pluots.  Our table grape vineyard is still young, we are hoping for our first real crop this	coming summer.  We also have raspberry, blackberries, ollalieberries and	blueberries planted.  You can see the new pick-your-own ollallieberry patch in front of the farm store.  In the summer we grow a number of garden vegetables including several varieties of
summer squash, Armenian and lemon cucumbers, asparagus, sweet onions, elephant garlic, artichokes, strawberries, bell and sweet banana peppers, and lots and lots of different varieties of tomatoes.  In particular we have been growing more and more heirlooms.  This year look for 16 different varieties of heirloom tomatoes.  What a taste treat!  All of our produce is allowed to vine ripen.  After eating a vine-ripened tomato you will never want to go back to store bought again.  Fresher not only means it tastes better ... but it's better for you!  (Fresh produce is proven to be higher in nutrients.)

In the fall we gear up for our main harvest of the year.  Pumpkins, pumpkins and more pumpkins!  We are planting over 20 different varieties this year to insure that we have the perfect pumpkin for you.  We'll have
								sugar pie pumpkins for pie making, jack-o-lantern type for carving, huge 100
								pound plus pumpkins, tiny pumpkins, heirloom Cinderella pumpkins, orange, yellow,  green, cream and white pumpkins.  We even have striped pumpkins!  Pick your own in the field from the vine, or choose from those already picked and displayed at the stand.							<br>

									Add to that 20 different varieties of baking winter squash (lots of traditional
								heirloom and specialty varieties ... the kind Grandma used to bake), Indian
								corn (both large and small), popcorn, meal corn for grinding (cornbread ...
								yum!) wheat sheaves, corn shocks, a multitude of decorative gourds and straw
								bales.  We grow everything you need for fall entertaining and decorating.  Our belief in God runs deep, and as a Christian Family we have chosen to emphasize a Harvest theme in lieu of traditional Halloween celebrations.

																One of our specialties is that we are fortunate to have a beekeeper who has had
								bees on our farm for over 30 years.  Each year we have fresh natural honey from
								crops such Safflower, Sage, Yellow Star Thistle Honey (our favorite!), Toyon and
								Wildflower.

	<p>
								Sadly we lost our laying flock of Plymouth Barred Rock hens to a wily fox.  We have 46 new pullets in the barn in the brooder.  Hopefully by fall we will again have wonderful fresh free-range brown eggs that our customers have grown accustomed to.						<br>
	<p>
								We enjoy taking time to answer any questions you may have about storing, drying
								or preparing any of the produce we grow.  We are happy to share favorite family
								recipes, including Great-grandma's Squash Pie recipe, Nani's Apple Crisp and my sister Janie's award winning to die for Backyard Apple Tree Cake.  Check our recipe page for these recipes as well as many others.

Thank you for the opportunity of letting us share our way of life with you!
