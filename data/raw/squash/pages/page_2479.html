<h3>Updates</h3>

Various installments of what should be a somewhat regular update on what God is doing in our life.


<h4>7/16/2003</h4>
<img src="/photos/photo_2126.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="left" alt>As far as I can tell, June was mostly uneventful. The garden is doing pretty well: we've enjoyed some cucumbers and tomatoes so far, and the zuccini are not far behind. The bell peppers, on the other hand, have been an abysmal failure. But the Thai peppers planted out front did quite well and they are scorching! Many thanks to Heather for those two plants. The tomatoes are all about to ripen, and since we have the bush (determinate) type, we'll get one big harvest from them and that's it. We'll probably plant winter squash or something like beans when they're done. Our sunflowers are blooming, and it's been really cool to see the goldfinch dine on them. The tallest flower is about 8 feet!<br>
<br>
We enjoyed seeing some old friends who came into town for a wedding. Chris stayed with us for a few days and we got to spend some time with Scot and Kim as well. Also, Michelle helped take care of our friend Marylu (Katie's favorite, and her biggest fan), who recently had surgery, so she was thankful to be able to help out. We took in the fireworks down by the river too, <img src="/photos/photo_2134.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="right" alt>and the park was packed like we've never seen it. Sarah played with the orchestra for the pops in the park, and it was a lovely holiday time. Sarah also recently played with <a href="http://www.kingfisherband.com" target="_blank">Kingfisher</a> at Nightfall (and other places)...they always sound great, and we're quite proud of her. <br>
<br>
Things are changing at <a href="http://www.3hd.com">3HD</a> (Bob's place of work). Jake Stuart and family recently left for Colorado to be closer to their families. Bob and Jake had the same basic job description, so things are a little lonely around the office, plus there's more responsibility for Bob, which of course makes things more interesting. Now Jennifer Kent is leaving for law school, which is of course great for her, but she will be greatly missed. She's the glue that holds the office together, so please pray for us! We're also moving our office down the block soon (still on the 400 block of Broad Street tho), so things are changing wholesale around here.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to a bit of traveling and more houseguests soon, so stay tuned. <br><br>
Latest movie (theater): <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0266543" target="_blank">Finding Nemo</a> - really good fun, and almost as good as the hype. The fish are especially well done and it's quite funny. Go see it.<br>
Latest movie (rental): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXXM/wiegersfamily-20" target="_blank">The Bourne Identity</a> - good action spy flick, but nothing overwhelming here.<br>
Latest book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/043935806X/wiegersfamily-20" target="_blank">Harry Potter 5</a> - a good continuation of the series. Great page-turning brain candy.<br>
Latest CD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008YJHY/wiegersfamily-20" target="_blank">Into the Cauldron</a> by Mike Marshall and Chris Thile (essential for mando/acoustic music fans)<br>
Latest passage: <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=colossians&amp;NIV_version=yes&amp;language=english" target="_blank">Colossians</a>

<h4>5/28/2003</h4>
<img src="/photos/photo_1916.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="left" alt>May has been another good month of beautiful weather and good time with friends and family. Michelle had an impromptu visit to St. Louis just for the heck of it (or was that last month?). She managed to surprise her mom and enjoy a weekend with her folks. More recently, we both made the trek to St. Louis to take part in Michelle's dad's graduation festivities. He graduated from <a href="http://www.covenantseminary.edu" target="_blank">Covenant Theological Seminary</a> and they're waiting on the Lord's timing for a call to plant a church. <br>
<br>
Covenant College's graduation was also this month, which brought Julie and Rich for a visit, along with all the folks here in town that we don't usually see unless we're all hanging out with Julie and Rich :-) Anyway, it was very good to have them here, and we're finally happy with the condition of our guest room (except for some trim that still needs a little painting). <br>
<br>
<img src="/photos/photo_1927.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="right" alt>Some of our bestest friends just had a baby (go meet Gideon at <a href="http://andyandlynn.com" target="_blank">andyandlynn.com</a>) and we got to meet him! So cute. So small. Very cool. <br>
<br>
We're loving the spring weather and still doing a lot of yard and garden work. We actually have had a LOT of rain, but then it clears up after a week or so and it's quite nice. We managed to avoid flood damage, but there was quite a bit here in town. Our veggie plants seem to be doing well, and the plot looks nicer now that it's mulched and such. The various roses in the yard continue to amaze us. We eat outside as much as possible, and we're still hoping to put in the fishpond soon. We recently had a massacre in our fishtank however (parasites killed all the fish), but hopefully that's not some sort of omen. On the pet front, Katie is still as cute as ever, and she's mellowing with age, which is a good thing.<br>
<br>
Please continue to pray for Michelle's health. The treatment is working well and there are quite a few more good days these days, but it's a long process. We're very thankful for the blessings of each day.<br>
<br>
Latest movie (theater): <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215" target="_blank">The Matrix Reloaded</a> (skip the part after Morpheus's speach, otherwise it's pretty cool)<br>
Latest movie (rental): <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0264464" target="_blank">Catch Me If You Can</a> (good fun, recommended)<br>
Latest book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878573410/wiegersfamily-20" target="_blank">Square Foot Gardening</a> (good ideas for small gardens)<br>
Latest CD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008YJHY/wiegersfamily-20" target="_blank">Into the Cauldron</a> by Mike Marshall and Chris Thile (essential for mando/acoustic music fans)<br>

<h4>4/21/2003</h4>
It's been a little while since the last update. Firstly, thank you for your prayers. We can feel that we've been lifted up in prayer, and God has been faithful to answer them. At times, His answers come in the form of comfort and joy despite the difficulty and pain. Other times, He does give us some good days, so we're very thankful. The fibromyalgia treatment seems to be working well, so praise God for that! It's a long road however, so you're continued prayers are ever appreciated.<br>
<br>
Michelle had a recent setback because she was rear-ended while she was at a redlight. Her neck and back were hurt, but she's been helped by the chiropractor and hopefully will be back to normal soon. God has blessed us even through this in at least one cool way too. <br>
<br>
<img src="/photos/photo_1669.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="right" alt>Anyway, we're very excited about spring time! There are SO many flowers in our yard, which you can see <a href="/section.asp?id=86">here</a>.  Daffodils, tulips, irises, cherry, dogwood, and lots of cute little flowers that some might consider weeds. We however, enjoy in the wild meadow that is our yard. At least for now. We've got a LOT of roses of various sorts too, so we're very happy about that. <br>
<br>
We've started a veggy garden in the back yard, and hopefully sometime this summer we'll be enjoying tomatoes, peppers, squash, zuccini, cucumber, onion, etc. It has been a lot of fun working hard in the yard together, especially since Michelle has been <img src="/photos/photo_1721.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="left" alt>blessed with good health recently. You can check on our progress <a href="/section.asp?id=96">here</a>. Sometime soon we're going to put a fishpond in the backyard, so stay tuned for that. <br>
<br>
We hope you know God's blessings through Jesus Christ this Easter. He is our only hope and joy, and the Spirit has blessed us richly. We are so undeserving of His grace, and we pray that we'll be ever thankful. If you don't know Jesus, just ask us: we'd be thrilled to tell you about Him! You may be interested in <a href="http://www.pcanet.org/general/eternal.htm" target="_blank">this article</a>. <br>
<br>
Please continue praying for us. We certainly need it! As always, we'd love to hear how we might pray for you.

<h4>2/11/2003</h4>
<img src="/photos/photo_1399.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="2" align="right" alt>We just had a great visit from most of Michelle's family. Her parents came first and helped get ready for the main event: her older sister, younger sister, and our 9 month old niece all came for a week! It was a lot of fun spending time with all of them, especially as we got to know Casey a bit more. The girls really helped out around the house a lot, so it was even a bit of vacation for us too.<br>
<br>
Shortly after they left, Michelle started taking the medicine for her fibromyalgia treatment. It's supposed to get worse before it gets better, and as of today it seems like it's getting a bit worse. Of course that's good and bad news. We're thankful that we're on the road to recovery though. Michelle's birthday is tomorrow, but it looks like we'll have a quieter celebration than normal. We're thankful for another year and hopeful for a healthier one this year. Please keep us in your prayers. 

<h4>1/14/2003</h4>
Many of you know that Michelle's health has not been good for a while now. God is faithful even in difficult times.<br><br>
She has recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. At first we were shocked and dismayed at this news, but we now we are quite hopeful that she will have a full recovery in time. It will be a long and most likely difficult recovery, and the treatment usually makes it (much) worse before it gets better. Meanwhile, on the bad days, she is unable to leave home. Her symptoms have grown worse recently, so she quit her teaching job at CCS so we can focus on recovery. This has been very difficult for us, so we ask you to pray.<br><br>
Specifically, pray that Michelle's body will be healed. Pray for wisdom as we make decisions regarding her care. Pray for softening of our hearts as we strive to remain faithful in this. Pray for me that I will be filled with strength from God so I might care for and serve her.<br>
<br>
For more info on fibromyalgia, we encourage you to visit <a href="http://www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com" target="_blank">www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com</a> This is the site of the doctor who has
discovered the only treatment (that we know of) that can reverse this disease. It is safe, cheap and effective, so we have decided to start it next month. Since she has hypoglycemia as well, she is on a strict diet too. We're very thankful and have much hope for this treatment.<br>
<br>
 If you're interested, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0446675121/qid=1042252733/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-0772523-8662539?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" target="_blank">this book</a>. It's very informative and well written.
<br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT!!!</b><br>
<br>
Many of our friends know others who have fibromyalgia. If you know someone with this disease, <b>PLEASE</b> at least visit <a href="http://www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com" target="_blank">www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com</a> or pick up a copy of &quot;What your doctor may not tell you about fibromyalgia&quot; by Dr. St. Amand. It could very well change a life. Why? Because Dr. St. Amand has discovered the only treatment that can reverse the disease. Everyone else simply treats the symptoms. It's cheap, safe and usually effective. So please check it out.
