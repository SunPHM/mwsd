        was reading a copy of Popular Mechanics at his desk</font></b> at the 
        New Yorker Hotel, on Eighth Avenue. It was 1931. He was twenty years old. 
        He was a night bookkeeper. He had left Toledo, his hometown in Spain, 
        a year earlier. Although he had graduated as a CPA in Spain, he still 
        enrolled at Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn, so he could learn English. 
        He was desperate to learn English. "I never stayed with Spanish friends," 
        he says. "I only spoke English. I made it my business to learn English." 
        It was the height of the Great Depression. He luckily found a job at night 
        at The New Yorker. "Figures are all the same," he says. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">One night he was reading this boy's magazine. 
        There was an article with a lot of diagrams about how to build your own 
        tennis racquet stringing machine. "I read it like the Bible," he says. 
        He took some wood and followed the directions and built his own racquet 
        stringer.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> He never looked back.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> Walter Montenegro is now a few weeks shy 
        of ninety-two years of age. He and I sit in the lobby of a Best Western 
        in Hackensack, New Jersey. He is barely five-feet tall. He eats nothing, 
        drinks nothing, barely moves at all for two hours. He talks intently about 
        his life in the tennis and squash worlds.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <b>DEPRESSION STRINGING</b><br>
        He worked as a stock clerk in the merchandise wing of Abraham & Strauss, 
        a Brooklyn department store. He married a Brooklyn-native named Marie. 
        They had no honeymoon. Married one day, back to the work the next. With 
        his jerry-rigged machine, he started a stringing business on the side. 
        One dollar and seventy-five cents a racquet. More for silk strings. Took 
        him over an hour to do one racquet. But that was good money. "I became 
        infatuated with the idea of stringing racquets," he says. "Took it up 
        as a hobby and eventually went into the business of stringing of racquets." 
        Walter's Tennis Service, he called it. Based at his home on 5th Street 
        in Brooklyn. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">He soon was in touch with tennis manufacturers. 
        One supplier was Cragin-Simplex. Calhoun Cragin, a former nationally-ranked 
        tennis player, founded the company in 1914 when he merged with the Simplex 
        Corporation that made a metal tennis racquet press with a distinctive 
        X shape. During the Depression, the company was failing. In 1936 Cragin 
        offered it to Montenegro for eleven hundred dollars. That was a fortune 
        to a kid from Toledo. He borrowed the money (his lawyer milked him for 
        a hundred bucks to do the paperwork) and became president of Cragin-Simplex 
        Corp., 53 Park Place, New York.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>THE CRAGIN RACKET</b><br>
        Cragin had occasionally made squash racquets since it was founded, but 
        its emphasis was on tennis. After the Second World War Montenegro changed 
        that. He opened a new 60,000 square-foot racquets factory in North Attleboro, 
        Mass. and began marketing squash racquets: the Whipstroke, the Coronet 
        and the Hornet. <img src="../../photos/history/zug/craginplant3a_sm.jpg" width="390" height="302"></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">"The Cragin-Simplex bats are perfectly balanced 
        to put extra 'whip' into every stroke," read the advertisements. "Smash 
        hits don't bother it. And it's a racquet that never acts 'boardy' or stiff 
        because the superb construction of the bat actually 'gives' with the ball. 
        The grip? Cushiony. Fits your hand like a favorite glove. Never 'cramps' 
        your hand, even after hours of hard play." The Whipstroke became the exclusive 
        racquet of the North American Professional Squash Racquets Association 
        (the predecessor, in large part, of today's PSA). Montenegro, cleverly 
        kow-towing to the egos of the pros, made up these racquets in the colors 
        of a pro's club and with the pro's signature on the handle. In 1969 Cragin 
        bolstered its line with a Mohibullah Khan Personal Model "with built-in 
        power for the incomparable Khan touch" and adorned with a little Islamic 
        flag.</font>
      <p align="center"><img src="../../photos/history/zug/craginplant1asmall.jpg" width="497" height="392">
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> Relationships with the pros became so friendly 
        that Montenegro served as treasurer for NAPSRA. After 1947 he donated 
        the trophies for the U.S. Professionals, a tournament now called the Tournament 
        of Champions.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> Montenegro became friends with Joe Hahn, 
        a Detroit standby who lived in Montclair, New Jersey and was president 
        of Clairmont Cadillac, and he learned of the perennial problem with squash 
        balls. Since 1938 the official U.S.S.R.A. singles ball was the Seamless 
        560 and the official doubles ball was the Seamless 561, made by the Seamless 
        Rubber Co. in New Haven. The singles ball was black, loaded with carbon 
        (thus staining the walls of squash courts with that distinctive pock-marked 
        smear), had little bounce and was usually troublesome. One box of balls 
        played beautifully, another was filled with duds. Some broke immediately, 
        others went clumpy and clay-like. Some got too warm, others stayed rock-cold. 
        Summer was an absolute no-go season. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>CRAGIN BALLS</b><br>
        In the late 1950s Montenegro started toying with the idea of making a 
        squash ball. At his new <img src="../../photos/history/zug/craginad1a.jpg" width="247" height="382" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">offices 
        at 163 Varick Street he vulcanized rubber and made molds and tinkered. 
        He gave Hahn bags of balls to test at the New York Athletic Club. "Of 
        course in the beginning those first balls were either too hard or too 
        dead or both," Montenegro wrote to me before we met. "It took a great 
        number of tests and a tremendous number of balls to test and dispose of 
        before we arrived at the right or ideal ball." In 1961 Cragin issued its 
        diamond balls: the single green diamond for singles play and the double 
        green diamond for doubles and the single yellow diamond for summer singles 
        play and the double yellow diamond for summer doubles play. The diamond 
        balls were revolutionary, for they were more lively, slowed the game down, 
        allowed for more shotmaking, broke less and, most importantly, made it 
        possible to play squash in the warmer months. Of all the reasons why squash 
        expanded in the 1960s and 70s, the mere fact of the diamond balls was 
        critical. It broke infrequently. It held its shape. It slowed the game 
        down and made it easier to learn. And you could play squash in July.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <b>THOSE GREEN DIAMONDS</b><br>
        In 1961 the U.S.S.R.A. approved the diamond balls, discarded the Seamless 
        ball and made the green diamond the official U.S.S.R.A ball (Seamless 
        continued to call itself the official ball until the late 1960s). In January 
        1962 Montenegro began publishing Squash Magazine, a six or eight-page 
        newsletter. Distributed free of charge, Squash Magazine was the first 
        monthly publication devoted to American squash since Squash-Badminton: 
        The Magazine of Winter Court Games, which the American Lawn Tennis Association 
        issued in the mid-1930s. Despite the typos, the plain writing and the 
        naked commercial aspect, with Cragin advertisements scattered throughout, 
        the magazine was a dramatic improvement over nothing. The magazine was 
        chock full with U.S.S.R.A. news and announcements and was the official 
        newsletter of NAPSRA. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Montenegro, hawking his racquets, balls 
        and newsletter, went to many tournaments and was a regular fixture in 
        the gallery. "Squash meant a great deal to me," he wrote to me. "It caused 
        me to have a great number of solid friendships. I worked sixteen hours 
        a day. My wife felt I was married to the company. I told her it was better 
        than if I was spending the time at a bar." He recalled one snowy February 
        evening when Hahn called from Atlantic City. "I was in bed, sleeping and 
        I knew he wasn't calling to say 'I love you,'" said Montenegro. "They 
        had run out of balls at the Atlantic Coast Championships. I drove into 
        the city, went to Varick Street and got a couple boxes of balls and went 
        down to Atlantic City." It was universally acknowledged that between 1945 
        and 1975 Montenegro, although he never played squash, attended more American 
        squash tournaments than any other person.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <b>BEGINNING OF THE END</b><br>
        In 1969 a secretary at Cragin approached Montenegro with a proposition. 
        Her husband helped run Garcia, a gigantic fishing, tennis, camping and 
        hockey equipment company that was traded on the N.Y. Stock Exchange. Garcia 
        wanted to get into squash. Montenegro hesitated. He had run the company 
        for over thirty years. His son Robert was vice-president at Cragin. "I 
        never entertained the idea of a merger, I could see no reason for it," 
        he says. "But eventually I said yes." Montenegro relocated Cragin to Garcia's 
        offices in Teaneck, New Jersey and worked as a salesman. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">In 1976 Garcia went bankrupt. Montenegro 
        lost $464,000 (he remembers the exact amount) and his livelihood. He thought 
        about trying to continue by making balls in his garage, but it wouldn't 
        work. "The shock was so great," he says. "This took all the taste of working 
        out of my system. I did not have the means to start over again, and to 
        this day the one thing I regret the most is that because of that merger, 
        the squash ball was no longer available. It happened for reasons that 
        I will regret for the rest of my life. I will always be the sorriest man 
        on this earth, for having created but not willfuly, the reason for that 
        beautiful ball to be no more." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The vacuum in ball manufacturing was taken 
        up by Bestobell-Merco, an Australian company, which made the Merco green 
        ball that was made the official U.S.S.R.A. ball in 1976 and the 70+ which 
        became official two years later. In 1978 Tom and Hazel Jones jumped into 
        the news vacuum and started publishing Squash News. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">A few weeks after I met with Montenegro, 
        I received another typewritten letter from him. After mentioning a few 
        things, he got to the heart of his letter: "I also wanted to ask you whether 
        it is necessary to state the fact that I came from Spain, etc. I haven't 
        taken it off my mind, and the real reason for it is that I always wanted 
        people to think I am a born Yankee. I don't think many friends care about 
        it. In fact, I have always felt some prejudice for not having been born 
        here, after more than seventy years of living here." That might be true, 
        but certainly it does say something about America that a boy from Toledo 
        can be such a fixture in the rarefied world of squash and by dint of hard 
        work help turn the sport into a game for the masses. </font>
