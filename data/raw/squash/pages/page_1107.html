<P>
Everyone
who tastes this soup falls in love with it.  Many different kinds
of
squash--buttercup, butternut, or red kuri, for example.---can be
substituted
for the pumpkin in this recipe.  I like to roast pumpkin
whole rather than
boil or steam it because the pulp is less watery and
the flavor is superior
using this method.  Save the pumpkin seed;
toasted, they are good as a snack,
in salads, or as an additional
garnish for the soup.  If you prefer a
creamier soup, you can whisk in
a small amount of heavy cream at the very end
of the cooking
process.

	<LI>4-5 to pound pumpkin    

<LI>1/2 cup vegetable oil   
	<LI>2 medium Spanish onions, peeled
     and cut into medium dice 
	<LI>1/2 teaspoon freshly grated
	  nutmeg
	<LI>10 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed

	  <LI>8 sprigs fresh thyme    
	<LI>1/4 teaspoon freshly
	       ground black pepper
	<LI>4 pounds mussels, washed
		    and beards removed
	<LI>3 cups white wine
	<LI>2
			 quarts fish Stock 
	<LI>Juice of 1 lemon

			 <LI>Optional garnish: Truffle oil (see  Note)
			      and chopped fresh herbs (dill, chives,
			      tarragon, or flat-leaf
			      parsley)
</UL>
<P>
1. Preheat the oven
			      to 350F<BR>
2.  Wash the pumpkin very
			      well, leaving the stem on.  Put in a
			      roasting pan
to fit snugly.  Fill the
			      pan with 4 to 5 inches of water and
			      cover with foil.  Bake for
about 1
			      1/2hours, until the pumpkin is tender
			      (test with the tip of a paring
knife).
			      Remove the pan from the oven, take off
			      the foil, and drain off excess water.
			      Let
the pumpkin cool to room
			      temperature.  When cool, cut in half,
			      remove the seeds and
strings, and scrape
			      out the pulp to use in the soup.<BR>
3.
			      Heat the oil over high heat in an
			      8-quart stockpot.  Add the
			      onions,
garlic, thyme, pepper, and
			      mussels.  Pour in the wine, cover the
			      pot, and cook the
mussels un-til they
			      just begin to open, about 5 to 8
			      minutes.  Be careful not to
overcook
			      them, as they will shrink.  Discard any
			      mussels that haven't opened.  Remove
the
			      rest of the mussels from the pot,
			      reserving the liquid.  Let them
			      cool,
then pull them from their shells,
			      trying not to break them, and set aside
			      in a bowl.<BR>
4.   In a food processor
			      or blender, or using an immersion
			      blender, puree
half of the pumpkin pulp
			      with a small amount of the mussel liquid
			      until smooth.
 Repeat with the remaining
			      pulp.  Put the pumpkin puree in a 4-to
			      6-quart pot and
whisk in the rest of the
			      mussel liquid, the fish stock, and
			      nutmeg.  Bring to a boil
over
			      mediumheat, then reduce the heat and
			      simmer for 5 minutes,
			      stirring
occasionally.  The soup should
			      have a creamy consistency, but should
			      not be overly thick.
 Adjust seasoning,
			      and finish with the lemon juice.  Stir
			      the mussels into the
soup just before
			      serving.  Let the guests top their bowls
with a few drops of
truffle oil and a handful of fresh
herbs.

NOTE: Truffle oil--which can be found in many
gourmet and specialty shops--is
a wonderful infused oil made from
fresh truffles; it gives you the taste of
truffles with-out the
expense.  You need only a few drops, as it is very
fragrant.  Be sure
to buy the best quality; the taste should be string and
pure.  This
oil heightens the flavor of cooked pasta, risottos, chicken
ragouts,
fish, and many other dishes.
<BR>
PLANNING AHEAD: The pumpkin can be
roasted, and the pulp removes, up to 3
days ahead.  Or you can do it
even further ahead and freeze the pulp, in
which case the pulp should
be thawed before proceeding with the recipe.
 The mussels can also be
cooked up to 3 days ahead and stored in the
refrigerator in their
broth until ready to use.
The fish stock can be made well in advance
and kept in the freezer until you
need it.
