      </strong></font> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">There are 
        a number of vegetables that I don't store any longer than they will keep 
        in the refrigerator. Lettuce is one of these, but I love lettuce so I 
        want to have it fresh from the garden for as long as possible. I extend 
        the season in the spring by starting seedlings in the house. The first 
        lettuce from transplants will reach the table in mid-June. That planting 
        will have pretty much gone by in a month, which is when the second planting, 
        planted from seed in mid-May, should be ready for harvest. </font><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Plantings 
        in mid-June, mid-July and mid-August will keep the lettuce coming until 
        November. We have even had lettuce from the garden on the Thanksgiving 
        table. People in more southern climates may not think that is much of 
        a feat, but our first fall frost comes around September 20. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Lettuce 
        is not killed by early frosts because the cell walls are more elastic 
        than most vegetables. When the water within the cells expands as it freezes, 
        the cell walls expand also. Tender crops like cucumbers die at the first 
        light frost because their cell walls burst.</font> </p>

        KOHLRABI, RADISH &amp; TURNIP </strong></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Kale is 
        another hardy vegetable that we don't store. It is wonderful in soups. 
        I like it steamed and seasoned with vinegar. This is the way I like spinach 
        also. Spinach in the spring and kale in the fall is the way I like it. 
        I just don't care for kale well enough to want it around a lot. It will 
        last longer in the fall than lettuce and it seems to get better after 
        a frost. I can't tell you how long kale will last because the deer always 
        cut the season short for me. One of these years I will keep them out of 
        the fall garden.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Kohlrabi, 
        radish, and turnip are delightful in summer salads. I can eat any of these 
        right in the garden after wiping the soil off on my jeans. Radishes grow 
        so fast that I can't keep up with succession planting to keep new ones 
        coming. We eat them fresh from the garden as soon as the first ones get 
        a little larger than peas. I always plant radishes with parsnips, carrots, 
        and parsley. The radishes mark the row and shelter the slow-to-germinate 
        crops. When the later crops need the space, I harvest all the radishes 
        to make room. That may mean I've got five pounds of radishes. They keep 
        quite well for up to a month if topped, washed, and put in a plastic bag 
        in the refrigerator. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Sometimes, 
        just to show off, I grow king-size radishes. They are regular radishes, 
        cherry bell is my favorite, but when grown in good soil and mulched they 
        can get almost as big as tennis balls. It's no big deal to grow them that 
        large. The big deal is when someone eats one expecting it to be pithy 
        or woody and finding it to have a perfect texture and superb taste. The 
        mulch assures stable moisture and keeps the soil temperature from fluctuating 
        as much as it would otherwise. The results are really special. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> We don't 
        store kohlrabi, radishes, or turnips as a rule. Kohlrabi can be pickled. 
        Daikon radishes and rutabagas provide radish and turnip flavor in the 
        winter and store easily in the root cellar.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#008C23" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>ASPARAGUS 
        &amp; ZUCCHINI </strong></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">There are 
        two vegetables that I really love in season, asparagus and zucchini. If 
        spring is kind, I can eat my first asparagus on my birthday, May 10. It 
        is just great steamed with nothing on it, or with butter, or served with 
        a little dressing. The harvest is only about a month long, but what a 
        month that is. It is especially wonderful because it is the first fresh, 
        home-grown green for many months. I don't crave asparagus until some time 
        in April, which is just right. I have a month of expectation and a month 
        of ecstasy. Asparagus <em>can</em> be frozen or canned but it's not anything 
        that I will ever be motivated to do. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Commercial 
        growers harvest asparagus by cutting it off below the ground. I presume 
        this is done to get more weight. They then let the ends dry out which 
        makes them inedible. I cut the early asparagus below ground level because 
        I want to get an extra bite or two from the first pickings. Later I will 
        cut at ground level or snap them off. When I bring the asparagus into 
        the house I bundle it together with two rubber bands. Then I cut the ends 
        off and stand the asparagus in water in the refrigerator. This keeps it 
        fresh until you eat it, and you won't wind up with any inedible fibrous 
        ends that way. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Zucchini 
        grows so fast that once it starts coming in you have to harvest it every 
        other day. When I had a market garden and supplied restaurants with zucchini, 
        I harvested every day and a half to get perfectly sized vegetables. I 
        think they are best about six inches long. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> When I 
        was a bachelor in New York City my favorite meal was lamb chops, baked 
        potato, and zucchini. I was not cognizant of seasons at that time in my 
        life and bought my favorite vegetable in the winter when the price was 
        notable. That is how I came to value zucchini. I don't even think I would 
        like zucchini in the winter now but when it is in season I revel in the 
        bounty.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#008C23" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>CELERY, 
        EGGPLANT &amp; PEPPER </strong></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">There are 
        three more vegetables in the we-don't-store-them category: <img src="157_images/157-42-leaves.jpg" alt="Illustration: Rebecca Leer" width="150" height="168" align="right">celery, 
        eggplant, and pepper. We don't grow celery very often mainly because I 
        am not geared up for starting seedlings in February. Then they have to 
        be taken care of until late May before they can be put out in the garden 
        and left on their own. Then they should be blanched or else they are too 
        strong and stringy. Celery can be stored in the root cellar for two to 
        three months, so the books say. That is an experience that still awaits 
        me. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Eggplant 
        and pepper are not as bad as celery but they do need to be started indoors 
        and cool summer weather can severely cut back the crop. Fans of dehydrating 
        vegetables tout that method of storing these. We have stored them in ratatouille 
        which we froze or canned. We try to get an overdose while they are in 
        season but that isn't easy as there is so much coming from the garden 
        at the same time...like corn. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#008C23" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>CORN</strong></font> 
      </p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Corn! Ah, 
        this is another ecstasy vegetable. We plant early, middle, and late season 
        varieties to get continuous corn from mid-July to mid-September. I have 
        been told that frozen corn on the cob is as good as fresh, but I don't 
        believe it. We have a lot of unused freezer space and we haven't even 
        bothered to try it. Some say just put the ears in the freezer right from 
        the garden. Others say shuck them and put them in plastic bags. Others 
        say shuck them and blanch them before putting them in plastic bags. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> We stick 
        with the old rule of getting the water boiling before picking the corn. 
        If you drop one on the way in, don't stop to pick it up. The sugar in 
        corn does turn to starch but the transformation doesn't begin immediately 
        and it takes a day or more to start to be noticeable. At least that is 
        what I have read Me, I enjoy jogging in from the garden with an armload 
        of freshly picked corn. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Harvesting 
        can be a little tricky because you can't see the kernels. The best indication 
        is the drying or browning of the silk. If you have raccoons, the corn 
        will be ready to harvest about three days after the coons start eating 
        it. If you are into sharing, plant a lot. With luck, your generosity will 
        be noticed by porcupines as well. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Our favorite 
        method of preparing corn is to cook it in the husk over coals. When the 
        coals are ready I pick the corn and put it on the grill. The corn can 
        actually go directly on the fire. The moisture in the husks keeps it from 
        burning. Keep an eye on the husks, turning frequently. When the husks 
        get brown, before they start to burn, the corn will be done. Pull back 
        the husks, this is a little hot on the fingers but it is a good time to 
        show off. Hand the ears around with the husk as handle. It cools in the 
        air shortly after you have burned your fingers. We serve this outside 
        with a stick of butter to rub the corn across. When finished, everyone 
        gets to try their luck at lobbing the cob into the compost bin. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Sweet corn 
        can be frozen on or off the cob and canned. It can also be dried. Of course, 
        some corn is supposed to be dried. Popcorn needs to be dried but not too 
        much because it is the moisture in the kernels that makes them pop when 
        it expands. We let popcorn dry on the stalk as long as possible, which 
        usually means until the birds get hungry. Then we pull the husks back, 
        tie them in bundles, and hang them in a dry place for a few weeks. Then 
        the </font><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">kernels are shelled 
        off the cob and stored in an airtight jar so the drying is stopped. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Field or 
        flint corn can't get too dry. We treat it the same as popcorn except for 
        the shelling which takes place later. If it is not dry enough, it will 
        gum up the grinder when you come to grind. We leave it hanging from the 
        rafters until we are ready to use it or until we decide it is getting 
        dusty. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">You need 
        a big garden to grow all these varieties of corn as they all need to be 
        separated during pollination. The separation can be either space or time. 
        <em>The Handbook for Vegetable Growers</em> by James Edward Knott (John 
        Wiley &amp; Sons, New York) says that different varieties of corn should 
        be planted a mile apart. As long as you are growing for your own table 
        and not to sell seed you can gamble on opposite corners of the garden. 
        If there is some cross pollination it will most likely result in partially 
        filled ears or skipped rows of kernels. </font></p>

      </b></font> <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">The opposite 
        end of the storability scale from lettuce has got to be onions. The rules 
        for onions are: don't let them freeze, don't store them wet or in a wet 
        place, and don't store rotten ones. Accomplishing this is just too easy. 
        First, when<img src="157_images/157-42-ionion.jpg" alt="Illustration: Rebecca Leer" width="150" height="146" align="right"> 
        onions are ready to be harvested, they lie down so there is no trick to 
        knowing when to harvest (By the way, you can harvest an onion any time 
        you feel like it during the season). You can harvest the onions for storage 
        any time after they lie down and before a hard frost. They won't rot, 
        get eaten by anything, or lose flavor or quality in anyway. When I get 
        around to it I pull all the onions and drop them right there in the row. 
        They can lie on top of the ground like this for a casual period of time 
        unless frost threatens. They can also be rained upon, which will clean 
        them up a bit, as well as stand full sun. The idea is to let them dry 
        and cure a bit. The soil that may have come up with their roots will fall 
        off. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Not all of the onions will 
        lie down at the same time, so you may have some with practically dry tops 
        and others that still have green tops. If you can't leave them in the 
        garden until all the tops are dry, you can move them to a porch or some 
        other dry place where they can be spread out to finish the drying process. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> The final step is to pick 
        each one up by hand and feel it while putting it in an onion bag or a 
        basket or whatever. My "feeling it" is really just giving it a squeeze 
        designed to pull off dirt and perhaps the outer skin. It is all accomplished 
        in the time it takes to pick up an onion and transfer it to the bag or 
        basket. I'm not trying to make them picture-book clean. Mostly I want 
        to be sure there are no soft ones. A soft onion is a rotten onion and 
        you don't want any of them in storage. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> There are invariably some 
        thick-neck onions. These are set aside for early use. I can taste onion 
        soup as I write this. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> The ideal 
        temperature for storing onions is just above freezing. In our house the 
        closest space for that temperature is the front hall. It is unheated. 
        Cold outside air comes in around the door and warmer air rises to the 
        second floor to keep it a cold but above-freezing place. But don't fret 
        about finding the perfect place. We sometimes braid onions and hang them 
        from the rafters in the kitchen. I don't think there is a warmer place 
        in our house. These onions sprout earlier than onions in a basket on the 
        floor but they still last through March. It's a good idea to check through 
        a bag or basket once a month or so just in case a poor-quality onion got 
        stored by mistake. However, if your nose is working you can probably rely 
        on it to tip you off to a potential problem. </font></p>

        to use a whole bale thickness and the cover has to extend about eight 
        inches from crops to keep the frost from coming in under the bales. I

        is the transition vegetable from unprocessed storage to processed. Winter 
        cabbage will last three to four months in cold high humidity, just the 
        same as root crops. The only real difference is that root crops usually 
        lose their goodness by getting dry and limp. Cabbage usually rots. Therefore, 
        you don't want to fill a box with cabbage in your cellar and forget about 
        it. Check your cabbage every now and then to make sure none are rotting, 
        because if you don't discover it until you can smell it in the house, 
        you are not going to be living with happy campers until the smell goes 
        away. In fact, <em>you</em> may want to go away. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> The beauty 
        of cabbage is that it is the only green vegetable than can be stored for 
        any length of time without being processed. If you are trying to eat as 
        much as possible from your garden, this is a very important feature. Lettuce 
        from June through November and coleslaw from November through February 
        still leaves four months with no fresh green vegetables. Those four months 
        are the period of the year when a died-in-the-wool self-sufficient gardener 
        is building an appreciation for fresh vegetables. We process some vegetables 
        to get through this period without feeling deprived. Cabbage is one of 
        the vegetables we process. </font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Our first adventure into 
        making sauerkraut lives on in our memories, especially Barbara's. Kraut 
        is made with late cabbage and sea or pickling salt. That's it. On a beautiful 
        crisp fall day I brought some firm heads of late cabbage in from the garden. 
        The outer leaves had been eaten by cabbage worms but the heads looked 
        great after the eaten leaves were removed. I quartered the cabbages and 
        cut out the core. Barbara shredded them. I weighed the shredded cabbage 
        and when I had five pounds I mixed it with three tablespoons of salt and 
        let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes. Then I packed the cabbage into a large 
        crock. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">It was a lovely old crock 
        which weighed probably 25 pounds and stood almost two feet high. We were 
        going to have a lot of sauerkraut to go with the pork we were also raising 
        that year. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Barbara kept shredding 
        and I kept mixing and packing, making sure all the air was forced out 
        of the kraut without breaking the shredded cabbage. When the kraut was 
        up to about six inches from the top I covered it with cheesecloth. I had 
        made a disk of oak that just fit into the crock. The idea was to hold 
        down the cheesecloth so the brine that would form as the cabbage fermented 
        would come up over the cover and seal off the kraut from the air. A rock 
        on top of the oak finished the job. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">The crock was placed on the floor on the 
        high end of our kitchen. I should explain that our house is 200 years 
        old and there is not a level floor or square corner in it. The high end 
        was farthest from the woodburning kitchen range which we were using at 
        the time. We thought that was the best place to find a 70&deg;F temperature. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">In two days the brine was covering the oak 
        disk. When scum formed on the brine we were to lift off the rock and disk 
        and cloth and skim off any of the white scum that did not adhere to the 
        cloth, then replace the cloth with a clean one, scald the lid and weight, 
        and replace them. I did this the first time it needed to be done but then, 
        as fate would have it, I got a job that called me away for a week. I left 
        Barbara in charge of the sauerkraut scum skimming operation. That's Hollywood. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> It didn't 
        go well. First, I had neglected to tell her that the top of the crock 
        was not a perfect circle, nor was the handmade disk. The disk would only 
        fit a certain way. Second, she neglected to notice that the cheesecloth 
        was tucked <em>down</em> around the kraut, not around the disk. When she 
        tried to reassemble the cover it wouldn't fit into the crock. As she tried 
        to make it fit, the crock split open, flooding her feet in brine. The 
        brine continued to run across the kitchen floor until it puddled at the 
        low end of the kitchen. Did I mention that lightning came into the house 
        and melted a burner on the stove and that the dog had an epileptic fit 
        that week? Oh yeah, Barbara was very pregnant, too. As you might imagine, 
        sauerkraut has a special meaning for us. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> While sauerkraut making 
        may seem like pickling, it isn't, because it uses only salt. It is not 
        salting either, which is a method of food storage that is not used much 
        at all today. The reason salting is not used is that the salt has to be 
        washed off before the vegetable so stored can be used and much of the 
        nutrient value of the vegetables goes with the salt. We have salted one 
        vegetable, parsley. The leaves are chopped and packed in salt in a small 
        jar similarly to the cabbage in kraut making. The salt keeps the leaves 
        green and, since parsley is used as a seasoning and usually at the same 
        time as salt, the salted parsley is used in place of salt when both are 
        desired. Another way to keep parsley around is to grow it in a pot as 
        a house plant. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> And what is sauerkraut

      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Pickling uses salt and 
        vinegar with spices and herbs. A number of vegetables can be pickled, 
        the most obvious being cucumbers. Green beans pickled with dill and hot 
        pepper is a favorite of mine. Green cherry tomatoes are another. Pickling 
        is more fun than any other vegetable processing because you can be creative.

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> In the 
        days before generally available processed foods on supermarket shelves, 
        when most households had shelves of home-canned food as well as a full 
        root cellar, pickles were the most frequently given or swapped vegetable. 
        Storage of all the other vegetables was pretty straight forward. Everybody 
        did it about the same way with the same results. Pickles were the items 
        in which experimentation might bring forth a special product. Think of 
        the subtle flavors of cloves, turmeric, mustard seed, dry mustard, celery 
        seed, cinnamon, allspice, honey, maple syrup, brown sugar, white sugar, 
        ginger, nutmeg, white peppercorns, black peppercorns, horseradish, garlic, 
        saccharin, curry powder, bay leaf, hot peppers, hot pepper pods, cayenne 
        pepper, mace, and dill. Perhaps I should say, "Think of them <em>as</em> 
        subtle flavors." They can all be used in varying amounts in making pickles; 
        pickling such fresh-from-the-garden vegetables as cucumbers, onions, cauliflower, 
        green peppers, red peppers, green beans, wax beans, green tomatoes, corn, 
        cabbage, beets, zucchini, and horseradish. A grape leaf stuck in each 
        jar of pickles before sealing will help keep them crisp. </font></p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">There are two processes 
        we use to store food from the garden: canning and freezing. They both 
        require energy, as in a stove and freezer, which causes them to have an 
        expense that other storage methods don't have. Vegetables do lose some 
        goodness in processing which is why we put it at the bottom of our list 
        of storage methods. Before I go on I should say that we process our pickles. 
        It wasn't done in olden days but using a boiling water bath stops bacteria 
        that can work in an acidic environment and cause spoilage. It also stops 
        enzyme action and insures a good seal on the canning jars. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> We only 
        can one vegetable other than the pickles which are pickled <em>and</em> 
        canned. That is tomatoes. The story of our first experience with canning 
        tomatoes is another memorable story. But before I get started, turn to 
        <a href="157-052-01.htm">Deanna Kawatski's guide to canning</a> for a 
        complete list of materials and instructions. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> It was a beautiful fall 
        day, the most wonderful time of the year in Maine. The kitchen floor was 
        crowded with vegetables that had been brought in the night before as our 
        first hard frost was sure. A couple of bushels of ripe tomatoes were joined 
        by a bushel of green tomatoes, pumpkins, winter squash, and onions. The 
        tomatoes were to be dealt with on this fine day. With the book propped 
        up over the sink, Barbara and her assistant, me, began to learn a new 
        skill, food processing. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> We assembled all the equipment: 
        canning jars, canner, assorted pots, knives, jar lifters, pot holders. 
        The top of the stove was filled with the canner and pots all filled with 
        water and being brought to a boil. Cleanliness is given such emphasis 
        in most books that the novice is sure to get the entire kitchen close 
        to operating room condition. Heaven forbid an enzyme should survive. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> The tomatoes are washed; 
        I did that. Then they are dipped in boiling water for half a minute or 
        so. This is called scalding. It loosens the skin so it slips off easily. 
        I did that, too, while Barbara read ahead and supervised so that everything 
        would continue apace. As I dropped the peeled tomatoes into a bowl Barbara 
        took them out and cut and packed them into the canning jars. Then she 
        ran a knife around inside the jar to liberate any air bubbles. The tomatoes 
        were packed to about half an inch of the top. She wiped the rim of the 
        jar to make sure it was clean and smooth so the top would seal properly 
        and placed the lid on loosely as directed. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">"It says to cover the jars 
        with half and inch of water," she said. "Won't the water get into the 
        jars?" </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> What did I know, but being 
        a man and being asked a question, I felt I had to come up with an answer. 
        "Guess not. If that's what the book says." By this time the kitchen was 
        so full of steam that we could barely see each other. Barbara put the 
        jars into the boiling water of the tanner and proceeded to add more boiling 
        water to cover the tops. The kitchen had become unbearably hot, especially 
        with my hands full of scalding tomatoes, so I opened a window. Cold air 
        swirled into the room. As the dew point dropped and the moisture-laden 
        air condensed into drops of water not unlike rain, Barbara could see through 
        the fog that the jars were indeed filling with water from the canner. 
        This precipitated another shower in the kitchen, this time of tears. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> We have told the kraut 
        and canning stories many times in the hope that they amuse and that they 
        help others to go forward bravely to learn new things. Doing something 
        for the first time is usually a bit stressful. After each misadventure 
        I think we become a little more philosophical. After all, it wasn't the 
        end of the world. It wasn't a waste of tomatoes either. Nor was it a waste 
        of time, because we learned something. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> What did we learn about 
        the water getting into the jars? I'm still a bit puzzled because we have 
        checked many books since and they all say the same thing. Perhaps we were 
        going too slowly and the inside of the jar had cooled too much and in 
        came the water. Deanna will fill in the details. </font></p>
      <font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Freezing </strong></font> 
      <p align="JUSTIFY"> <font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">We 
        freeze peas, spinach, green beans, and broccoli. We have frozen brussels 
        sprouts and cauliflower but our taste for brussels sprouts can generally 
        be fulfilled by eating them in season. Their season is October through 
        December if I can protect them from the deer. We are not big fans of cooked 
        cauliflower so it is usually a fresh-from-the-garden vegetable with only 
        about a monthlong season in late spring. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> Freezing 
        is really pretty easy. Pick the vegetables when they are at their peak 
        and process them as soon as possible. For peas and beans this may mean 
        planting more than you will use so that you have enough in a single picking 
        to process. These two vegetables produce over a two-week season. A 25-foot 
        row provides enough in one picking to make it worthwhile to freeze. Over 
        the two-week period the 25-foot row will produce two or three times as 
        much as we can or want to eat, however. We could plant shorter rows and 
        hold the peas in the refrigerator while enough accumulate to process but 
        they will not be as good as they can be. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">Spinach is very cooperative. When it reaches 
        its peak you want to move fairly fast as it won't be long before it bolts. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial">The actual "processing" in freezing takes 
        place in the freezer. I mentioned people telling me they had success freezing 
        corn on the cob doing no more than putting it in the freezer. I believe 
        them. The preparation before putting the vegetables in the freezer is 
        solely for the purpose of getting rid of enzymes that will cause the vegetable 
        to deteriorate. Maybe if vegetables are frozen directly from the garden, 
        the enzymes don't have time to get involved. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> We prepare vegetables for 
        freezing first by preparing them just as we would for cooking: popping, 
        washing, cutting, or whatever, depending on the vegetable. Then we put 
        them in a strainer that can be placed in a pot of boiling water. We have 
        plenty of ice to keep ice water good and cold. We plunge the veggies into 
        boiling water, which is called blanching, for a minute or two. The books 
        say longer. Then we lift the strainer with the vegetables out of the hot 
        water and plunge them into ice water for another couple of minutes. It 
        sounds like a Swedish bath, doesn't it? Then the vegetables are dried 
        on a towel and put into a freezer container of some kind and put in the 
        freezer. They are spread out in the freezer so they will freeze quickly. 
        That's, it. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> When we are ready to eat 
        frozen vegetables they go directly from the freezer to the stove top. 
        In a few minutes they are ready, having lost very little garden goodness 
        in the process. </font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial"> I have not covered drying. 
        We have done very little of it. I mentioned corn for cornmeal and popcorn. 
        Dry beans and peas are also pretty easy. We usually have some of both 
        in the garden because I am not diligent in cleaning up garden plants when 
        they go by If left alone the plants will dry and the pods left at the 
        end of the season will dry along with the vines. These can be harvested, 
        shaken or popped from the pods, and stored in jars. The peas should be 
        split and the husks blown away leaving split peas for soup. I haven't 
        done this so I'm going to leave you to your own theories on how best to 
        do it. </font></p>
