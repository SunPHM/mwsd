<img src=neighbors.jpg align=right width=450 height=460>I recall in the spring, planting a packet of seeds labeled "Mixed Squash".  There might even be a plant marker by the little mound with the same label on it.  But what ARE these giant vegetables that are lurking within this tangle of prickly leaves?  Where is Farmer Rick when we need him?  We pulled out two huge white squashes that were about the size and shape of a rugby football? None of us could identify them with any degree of certainty. One of our younger gardeners volunteered to hold one to provide perspective. <p>This week also provided a bounty of cucumbers in all shapes and sizes; short fat ones and long skinny ones.  Again, our plant labeling left a little to be desired.  What were the different varieties that we planted?  Note for next year: make sure everything is labeled. It looks like it will be cucumber salads for everyone this week.

There were a number of neighborhood children who visited the garden this week too. There were vegetables to identify, a few carrots that were ready to eat and samples of greens and herbs to be tasted.  What does fennel taste like?  "It tastes like black jelly beans" remarked Precious, who has been a regular visitor to the garden since its inception.  Fennel is known for it anise or licorice flavor.  They were all eager to take some cucumbers home with them and one boy was willing to take home the 'rugby' squash - even on his bicycle.<p>

The giant sunflowers have also opened up this past week, towering above all the other plants with their huge round blossoms. Summer is in full bloom in the Left Field.
