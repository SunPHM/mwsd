<p><em><strong>DISEASES</strong></em></p>
<font SIZE="2"><b>

<p></b></font><font size="4">W</font><font SIZE="2">&nbsp; POWDERY MILDEW is continuing to
show up on lilacs and snowberries (including coralberries). The symptoms include white to
gray, dusty patches with small pinpoint-size black dots in the patches. Many of the
infected leaves were infected this summer and only now as the patches have enlarged to
cover the leaves are people noticing the problem. The disease is not a serious health
threat to the plant but it can be unsightly. The recommended control is to remove the
infected leaves in the fall. It might also be a good time to prune out the plant to allow
for better air circulation next summer.</p>
</font><font face="Arial" size="4">

<p>V,H</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> SANITATION, SANITATION &amp; SANITATION are the
three keys to managing diseases for next season. Carefully clean up the leaves and other
plant debris from the garden this fall, especially if the plants suffered any disease
problems. Many foliar diseases overwinter on diseased plant debris from the previous
season so removing this material reduces future problems. If you don&#146;t physically
remove the material, plowing it under will work well too. However, rototilling the garden
will only bury some of the debris and leave much of it at or near the soil surface where
it can start disease problems for next season. Organic waste from the garden makes
excellent material to add to the compost pile. And, as long as the pile is active, the
material will be safe to incorporate back into the garden next season as compost. For
additional information on composting see <a href="../compost.htm">ExEx 6004 - Composting
Yard Waste</a> and <a href="../recycle.htm">ExEx 6005 - Recycling Lawn and Yard Waste. </a></font></p>

<p><font size="4">W</font><font SIZE="2">&nbsp; SEPTORIA LEAF SPOT is showing up on
cottonwood trees across the state. Infected trees are easily identified at this time by
cottonwood shelterbelts with only foliage near the very top of the trees. The disease
overwinters in dead leaves and twigs. In the spring, during wet weather, the leaves on the
lower branches become infected. Later, secondary infections continue to infect higher
foliage. Usually by late summer, most of the leaves, except for those at the very top,
have turned yellow and fallen. As with most fungus disease now is not the time for
control. The only recommended control at this time is to remove and destroy infected
leaves.</font></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;<em>INSECTS</em></strong> </p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">

<p>F</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> RASPBERRY CANE MAGGOTS have been a problem in
several gardens in the Rapid City area. The typical symptoms include canes that wilt down
and <a href="../images/raspberry%20cane%20maggot%20damaged%20canes.jpg">break off, usually
at the base</a> or <a href="../images/raspberry%20cane%20maggot%20swollen%20stem.jpg">near
a swollen area on the stem</a>. Typically, the upper part of the shoot will have exhibited
some purple and brown discoloration of the stem as well. Careful, close examination of the
swollen areas will reveal very tiny feeding galleries, just beneath the bark. These
tunnels are filled with frass, a sawdust like material. The maggots are actually very
small and may be difficult to find. The adult, which is about 1/2 the size of a housefly,
emerges from infested canes in the srping and lays the eggs in the leaf axils. The larvae
hatch and tunnel into the stem and begin feeding and tunneling toward the base of the
plant. At the end of the summer, the larvae pupate before emerging again the next spring.<a href="../images/raspberry%20cane%20maggot%20galleries%2010x.jpg"> (close-up view of very
small feeding galeries in lower stem).</a> The main treatment involves removal of infested
canes, cutting close to the soil line. Destroy or at least remove the canes from the
garden area. Protective insecticidal sprays, applied to the young canes in the spring may
be helpful.</font></p>

<p><strong><em>OTHER NOTES</em></strong></p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">

<p>V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> ASPARAGUS FERN GROWTH AND RHUBARB should be
allowed to remain on the plant until it freezes this fall. It can be removed this fall or
it may be beneficial to let it remain until spring. The fern growth will act to catch snow
during the winter which will provide extra winter protection and moisture for next
year&#146;s crop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">L</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> BROWN BUFFALO GRASS
LAWNS will soon be a common sight when the cool and frosty weather arrives. Also, people
that have other warm season grasses like zoysia or blue gramma will see their lawns
browning up too. Some lawns have already turned brown. If someone knows they have a
buffalo grass lawn, they are probably expecting their grass to go dormant as temperatures
get below 50°. However, for some homeowners, that may only have a patch of this warm
season grass in their lawn, it may be quite disturbing. Buffalo grass typically grows in
patches, is a lighter green than bluegrass, has small flattened seed heads and spreads
over the ground by stolons. It can make a fairly nice, low maintenance lawn in some areas.
But, it does brown-up early in the fall and is slow to green-up in the spring.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One significant benefit to this early dormancy is that it
provides a very safe treatment window to control unwanted vegetation including broadleaf
weeds and even cool season grasses. Roundup can be applied after the buffalo grass is
completely brown to selectively control these unwanted plants. </font></p>

<p></b></font><font size="4">W</font><font SIZE="2">&nbsp; FALL NEEDLE DROP IS OCCURRING
NOW. The fall coloring and <a href="../images/fall%20needle%20drop.jpg">loss of inner
foliage</a> is a natural occurrence of evergreen trees, including juniper (cedar) and
arborvitae. The normal shredding of needles is most apparent on pines and spruce and
results in numerous calls from alarmed tree owners. The critical factor is the age of the
affected needle. Healthy pines retain their one- and two-year old needle while <a href="../images/fall%20needle%20drop%203yr%20old.jpg">shredding their third</a>. Healthy
spruces retain their one- to six-year old needles while shredding their older ones.
However, we have been receiving calls from people concerned about excessive needle loss on
spruce. Generally this is due to a combination of normal interior needle drop and the loss
of current and one-year old needles from rhizosphaera needlecast disease. Usually the
interior needles merely turn yellow before falling, the needles infected with needlecast
turn a purplish-red before falling. There is no recommended control of needlecast at this
time of year. Control is initiated in the spring just as the new growth begins.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">F,V,H</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> FROST. Freezing
temperatures have arrived in most of the state and caused a flurry of calls in Extension
offices around the state. Here are few answers to some of the more common questions. HOW
COLD CAN IT GET BEFORE I HAVE TO BE CONCERNED? The usual killing frost is thought to be
28° but this will vary depending on the kind of plant we are talking about. Many of our
tender bulbs, like cannas, will have their foliage killed at 32° while many varieties of
apples can tolerate 25°. WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY APPLES, PEARS AND PEACHES? If you still
have fruit on your trees and temperatures are predicted to get near or below 28°, the
safest bet is to harvest all the fruit, especially peaches. While fruit can be even frozen
solid and still be OK if it thaws out slowly, storage life will be shortened dramatically.
Pears should be harvested before they are fully ripe to avoid the development of stone
cells that make the fruit taste gritty when ripe. HOW DO I STORE MY HARVESTED APPLES AND
PEARS? Both of these fruit are best stored at about 35° in plastic bags with a few air
holes. Usually an old refrigerator works best but they can be stored in a garage as long
as they don&#146;t get too cold and the garage doesn&#146;t get too warm later this fall
during warm spells. SHOULD I PICK MY PUMPKINS AND SQUASH? If temperatures are predicted to
get near of below 28°, harvesting is probably the best answer. Mature pumpkins and squash
can take a pretty good frost , especially if they are covered with a blanket early in the
evening before temperatures drop. However, if the skin is damaged by frost, storage life
will be greatly reduced and they will soon probably begin to rot. HOW SHOULD I STORE MY
PUMPKINS AND WINTER SQUASH? These vegetables are best stored in a cool (50 to 55° ) and
dry location. Normally, mature, hard-skinned pumpkins and squash can be stored for two
months or longer under good conditions. SHOULD I HARVEST MY CARROTS AND POTATOES? You
certainly can harvest these vegetables now if you want but they will probably be OK out in
the garden yet for a few weeks. Carrots can even remain in the garden all winter long if
they are heavily mulched to prevent the ground from freezing. Carrots should be topped and
stored in barely moist sand or peat moss (95% humidity) at about 32 to 35° for best
results. Potatoes should be stored in an absolutely dark location at 40° and 80 to 95%
humidity for best results. <a href="../images/tomatoes%20peppers%20frosted.jpg">WHAT DO I
DO WITH ALL OF MY GREEN TOMATOES?</a> This is probably one of the more commonly asked
questions. Mature green fruit, that is just starting to change color from green to white,
can be ripened indoors. Lay the fruit out in a single layer on a flat surface. Cover the
fruit with a couple sheets of newspaper. Check the fruit from time to time and remove them
as they ripen. This method will work better than ripening them on a window sill because it
helps to concentrate the ethylene gas that aids ripening. Plants may also be pulled from
the garden and hung in the garage. Many of the fruit may still ripen. CAN I JUST COVER MY
FLOWERS OR DO I HAVE TO DIG THEM UP? Covering flowers like geraniums and impatiens will
help for a light frost but not a hard frost. So, I you have plants you want to save, I
would suggest either digging them up now or take cuttings to keep over winter. DO I HAVE
TO DIG MY GLADIOLUS AND CANNAS? You can still wait to dig these tender bulbs. It is
usually best to wait a week after the tops are killed by frost before digging.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">L</font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; LAWN
FERTILIZATION is best done in the fall, especially for those lawns that are not highly
maintained, i.e. watered all summer, clippings are removed and the grass is mowed fairly
short. One or two applications should provide most of the low maintenance lawn&#146;s
nutrient needs for the next year. Apply 1 lb. of actual nitrogen per 1000 sq. ft. now and
again, if desired in 4 to 6 weeks. An ordinary, quick-release lawn fertilizer is all that
is really needed but a fertilizer that has about 25% slow release nitrogen can be
beneficial. &quot;Winterizer&quot; fertilizers, which are lower in nitrogen and higher
phosphorous and potassium are not really necessary unless your lawn is deficient in these
nutrients. However, a complete fertilizer should be used, one that has a ratio of 4:1:2
will work well. Applications of nitrogen are rapidly taken up by the plant, stored for
winter and Fall utilized next spring for new growth. Fall nitrogen applications generally
will NOT cause a huge flush of top growth because the plant is naturally slowing down top
growth at this time of year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">H</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> PERENNIAL FLOWER
FOLIAGE should be allowed to remain on the plant until the foliage has died down
naturally. This will provide for the maximum amount of food to be stored in the
plant&#146;s crown to better enable it to get through the winter and produce a good crop
of flowers next year. It is true that the foliage can be removed earlier in the season
with good results but a good general guideline is to wait until the end of the season. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Foliage removal is a major part of general garden
sanitation which is especially important if the plants suffered from any foliage diseases
this season. Iris and hollyhocks can benefit especially from this fall sanitation since
they are prone to diseases that overwinter on the old foliage. Hollyhock rust has been
very common this year with the wetter weather as has iris leaf spot. Thorough cleanup this
fall may delay the onset of the disease next year.</font></p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font size="4">W</font><font SIZE="2"> WATERING IS STILL A GOOD IDEA FOR TREES
AND SHRUBS. In many parts of the state we have had limited precipitation during August.
Some people are concerned that watering during late summer will delay hardiness and
increase winter injury. While this can occur if marginally hardy trees are provided with
luxurious amounts of water during late summer this is the exception rather than the rule.
Instead, providing trees and shrubs with water will usually not delay dormancy and can
increase winter hardiness. How much water is enough? Here is the typical weekly water use
for various diameter trees; a 1-inch diameter (diameter measured 4.5 feet above the
ground) requires 20 gallons, a 2- inch diameter tree requires 35 gallons and a 5-inch
diameter needs 125 gallons of water every week. &nbsp;</p>

<p></font><font size="4">W</font><font SIZE="2">&nbsp; WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE BEST
TIME TO FERTILIZE TREES AND SHRUBS. Fertilizing after the first hard frost will allow time
for the tree to absorb and utilize the nutrients this fall. Fall fertilizing will not
result in an expansion of shoot growth, or a reduction in winter hardiness. Fall
fertilizing will improve spring growth, however, as 70 percent of the nutrients used in
the construction of spring growth are absorbed during the previous fall.</font></p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p></font><font size="4">W</font><font SIZE="2">&nbsp; WHY ARE MY TREES DROPPING THEIR
LEAVES NOW? We sometimes get this question from tree owners concerned that their tree is
dropping leaves before the others in the neighborhood. There are several reasons to
explain this and not all of them indicate a problem.&nbsp; <u>It might be a tree species
that drops leaves earlier than the others.</u>&nbsp; Black ash, Kentucky coffeetree, and
black walnut are all examples of trees that drop their leaves earlier than most trees.
&nbsp; <u>It might be due to drought.</u>&nbsp; Trees in most of New England were dropping
their leaves in late August due to the extended drought occurring in the region. If the
tree is not able to provide water to the foliage it will begin to shed the leaves
prematurely. While most of the state has been receiving adequate moisture, there are a few
areas that still have not received much precipitation since July and in some of these
areas (such as parts of southcentral South Dakota) many trees have having the leaves turn
yellow and drop.</p>

<p><u>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may be due to a fungus.</u> A number of trees, most notably ash, walnut and oak,
have anthracnose. This is a fungus disease that results in botches forming on the leaves
and often the leaves dropping prematurely. There is no recommended control at this time
other than removal of the infected, fallen leaves. While it may not be a great help in
controlling the disease and can provide some reduction of spores the following spring.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> WINTER SQUASH AND
PUMPKINS should be harvested before frost for best storage. Cool temperatures, below 40F
can cause cold temperature injury to the fruit which can shorten storage life. <a href="../images/pumpkins%20frosted%20some%20immature.jpg">Frost can cause more severe
injury</a>, especially if the fruit are not fully mature.&nbsp; Frost damage can result in
the invasion of decay organisms resulting in rapid softening and spoiling of the fruit.
For maximal storage life, allow the fruit to fully ripen which is evidenced by good skin
color a hard shell and often the development of a yellow or orange ground spot on the
bottom of the fruit (generally seen on squash). Cut the fruit from the vine with a pruning
sheers to maintain the stem and carry fruit by the bottom and not the stem. If the stem
breaks off, this creates a wound that allows decay pathogens to enter the fruit. Cure the
fruit in a warm and dry location for a couple weeks before putting into storage at about
40F and 50% RH. Properly harvested, cured and stored fruit should store for 2 to 4 months.</font></p>
