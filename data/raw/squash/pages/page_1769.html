<IMG SRC="39666EA5.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39666EA5.JPG" ALIGN=right> Boy, you sure clean up nice. 
Thanks. 
So 
back to New York, 
scene of the crime? 
Scene of 
all my crimes. 
$2 million wasted, 
marriage wrecked. 
That was a long 
time ago, peter. 
You're a different 
guy now. 
I'm 
soon going 
to find out. 
Listen, I know 
how you feel 
about your dad. 
You wouldn't be 
asking him for money 
if horizon hadn't 
gone into chapter 11. 
<IMG SRC="39666EF7.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39666EF7.JPG" ALIGN=left>I don't think there's 
a chapter written 
for where we are. 
Chloe? 
She's picking me up 
at the airport. 
That's what ex-wives 
are for, right? 
Cabs from the airport 
are expensive. 
<p>
Look, 
don't let them burn down 
the place while I'm gone. 
Placement tests are on thursday. 
Jeff's gonna 
handle that, 
and, if you need him, frank will 
be around. 
We'll try to struggle through without you. 
Oh, listen, um, 
auggie's at two months today. 
I could sit down with him, if you want, but if you got time if you... 
<br><br><br>
<IMG SRC="39666F14.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39666F14.JPG" ALIGN=left>No, I can do it. 
I'll see you 
in a few days?  
Yeah. 
Knock 'em dead. 
Stay strong. 
I will. 
<p>
Woo-hoo, 
look at you. 
Oww! 
Someone call GQ. 
<p>
Hey, Augg'.
can I talk to you 
a minute? 
Have a seat. 
I just want 
to let you know 
that I think you've 
come a long way 
in eight weeks. 
oh, 
with my attitude and stuff? 
Yeah
<IMG SRC="39666F47.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39666F47.JPG" ALIGN=right>Yeah.
 I'm very 
proud of you. 
You know that, 
right? 
Except 
now you've got to get to work 
on those grades, man. 
You're not a newbie anymore.  
No more getting by 
without doing the work, 
you got me? 
Listen, augg', 
I've seen you out there on the trail.  You're 
doing things you never 
thought you could do before. 
Yeah, but that's different. 
No, we're tested 
every day, 
every one of us. 
Sometimes you just 
got to dig deep, 
all right? 
I'll see you in a few days. 
<p>
Hopefully I'll be back in a few days
<IMG SRC="39666F6E.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39666F6E.JPG" ALIGN=left>with just pockets 
full of money. 
You know, this school, peter... 
has been my life. 
I know, frank, 
and I'm giving it my best shot. 
Well, that's all 
you can ever do. 
Yeah.  
Here, Pete, I want you to have 
my lucky arrowhead... 
To remember where you belong. 
Thanks. 
<p>
Chloe, 
where are we going? 
This isn't the way 
to the hotel. 
It's a surprise. 
I couldn't resist. 
Listen, I have 
to get to the hotel. 
I -- 
I got to get up in the morning and see dad. I can't --
I need my rest. I can't --
Come on, Peter, 
this was our place. 
One quick...Ginger ale. 
For old times' sake? 
<IMG SRC="396670B0.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396670B0.JPG" ALIGN=right>I can't say I'm a big fan 
of the old times. 
I'm talking about
the real old times, 
before everything 
got poisoned. 
We had good times. 
Yes, we did. 
Silvano still make 
that tiramisu? 
Yeah?
Um-hmm, 
like eating a cloud you said. 
Come on. 
( Drum and bass music playing ) 
<p>
They heard you were coming. 
I couldn't keep them away. 
Peter, it's great 
to see you. 
Hey. 
How have you been? 
<p>
The british army 
had better weapons, 
<br><br><br>
<IMG SRC="396670DC.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396670DC.JPG" ALIGN=right>more soldiers, 
so why did we win 
the revolution? 
We were good hunters. 
We knew how to fight. 
Good, but that 
only helped so much. 
England was the biggest 
military power 
in the world. 
How did we ever break away? 
Anyone? 
Auggie? 
I don't know. 
Come on. 
Impress me. 
Maybe because 
the french came in 
and saved 
our sorry butts, 
and king george, 
<IMG SRC="396670FD.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396670FD.JPG" ALIGN=left>well, 
king george was, 
like whacked 
and stuff. 
That's 'cause why. 
Correct, auggie. 
( Bell ringing ) 
<p>
placement tests on thursday, 
and don't freak out -- 
you'll all do great. 
Leave your reports 
on the table. 
<p>
I know you said 5 pages 
but is 13 okay? 
Yeah, 
13 will be great. 
Auggie, hold on. 
No paper? 
No, I didn't do it. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look around. 
You're not in your old school anymore. 
<IMG SRC="39667121.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667121.JPG" ALIGN=right>I don't want 
your homeboy attitude, 
I want your paper. 
I want 500 words and I want it friday. 
Look, I know 
all this stuff, all right? 
I don't need to do no paper. 
This isn't up 
for discussion, Auggie. 
You'll have time to work on it
after placement tests. 
Yo and
I'm not taking 
no tests. 
Why not? 
Just get off me. 
<p>
Hi, don scarbrow please, 
it's his son. 
Do you have any idea 
when he'll be back? 
No, no message. 
<IMG SRC="3966714D.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966714D.JPG" ALIGN=left>I'll -- I'll call him at home. 
Thanks, bye. 
<p>
Peter, man. 
Hey, Reed. 
Sorry I'm late, 
dude. 
Had to lay off 
a couple thousand 
employees. 
Still a softie, huh? Oh, 
yeah, you know me. 
So, listen, why don't we head off
into my office there 
and we can get this little party 
really started. 
I'll pass. 
Excuse me, 
pete scarbrow passing? 
I got smart. 
You should give it a try. 
Oh, oh, okay. 
<IMG SRC="3966716A.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966716A.JPG" ALIGN=right>Uh, well, listen, pete, 
I don't care 
what mountains you've climbed, okay? 
Just don't come back down here 
and start trying to preach to me. 
And
why don't you get smart and realize that
your way is not 
the only way? 
Not everybody's an addict 
like you. 
You've got it under control, huh, Reed? 
Total control. 
Purely recreational -- 
weekends only. 
It's thursday. 
Yeah, well, 
when you got 
as much bread as me, 
every day's a weekend. 
And hey... 
Think fast. 
On the house. 
<IMG SRC="3966718A.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966718A.JPG" ALIGN=left> <p> Hey, stranger. 
Where have you been? 
Oh, just saying goodbye 
to an old friend. 
I hope it's not me. 
No, chloe. 
Listen, I'm grateful for the 
party and everything, but, uh... 
But what, peter? 
I just really miss parts 
of this and, uh, it scares me. 
What about me? 
Did you try to forget about me? 
No, chloe. 
You were 
the only good part. 
You always were. 
Well, excuse me, kids. 
We were just leaving. 
And, uh, reed, 
think fast. 
<IMG SRC="396671B5.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396671B5.JPG" ALIGN=right>If you still can. 
<p>
Come on now, I don't want 
to get put on restriction 
again, all right? 
Don't worry, 
peter's away. 
Nobody else 
notices anything. 
I don't know 
<p>
I don't know
who she's kidding. 
She's so wrong 
for him. 
It's like 
temporary insanity. 
Well, I mean, 
I think he's crazy. 
You are much... 
Smarter than she is. 
Smart? 
Yeah, I also have 
some complimentary thoughts about your body, 
<IMG SRC="396671E2.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396671E2.JPG" ALIGN=left>if you want 
to hear them. 
( Clearing throat ) 
or not. 
<p>
Juliette. 
After dinner 
you're on 
room restriction 
until last light tonight. 
you understand? 
<p>
Yo, man, stop pushing 
on me, all right? 
Problem, auggie? 
Auggie decided he wanted to be 
on dish-washing duty tonight. 
All right, go on.  
15 minutes for dinner and
then hit the suds. 
<p>
He was doing so well. 
We finally 
got rid of the anger. 
He still isn't doing his work. 
<IMG SRC="39667217.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667217.JPG" ALIGN=right>More authority 
problems? 
I don't know -- 
two months? 
I'm thinking 
there's something else. 
Did you ever go over 
his public school records? 
Yeah.  last year he was 
in a class with 46 kids. 
Poor teacher barely 
knew his name 
let alone any possible 
learning differences. 
Now! 
Give me some food. 
<p>
Truth -- 
you miss it, don't you? 
Truth? 
Uh, sometimes. 
Thanks. 
<IMG SRC="39667242.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667242.JPG" ALIGN=left>My pleasure. 
<p>
This just isn't, like... 
Food. 
Yeah, the turkey 
tetrazini here 
is always problematic. 
( Juliette ) 
it's horrible. 
What do you care, 
you're just gonna toss it up anyhow. 
That just means she's
gonna have
to taste it twice. 
I'm telling you, 
man, this test... 
Why are they making us 
take this stupid test? 
( Juliette ) 
it's prep for the sats, for college.
I ain't going 
to no college. 
Anger management, Augusto.
<IMG SRC="39667262.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667262.JPG" ALIGN=right>I wasn't talking 
to you, stick. 
Why don't you 
go barf? 
<p>
Hey, hey, watch where 
you step there, little man. 
You want a piece, 
boy? 
Come on, 
let's go outside. 
Get your butt kicked. Come on.
Right, i could step on you. 
Heads up. 
Auggie? Mike? 
Problem? 
No, no problem 
at all. 
<p>
This is one addiction 
I can commit to. 
No delicate italian 
desserts back home? 
<IMG SRC="39667289.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667289.JPG" ALIGN=left>hun-uh. 
<p>
( jukebox playing ) 

  Hmm-hmm, oh yeah  
[ singing ]
  it's been a day 
since you went away  
  but here I am missing you  [end of singing ]
<p>
mmm, this is familiar. 
You look just like you did 
when i met you. 
I think that's the gin 
talking, sweetheart. 
I cheated -- 
it's just soda water 
with lime. 
I wanted to remember 
every moment. 
Did I ever tell you 
i was sorry 
for everything 
I put you through all those years? 
I never blamed you for leaving. 
<IMG SRC="396672C0.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396672C0.JPG" ALIGN=right>I should have stayed. 
No, 
it was tearing you apart. 
I was the only one 
that could help myself. 
And I was scared, 
young. 
What did I know 
about love? 
I think 
about love... 
A lot. 
<IMG SRC="396672E0.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396672E0.JPG" ALIGN=left><P> [singing ]
You come back home
Oh darling, 
 I swear 
i'll make it up to you....  
<p>
I'm sorry I didn't call. 
They threw me 
this huge "welcome home" party. 
I felt like don corleone. 
What, dead in the garden with an orange peel 
in your mouth? 
Not exactly. 
So, uh, how's the hotel? 
I, uh, i crashed at chloe'S. 
Did you sleep well? 
<br><br><br>
<IMG SRC="396673FB.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396673FB.JPG" ALIGN=left> The couch was very 
  comfortable. 
Listen, I should get going. 
I'm playing squash 
with dad today. 
Peter, remember, ultimately 
it's not about the money. 
  I know. 
Ever feel like you were 14 again and everything 
you're doing is a mistake? 
Deep breaths. 
All right. 
I'll call you afterward. 
<p>
Local calls are 
a buck seventy-five. 
Hey, good morning. 
I -- I didn't hear you get up. 
Mistakes? 
Oh, no, 
that was, um, 
I wasn't talking about you. 
You know, you could 
<IMG SRC="39667425.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667425.JPG" ALIGN=right>have shared my bed. 
That was one thing we always 
did well together. 
That we did. 
Squash with dad, 
just like old times. 
Should we make plans 
for tonight? 
I'll call you. 
Give dad my love. 
<p>
Hey, dad. 
Peter, 
you're looking well. 
Did you just get in? 
No, last night. 
Chloe sends her love. 
Beautiful chloe. 
You've seen her then? 
Yeah, I'm staying 
with her. 
Wonderful, good news. 
<IMG SRC="39667451.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667451.JPG" ALIGN=left>you getting 
back together? 
No, Dad, 
it's not like that. We're uh -- 
No, no. 
Who can blame her 
after what happened? 
Let's go. 
Hey, jeff, how you doing? 
<p>
When was the last time
you played? 
1987, father-son 
tournament. 
Ahh, 
we could have had 
that trophy. 
You never quite 
developed a backhand. 
<p>
Mr. Scarbrow... 
I apologize, mr. Scarbrow, 
uh, your membership card 
was rejected. 
Apparently your membership 
has lapsed. 
<IMG SRC="3966746C.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966746C.JPG" ALIGN=right>Try it again. 
I did -- 
three times. 
Accountant 
must have forgotten 
to send the renewal. 
I'll write you 
a check when we're done, okay? 
<p>
Guess 
what time it is. 
It's payback time. 
Wrong. 
It's time for you 
to apologize... 
To me. 
Don't be 
so brittle, jules. 
You know you take worse 
from shelby every day. 
Shelby's a toad -- 
you're not. 
<IMG SRC="39667491.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667491.JPG" ALIGN=left>You can't fool me, 
auggie. 
I'm the best 
actress here. 
Underneath that bad exterior 
you're really a nice guy. 
But don't worry, i won't tell. 
And now's the part where you tell me 
what's bugging you. 
No, now's the part where you get 
out of my face. 
I'm trying 
to be a friend here. 
Don't, all right? Just
stay out of my head. 
You know 
you're worse than group? 
Everybody -- 
"auggie, open up." 
"You're safe, auggie." 
"Let it go, auggie." 
<IMG SRC="396674AF.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396674AF.JPG" ALIGN=right>"Take the test, 
auggie. 
Take the test." 
You all can just 
step off. 
<p>
Yo, 
are we playing ball here or what? 
I came here 
to kick some tail, 
starting with you, 
son. 
Bring it on. 
<p>
Point. 
Five, serving love. So, 
how much 
do you need? 
I don't have a hard number yet. 
Somewhere around seven figures. What? Just
a house of delinquents 
on a mountaintop? 
Isn't that what jails are for? 
<IMG SRC="396674D0.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396674D0.JPG" ALIGN=left>
<p>
You okay, dad? 
It's your serve. 
<p>
Yeah! 
Yeah, baby. 
You're starting to tick me off. 
<p>
I swear 
I still 
don't believe it. 
Just threw it 
all away. 
Up your nose, 
in your veins. Down your throat. 
You're right, 
dad, I fell hard. 
All the privileges 
you had in life, 
all your gifts.  I think 
I've been using them 
pretty well, lately. 
I've been sober for
seven years, dad -- 
seven years. 
<IMG SRC="39667507.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667507.JPG" ALIGN=right>What do they say? 
"Day at a time." 
What about tomorrow, 
peter? 
<p>
I guess I got 
a backhand after all, huh? 
Serve it. 
<p>
What you got? 
What you got? 
What is up with you, man? 
Just playing to win, man.
Yeah, 
that may be how they play 
in the barrio, 
but up here we play by the rules. 
I'd show you that rulebook 
if you could read english. 
Do it, Auggie.
<p>
Do you know 
what it's like 
having a drug addict for a son? 
A recovering drug addict, dad. 
What people think? 
You swore you'd kicked it a thousand times. 
<IMG SRC="3966753E.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966753E.JPG" ALIGN=left>what's 
one more time? 
You sound like you want it 
to happen to me! 
I know i'm going 
to get that call, 
the phone ringing in the middle of the night,
the hospital 
telling me you're dead. I -- I can't -- 
I just wish I had a son 
i could be proud of. 
<p>
Get off me, Scott. 
Calm down, man. 
No, we can do this! 
We can do this. 
Okay, settle down, 
settle down. 
Break it up. 
All right. 
Room restriction, two days, 
starting now. 
<IMG SRC="39667570.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667570.JPG" ALIGN=right>Whatever. 
Did you hear me? 
Room restriction... 
Two days. 
I could use a rest. 
Go, 
now. 
<p>
He got just 
what he wanted. 
How so? 
Two-day restriction -- 
placement test is 
this afternoon. 
You're not going 
to let him off. 
No, I don't want 
to single him out from the others. And I gotta get this kid 
to put pencil 
to paper if I'm going
<IMG SRC="396675A0.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396675A0.JPG" ALIGN=left>to confirm 
what's happening here. 
<p>
Hannah, 
you have a call. 
Can you take a message? 
<p>
So, um, I assume 
we're looking at dyslexia. 
Almost certainly. 
He's just scared and unsure 
right now. 
I don't want to aggravate it 
with any 
specific testing. 
<p>
Hi, hannah, it's peter. 
<IMG SRC="396675B4.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396675B4.JPG" ALIGN=right>
she's in the middle

<P>
   And I guess 
that's why they say 
it isn't going 
to be easy, 
but surely 
it's worth it. 
I see some new faces. 
Welcome to AA
If anybody wants 
to introduce themselves, 
we're a friendly group. 
I'm peter 
and I'm an alcoholic. 
Hi, peter. 
I've been sober for seven years now
and four months now. 
I was in a bar today. 
Rather than have a cocktail 
i decided 
to find myself a meeting. 
<IMG SRC="3966760C.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966760C.JPG" ALIGN=right>Glad you did. 
<p>
Auggie, you in here? 
What are you 
writing? 
Nothing. 
Uh, I'm on restriction. 
That means i don't have 
to talk to you. 
It's time for class.  We have the tests. 
Just -- just take off. 
You got to take it, 
auggie. 
Why? 
It's just another way 
for them to tell me 
how stupid I am. 
I always thought 
you were the smart one. 
You know everything 
in class. 
Auggie... 
That's different. 
It's different 
writing it down. 
I mean I failed every -- 
every test they ever 
made me take.
<br><br><br>
<IMG SRC="396676E4.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396676E4.JPG" ALIGN=right>
You just have 
to concentrate 
and try harder. 
Shh...Shush, 
all right? 
You don't... 
You don't get it. 
What don't I get? 
Tell me, what don't I get? 
<p>
I can't even read the test. 
Everything I read, 
it's all mixed up. 
It's backwards. 
The words, they, uh, 
they don't make sense. 
You know, 
all they ever 
told me was 
"try harder." 
<IMG SRC="3966770B.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966770B.JPG" ALIGN=left>"You're not trying hard enough." 
You've got a problem. 
Everyone here's got 
some problem. 
Me, for instance. 
It's called bulimia. 
Yeah, my problem's got 
a name too. 
It's called "stupid." 
Here, 
sign your name. 
Nah. 
Come on. 
Is this your name or your tag? 
My tag is my name. 
It's beautiful. 
Beautiful? 
Mm-hmm.
<p>
( Peter ) 
Thanks for taking time 
to meet me. 
Of course.
Dad, I...I --  
<IMG SRC="39667744.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667744.JPG" ALIGN=right>Yeah, your game's 
improved quite a bit. 
Didn't know they had 
squash courts 
on that mountain of yours.  
They don't. Well, then 
I must have slowed down. I suppose
we all get older. 
Dad -- 
don't. 
Dad, 
you're right 
to be angry with me. 
I disappointed you 
and I disappointed myself. 
But every day 
i try to get stronger. 
I'm sorry for all 
the pain that I've caused you. 
That's all. 
I -- I should get going. 
Do you have time 
<IMG SRC="39667764.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667764.JPG" ALIGN=left>to go to morty's 
for a steak later? 
Yeah, I'd like that. 
Hey, 
it's all right. 
And I'm going 
to look into 
that loan of yours. 
Thanks, 
thanks very much. 
It's a mere 
bag of shells, my boy. 
<p>
Auggie. 
Auggie, 
where are you going? 
<p>
Hey, how about 
a little game 
of one-on-one 
without your little friends
around to fight for you, huh? 
Grrrrrrrrr......
<p>
This isn't over, Pee-Wee.
<IMG SRC="396677C8.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396677C8.JPG" ALIGN=right>I want you 
where there aren't 
any counselors 
to save your butt. 
Bring it on. 
All right, 
knock it off. 
Scrub... 
Or i'll take those away from you 
and give you toothbrushes. 
<P>
( Chloe ) 
How was morty's? 
Delicious -- I had a steak the size of Louisiana. 
<IMG SRC="396678A3.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396678A3.JPG" ALIGN=left>I'm proud of you, peter. 
It took guts. 
I know, 
red meat's a killer. 
It was good, 
actually. 
We talked. 
What a concept. 
As for my end, 
I talked to vanessa, 
john, and chip 
and they think screwed-up kids 
is a growth industry. 
They want to put together 
a financial package. 
Chlo'
You could stay at your school, 
run things. Lord knows 
we all trust you. 
Then, who knows, 
maybe we could launch 
a new school in the next year. 
<IMG SRC="396678C2.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396678C2.JPG" ALIGN=right>Listen, I don't-- 
I want to do this. 
It's a chance for us 
to work together... 
And maybe see what else happens. 
What we felt 
the other night 
at the club 
wasn't history. 
It felt like a future. 
Chloe, I think 
it'd be better for everyone 
if i take my father's offer. 
He's going 
to put together 
a loan for me, and i just-- 
peter, you don't know? 
Black thursday, 
september '98. 
I don't know what? 
Your father's derivatives were a black hole. 
<IMG SRC="396678E8.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396678E8.JPG" ALIGN=left>he lost everything. 
Everything down the drain 
overnight. 
He took a massive risk 
and fell. 
I'm sure he was just 
embarrassed to tell you. Oh, 
whyy don't I learn, huh? 
Maybe he still has 
connections. 
I'm sure his heart was in it. 
His heart. He knows why I came here. 
He just wanted to make me feel 
small again, you know? 
Peter running to daddy for money 
because peter's broke again. 
Peter, 
I have seen the two of you go through this a thousand times. 
Things are different this time. 
I'm different, you know? 
Oh, please. 
<IMG SRC="3966790E.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="3966790E.JPG" ALIGN=right>You are both exactly the same. 
So proud 
and self-centered 
you can't even see each other. 
His son came 
to him for help 
that he can't give. 
When are you two going to learn 
to give each other a break? 
<p> I think 
Auggie's right, 
the guy's a jerk. 
Yeah, but what's up 
with auggie anyways? 
Jules, 
what'd he say to you? 
Juliette? 
Nothing, he's just... 
He's just thinking 
about some things. 
Hey, what's up 
with you, huh? 
<IMG SRC="39667937.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667937.JPG" ALIGN=left>Nothing. 
Later at the lake. 
It's all set. 
What's all set? 
They're calling 
each other out. 
But hannah's 
on duty. 
We could get 
into trouble. 
"We could get 
into trouble." 
Look, she's got 
the whole campus 
to cover. 
I don't care 
about you guys. 
I'm gonna be there. 
<p>
Oh, my god, 
he really can't write. 
<IMG SRC="39667975.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667975.JPG" ALIGN=right>
<p>
You went through 
my stuff? 
No, it was found 
by a student. 
Yeah, and 
her name's juliette. 
Auggie, look, I've been 
through your records, 
talked to your parents, 
talked to every teacher 
i could. 
I think we've pulled 
this together. 
Pulled what together? Hey, 
what's up with this? 
We believe you have 
a learning difference 
called dyslexia. 
Yeah, so what? 
And it's very common, 
auggie. 
<IMG SRC="396679A0.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396679A0.JPG" ALIGN=left>Very common. 
Your brain just works 
a little differently 
than others, 
turns things around, 
backwards. 
Sound right? 
So i'm stupid. 
I don't see things 
like everyone else. 
No, you don't. 
As it happens, 
most dyslexics are smart, 
really smart -- 
way above normal, 
often excelling 
in visual arts. 
But when it comes 
to reading and writing 
that's where they have 
the trouble. 
<IMG SRC="396679BF.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="396679BF.JPG" ALIGN=right>
<p>
This is 
our fault, auggie, 
for not catching it 
sooner. 
Problems like this 
can slip by 
for years in school. 
But we've seen it 
before. 
We should have 
noticed sooner. 
I apologize, auggie. 
I do. 
Things are going 
to start getting 
better, augg'. 
We know how 
to deal with it. 
I promise. 
<p>
Oh, back off, twig. 
I was trying to help. 
<IMG SRC="wtl02.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="wtl02.jpg" ALIGN=left>You needed it. 
I don't need anything from you, all right? 
I am so sick of you.  You're not a little kid anymore. 
You've got 
some problems, 
and if you don't deal with them 
you think they're going to get any better? 
These people want to help. 
They're here to help. 
Don't be so stupid. 
Shut up. 
Yeah, you're stupid.  
If you can't see 
when people really 
care about you, you really are stupid. 
<p>
Thanks, dad, 
for meeting me here
on such short notice. 
So is this 
about the loan? 
Yeah, dad, it's about the loan. 
<IMG SRC="wtl01.jpg" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="wtl01.jpg" ALIGN=right>Because, believe me, 
it's not a problem. 
In fact, it's... 
Well, you go ahead. 
Well, the point is 
that chloe told me --  
Chloe told me 
that she's pulled together 
a group of investors, 
mostly old friends. 
It would just be awkward 
at this point to refuse 
after all of her hard work. 
You understand? 
Well, then, I -- I don't want 
to hurt her feelings. 
Dear chloe. 
You're sure, son? 
I'm positive
I could arrange 
a guarantee. I mean 
it's really not a problem. 
<IMG SRC="39667A37.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667A37.JPG" ALIGN=left>Don't sweat it, dad. 
We're covered. 
You know, I'm here 
if you need me. 
I know, dad. And 
I love you. 
Well... 
Perhaps you can come back 
sometime soon, 
we can work on 
the squash game. 
I'd like that very much. 
<p>
Where are they? 
<p>
You ready, Pee-Wee? 
I'm sorry. 
Say again? 
I was dealing 
my own house, man. 
I was a jerk... 
And I'm sorry. 
You think that's good enough? 
<IMG SRC="39667A79.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667A79.JPG" ALIGN=right>hey, it's all I got. 
You got to give me something. 
One shot. 
I got that coming. 
Mmmm
I'm going to kill him. 
<p>
All right. 
That's your shot. 
Ahh! 
Ha-ha-ha-ha. 
<p>
What, it didn't 
even go one round? 
Yeah. 
That looks like fun. 
Shelby. 
Come on in! 
You in? 
<p>
Frank, 
what are you doing? 
Ah, summer 
in the mountains. 
Nothing like it, huh? 
<IMG SRC="39667AE8.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667AE8.JPG" ALIGN=left>Makes you feel young. 
Frank, this is crazy. 
We can't-- 
no, no, 
give them a minute. 
I mean, even our kids 
need to be kids sometimes. 
And of course tomorrow, 
they'll chop enough wood 
to build an ark. 
<p>
That's bad. 
You coming? 
No, I look like 
a cow when i'm wet. 
Ah, you look fine, twig. 
You look perfect, jules. 
Yeah, I guess we all got 
our problems, huh? 
Sorry about your notebook. 
It was wrong. 
Nah, you did the right thing. 
<IMG SRC="39667B1B.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667B1B.JPG" ALIGN=right>you know, 
I got a... 
I got a disorder. 
I can't remember the name 
but, uh, it's for real. 
I owe you. 
You don't have to. 
<p>
You need this money, 
peter. 
I'm happy 
to make it happen. 
I just don't know. 
For old times' sake? 
Can I have some time 
to think about it? 
You let me know. 
I've learned some things in the past seven years. 
Patience, for one. 
The good things are 
worth waiting for. 
<p>
Hey, five minutes. 
<IMG SRC="39667B65.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667B65.JPG" ALIGN=left>You've got pots 
to clean. 
Yeah, yeah. 
<p>
Hey, 
you on kitchen? 
Yeah, until, like, 
the second coming. 
You? 
Woodshed. 
You want to see 
the calluses? 
Um, jeff got 
some books for you. 
Said, like, like
a place to start. 
He said maybe 
I could help, 
if you wanted. 
Ah, I'm not much 
on books, you know? 
He said these would be good for you. 
<IMG SRC="39667B8E.JPG" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=120 ALT="39667B8E.JPG" ALIGN=right> Here, 
read it to me. 
Go away. 
Come on, you got 
to start somewhere. 
It's just me, right?
