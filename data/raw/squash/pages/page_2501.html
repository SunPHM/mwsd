<A HREF="http://www.sunwatch.org/index.html" TARGET="display">Sunwatch
Prehistoric Village</A>. Located on the bank of the Great Miami River in
Dayton, about forty minutes away, Sunwatch is a reconstructed Hopewell Indian
village which appears much as the original did over 800 years ago.
<IMG WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="140" ALT="Sunwatch Prehistoric Village" BORDER="0"
    ALIGN="Left" SRC="0107_sun-logo2.jpg">Archaeologists have built thatch-roof
huts of sticks and twigs plastered with mud, and planted gardens with sunflowers,
corn, squash, and beans. They used the original foundations, which can be
detected from the holes where the wooden posts were once set. Every effort
has been taken to make the reconstruction as accurate as possible.
<P>
Aunt Linda didn't go with us today. This is the only day she has stayed home.
She needed to do some housecleaning and was happy to let Grandpa spend the
day with us by himself.
<P>
After we got back home, we all went King's Island to see their Fourth of
July Fireworks Spectacular. It really was impressive. The fireworks were
launched from two widely separated locations, with the landmark Eiffel Tower
in the middle. Fireworks were launched from the tower as well. The whole
show, which lasted nearly twenty minutes, was computer-choreographed to a
musical soundtrack which played throughout the park. There were <B><I>a
lot</I></B> of people - the park was very full, and we waited a long time
to get out of the parking lot. When we got home, the neighbors in the apartments
on the other side of the woods were shooting off fireworks until well after
midnight. They were big fireworks, too; almost professional quality. The
cats stayed inside; they don't like fireworks.
