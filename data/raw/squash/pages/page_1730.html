<h3>Squash</h3>

I play a fair amount of squash these days, although I'm still
learning the game. 

<h3>Skiing</h3>

<p>I also like skiing a lot, and I try to go skiing as much as I
can. I've been skiing in Austria (Axamer Litzum and Kaltenbach,
Zillertal), France (Tignes/Val d'Isere and Val Thorens/Les Trois
Vallees), the US (Georgia, North Carolina, West Virginia, and
Summit County, Colorado), and Canada (<a href=
"http://www.whistler.com/">Blackcomb mountain</a>).</p>

<p>In 1999 I went skiing in Serre Chevalier in France, and in Haute
Nendaz near Verbier in Switserland.</p>

<p>2000 was a French year exclusively, and also a year I only skied
in March. Nicer weather than January, but also lesser snow quality.
I ended up skiing in Les Deux Alpes and La Plagne.</p>

<p>In 2002 I skied in Chamonix, Champ&egrave;ry, and
Lenzerheide.</p>

<h3>Volleyball</h3>

I used to play a lot of volleyball, but for various reasons I gave
it up pretty much completely a few years ago. 

<h3>Other sports</h3>

<p>I've been climbing a few times, and I thought that was good fun
as well. While living in the US I also made a couple of rafting
trips, and that really was a lot of fun. Too bad decent rivers are
pretty far away from where I live in the Netherlands.</p>
