<P>With so many exceptional dining venues in New Orleans, where do you go for a dining experience that surpasses the traditional evening out? Try <B>Muriel&#146;s Jackson Square, New Orleans</B>, located at 801 Chartres Street, New Orleans.  </P>
<B>
<P>Muriel&#146;s</B> mission is to provide their guests with an experience of refined dining in an atmosphere that enhances and entertains. <B>Muriel&#146;s</B> is located in a meticulously restored 19<SUP>th</SUP> century historic brick structure. There are several dining options: a bistro, a courtyard, elegant dining rooms, and an after dinner soiree solon, luxurious and exotic, like a sultan&#146;s intimate living room, complete with handmade chocolates and truffles. </P>

<P>Start with the &quot;<B>Seared Foie Gras, Apples, Mustard Sauce&quot;</B> ($14) or the room-temperature &quot;<B>Foie Gras Torchon, Oxtail-Truffle Gel&eacute;e&quot;</B> ($14). Either choice is presented with traditional accompaniments to contrast with the rich foie gras. Next, consider the <B>&quot;Shellfish Bouillabaisse&quot;</B> ($9), listed as an appetizer, for an original, sweet rendition of a French classic. Both the foie gras and the bouillabaisse were enhanced by sips of <B>Piper Sonoma n/v</B>  sparkling ($7), offered by the glass. </P>

<P>Don&#146;t miss the <B>&quot;Endive and Watercress, Roquefort and Candied Walnut Salad&quot;</B> ($8.50) or the <B>&quot;Smoked Duck Salad with Fried Portobello, Feta&quot;</B>  ($9), a delicious way to refresh and cleanse the palate. </P>

<P>The entrees includ carefully selected seasonal specialties, such as <B>&quot;Crispy Soft-shell Crabs with Roasted Corn Coulis, Tomatillo Drizzle, and Avocado Salsa&quot; </B>($26) and the <B>&quot;Grilled Lemon Fish, French Beans, Ginger Beurre Noisette&quot;</B> ($21), as well as the tried and true roasted duck described as <B>&quot;Roasted Duck with Spaghetti Squash, Potato Pan Cake, Braised Shallots, Red Eye Demi&quot;</B> ($18), and the pork loin, described as <B>&quot;Pork Loin, Crabmeat, Wild Mushrooms and Calvados Gastrique&quot;</B> ($18.50). </P>

<P>Throughout the meal the high quality produce and extremely fresh fish and meat impressed us.  We spoke with the <B>Executive Chef, Devlin Rousel,</B> who told us he took particular care in choosing produce. He had located quality local boutique producers and growers.  He also told us about his own fishing and hunting experience. What a guy&#150;chef and outdoor&#146;s man!  He told us he looked for and found excellent fresh fish and meat for <U>Muriel&#146;s</U>.  </P>

<P>Every entr&eacute;e included surprising, non-traditional touches of brilliance to accompany the course. For example, <B>Muriel&#146;s </B>superb Roast Duck came with Spaghetti Squash, Potato Pan Cake, and Braised Shallots in a Demi sauce. These accompaniments were succulent and delicious. The Pork Loin was served with crabmeat, wild mushrooms and calvados gastrique, a rich and moist compliment to the pork loin. </P>

<P>Desserts included several selections for chocolate lovers and a bread pudding, cr&egrave;me brulee, and fruit crisp, <B>&quot;Peach and Blueberry Crisp with Ginger Cream&quot;</B> ($6). What a way to end a meal with flair!  One should also note that <B>Muriel&#146;s</B> had an especially fine cheese course, the  <B>&quot;Daily Cheese Selection&quot;</B> ($12). <B>Chef Delvin Rousel</B> told us he once made cheese and was therefore presenting carefully selected artisan cheeses. &quot;In New Orleans,&quot; he explained, &quot;people eat cheese at the beginning of a meal, and also at the end.&quot; </P>

<P>The wines by the glass were varied and strayed from the traditional selections to offer breadth and depth for those who enjoy the opportunity to pair each course with a different wine. For example, from the &quot;Wines By The Glass List&quot; we had <B>Schuetz-Oles Korte Ranch Napa Valley 1998 Zinfandel</B> ($7.50).  This was a good valued Zin that paired well with the duck course. </P>

<P>All in all, <B>Muriel&#146;s</B> lives up to its vision of providing an extraordinary dining experience, particularly, when you are invited to the salon for chocolates and cordials. What could better epitomize the New Orleans experience of fine wine and food in a lovely and entertaining environment than an evening at <B>Muriel&#146;s!</B> </P>
