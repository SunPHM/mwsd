			<p>Well, it&#8217;s been a very busy couple of weeks, with more busy-ness upcoming, and the garden has admittedly been neglected. Also, my camera is in the shop, so there aren&#8217;t even any photos of the neglect. However, things keep growing dispite us. We picked a dozen gorgeous tomatoes yesterday - a combo of golden, cherry, patio and plum. Real serious tomato deliciousness. The tomatoes are still ripening dispite the fact that they have few leaves to protect them from the sun. If we had time, we would build a sun screen for them so they don&#8217;t get burnt. We&#8217;ll try, in the next week, to get some new plants in that we&#8217;ll harvest in late September. Perhaps salad greens and bush peas. But it&#8217;s a crazy upcoming 2 weeks. The Republican National Convention is coming to New York, and we are doing lots of documenting and participating in the huge creative protests that will happen.

			<p>Another beautiful day, pleasent like September, a welcome respite from the New York August heat and humidity.  We had a lot of work to do on the garden - those tomatoe plants that had not yet been staked, since they seemed to have stalk enough to bear the weight of the burgeoning fruit, had fallen over from the clustered green orbs of their success.  Many leaves have died on the patio tomatoes due to the leaf mold attack, they look like they&#8217;ve been sprayed with a defoliant, and yet they are still bearing fruit.  Many of their tomatoes are ripening small, which makes me wonder if the defoliation or the constriction of root space is causing them to behave as if there is a crises, and therefore ripening (and more importantly for the plant, seeding) sooner.  This leads to another thought, Do Plants Think, but i&#8217;ll save that for the rooftop philosophy corner.</p>
	<p>We took in an amazing harvest of eggplant, cuccumber, tomatoes, rosemary and hot peppers and <a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/weblog/index.php?p=12">more</a>.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/harvest-807.jpg" alt="harvest" /><br />
<br />
I found myself conflicted about taking the vegetables - it was so interesting to watch them grow, and to see the plants fat with fruit.  Also, the ripening vegetables are the evidence of the viability of the garden - so great to show people.  And yet, these plants are grown with the intention that they produce food that is harvested.  So that&#8217;s what we did.</p>
	<p>I realize that I have a rather absurd relationship to the plants.  They are my babies, I shed a tear when we had to dig up the zucchini and squash (root rot,<a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/weblog/index.php?p=10"> grub nasties</a>).  I take the attacks of leaf eating beattles personally, and yet the whole point of growing plants is to be able to exploit them for one&#8217;s own use, to eat them or enjoy the beauty of their blooms.  All living things seem to use each other to get what they need, and when that works out things thrive.  Or is that just a perspective?  Maybe the cynic uses and the optimist contributes.  Which one are you?  Which one am I?

	<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about some of the things we&#8217;ve learned so far:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>catch disease and pests early and have treatments ready early. spray with organic stuff like hot pepper wax spray even before seeing signs of distress</li>
	<li>stake stuff up! the eggplants are falling over, their roots emerging from the ground, because of the weight</li>
	<li>choose plants that have small fruit or are made for container growing</li>

			<p>This morning we went up to get one of the crashed sqaush plants.  Its kind of striking how they all just completely fell over yesterday.  We knew they were struggling for a while but then it seems as though they all just said &#8220;ok, that&#8217;s it&#8221; and collapsed.  We wanted to dig up one of the plants to send it in to the Cornell Extention lab so they could do some analysis and tell us what exactly was responsible for taking the plants down.</p>
	<p>I dug up as much of the root as I could with a trowel, trying not to separate the plant from the roots at the mushy middle that had been most attacked.  Some separation was unavoidable, however, and as the plant came up the root stem opened to reveal&#8230; <br /><img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/squash-worm-sm-93.jpg" alt="squash eating wormy beast" /><br />
<br />
a fat and sassy white grub of some kind that has been making a nice home for himself in the squash.  It had hollowed out the root and as I brought the plant up with the trowel it slunk away from the light of day into its little root cave.  We put the plant, with it&#8217;s inhabitant, into a plastic ziploc and sent it off to the interrogation rooms at Cornell.  Now, I should mention that the jury is still out, and the question in my mind is will we find compatriots of this fiendish little beastie in the other affected plants, or is there something else going on as well?  It seems a pretty clear case that the fat white grub eating away at the root of the plant was responsible for the destruction, but we also saw other little mites - our first thought was nemotoads - so it could be a combination of things.</p>
	<p>Have a look at the whole <a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/squash-rot.htm">history </a>of the squash plants &#8230; a sad yet oft told tale.  It seems that what we like to eat, other things do too.

Some neighbors were grilling and they oohed and aahed over the large cucumber and abundant parsley. We staked up the cotton, which - I&#8217;m a northern girl - I had never seen before planting it. It has these feathery leafy pre-bloom things and then pink flowers. Haven&#8217;t seen any indication of something cotton-like. The bees love it, but the wind is giving it a problem. It looks like it wants more space for its roots as well - it has pretty splindly stalks.</p>

After 7 years of hard work, it is wild and full, with all sorts of grasses and flowers, shot through with crafted brick walkways. We talked to Avigal, who said it needs little work these days, aside from weeding and dead-heading. I hadn&#8217;t thought about dead-heading for a while, and so this evening did a bit on the cosmos which are frankly looking a bit sad and old and generally tired of their bright orange-ness.</p>
	<p>We also sprayed some more baking soda mixture on the increasingly wilty patio tomato leaves and some hot pepper wax spray on the cherry tomatoes. At this point, we&#8217;re just hoping that both stay alive long enough for their many green tomato clusters to ripen. </p>

			<p>Problems. </p>
	<p><a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos.blog3.html"><img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/tomatoes-patio-leaf2-sm-730.jpg" width="108" height="108"" alt="tomato spots" align="right"></a><strong>Problem 1: Patio Tomato Leaf Spots. </strong>The patio tomatoes have white spots on the leaves, which are looking more and more wilted. There are still tons of green tomatoes on the plants, but it looks like the nutrients are being stripped from the leaves. </p>
	<p>I wonder if people smoking on the roof has transferred this leaf mold to the patio tomatoes. Strange that some disease on a plant in North Carolina or somewhere could make it’s way, through processing and travel, to our roof.</p>
	<p>But, how to counteract this leaf mold? It may in fact be something else. <a href="http://www.shopapspress.org/41205.html">There are whole books devoted to the various diseases that tomatoes can get</a>. </p>
	<p>So, we have to try and identify this thing. Cooperative extention services are one way. My mom says that she goes to her local one with a plant clipping and they put it under a microscope which projects onto a big screen. Cornell Cooperative Extension Service has a branch in NYC, but you have to <a href="http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/sample_submission_2.htm">mail plant samples to Ithaca for diagnosis</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos.blog3.html"><img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/tomatoes-patio-leaf-sm-730.jpg" alt="patio tomatoes with spots on leaves" align="right"></a>Also, it always makes sense to ask other gardeners in the area. They are dealing with the same conditions and many of the same diseases floating around. Gardening on the roof may be slightly different and present different problems than plot gardening on the ground, but I’ll try asking around. I would love to hook up with some other city rooftop gardeners.</p>
	<p>There are also some good <a href="http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/pathology/tomato.html">online resources for identifying disease</a>. </p>
	<p>Even before we identify this thing, we have to try to fight it. There are organic fungicides out there. Research on the web has brought up these solutions: neem oil, 5 teaspoons of baking soda to 1 gallon of water, copper spray, sulfur (<a href="http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/greenline/03v1/07.html">the oldest fungicide! Used by ancient greeks!)</a>, milk, and apple cider vinegar. Here’s more on good <a href="http://www.ghorganics.com/page15.html">easy organic fungicides</a>.</p>
	<p>There aren’t many places in the city that I’ve found that sell organic stuff, except for a couple products at the fancy and expensive Chelsea Garden Center. There are places to <a href="http://www.gardensalive.com/prog_display.asp?PROG_NBR=5&#038;NAV=2">order online</a>.<br />
Anyway, I think this high humidity and heat recently has caused some of these problems.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos.blog3.html"><img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/zucchini-rotting-sm-724.jpg" width="108" height="108"" alt="rotting summer squash" align="right" border="0"></a><strong>Problem 2: Rotting squash.</strong> This is really mysterious. The zucchini and summer squash plants are getting all grey and alien-looking at the roots. The squashes themselves have been rotting. After a little checking around, I thought it might be the dreaded <a href="http://www.growinglifestyle.com/us/article/s0/a159577.html">Phytophthora Root Rot</a> or <a href="http://www.growinglifestyle.com/us/article/s0/a159570.html">Fusarium Crown and Foot Rot</a>, but both make the plants die within a few days.</p>
	<p>I did find out that squash, cucumbers and pumpkins are called cucurbits, which is really more cute than they deserve. Also, I’m going to have apocalyptic nightmares based on this: In young melon, cucumber and watermelon plants: damping-off, stem collapse, and death. In older plants: yellowing, stunting, wilting, and death. The disease is established wherever cucurbits are grown.</p>
	<p>Okay, more research at another <a href="http://www.backyardgardener.com/alive/">handy fun plant disease finder online</a>. Perhaps it’s Root Rot Nemotodes! How exciting! 1/50” long “eel-worms” with thin, translucent bodies, they can be destroyed by good nemotodes. You just buy the good guys and then the war starts – unfortunately too small to see but I imagine a macrocosmic star wars where all the characters are worms and the Death Star a rotting cherry tomato. Anyway, the sign of bad nemotodes is that “Roots have swellings, galls, or knots in which the nematodes live.” I’m not sure that necessarily describes the problem.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos.blog3.html"><img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/squash-rootrot2-sm-730.jpg" width="108" height="108"" alt="horrifying zucchini root" align="right" border="0"></a>It looks like it may more likely be Fungal fruit and root rot. You’re supposed to submit a sample somewhere for diagnosis of this. I think for now we’ll spray the baking soda and mixture on both the tomatoes and squash – it sounds like it’s a fungal problem for both. Also, we’ll strip off the problem leaves and clean up the rotting ones on the soil.</p>
	<blockquote><p>Mix 1 tablespoon baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil with one gallon of water. Shake this up very thoroughly. To this mix add 1/2 teaspoon of pure Castile soap and spray. Be sure to agitate your sprayer while you work to keep the ingredients from separating. Cover upper and lower leaf surfaces and spray some on the soil. Repeat every 5-7 days as needed.</p></blockquote>
	<p><a href="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos.blog3.html"><img src="http://www.overainslie.org/roofgarden/photos/eggplant-holes-sm-76.jpg" border="0" alt="eggplant leaves with holes" align="right" /></a><strong>Problem3: Hole-y Eggplant.</strong> The eggplants have tiny holes in the leaves like large pinpricks. This is apparently <a href="http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/pathology/eggplant.html#eggplant.">flea beetles</a> . They are very <a href="http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/fleabeetle.html">hard to get rid of</a>, but –yes!- they can be controlled by the good nemotodes! You can <a href="http://www2.oardc.ohio-state.edu/nematodes/nematode_suppliers.htm">order nemotodes online</a>. Neem oil and garlic spray are also listed as good controls, as is planting mint nearby.</p>
	<p>Which reminds me – our mint plant is missing! We had just a small pot of it sitting in the middle of the picnic table and it has mysteriously disappeared.</p>
	<p>Ah, but, cherry tomatoes are ripening, the eggplants are growing bigger than the plants they&#8217;re attached to, the flowers continue to bloom, and the bees are happy.</p>

			<p>After a few hours in the garden, kicking back with a cold one and taking in the view can very quickly lead to philosophizing.  As I was watching a bee buzz around the fluted blossoms of the flowers, burying its head deep in those blooms with pollen to offer, I was struck by the remarkable collaboration of nature.  We often hear about the competitive model of nature, how species thrive or die in a constant brutal struggle for survival.  We tend to use this example as a rationale for the competitive models of human society, such as the marketplace (capitalism) or the various means in which man actualizes his will through force, either over the natural world or over other people, and there is implicit in the lesson that this is the way of things, this is practical and to be accepted.  There is also the idea that a cooperative human model is possible, one that would seek to meet the basic needs of human life and strive to better the world.  Those who promote such a potentiality often present such an approach as being part of the evolution of the human species, that the competitive model is a primitive state that we need to move beyond in the interest of our own survival.</p>
	<p>What I realized watching the little bee is that the cooperative model is just as primitive, if not more so, then the competitive model.  All life, it seems, is dependent on a complex accident of cooperation where various species pursuing their own interests (survival) work to benefit the survival of other species; a true symbiosis.  And we can see this process as being the essential source of the vast diversity of life that exists on Earth.</p>
	<p>Competition has defined much of how life has developed, but without cooperation, there would not have been any life forms around to compete.</p>

			<p>Well, this is the first update I’ve written, and the garden was planted five weeks ago.  We’re going to go back and write more about the process leading up to this point, but I’m going to jump in here, where we are today.</p>
	<p>We just came down from the roof, and I’m amazed on the growth.  We’ve had a lot of rain over the past week, including a veritable deluge yesterday, but the containers and vermiculite soil provided excellent drainage once the soil became saturated, so my worries of finding the roof strewn with the flotsam of our garden were unfounded.</p>
	<p>The tomatoes were in dire need of staking and re-staking, becoming so heavy with fruit that some where toppling over.  Only the cherry tomatoes have ripened so far, but that has presented a problem, one we anticipated but hoped would be avoidable – insects.</p>
	<p>Of course, we wanted some insects, bees in particular, and they were the first to arrive, after only 2 weeks or so.  I was wondering if we would get bees, given the elevated situation of the garden, and the high winds we often have up there.  And of course, without bees and other bugs, plants cannot cross pollinate.  I wondered it we would have a garden of fruitless blossoms.  Some plants, I have learned, can self-pollinate, growing both male and female flowers on the same plant, and others can be pollinated by the wind.  But bees and other bugs are incredibly important to the whole fruiting process.</p>
	<p>But the bees did find us, and the plants now bearing fruit include the tomatoes, which are growing faster then we can keep up with, squash, zucchini, cucumber, eggplant, and a variety of peppers.  The herbs, such as basil, thyme, rosemary, oregano, parley, mint and borage (used in herbal remedies, Rebecca tells me, I’ve not tried it) are also doing really well.  We are actually producing more food then we can actually use.</p>
	<p>But following close on the wings of the bees, and at least one very welcome ladybug, came other critters not so welcome.  Many of the cherry tomatoes looked as if they’d be feasted upon by vampires, shriveled husks of their former selves.  Which in a sense they had.  Wave you’re hand over the plants and you will see a remarkable flurry of winged life of the small, really small and barely visible variety.  Remain still and watch as the creatures return to their feasting, a rich variety of flies and mites arranging themselves around the table.</p>
	<p>We have learned from Carol, of Plants a la Carte, that hot pepper wax is the thing to use to combat these ravenous guests.  We found some that is relatively organic and once the rains stop for at least 24 hours we’ll try it.  Check back for updates on the battle for the cherry tomatoes.</p>
