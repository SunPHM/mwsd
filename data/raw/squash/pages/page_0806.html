  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"> <b>NOW IN MY DAY , YOUNG MAN… </b>At the risk 
        of sounding like an old fart, may I take issue with a certain refereeing 
        decision that has changed somewhat in two decades. It came up at the Super 
        Series Finals, in particular in the final, when David Palmer was playing 
        Thierry Lincou. There were half a dozen occasions when Palmer dropped 
        to the front left and Lincou, unable to get through to the ball, asked 
        for a let. Now in my day, twenty three years ago when I first started 
        watching top squash, the referee awarded the incoming striker, a stroke. 
        It was a decision that went without argument unless the drop shot had 
        nicked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"> At Broadgate (and elsewhere recently) the 
        referee has been awarding a let rather than a penalty stroke (and on two 
        occasions unbelievably said no let.) There was the usual admonition to 
        ‘make more effort to get to the ball’ which was surely going against the 
        rules, which state that the outgoing strike should allow the incoming 
        striker full access to the ball, full sight of the front wall and enough 
        room to make his/her stroke. Also in the front corner situation, the outgoing 
        strike should arc back to the T, allowing the incoming striker a direct 
        line to the ball from the T. Palmer was not arcing to the centre, but 
        backing in a straight line, and thus blocking Lincou’s access to the ball.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"> On one occasion, the ball was sitting up around 
        three feet high: had Lincou gotten to the ball he was sure to have hit 
        a winner. He was given just a let and when, in frustration, he complained 
        about the decision, (judging by the spectators’ howls and the remarks 
        of knowledgeable observers, it was certainly a stroke to Lincou) the referee 
        said, ‘Make more effort to go around your opponent,’ or words to that 
        effect. Really? Can a player now hit and block and have the referee support 
        his tactics? Surely it is the outgoing striker’s responsibility to get 
        out of the way. I used to listen endlessly to top ten players griping 
        about Jansher Khan not clearing in that situation and getting away with 
        it. The above in no way implies that Palmer was doing a Jansher. He would 
        have won anyway because Lincou simply ran out of steam in the fifth game. 
        But you can understand why some of the players blow their top at the referees 
        sometimes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>TRAVELLING TOM</b> <br>
        There’s a guy in Philadelphia called Tom Tarantino who is doing more good 
        for squash than any individual has the right. Tom ran the Philadelphia 
        Open for a decade and when he gave that up met up Andrew Shelley in Egypt 
        when he was watching one of the early Al Ahram Pyramid tournaments. He 
        said he wanted to get into squash in a more personal way, and although 
        no-one remembers who came up with the idea, a sort of crusade came into 
        being : taking squash to parts of the world where it is just emerging. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">That first year, 1999, Cassie Jackman, Natalie 
        Grainger and Sarah Fitz-Gerald spread the word in Prague. Sarah went even 
        though she was on crutches from her knee operation. The party included 
        Shelley, media director Howard Harding as well as Tom and his wife Barbara. 
        It was such a success that the following year Natalie Grainger and Sabine 
        Schoene toured El Salvador, Peru and Jamaica.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"> Last year they made a safari to Kenya with 
        a fit Fitz-Gerald and Linda Charman- Smith and this year the Far East 
        - Thailand, Brunei and Sarawak - had two world champions (Sarah and Nicole 
        David) giving exhibitions, clinics and playing the top seniors and juniors 
        in those countries. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">The party always includes Shelley, who is making 
        friends and contacts wherever he goes, Tom and Barbara and Howard Harding 
        , who gives a running account to the squash world via his lap-top. While 
        the host nations supply hotel and food, I estimate that it costs Tom between 
        $15-20,000 a year for his ‘vacation’. And furthermore, nobody gets paid 
        for their services. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">“Sarah is a fantastic asset on these trips. 
        Not only as president of WISPA but also as world number one and world 
        champion. And she does it for no fee,” says an admiring Shelley. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>FABULOUS FACILITIES</b><br>
        Howard Harding was totally gobsmacked (astounded, surprised, overwhelmed) 
        by the facilities he found in the Far East. At the Jerudong Country Club 
        in Brunei, there were two complete Ellis-Pearson 4-wall glass courts, 
        side by side, while in another club there was a three wall glass court 
        (solid front wall) with permanent seating for 500 people. “And they get 
        very little usage,” he tells me. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">While I was on holiday in Madeira I discovered 
    the Quinta Magnolia was just a 100 yards away from my hotel in Funchal. This 
    was a huge estate, a former grand country house, with marvellous rolling gardens 
    full of the most beautiful trees and flowers. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">It is now a government -owned and run leisure 
        centre with tennis courts and an Olympic-sized swimming pool. I was told 
        there was squash and after touring the hills and dales came across a delightful 
        building sitting alone, surrounded by trees. Inside this unique piece 
        of architecture was just one squash court. They just don’t build courts 
        like that any more. Did I tell you it had a garden on the roof? Sadly 
        I didn’t take my racket but I did find out that to rent the court for 
        an hour would have cost me two Euros, which is just a couple of bucks. 
        See the photo above (yes, yours truly at the right) You won’t believe 
        it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>BAJ MIGHT STILL BE THE BMOC</b> <br>
        I spoke to England Squash head man Jeremy Lister at Broadgate Arena during 
        the Super Series. He tells me that the talks with Satinder Bajwa, Harvard 
        head man, are still in progress and there is a good possibility that Baj 
        could be running the British Open next year. I hope he does; I think he 
        needs something to replace the Super Series finals which, I am sorry to 
        say, has seemed to have lost any real meaning. And with no ranking points 
        at stake, some of the players go on court without the same resolve as 
        they normally do. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">June, too, is not ideal, coming in the middle 
        of the summer break. Both Peter Nicol and Thierry Lincou, who both lost 
        to David Palmer, the eventual winner, said that their training had been 
        interrupted to play at Broadgate. Even the normal placid, but determined, 
        Stewart Boswell found the timing was all wrong. He, like Nicol, was in 
        the middle of preparations for the Commonwealth Games. He made the 25,000 
        mile round trip from Brisbane, so he certainly had my sympathy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"> <b>A WORLD CUP INSTEAD?</b><br>
        If Baj doesn’t get the British Open, perhaps he should reinvent the Mennen 
        Cup and call it the World Cup. Put the top player from eight countries 
        in a knockout formula. Right now that would be: Peter Nicol (England), 
        David Palmer (Australia), Jonathon Power (Canada), Thierry Lincou (France), 
        John White (Scotland), Ong Beng Hee (Malaysia), Olli Tuominen (Finland) 
        and Amr Shabana (Egypt). Now that is really not a bad line-up. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS">When Trevor Marshall was doing this in Toronto 
        a decade or so ago, the problem was that all the top players came from 
        Pakistan, England and Australia. Now the first six named above are all 
        in the top ten. Hold it right at the end of the season, after the British 
        Open, while all the players are around and in top form, and you’ve got 
        a sizzler of an event. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>THE MAIDENS ARE BACK</b><br>
        A small footnote to my piece last month about women changing their name 
        upon marriage. Sue Wright decided that nobody knew who Sue Rose was and 
        went back to her maiden name. Cassie Jackman was adamant when she got 
        married that she would change her name to Campion and proudly so. Now 
        she is back to her maiden name of Jackman and will appear as such in all 
        professional matters. Nevertheless, in years to come there will still 
        be some puzzlement at this C. Campion who won many tournaments in 2000/1. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS"><b>MUSICAL MAYHEM</b> <br>
        I shall be brushing off my top hat and tails as well as my musical metaphors 
        for the US Open in September. John Nimick has got it back into Boston’s 
        Symphony Hall and I am wondering whether his budget allows him to hire 
        the Boston Symphony Orchestra to supply a music track to the games. I 
        would certainly suggest the 1812 overture to accompany any match between 
        Palmer and Mark Chaloner. The Sorcerer’s Apprentice might be fitting background 
        music to a Power match. Any further suggestions from Squashtalk readers 
        matching major classical works to players would be appreciated…might even 
        be rewarded with a prize. </font></p></td>
