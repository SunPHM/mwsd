<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>This morning we awoke in Rio
Blanco, the Quichua Indian village where we would have a chance to meet and
interact with the men, women, and children who call the Amazon Rainforest their
home.&nbsp; At 7:30 A.M. we sat down to a breakfast of fried bread, eggs, juice,
and fruit.&nbsp; Our meals, served at tables overlooking a small Amazon river,
impressed upon us the beauty of the Amazon.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast we put
swimsuits on under our clothes and prepared for a hike through the rainforest,
upstream to a waterfall, a place that was said to be good for swimming and
relaxing, something we all looked forward to after the many days of work at
Jatun Sacha.&nbsp; During the hike, about halfway to the waterfall, we got an
unexpected treat, a vine swing.&nbsp; Augusteen, our Quichua guide and Shaman
for the village, reinforced the vine so that we could sit or stand on it without
falling off.&nbsp; He dem<img border="0" src="Rainfo1.jpg" width="265" height="205" align="left">onstrated
how to use the vine swing, which was attached to a tall tree, to swing out over
the rainforest floor.&nbsp; We all took turns and enjoyed swinging back and
forth while others captured the moment on film.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refreshed from our stop and the
vine swing, we continued down the narrow Amazon trail to what we hoped would be
a couple of hours of swimming and fun at the waterfall.&nbsp; As we got close to
the waterfall, we spotted a large snake on the river's edge.&nbsp; Maybe five
feet long, the black snake, with yellow and white marking on front, darted into
the river upon our approach, moving easily through the water and forest beyond.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reaching the waterfall proved
somewhat challenging toward the end.&nbsp; We had to descend a steep, muddy hill
to climb down into the river valley.&nbsp; Once there, we found not one
waterfall but several with the largest one, our final destination,
upstream.&nbsp; Carefully working our way over rocks and through the swiftly
moving water, we reached a magnificent waterfall.&nbsp; It stood about eight
feet tall and had a nice pool for swimming.&nbsp; One only had to be careful not
to get too near the downstream edge and be swept downriver.&nbsp; We enjoyed
swimming back and forth in front of the waterfall, and some of our group even
climbed up the rocks beside the waterfall.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a time, we had to head
back to the Indian village, but we didn't go back the same way that we
came.&nbsp; After a short hike back down the trail, we met up with some more
Quichua Indians that had brought small dugout canoes upriver to transport us
back to the village.&nbsp; The ride was exciting. The river <img border="0" src="Rainfo2.jpg" width="272" height="202" align="left">had
some areas so shallow that we got stuck and some small rapids that were fun to
ride through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two o'clock in the
afternoon we ended up back at the Indian village, just in time for lunch.&nbsp;
Lunch consisted of rice, beets, green beans, fired yucca and a small fish.&nbsp;
After lunch we had free time to swim, sleep, or just take life easy.&nbsp;
Around four-thirty in the afternoon, we gathered in the main lodge for lessons
on how the Quichuas lived.&nbsp; The Indians made fish traps and baskets from
leaves, and we watched a women make thread<img border="0" src="Rainfo3.jpg" align="right" width="279" height="210">
from leaves that would be used to made bags.&nbsp; We even had a chance to help
them, which turned out to be a great learning experience on our part.&nbsp; Some
in our group even had a chance to take target practice with the eight-foot blow
guns the Indians used for hunting.&nbsp; The Indians are much better at this
that we are.</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an
evening meal of hearts of palm - which tastes like shrip - fried yucca, green
squash, and noodles, the natives showed us some of their dances.&nbsp; We
observed a war, peace, and <img border="0" src="Rainfo4.jpg" width="275" height="204" align="left">bridal
dance.&nbsp; The Indians also sang to us.&nbsp; Afterwards, we did our cultural
exchange by showing them card tricks, a human knot activity, a clapping game,
and string pictures.&nbsp; Then, we all danced a few dances together, handed out
the presents we had brought with us - school supplies, games, and shirts - and
listened to a thank you and welcome speech by Augusteen.&nbsp; Finally, we were
able to make our way back to our cabins for the night.&nbsp; The day has been
fun and exciting, and tomorrow we hike out of the rainforest back to Jatun Sacha.&nbsp;</b></p>
