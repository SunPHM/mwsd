<p align="left">Remember, when you play in sanctioned tournaments, your results 
will count toward ratings. So for the system to work accurately (like a true 
golf handicap), we should all play in more sanctioned events. The USSRA is 
working toward rating every squash player, and Houston has over 130 rated 
players; the highest ratio of rated players to total membership in the country. 
Mind you, there are still some glitches that stand out, but in time they will be 
ironed out. As far as I'm concerned, it's working well - I'm ranked ahead of 
super-brat Bruce Crane. Go to the&nbsp; Rankings (HOU) link on the homepage.</p>
<p align="left"><FONT COLOR="green" face="Times New Roman">January 24th, 2006</Font></p>
<p align="left">I just heard through my counterpart at SESRA that about 40 players from Atlanta will be heading 
up to Yale for the US Nationals in March. Shouldn't we be thinking in terms of 
sending a squad as well? It's been a while since Houstonians have traveled en 
masse to tournaments; we used to make an annual pilgrimage to New Orleans back 
when Pat Wells enticed us with beads and beer, but that seems like ages ago. The 
trash talking brat pack (all the punks you see playing at the Met with their caps on 
backwards) should think about putting a group together for a trip to Yale; let 
the HSRA know if we can help in any way.</p>

<p align="left">After three years of hard work as the Ladder Commissioner, Kevin 
Darby has handed over the reigns to Danny Walker. We all welcome Danny into this 
new role; I hope you'll all support him by continuing to participate in the 
ladder. I can't even begin to thank Kevin for all that he's done for the HSRA. 
There are &quot;talkers&quot; and there are &quot;doers&quot;; Kevin definitely falls into the 
latter category. Every single ladder participant owes him a thank you, or at the 
very least, a pint of beer.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">Happy New Year. Here's a news flash; super thrifty Bruce Crane 
has finally bought a car. Just in time too; he was fast running out of friends 
willing to give him a ride to places (he once made an unsuspecting friend take 
him to pick up a date - true story). Anyway, he can now participate in 
tournaments at the University and Westlake Clubs and actually get there on time 
(riding a bicycle to those venues from downtown took longer than he 
anticipated). Speaking of cars, check out the

<p align="left">We've all got stories to tell about how we lost a match because 
of poor refereeing decisions. While we may not agree with the referee's decision 
on a call or two, we must recognize that we, as players, are not exactly 
unbiased, nor are we in the best position to make a call. Being on court rather 
than outside, where the entire picture is better viewed, puts us in an inferior 
position to make decisions on most let calls. In any event,&nbsp; the bottom 
line is that we don't lose squash matches because of the referee; we lose a 
match because either, 1) the opponent is a better player, or 2) we played 
particularly badly that day, for whatever reason (the court sucks, is my 
personal favorite). What we need to know as players is that the rules of squash 
dictate that the players can NOT request a change of referee once a match has 
begun. So it can be argued that the mere act of asking for a change of referee 
by a player constitutes a violation of the rules, and may be dealt with under 
Rule 17 (conduct on court). Here's some good advice if you don't like a 
particular call - 
shake it off and play on.</p>

<p align="left">For the 18th time in its 19 year history, the GrandMasters has 
broken the 100 entry mark, this time a full 3 weeks before the tournament. If 
you plan on playing in this fantastic Atlanta tournament, it is important to get 
your entries in as soon possible. The Tournament Director, Tom Rumpler, will be 
traveling over the next few days and will NOT be able to entertain last minute 
entries. I strongly encourage you to play in this tournament if you are able; 
it's a good one. </p>

<p align="left">Please note that Muhammad Sadiq will be doing an exhibition 
match with Ryan Donegan on Tuesday, November 15th at the Met Club. Ryan is a PSA 
Top 200 player, and is currently ranked No. 8 in the US. Although they reside in&nbsp; 
New Orleans, Ryan and his father Jeff Kindle have long been HSRA members. Jeff 
is currently living in Houston temporarily due to hurricane Katrina. Ryan, when 
not playing PSA tournaments, trains in England.</p>

<p align="left">Keith Christman, long time Sports Director at the Downtown Club 
at the Met says that we had a good squash showing at the Linda Lorelle Charity 
event, which was held this past weekend. Almost 40 players participated 
in the event and the squash portion of the tournament contributed approximately $2,000 to the charity. 
Well done, Muhammad!</p>

<p align="left">Last Thursday, during the Hurricane Rita scare, I received an 
e-mail followed by a phone call from Jamal Al-Awadi. Jamal has long been a 
fixture on the squash scene in Dallas and is now one of the top 40+ players. We met 
during one of my visits to Dallas last year, and in fact we played each other in 
the final of the 40+ draw. The purpose of his call was to offer me, and anyone 
else from the HSRA, refuge at his house in Dallas should it be required. 
Although I, or anyone else, didn't need to take him up on his offer, I was 
extremely touched by this show of unselfish hospitality. If you get a moment, 
please take the time to thank Jamal for his kind offer. His e-mail address is

<p align="left">Muhammad Sadiq demonstrated his dominance yet again, winning the 
final of the 9th Annual ICS Top 32 in three straight games. With a win next year 
he will catch up to Guy Cowan, who currently has the most number of wins to date 
(he dominated this tournament in the mid 90s before ICS became the title sponsor 
when it was played at the Met Club, and won in 2001 as well). The
<a href="2005Top32.xls">final standings</a> proved the accuracy of the seeding - 
the top 9 players ended up in the exact positions that they were expected.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Hats off to Guy Cowan for running this tournament while playing in it (we all 
know how difficult it is to play your best when your mind is on a million other 
things), and to <a href="AndyForster.jpg">Andy Forster</a> for once again sponsoring this fantastic event. The 
results for every match will be personally entered into the USSRA rating system 
by Andy. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that each and every 
participant is a fully paid up current member of the USSRA, so the results of 
every match will count toward ratings (go to main page for photos).</p>

<p align="left">Longtime Houston squash player Ed Hlopak offers his input on the 
eye-guard debate. Read his letter to the HSRA
<a href="President_corner/hlopakoneyeguards.htm">here</a>. Ed has played top 
level squash in Houston since the late 80s and used to coach squash at the YMCA 
for years. This letter is an eye opener.</p>
<p align="left"><FONT COLOR="green" face="Times New Roman">July 14th, 2005</Font></p>
<p align="left">For years we've debated whether or not the wearing of eye-guards 
should be mandatory. The main argument against (usually by foreign born players) is that a player's vision is 
sometimes obstructed while wearing eye-guards, thus putting him/her at a 
disadvantage. When I first started playing in the US, I too used this absurd 
logic. However, it wasn't long before eye-guards became a part of my essential 
equipment and I became a strong proponent of their enforced inclusion; in fact, 
here in Houston only Dave Karohl, Andy Forster and Dave Matthes have been as 
vocal on this subject.&nbsp; While no one enjoys a good debate more than 
me, this one is a waste of time and should not be indulged any further by 
intelligent people (try explaining to airline personnel that you'd rather not 
buckle in during take-off and landing because the seat belt wrinkles your 
shirt!). Rather than exhaust myself with all the reasons it makes sense to wear 
eye-guards, I suggest you read the extremely well 
written article by Will Carlin in the latest issue of Squash Magazine.

used to be the No. 1 ranked player in the US when he suffered a serious eye 
injury after being hit with a squash ball.</p>

and take questions from the spectators. Many thanks to Muhammad Sadiq for

matches 3 - 1 in spite of the referee giving the local favorites a couple of 
generous calls!. Also, we thank Mark Frankland for hosting Ben on this visit. In 
the future, please consider making small donations to ensure that we are able to

The following is the letter I recd. from the CEO of the PSA, which I would
like to share with you all:

29TH APRIL 2004

Dear Colleagues,

Following the recent release on the topic of the new PSA scoring system, to
be introduced very shortly at the Brit Insurance Super Series Finals, please
also receive here confirmation of the detail of the reform:
<br>

1. Each game is scored up to 11 (eleven) points, point a rally.
<br>
2. Matches are best of 5 (five) games.
<br>
3. Rest in between games to remain as per PSA rules (two minutes).
<br>
4. a). If the game score reaches 10-10 (ten all) there is no election by the
receiver. A player must win the game/match by two clear points.
<br>
b). The Marker to call: "10-10 (ten all), tiebreaker, player to win by two
clear points, 0-0 (love all) play". This announcement to be made only for
the first
game. Thereafter Marker to call from second game on, at 10-10 (ten all):
"10-10 (ten all), tiebreaker".
<br>
c). The Marker to then to call the score as: "1-0 game ball (or match
ball)", then "1-1", then "2-1 game ball (or match
ball)", then "3-1 game to ** (match to **)".
<br>
d). Service to continue as per current PSA rules.
<br>
5. The game score is then recorded, for all purposes, as: 11-10 (3-1). All
scores are recorded with 11 as the pre-fix.
<br>

Thank you in anticipation of your continued good will and assistance during
this exciting and important reform period.
<br>

Best wishes,
<br>
Gawain Briars.
<br>
Chief Executive, PSA.

An extremely important point that a referee must remember is the timing of an 
appeal by a player. <a href="President_corner/The_rules_timing_of_appeals.htm">Click and Read document</a>

Every Squash player should know the basic line of thinking in order for a 
referee to render the correct decision. Once the basics have been mastered,
there are more complicated nuances to marking and refereeing which can be 
mastered in short order by 1) experience, and 2) memorizing the rules 
of squash handbook.

Houston squash players take over Bob Hope's good works.

Chris Spies and Bruce Crane accompanied Hillary Clinton to Iraq
recently, where they played an exhibition match (see photo) to
entertain the US troops stationed there. The grueling travel schedule
was too much for Crane, who after returning to Houston last Friday
went directly to the University Club where he played a five game match
against Duncan Robinson, drank a couple of beers and proceeded to
vomit violently all over the home of a close friend (photos not
available). Click <a href="President_corner/Spies_Crane.jpg">here</a> for a picture.

The 17th annual Atlanta Grand Masters Squash Championships, to be held
December 12 - 14, now looms less than a month away. Tournament director
Tom Rumpler (windyhillsquash@comcast.net) informs me that entries are
beginning to fly in in droves. He expects another 150-player turn out
this year, with over 1/3 coming from out of state. Last year, the HSRA
was well represented at this tournament, with the following in
attendance: Rishad Alikhan, Harald Blakeslee, Kevin Darby, Greg Golding,
Martin Langley, Bill Millman and Dave Scruton. If you are planning on
playing in this tournament, DON'T DELAY.

Guy Fawke's day went by unnoticed by most, but a few die-hard Brits
decided to hang on to their tradition of lighting a bonfire and
burning Guy in efigy. On Saturday evening, November 8th, Kevin Darby,
Chuck Chapple and Dave Scruton gathered wood and general debris and
lit one of the biggest bonfires I've seen. Folks from miles away (a
slight exxageration maybe) could see the flames and joined in on the
celebration, although very few understood the relevance of the
ocassion. For photos of the event, click <a href="archive/2003/2003_guyfawkeday.htm">here.</a>
