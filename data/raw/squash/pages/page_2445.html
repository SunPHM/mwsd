The soup was on at the Carrboro Farmer's Market on Saturday, September 6th. when 6 area chefs came to share their special recipes for soups using Market ingredients. <br><br>

There were plenty of volunteers on hand to help out with the event. The line circled around the bandstand where the tasting was to occur, as eager tasters appreciated the coolness of the morning while they waited for the chefs to arrive with their wonderful creations. Special events coordinator Kelly Clark assured the folks that the chefs would be there soon, looking down at her watch for the tenth time as 8:30 drew near.<br clear=left><br><br>

A bit bleary-eyed in some cases, when 8:30 am rolled around (well, maybe 8:45), chefs and volunteers began ladling their culinary delights into small plastic cups for the masses to taste. And masses there were.<br><br>

The chefs were Magnolia Grill’s Ben Barker and Chef de Cuisine Matt Murray, Shane Ingram of Four Square in Durham (where Claire's used to be), Bret Jennings and Ryan Stewart of Elaine’s on Franklin, Bill Smith of Crook’s Corner in Chapel Hill, Alex Gallis of Acme Food & Beverage Co. and Peter McCloskey of Panzanella’s in Carrboro.<br clear=right><br><br>

All of these talented taste makers used the freshest market ingredients to create their tempting tureens of mouthwatering soups. These chefs are all familiar faces as regular customers at the Market.<br><br>

Each of the soups offered was an adventure for the taste buds, with 3 cold and 3 hot selections at this crisp morning sampling.<br><br>

As the smell of fresh soup wafted through the air, folks couldn't wait for a taste. The weather was perfect for the spicy fare created by the men behind the tables.<br clear=left><br><br>

<img src=benandallison.jpg border=1 alt="Ben Barker and volunteer Allison Hayes prepare to offer soup samples at the Carrboro Farmers’ Market" hspace=15 vspace=5 align=right><br>The chefs and their helpers ladled for hours, in some cases carefully garnishing each tiny cup. The line wound its way along the outskirts of the bandstand with a new taste treat around every corner. <br><br>

Chefs answered questions about their recipes, their restaurants, and basked in the glory of a job well done. The chefs enjoyed the compliments of the tasters, pleased with their creations. Folks of all ages opened wide to try something new and different.<br><br>

Magnolia Grill’s offering was spicy green tomato soup with crab and country ham (my favorite). <a href=CFMMarketSoupRecipeBenBarker2003.doc>Download the recipe.</a>
