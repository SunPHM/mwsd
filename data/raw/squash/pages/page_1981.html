                  <p class="bodytxt">Ann Arbor MI-- About twenty minutes west 
                    of Ann Arbor, off a main drive and down a dirt road there's 
                    a sign that you might miss unless you were looking for it; 
                    it says Community Farm of Ann Arbor. Turn into the adjacent 
                    driveway, pass a blue farmhouse, and hidden behind the trees 
                    you'll find a thriving, small-scale farm.<img src="../images/farm.jpg" width="272" height="314" align="right"><br>
                    Out in the fields are lush rows of winter squash, tomatoes, 
                    peppers, tat soi, garlic, flowers and corn. Purslane, lambs 
                    quarters and other edible plants that many farmers would yank 
                    out of their beds are allowed to flourish alongside the cultivated 
                    crops. Beehives and a pen for chickens stand near the aging 
                    but sturdy red barns. There is a cow pasture, and the farm 
                    site even has a composting toilet for visitors and workers.<br>
                    Community Farm is a biodynamic farm. That means the farmers 
                    recognize the basic principles at work in nature and take 
                    them into account when coordinating the farm's activities. 
                    Biodynamic farmers go beyond accepted organic methods and 
                    strive to develop a sustainable, self-contained farm. This 
                    would include an active composting system to nourish the plants 
                    and feed grown to support the livestock that provide fertile 
                    manure. A biodynamic farm uses fertilizing and pest management 
                    methods that not only avoid negative impact, but work to restore 
                    and maintain balance.<br>
                    Community Farm is community-owned, and its produce is shared 
                    equally between its membership of over 200 families. On share 
                    pickup days, the barn is bustling. Crates and boxes overflow 
                    with freshly picked vegetables, herbs and fruits. Cows and 
                    goats observe the activity placidly from their stalls as farm 
                    members stream in. People check the chalkboard to see how 
                    many of each item they get to take home, and fill their bags 
                    with their share of the farm's bounty.<br>
                    <img src="../images/farm2.jpg" width="282" height="388" align="left">Annie 
                    Elder and Paul Bantle, the primary farmers, chat with the 
                    farm's shareholders during pickup. Whether it's recipe swapping, 
                    information about growing or creative ideas on what to do 
                    with food, there's a constant exchange of information going 
                    on between the farm's members. &quot;People teach each other 
                    things all the time,&quot; Annie says.<br>
                    Community has always been a focus of the farm. Established 
                    15 years ago, the farm's by-laws are based on those of the 
                    now-defunct Wildflour Bakery, Ann Arbor's community-owned 
                    and collectively operated bakery. Ownership in a CSA (community 
                    supported agriculture) farm encourages shareholders to come 
                    out to the farm, get to know the farmers and other members, 
                    and gain a strong connection to the source of their food. 
                    When the farm moved from its original site 10 years ago, members 
                    pitched in to help. Annie recounts, &quot;Many members brought 
                    equipment, plants, soil, seed and chickens over to the new 
                    site in the middle of winter.&quot;<br>
                    Community Farm has served not only as a provider of food but 
                    also a place of learning. &quot;U of M's School of Natural 
                    Resources sees the farm as a huge resource,&quot; says Annie, 
                    citing the yearly visits made by students. Field trips from 
                    all sorts of schools and organizations travel to the farm 
                    each year in the spring and fall, and the young people that 
                    visit always seem to enjoy learning where food comes from, 
                    she said. Many of them also make fast connections with the 
                    farm animals, and are excited to try what to them are exotic 
                    veggies like rutabaga. According to Paul, &quot;There's a 
                    huge emphasis here on making it a good experience for children.&quot;<br>
                    Paul and Annie work full time at the farm, working 80-hour 
                    weeks at the peak of the season. This year they have 14 apprentices 
                    who are paid and also given produce. &quot;Many of the apprentices 
                    we've worked with have started their own farms and CSA's,&quot; 
                    says Annie.<img src="../images/farm3.jpg" width="326" height="281" align="right"><br>
                    In order to protect the future of Community Farm, a relationship 
                    has formed between the landowner, the Farm and Washtenaw Land 
                    Trust, whose goal is to protect farmland, natural areas and 
                    open space. Most of the undeveloped land in Washtenaw County 
                    is used for agriculture, and as the county's population grows 
                    so does the trend to develop farmland into housing. If enough 
                    money can be raised, WLT would purchase the development rights 
                    for the land used by Community Farm from the landowner, allowing 
                    the landowner to retain her asset while ensuring the land 
                    is used for agricultural purposes in perpetuity. Community 
                    Farm would then sign a 99-year lease with the landowner, and 
                    even if the Farmwent defunct the land would still be preserved 
                    for agriculture. &quot;This arrangement would be a stepping 
                    stone into this area for farm preservation,&quot; says Paul.<br>
                    Paul says farm preservation is especially critical in this 
                    part of the country. Michigan has the most diverse offering 
                    of crops in the U.S. after California, and living here we 
                    get to take advantage of all that local farming. &quot;We 
                    need to protect that,&quot; says Paul. <br>
                    Between $65,000 and $70,000 is needed to secure the property's 
                    development rights; so far $20,000 has been pledged or donated. 
                    Community Farm is hosting a music festival fundraiser on October 
                    13. &quot;The festival is one way to give support, by attending 
                    and celebrating,&quot; says Paul. &quot;Another is by making 
                    pledges, either at the event or at another time.&quot;<br>
                    &quot;When there are places like this, there are opportunities 
                    for people to do good,&quot; says Annie. &quot;When they do 
                    good work they feel really good even if they weren't trying 
                    to.&quot; For more information, contact Community Farm of
