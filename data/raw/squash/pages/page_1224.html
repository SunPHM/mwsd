<br><b><font size=+1>The House at 4440 Nichols Avenue</font></b>
<p><img SRC="4440.jpg" height=250 width=213 align=LEFT></center>

<p><font color="#FFFF99">LAYOUT OF OUR HOUSE:&nbsp; Large white wood clapboard
- red roof - dark green shutters.&nbsp; Large porch across the front and
around each side of house; also enclosed porch across the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a full basement with cement floor and center stairway.&nbsp;
Front left side was a large coal-bin and the furnace; I learned how to
bank the fire and stoke it when I was in high school.&nbsp; Right front
side was divided into rooms by partitions.&nbsp; Smaller enclosed front
room was used for food; shelves were full of canned fruits and vegetables
prepared during growing season.&nbsp; Hours were spent preparing fruit
and vegetables for canning - cooking, sterilizing jars, etc.&nbsp; Daddy
also had some kegs in which he made brandy.&nbsp; A large work area separated
that room from another one, used mostly for storage, sometimes as an incubator
room, or as a dark-room. The work area had Daddy's workbench, shelves of
tools, etc.&nbsp; Back part toward rear of the house was the laundry area,
clothes lines for when they couldn't be hung outdoors.&nbsp; First remembrances
were of a kerosene stove with a big boiler tub in which the clothes were
boiled, then transferred to double laundry tubs with scrub board and hand
wringer.&nbsp; Later we had a washing-machine with a wringer; later still,
one with a spin dryer.&nbsp; Ironing was also done here.</font>
<center><img SRC="4440Rear.JPG" height=222 width=361 align=RIGHT></center>
<font color="#FFFF99">FIRST FLOOR: Large entrance hall with stairway to
second floor; hallway the length of stairway led to a side-door into a
small hallway connecting the living room to the kitchen and stairs to basement.&nbsp;
The telephone was at the back of the hallway, and a door to the right went
into the dining room.&nbsp; Two large rooms were on either side of the
entrance hall; they could be closed off with sliding doors with which we
used to play "elevator".&nbsp; The hallway, stairway, and room on the right
were wood-paneled halfway up - dark brown handmade squares set in panels,
said to have been made by the original owner.&nbsp; Both rooms were the
same size - approximately 20' x 30' - two windows in front and three on
other sides.&nbsp; A large fireplace in the back of each room (white in
living room, red in dining room) jutted into the room, making alcoves on
each side.&nbsp; These rooms were interchanged as to use; most of the time
the paneled room was the dining room and the other - papered and with white
woodwork - was the living room.&nbsp; The paneled room had a door to the
left of the fireplace that led to a small entry room from the side entrance;
we hung coats, etc., there.&nbsp; There was also a large roll-top desk
and a wooden clock - made by Granddad - on the wall.&nbsp; I can remember
it as a living room at one time.&nbsp; We had a long wooden couch with
leather cushions; we'd pretend it was a bus - the driver sat at one end
and used "Texaco rulers" as gear-shifts.&nbsp; Also remember having a radio
in the alcove by the fireplace; once while we were sitting listening to
some program, lightning struck and knocked us back across the room.&nbsp;
Another time, lightning struck the front of the house (upstairs where wires
came in) when Grandma was walking along the hall; a ball of fire rolled
down the hall and went out the bathroom - through the partly-opened window,
we supposed.&nbsp; The other room had a built-in china-closet in the alcove
to the right of the fireplace, and the door leading to the small hallway
to the kitchen was on that side of the room.&nbsp; The back part of the
house was narrower than the front; it included the side entrance hall that
led into the kitchen, which was a large square room with an enclosed stairway
to the second floor and a large pantry on the right side of the room.&nbsp;<img SRC="4440Driveway.JPG" height=200 width=305 align=LEFT>There
was a big wood/coal stove in one corner and a water-heater tank; windows
along the outside and a large sink (with drainboards on each side) on the
left side of the room.&nbsp; A built-in china-closet with glass doors on
top of wooden-doored storage shelves was on the opposite side of the kitchen
with pantry behind that.&nbsp; A door in the middle of the backside of
the room led out to the enclosed porch, used for storage, trash, a large
table where milk was kept to get cream on top of pans, a large icebox,
and a small "john" in one corner.&nbsp; A screened-in stairway led to the
backyard.&nbsp; The kitchen stove was usually banked at night; if not,
first thing done in the morning was to build a wood-fire; when it had a
good base, add coal.&nbsp; Heat of the oven depended on how hot the fire
was, as the heat from that stove also heated water in the hot-water tank
beside it.&nbsp; In later years we got an electric stove; many a time we
used both stoves during canning season or for big meals.&nbsp; Did get
rid of the coal stove a few years before we moved.&nbsp; At first we had
a large icebox in the pantry plus the one on the back porch, and ice was
delivered to the house.&nbsp; The inside icebox was converted to a refrigerator
when they became popular; we would still get ice for the outside icebox
when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Groceries were ordered in the morning from Fillius'
Grocery Store in Congress Heights and delivered in the afternoon; my brother
Tom worked there during a summer vacation or two.</font>

<font color="#FFFF99">SECOND FLOOR: Reached by open stairway in front hall
or by enclosed stairway off the kitchen.&nbsp; Two front bedrooms over
the two first floor rooms, each with a closet and a door leading to the
bedroom behind it, making four bedrooms over the living room and dining
room areas of the first floor.&nbsp; The back bedrooms each had a red brick
fireplace but were never used.&nbsp; The area over the first-floor entrance
hall was a paneled library/den, and a hallway ran the distance from that
area to the back of the house, with a 3'-4’ railing around the stairway.&nbsp;
Leading on back to the area over the kitchen was the bathroom on the left
and a walk-in linen-closet; next to that was a similar enclosed stairway
to the attic.&nbsp; Behind the bathroom and all across the back of the
house was an L-shaped bedroom.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">ATTIC - THIRD FLOOR: Covered the whole house;
high ceilings in the central area and side windows (dormer-styled so ceiling
slanted toward them); large oval-shaped front window (floor-to-ceiling).&nbsp;
An enclosed bedroom in the back part was the maid's room in the early years.&nbsp;
Stairway from second floor came up just outside the door on the right.&nbsp;
To the left was a bathroom made out of the storage-tank room that was used
when the water was pumped up to the house from the spring in the woods.&nbsp;
The whole front part of the attic was open - no partitions - with wardrobes,
beds, and bureaus in various places as storage where the roof slanted down
to the eaves.&nbsp; Also enclosed storage under side eaves was reached
through a small door - scary to us kids - we thought ghosts lived in there.&nbsp;
A lot of play area - great for rainy days, except cold in winter due to
no heat.&nbsp; We had an old wind-up Victrola, books, and magazines there.&nbsp;
We'd sleep up there in the summer when relatives would come to visit.&nbsp;
There was an opening (reached by a ladder) to a large square area on the
roof; it had once had a railing around it.&nbsp; It was said the original
owner used it as a lookout for watching ships come up the Potomac River.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">FRONT PORCH: Screened-in not too long after we
moved there; entrances in front and at the end of each side.&nbsp; Floor
painted gray, railings white.&nbsp; Lots of rockers for all, also a lounge-type
swing.&nbsp; On hot summer nights we'd sleep out there on the swing and
Army cots.&nbsp; Many a summer day and evening was spent sitting on the
front porch, preparing vegetables for dinner and for canning (string and
Lima beans, peas, etc.). Corn was always picked just before dinner, shucked,
and put in boiling water just in time to eat.</font>
<p><img SRC="4440andoutbuildings.JPG" height=250 width=429 align=LEFT><font color="#FFFF99">There
was a vegetable garden for raising string beans, lima beans, yellow squash
and cymling (white) squash, asparagus, corn, tomatoes, lettuce, Swiss chard,
collards, rhubarb, onions, potatoes, parsley, etc.&nbsp; The second&nbsp;
garden was up nearer the house in a large flat area between the back driveway
and the chicken-yard; a mixture of vegetables and flowers were grown there.&nbsp;
To the left of that, going down a hill, was the fruit garden area for currants,
gooseberries, black and red raspberries and grapes.&nbsp; Strawberries
were rotated between the aforementioned vegetable/flower garden and a large
plot down a hill on the (side of the chicken-yard, to the left of the tenant
house garage and chicken-coop.&nbsp; Flower gardens were on both sides
of the driveway; on the lawn proper were such shrubs as snowball, wisteria,
strawberry, lilacs, plus evergreens, holly, red maple, and two sycamores.&nbsp;
Trees were balanced on each side in groupings.</font>
<center><img SRC="PeonyBeds.JPG" height=337 width=550>
<br><i><font size=-1>The Peony Beds</font></i></center>
<font color="#FFFF99">Next to the house on the left was a long row of lilacs
(deep purple, purple, white).&nbsp; The driveway ran between them and another
large lawn, area which had some vine-type flowering bushes.&nbsp; That
large area had a blackheart cherry tree and a redheart one, also a grove
of what used to be chestnuts till blight ruined most of them.&nbsp; Beyond
that area, Toward the fruit garden, was a large field of peonies - hundreds
of plants.&nbsp; Mother sold them for Decoration Day (now Memorial Day);
if they started blooming too soon, she would cut them and put them in the
cold cellar to hold them back.&nbsp; If not out far enough she'd cut them
and put them in a warm place to force them to open sooner.&nbsp; Selling
of flowers, fruit, preserves, etc., helped us through the Depression; HIGH
VIEW FARM&nbsp; was the label used on the products sold.</font>
<center><img SRC="Moo.JPG" height=200 width=324 align=LEFT></center>
<font color="#FFFF99">We had two cows - a Holstein for quantity of milk
produced and a Jersey for richness of the milk.&nbsp; Mother would pour
the latter's milk into big round pans on the back porch to let the cream
come to the top, to be used for butter, buttermilk, and ice-cream.&nbsp;
The cream that came to the top of the Holstein milk was used for coffee,
or often -just shaken up in the milk and drunk.&nbsp; Chickens were mostly
leghorns, Rhode Island reds and a black-and-white type.&nbsp; We tried
geese once&nbsp; -- too noisy; one bit Mother when she went in the yard,
so that was the end of them. Tried guinea hens, but also too noisy.&nbsp;
Never had too much luck with turkeys; we always felt good if we could raise
a few for Thanksgiving and Christmas. (They have a habit of going out in
the rain, putting their heads up in the air, and drowning!) Tried pigs
for a year or so, but too much trouble.</font>
<center><img SRC="Outbuildings.JPG" height=300 width=357 align=ABSBOTTOM></center>
<font color="#FFFF99">Down the roadway leading to the bottom part of the
farm was the chicken-yard on the left - a large fenced-in yard leading
off a smaller one near the hen-house, a log-cabin type building (half a
loft for hens to lay eggs, the other half you could walk around in).&nbsp;
We thought it was great to gather eggs with Granddad.</font>
<p><img SRC="Chickens.JPG" height=300 width=259 align=LEFT><font color="#FFFF99">There
was also a woodpile and chopping block; that was the spot where the chickens
were killed.&nbsp; After the heads were chopped off, they'd flop around
till dead, then were dumped in a tub of hot water and feathers pulled off.&nbsp;
I learned to kill chickens and fix them for cooking - UGH!&nbsp; Didn't
like doing so.&nbsp; Granddad kept the buildings in shape and would whitewash
them periodically.&nbsp; He was 90 years old the last time he did it; Jack
Fessenden helped him.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">During summer vacations and Christmas holidays,
we always had relatives visiting - mostly the Duboises, who lived for a
while in the tenant house (so we were like a big family then).&nbsp; Other
times we'd sleep in the attic under mounds of blankets in the winter.&nbsp;
It was easy to entertain ourselves on the farm, playing in the dirt with
bricks and sticks, making towns, roads, houses, etc.&nbsp; Pretended we
were explorers hiking through the woods, climbing in and out of ravines
(which were the mountains).&nbsp; Sometimes we would be in the wilds of
Africa or in some unexplored territory, pretending we were lost.&nbsp;
We also had wars, with the ravines as trenches.&nbsp; We swung on vines
growing from the wild grape trees, being Tarzan and Jane.&nbsp; Favorite
games included: hide-and-seek, red light, “Mother-May I?”, tag (played
on the front lawn in the evening with the shadow of the hedge as "safety"),
statues, jump rope and Double Dutch, baseball, dodge ball, and badminton
(when we were older).&nbsp; The badminton court was built to the left of
the house near the cherry trees and old chestnut grove.</font>
<p><img SRC="KidsWithDog.JPG" height=250 width=336 align=RIGHT><font color="#FFFF99">When
Jim Henry and Morley Geltman were in the Scouts, their troop built a log
cabin and made a campfire place in a clearing in the woods.&nbsp; It became
a favorite spot for us to play and have campfires on special occasions,
toasting hot dogs and marshmallows.&nbsp; An old fallen tree had rotted
out through the middle, and we had great fun playing on that and crawling
through the cavity.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Fort Drum and Fort Greble were in that area, with
fort embankments along the crest of the hill, also the Byers' farms across
Geisboro Road toward the river.&nbsp; We used to play in the embankments
and in an old house nearby that we pretended was haunted.&nbsp; A pathway
went down the hill to the river; we'd walk the train tracks along there
going to the Poor Farm.&nbsp; I fell one time and badly sprained my ankle.&nbsp;
We&nbsp; watched from the riverbank (Shepherd's Landing) and cheered when
Lindbergh came UD the river on a Navy ship for his "welcome home" from
his solo flight to Paris in 1927.&nbsp; The Naval Research Lab and Sewer
Plant are on the land now.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">Going down the road past Paynes' was a fork in
the road; the left fork led to the Kennedys’, the right one went to the
Poor Farm.&nbsp; When we must have been about 9 or 10 years old, Jim Henry
and I played old-time songs - he on violin, I on piano - at an entertainment
for the Poor Farm residents.&nbsp; We were beginners and didn't have much
sense of rhythm.&nbsp; Kate Smith was also there performing; when we played,
she tried to sing!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">St. Elizabeth's Hospital (mental) was in Congress
Heights before reaching where we lived.&nbsp; During the Depression, Daddy
used to tell people he lived halfway between the Poor Farm and the Insane
Hospital and didn't know which one to go to.</font>
