          We went to <a href="http://www.pfchangs.com/index.jsp">PF Chang's</a> last night... yum. I was so stuffed and so tired, that I kind of was nodding off on the way back home in the car, and then proceeded to pass out by around 9:30 pm when we got home.  SOOOO exhausted.  At least Scott didn't feel bad for being tired for once, I was in the same boat!  I guess the martinis & Sapporos really did me in.<br /><br />Now, I am ready for a relaxing day with no worries. Yeah!<br /></font>

          I am SO strange.  I had crazy dreams last night.<br /><br />First:<br />I am driving my car and talking to my mom on my cell phone.  I'm kind of driving fast, but there aren't many cars, and I'm thinking that it's kind of fun.  All of a sudden a car starts to back out of their driveway that is on the other side of the street and is coming into my lane. At the same time, a car is pulling out of their parallel parking spot on my side of the street... it leaves me nowhere to go, and I'm going too fast to stop, so my car plunges into a parked car and a parking meter!  I keep going straight, but was just really scared and screaming.  That was the end of my first weird dream.<br /><br />It seems to have picked right up with me in the car again, waiting at a left turn light... two guys come up to my passenger door and tell me that they are going to take my car.  I'm just saying okay, they grab my purse and tell me to get out of the car.  The end.  Odd.<br /><br />In the next dream, my grandma is driving me around LA in her car.  She takes me to an ice cream shop... only, we pull into this garage, and there is a counter in the garage where they are serving ice cream.  What makes the situation more bizarre is that there is a group of girls in matching red outfits doing a choreographed song & dance routine a la N*Sync.  They were a mix of girls I knew in high school & college, and no one that I liked very much.  After they finished their song, they all had their own individual ice cream pies.  We all ate ice cream pies and talked a little bit.  I got back in the car with Grandma, and as we were driving away I asked her how she knew about this place.  She said that she'd been there before, and remembered how to get there.<br /><br />In another dream, I am with my friend Michelle, and our former roommate Jen, and maybe a couple of other girls, but I can't remember who right now.  It may have been after one of my car mishaps, because we are walking to some destination.  I'm not sure what city I'm in, but it seems seedy.  We are trying to get away from something, but I'm not sure what.  Everyone is in a good mood.  We start walking down this alley, and it is like there are these odd, "underground" clubs.  It felt like prohibition or something, there were bodyguards at the door, and you couldn't really see what was going on inside.  We keep walking past, but eventually come to a cyclone fence.  As we are looking around, we notice that there are some very unhappy dobermans behind the fence and we begin to run.  That's about where it trails off.<br /><br />NEXT dream (come on already, you would think I had been sleeping for days)!  Scott is having a party at his house, but I feel like I get there and I need to change clothes.  I go into his room, and I can't find anything to wear... I don't like any of the clothes.  Also, the closet seems to be my grandmother's closet.  I don't like what I am wearing, so I decide to go out with my friends instead of staying at his party.  I actually think this is how I ended up with Michelle, because I decided to go out with her instead.  So maybe the order of these dreams occuring is somehow wrong.  I think I seem Melissa as I am leaving, but I can't remember what we talked about.<br /><br />Maybe this is where I go off with Michelle, then I remember that I don't want to leave my boyfriend alone at his party, and I don't understand why I didn't stay.  It's 1:00 am, and I go to his house and he is in bed asleep.  Both of us are confused, and I could have sworn he had a party, but now it seems foggy.<br /><center><HR WIDTH="64%"></center><br />Here is my very uneducated analysis:<br /><br />Crash dream:  I was fooling around on the computer the other day, and there was this old arcade style car racing game that I came across.  You know, where you can speed up and slow down, and if you hit a car, a new one pops up.  That's kind of how the dream felt, like I was driving the car in the game.  Freaky, but maybe that's what brought it on.<br /><br />Car-jacking:  Well, there was that story from a couple of weeks ago with the lady that followed me in her car and started pounding on my windows, and I was just glad that I had locked the doors, because she was so insane.  Maybe that's what sparked that dream... worrying about what might have happened if my doors were unlocked?<br /><br />Grandma & the dancers getting ice cream:  I have been wanting to spend time with my grandma ever since she had a stroke a few weeks ago.  I meant to call her yesterday, but forgot, so maybe this was my way of remembering her, or reminding myself to spend time with her.  The dancers are harder to explain, but I did just watch the Wade Robson show on MTV the other day, coupled with <b><i>Crossroads</b></i> which probably could explain why I am dreaming in dance.  Why were the people who they were?  Well, the girls from my sorority seemed to be girls that I remember a lot when I think of Rush, and I just got a notice about helping out with UCLA's mock rush.<br /><br />Michelle, Jen & the dobermans:  Um, can't explain that much.  The underground clubs seemed to be related in someway to what I was talking to Monique (girl I work with) about the other day.  I can't exactly link it, but for some reason, I feel like it's related.<br /><br />The party:  My boyfriend's friend Grant called the other day, and he mentioned having a party at his place for one of the upcoming UCLA games.  I was kind of put off... I don't know why exactly.  Because I'm not a people person?  Because I always feel like ,b>I</b> should be enough for him, so why does he need other people?  Yes probably.  And my insecurity is probably why I rushed back to his house to make sure he wasn't having any fun without me.<br /><center><HR WIDTH="64%"></center><br />I don't know how it's possible that I can dream for what seems like the entire night, and then not be able to remember dreams again for weeks or months.  <br /><br />Oh well.  We might go out to dinner with one of my boyfriend's co-workers and his wife sometime.  TO DON ANTONIO'S!  Sign me up.  I don't know if we will go this weekend or not.  I don' t think we really have any plans though as of right now.  Which is just how I like it!<br /><br /><strong>currently:</strong> <img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/opiummmm/foxies/confused.gif" align='absmiddle' width='49' height='30' vspace='1' alt='' /> curious<br /></font>

          I hate being old.<br /><br />Too many responsibilities. <br /><br />Yesterday I got a call from my former landlord telling me that my deposit was basically "absorbed" with the cost of me moving out early.  WTF?  Huh?  $850 in move-out fees?  Unreal.  And it will be a pain & a time consuming pain to argue with him.  Bleh.<br /><br />Then I am dealing with this stupid periodontist office over this procedure I have to have + my insurance company being a pain in the ass.  To top it off I got a bill in the mail from them yesterday for $135 for the initial exam.  You've gots to be joking me.<br /><br />Bills, bills, bills... no end in sight.<br /></font>

          First things first.... a cute new pic of us at Border Grill from Saturday night:<br /><br /><center><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-9/346827/a_bordergrill3.jpg" width=607 height=282 ALT="Border Grill"></center><br /><br />Last night I made the best, best, best <a href="http://www.foodfit.com/recipe.asp?rid=390">Penne with Summer Squash, Zucchini and Sugar Snap Peas</a>.  Hold the sugar snap peas (because I'm not a fan).  It was really good... I'll have to make that again!  I really like the website where I found the recipe, and I'm thinking of trying the <a href="http://www.foodfit.com/recipe.asp?rid=1403">Honey Barbecued Chicken with Red Pepper Slaw</a> next.<br /><br />Mmmm, yes, and Scott made me some delicious apple martinis last night too.  That made my night!<br /></font>

          I am gradually getting back into the swing of things with work.  Although with an extra day off, it seems like work days have gotten longer.<br /><br />I had the weirdest dream last night.  It's weird how sometimes the more you think about dreams, the more vivid they become.  There are times when I wake up not even remembering my dream from the night before, and then gradually throughout the day it comes back to me in bits and pieces.  That's how my dream last night was, and the more I remembered it, the more I realized that I have been dreaming about the same place.  It's like a little town that I go to in my sleep.  Very bizarre, because it's  not even an amalgum of other places that I've been... <br /><br />In my dream I work in an office that is dark reddish brown inside, with lots of cubicles, and not all of them have walls... it's very 80's-ish (think <i><b>Nine to Five</i></b> with Dolly Parton).  There is a girl there that I went to elementary through high school with.  I haven't seen her since graduating high school (er, that would be seven years ago).  BUT, it's not entirely random, as our parents have always been good friends, and when she was diagnosed with cancer about three years ago, my step-father was very instrumental in helping her family find physicians, and my mother handles their health insurance account.  Still, why her of all people?  I do not have a clue.<br /><br />It's nearing lunch time, and I am thinking of going out and buying nail polish during lunch -- again, I have no need for nail polish, and have never purchased any at lunchtime.  But then I decide I won't go, since it is kind of drizzling outside.  There is a cafeteria type place to eat lunch at my office, and the girl I know is in line, so I go and get in line too, and I'm asking her about the food.  And I end up eating there and thinking how much easier this is than picking up lunch.  That is when I recall where I would normally buy lunch, and it's a place that I remember from other dreams.<br /><br />We end up talking and becoming fast friends again.  I don't know what that dream was about or why, but perhaps I'm trying to connect with friends from the past?  Trying to reach out and not be so isolated?  I don't know. Hmmmm.<br /></font>

          You're kidding me right?  Back to work?  Aargh.<br /><br />Last night was movie marathon night... seriously.  We rented <i><b>Bringing Down the House</i></b>, and watched that.  Then we kind of started to cook dinner, but <i>Novacaine</i> started on HBO... so we were kind of suckered into watching that for a while (it was like a Steve Martin movie marathon)!<br /><br />Had dinner, and then <i><b>Crossroads</i></b> with Britney Spears was on... and it was hypnotizing.  NOT because it was entralling, or amazing, but because I just wanted to see her act.  I kind of thought she might be getting a little weird... it can't be easy being the most famous girl in America!  But it was a decent teeny bopper movie.  I felt like even if I was watching it as a sixteen year old, I would have still thought it was immature, but oh well.  Still waaaaay better than <i><b>Glitter</i></b> -- now that was a train wreck that was hard to stop watching.<br /></font>

          Our Saturday hike was fun.  It was so neat being up above the city.  I have to say that it didn't really stack up too well against the trails in SB, but it was just so nice to get away for a few hours.  Our sandwiches were a great idea, but I couldn't even sit and enjoy the view from the top of the trail, because there were all kinds of bees and insects up there.  I'm such a city girl, it's pathetic.<br /><br />After our hike, we cleaned up, relaxed a little, watched a little <i><b>Happy Gilmore</i></b> and then got ready for dinner.  We decided to try a place in Santa Monica called The Border Grill.  It was nice to go somewhere that neither of us had already been.  The restaurant was cool -- painted murals adorned every wall, and this place was packed, even getting to dinner at 9:30.  But the food was "eh" nothing too special.  I still loves my Don Antonio's... what can I say, you can't mess with a good thing!<br /><br />I got a little tipsy on those margaritas, so I was out like a light that night.<br /><br />Sunday: got up and did NOTHING for quite a while.  Then Scott's sister Blair came over and we all went out to the beach (Topanga), came back and showered and went to dinner at  Houston's (since it's so close to our house and the movie theater).  I was severly underwhelmed by Houston's, but I guess I didn't honestly expect that much.<br /><br />We saw <i><b>American Wedding</i></b> which was also mediocre at best... but I wasn't expecting a whole lot there either. It was just a fun no-hassle day.  And I'd take an okay dinner, and a mediocre movie over work any day!<br /><br />Today, Scotty & I have just kind of hung out.  We woke up early & grabbed bagels & coffee and made a trip to Target.  Fun!  I love that place.  We went to the grocery store to get all of our Labor Day BBQ fixins, and then came home.  Oh, I did pilates when Scott went to the gym.  Um, yeah, it's not easy.  Seems like it should be easy.  It's not.<br /><br />Now I am showered and ready to enjoy my last afternoon of relaxation in this looooooong weekend.  :(  Sucks to go back to work tomorrow.<br /><br /><strong>currently:</strong> <img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/opiummmm/foxies/sad.gif" align='absmiddle' width='36' height='41' vspace='1' alt='' /> depressed<br /></font>
