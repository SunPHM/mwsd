        gardens are fairly common these days, but what makes Sacramento's <a href="http://schools.scusd.edu/hiramjohnson/index.html" target="_blank">Hiram 
        W. Johnson High School</a> garden unique is that it was started by their 
        school nurse, <a href="mailto:paulinetracey@aol.com">Pauline Tracey</a> 
        (pictured on far right in the above group photo). Along with a dose of 
        exercise, these young adults are getting important lessons in health, 
        agriculture, business, community service and teamwork; not to mention 
        a beautiful crop of vegetables and flowers they'll sell for reinvesting 
        in the garden. Perhaps most importantly, these kids on the brink of adulthood 
        are learning how you really can start with nothing and end up with something 
        to be proud of. Something worth nurturing. <br>
        <br>
        Short on funds (like most school programs these days) but long on enthusiasm 
        and energy, the JWAGs are nurturing several different varieties of tomatoes, 
        beans, squash, garlic, marigolds and more this summer...<br>
        <br>

        Another unique feature of the Hiram Johnson school garden is that it isn't 
        actually located on school grounds. It's about a block away from campus, 
        in a large section of a very generous neighbor's backyard. </p>
      <p>Popping in on the kids one morning, I had a chance to see them work. 
        Asking their thoughts on the garden; what they liked... or even <em>didn't</em> 
        like.. students Xue Vang (age 17) and Peter Uang (age 16) both replied 
        that they want to make JWAG &quot;...into a better garden.&quot; Peter 
        said he enjoys the physical exercise he gets while working in the garden.</p>
      <p>Nou Thao (age 15) added poetically that she likes to see &quot;...the 
        green blossom garden. If I see green in nature, I see life.&quot; What 
        she doesn't like &quot;...is that since the plants are still growing, 
        there are weed plants in their way.&quot; She &quot;tried to dig out as 
        many weeds&quot; as she could &quot;...so the plants can grow better and 
        faster.&quot; </p>

        Heather Colburn (age16) first joined JWAG because &quot;it sounded like 
        fun,&quot; but stayed because she gets to learn about &quot;the earth 
        and bugs.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        Danny Cha (age16) observed that he thinks this is Hiram Johnson's first 
        school garden.</p>
      <p>Chai Thao (age 16) enjoys the garden and wants to improve it. Like Nurse 
        Tracey, he has grand visions. &quot;We work very hard just to make the 
        garden good. I wanted to make the garden not just good but beautiful.&quot; 
        Speaking like a natural leader, Chai added, &quot;I will do my best to 
        keep the garden going.&quot;<br>

        Tracey, when pressed for what the garden really needs to make it better 
        and keep it going, mentioned among other things: fencing to protect the 
        plants from resident chickens, sturdy tomato cages, stakes, ties, and 
        a good wheelbarrow. Since she also produced from her pocket a diagram 
        showing hopeful plans for a future expansion, it's safe to say <em>any</em> 
        contribution would be put to good use by her and the kids. <br>
        <br>
        Eventually, she envisions a permanent garden on the Hiram Johnson campus.<br>
