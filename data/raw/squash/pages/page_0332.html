1 large green squash                        tomato sauce
1 lb. ground meat                           salt and pepper
stale bread (crumbs)                        3 eggs

    diced                                   oil
4 slices Genoa salami, diced

      Peel skin of squash; carefully scoop seeds inside of squash,
which has been cut in six inch lengths.  Mix all ingredients,
except tomato sauce, and stuff cavity of squash.   
      In oil, fry the stuffed pieces of squash slowly on low heat,
turning so that they will brown on all sides.  When browned,
place in baking dish, side by side.  Cover with tomato sauce;
sprinkle with grated cheese.
      Bake in 350° oven for 15 minutes.

<font color="#000000">PS Because the correct traditional white squash is hard to find, I have referred to them as green, as they can be used as a substitute and are also tasty.   These long white squash, if nothing else is also commonly known by its southern Italian slang name of “Saccapove”  (I think that’s the way it’s spelled, because Lord knows you won’t find that back woods word in any normal Italian dictionary) as most refer to it.
</font>   



<p align="justify">
<font color="#000000"> Most people these days don’t have the time to cook, so consequently, the 
long white squash that was once very common in New Haven, Connecticut, where most of the Atrani, Italy immigrants settled, is hard to find these days.  Sorry to say, but you may have to go so far as to grow them in your own backyard, if the climate where you are permits.  If you are out food shopping in produce, they are hard to miss, as they are on the average, about three feet long.  A huge squash to say the least!
</font> <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">The recipe above, along with so many other mouth-watering Italian peasant dishes is becoming nearly extinct, because no one seems to remember when.  They are all just too busy at work that they just don’t have the time to even think about them.  They are a thing of the past, when men were the bread winners (Their pay alone was sufficient enough to support the entire family) and when women stayed home, to cook, bring up children, do the laundry, etc.  Were they better off?  I don’t know 
if they were, because it was all still a lot of work.<br>

<p align="justify"><font color="#000000">PS  Here in Amalfi, Italy in the basement of Saint Andrew’s Cathedral, lay the remains of Saint Andrew the Apostle, in a tomb that is mounted with a large statue by Michelangelo.   There is something very interesting that happens every year on the same day of his feast and at the exact same time.  A salty liquid, that is perspiration like, comes from his bones.  The smartest scientists in the world can’t explain it.  This qualifies to be non-other than a miracle.
</font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#000000">This fluid phenomenon that is called “Manna” is dripped into a copious quantity of cotton; after which pieces are then put into envelopes and distributed to the congregation that is present before Saint Andrew’s tomb at the time.   I was a witness and thus have one that I scanned and have pictured below.  I was fortunate to be there when once, every so many years the skull of Saint Andrew is placed on top of the crypt.  Everyone present can get a good view, only because the tomb is located in a small room that is very chapel like.  I have to admit that I have been in that room alone several times and must say that I had to keep looking over my shoulders, sort of speak, if you know what I mean.  Have you ever been down a basement alone and had to run up the stairs in fear that someone or something would grab you at the ankles?  Well that’s exactly the way I felt.  All kidding aside, when at the tomb I knelt, prayed and felt closer to God.</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000"><br>

    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">PS Scafati, Italy is my Godfather’s hometown. I have many memories of him 
    and his Italian Restaurant in New Haven, CT’s "Little Italy". It was really 
    an outstanding place, attracting many rich and famous people, including 
    movie stars and Broadway stars that came into New Haven, CT to open up new 
    musical shows like, South Pacific, The Sound of Music and Oklahoma at the 
    Shubert Theater, The Oakdale theater in Wallingford, etc. We lived upstairs 
    from the restaurant on the second floor, along with my godfather and his 
    family in the same apartment building that he owned. All of the cooks, my 
    father was one of them, also lived in the same building, being that just 
    about everyone in this predominately Italian neighborhood could really cook.<font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
    <br>
    </font>The Italians believe that children should be seen and not heard, well I was 
    no exception to that rule.  Of course us kids could care less about 



    what adults had to say, much less the old timers with their outdated ways.  
    Who wanted to hear, who did this and who did that of the grown up world? Who 
    cares? That was our attitude! All though these days, I find that kids are 
    more inquisitive as to what the elders have to say, except for when they're 
    supposed to pay attention, like in school or church, of course. My family 
    and their friends would sit around the table telling stories, jokes and 
    singing in Italian. There were always plenty of musicians around, who played 
    the accordion, who played the guitar, who played the mandolin, and so we 
    always had plenty of live music accompaniment around our kitchen table.  
    Now children and even though they are children, begin to take notice when 
    there is any strange adult behavior going on, especially if they hear the 
    laughing and telling about it.  </font> 
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Now I began to take notice that my godfather's father was acting very 
    peculiar, leaving his wife behind, to do the bulk of the restaurant work and 
    she would say nothing.  What? Hello!  She would get up at four in 
    the morning to go down stairs into the restaurant and start the cooking. She 
    was an extremely hard working woman to say the least and if it had not been 
    for her, the restaurant would probably not even exist.  As for her 
    husband, it was a different story entirely for him! He would leave for Italy 
    and then all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, come back again. Now I 
    gather that he would do clown antics like bluff an accident, grubby beard, 
    bandages, a cane and of course, the famous limping act, that he could have 
    won an Academy award for.  The act that was good enough to fool a 
    doctor, in order for him to collect a huge amount of insurance money, of 
    which he would take with him back to Italy.  But on this one occasion, 
    as I recall, when he arrived in Rome, he was tipped off that the FBI was 
    waiting for him, so he took the very next plane back. I guess that sort of 
    explained to us kids, why he was going back and forth.  We said nothing 
    about it at that time, because they were all still living. Plus, children 
    are by nature, very trusting of adults and feel that they can take care of 
    them selves. When you are born and raised in Little Italy, you quickly 
    learn what to say and what not to say, what to write and what not to write, 
    it all becomes second nature to you.<font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
    <br>
    </font>I can remember as a young boy, just learning how to play the trumpet, that 
    Louis "Satchmo" Armstrong, the famous trumpet player, came into my 
    godfather’s restaurant with this blond and put in a special order for Chicken Cacciatora that my father made. I learned also, that while Satchmo 
    was just right downstairs from me, that he went into the kitchen and shook 
    my father’s hand, thanking him for the excellent meal my father made special 
    for him. How I wished I could have met this great trumpet player that I 
    admired, along with every other trumpet player, musician and music lover 
    that there ever was and will be.<font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
    <br>
    </font>Peeking into the restaurant every two minutes, I can also remember how us 
    kids would wait for the last customers to leave the restaurant so we could 
    all pile up into my godfather’s big car and go out to the biggest amusement 
    park in Connecticut, "Savin Rock" in West Haven. We would get disappointed 
    sometimes, because the last customers would seem to never want to leave and 
    if that was the case and they left too late, it would be too bad for us 
    kids, because that meant we could not go to Savin Rock. How down hearted we 
    all felt!</font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><p>

    </font>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#000000">Did we ever eat in my godfather's restaurant? Never! Not if our life 
    depended on it! There is no 
    substitute for homemade and even as kids we had the God given common sense 
    to know that. The meatballs for example, were mostly bread that they should 
    have called, matzo balls or sawdust balls. There was so much bread in them, 
    that I can imagine that they tasted more like pancakes in tomato sauce. With 
    the chicken alone, I didn't know how his customers didn't die on him. In the 
    backyard, he would have crates of chicken outside in the summer heat that 
    smelled so raunchy , you could shrivel up bathroom tiles with them.  
    His trick was to spice them so much that you couldn't tell. They usually 
    ended up as some sort of, "
    Chicken Hunter-style: Pollo alla Cacciatora".  A customer would come 
    into the restaurant and ask, "Ay cum-ba, what-a the special-a the day?"  
    He would say, "Pollo alla Cacciatora"  magnifico!  Unbelievably, 
    after eating it, the customer would say, "Cumba, that's-a the best-a Pollo 
    alla Cacciatora I eve-a eat-a! Era realmente speciale!"  as he would 
    shake my godfather's hand.<font face="Comic Sans MS">  </font> </font>

    <br>
    <br>
    The other thing I'd like to add is, don't ever send your food back to the 
    kitchen if it's not done right, like send your steak back because it's not 
    well done enough or not rare enough.  Big mistake!  Very big 
    mistake! I can't even begin to tell you what they do to it, not to make you 
    sick to your stomach.  You'll never want to eat in a restaurant again. 
    Yuck! <br>

    The thing that drives employees and the employers of a food establishment 
    simply nuts, is the incredibly stupid trivial complaints, like the two 
    paragraphs in the mail, telephone or in person, about how the slice of a 
    pickle was missing with their sandwich or meal. At that point, anyone one 
    with a normal disposition, would get this sudden rush of blood to the brain, 
    accompanied with the urge to literally strangle the customer, publicly. 
    While that may not be realistic, you can always fantasize, like throwing the 
    customer into a washing machine and leaving he or she in there for a few 
    days, for example.  That sounds good! <br>
    <br>
    I did find however, that the restaurant food in Italy is comparable to 
    homemade, if not, even better.  There they are fooling no one.  
    The Italian people know the food and what the dish is supposed to be, so 
    there is no misrepresentation.  </font> 
    </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><font color="#000000">What became of my godfather's restaurant?  
    Well from the very beginning it was a case of money making money. It was 
    started as a small establishment by his mother and it moved to a bigger 
    place and yet an even larger place and finally a facility which was able to 
    handle very large parties, such as wedding receptions.  As it came to 
    be, my godfather retired to Florida with a bundle. One of his sons in the 
    mean time, gambled the entire business in Las Vegas, Navada.  Did his 
    son get his head mounted on a wall somewhere? Could be! I haven't seen him 
    in a while, so I sort of have visions of that.</font><p align="justify">

I believe that he had so much money, that he was able to afford to gamble the restaurant, simply because it was just too much work; just like so many other children that inherited the business of their grandparents and parents. I can understand that, especially to the very high level that it had gotten to be.  It was a lot of work just when it was small, let alone the way it had evolved to be, with weddings and all.  With upper level and lower level functions. I'll grant you this, he could have sold it, but I don’t think he even wanted to be bothered with that. 
What fool do you know of that would gamble everything that he or she, what ever 
the case may be, has to live on? Personally, I know of no one.  I only know 
of some people that would give the shirt off their back to help the poor!<br>
<br>
This sons philosophy is, what good is it to have money and yet slave all the 
time?  You never get to enjoy it.  To me, it is  like going to a 
restaurant, ordering a big expensive meal, have it sitting in front of you and 
you never eat it.  As you leave, you pay for it and go home to bed. Is that 
nuts or what? Money...what are they saving it all up for?  Have you ever 
seen a moving van in a funeral procession?  I haven't!  Maybe they 
think they have to pay admission to get into heaven or pay Saint Peter under the table.  
Saint Peter, come over here to the side a minute, I got to tell you something, 
Shhhhhhhh...now look, here is five million dollars so you can let me in through 
them pearly gates...Shhhhhhhhh.  After they are all 
departed, most likely their kids will be at each others throat over it....I 
should have got this and I should have got that.  I could hear it all already. 
Maybe the departed had it all planned that way, as a weapon of rebellion because 
of family feuds. Maybe the battle cry of the departed is, "Knock each other out 
over it! Yes!!! Pow! Pow! Bang!"  No, this one of my godfather's sons was 
not about to make himself a slave to money, like his grandmother and father did 
over hot restaurant stoves. He is going to enjoy the money while he is still 
able to and forget about work. Work is no fun!  <br>
<br>
I often tell people when they complain about their job, "Show me where they pay 
you to have fun and I'll be right there!"  Guess what?  No one ever 
told me where.  There is no such place.  No one is going to pay anyone 
to have fun, so in that specific regard, I don't complain about my work.  
When I weigh the pros and cons of my full time day job, I find that while I am 
not making that much money, I am not breaking my back at it either. I really 
have an almost no work job. Thank you Jesus!  On the other hand, my part time job at night, 
leaves something to be desired both ways.</font></font><font color="#000000"><br>

      </font>PS  The coastline just south of Naples, known as the AMALFI COAST, is undoubtedly 
one of the most beautiful in the world. It has an inherent natural beauty 
      characterized by very steep, rocky hillsides falling sheer into the sea, and the 
local villages, untouched by modern architecture, which used to be dedicated to 
fishing, have retained all their centuries-old charm. Sightseers, if they really 
want to absent themselves from this beautiful area, can visit Naples, Pompeii and 
Vesuvius. Ravello, just above Amalfi, has two enchanted villa gardens with views 
of the coastline. Capri and Ischia are islands nearby, both of extraordinary 
natural beauty.
<br>
      <br>
      I have been all over Italy, but the most beautiful area that I have ever 
      been to, is the Amalfi Coast. As soon as you leave Naples and enter the 
      Amalfi Drive, there is a feeling of tranquility and beauty that I have 
      found nowhere else. The warmth and hospitality of the people is a relief 
      in itself.<font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
      <br>
      </font>Here, if you need to find a relative or friend, for example in Atrani, 
      just ask the very first person you meet in that town and they can tell you 
      exactly where he or she is, just like I did as soon as I got off the bus 
      from Rome.  Everyone seems to know everyone, just like members of 
      your own family.  Amazing!  Am I on another planet?   Where 
      are the Indians that I would ask for directions in New Jersey? One of them 
      Indians can manage to get you lost in your own bathtub and they all sound 
      like they know New Jersey and New York, inside out too!  How ironic!<font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>
