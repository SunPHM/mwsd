  <b class="font">Vanessa Atkinson is just starting to fulfil her potentital as a player. The former  Geordie, who now plays for the Netherlands, is making an impact at the top of the women’s game. More disciplined, stronger, fitter and with a work ethic, she still has an appetite for the rest of life. Martin Bronstein interviewed her.</b>

It has taken a long time but Vanessa Atkinson has kept on working on her game and is now keeping company with the best players in the world. Ranked no.6 in the world Atkinson has now won her first major tournament – the Irish Open and beat her nemesis Cassie Jackman for the second time in succession at the European Championships.<br> 
The Squash Player’s panel of international experts have voted her Player of the Month.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Vanessa Atkinson is everywhere, beating everybody and knocking on the door of the top five players in the world. To say that she is a late developer is a slight understatement; she has been a member of WISPA since she was 18, almost ten years ago. She admits to spending too many years in the wasteland – that is the ranking list below number twenty – and she sheepishly admits to not training hard enough and not putting in the work to be fit enough to mount a serious challenge at the top level. Ironically, she has learned that by curbing her attacking instinct she has become a better player.
Once you get past that flaming red hair, you find an articulate and shrewd professional athlete who can list her faults and attributes in the same tone of voice, always with a touch of humour in the subtext. Despite having left England at the age of ten to move to Holland with her parents and older sister, Atkinson still has that humorous, jokey Englishness that puzzles so many foreigners, who, it is said, don't understand irony. She is, after all, a Geordie, born in Newcastle in north-east England, where the people have a very distinct sense of humour.<br>
After a roller-coaster performance in one match, she was asked what she needed to improve her game. "A good psychologist," she dead-panned. And what does her coach think she needed? "A good psychologist," she said, and laughed.<br>
At one tournament she turned up with boyfriend and dog. The boyfriend was there, it seems, to look after the dog. That boyfriend has gone, but the dog is still around.<br>
Her parents both played squash and when she finally put a racket in her hand at the age of eight, she expected to be good at it.<br>
"I expected to be good at every sport I played because I was always into sport and I was always better than average. I was into athletics in England and I did everything – running and jumping, netball, rounders – I just loved every sport. When I was 12 or 13, I started playing more and more squash and then I stopped doing all the other sports," she remembers.<br>
Her first coach was Arthur Smith: "He was the first guy who came up to me and said I was very talented and asked if I’d like proper training. I'd never had any lessons, so I trained with him twice a week for two or three years."<br>
She had to fulfil a five year residency rule before she was eligible to play for her new country. And as soon as she did, she was off at a gallop. At the age of 15 she won the Under 16 and Under 19 Dutch titles. In fact she won that Under 19 title four times in all. By this time she was able to get further coaching from Brian Barnett, a New Zealander who was the Dutch National Coach.<br> 
When she reached the age of 18 there was no question what Vanessa Atkinson would do; she left school, joined WISPA and has been a professional every since.<br>
"I was almost independent, from the start nearly making ends meet through local funding, league matches and tournaments. My sister and I rented a flat and occasionally I had to borrow some money from my parents," she recalls.<br>
Atkinson likes to have a life outside squash and it was this desire for normal living that kept her from an upward curve in the rankings. Success in any profession comes at a price and that price is dedication to the exclusion of almost everything else. Atkinson knew she never had that total dedication. Asked whether she is disciplined in training, she reveals her past faults.<br>
"I would say that I am disciplined now, but it has taken a lot of years to get here. I've never been someone who has enjoyed training; I've always struggled to get myself motivated. I've always had to do a lot of training by myself. If I'd been in a group, that would have helped. It's harder to do it by yourself. The motivation came from getting a few good results. It started two or three years ago when I had that big result against Cassie and Suzanne Horner. I had been sitting around the same standard for three for four years, and then I made that jump, when I was about 24 or 25. That gave me a bit of confidence. It showed that maybe I could get there.<br>
"Before that, whenever I played Cassie or Sarah [Fitz-Gerald] or Michelle [Martin], I would get wiped off the court. And after a while that takes its toll on your confidence; you can't see yourself ever beating them. When somebody beats you that easily it seems like a big gap to bridge, but it is actually not that big and once you can at least give them a good game, it can easily turn to winning. Once I got my confidence, it made all the difference," she explains.<br>
She gives some credit to Liz Irving, who has been coaching her for the last three or four years. They have a very loose arrangement and Atkinson may work with Irving once or twice a week.<br>
"Liz helped me a lot with my technique: first we worked on the swing on my forehand and now we're working on the backhand. She has also got me volleying more, moving on to the ball earlier rather than waiting for the ball to come to me. I've always been a good mover, but she sorted out my footwork. I was moving around the ball instead of stepping in and taking it early."<br>
Irving says that Atkinson had a natural feel for the court. "She just didn’t hit it up and down the wall. All I've concentrated on is helping her use the court more and up the level of her game."<br>
I reminded Atkinson that a few years ago, whenever she lost, she would say at the post-game interview that she had run out of gas. How has that changed?<br>
"I’m definitely working harder and I’m getting stronger, which may be something to do with my age. Probably all the years of training are beginning to pay off. I'm not hitting the wall that I used to hit. When I hit that wall, that would be the end of it. Now I hit the wall and recover," she says.<br>
Although she doesn't do any seven-mile runs like Michelle Martin, her training is broad and thorough. She works in the gym on cross-training machines and there are also 90-minute sessions with Tommy Berden and Natalie Grinham under the guidance of a trainer.<br>
"It's a combination of sprint work, speed work, Plyometrics and strength work – with a resistance band. It's a continuous 90-minute session. It's not the kind of workout where you feel knackered when you're finished, but if you try to play squash afterwards, your legs are like jelly. You feel it in your body but not your lungs," she explains.<br>
She also takes spinning classes (planned workouts on stationary bikes) which are one-hour sessions split into blocks of three, four or five minutes. She took it up when she read that spinning was one of the most squash-specific things you can do for endurance, because the heart rate is going up and down.
"It’s better for your body because there’s not as much pounding as with running, but it feels just as hard," she claims.<br>
This new regime led to her first breakthrough, when she beat Cassie Jackman in five games in the 2000 British Open. She followed this up with a win overt Suzanne Horner and then in November 2001 she finally notched up her first tournament win, the Deloitte Touche Cup, beating Rachael Grinham in the final.<br>
In the 2002 British Open she beat her coach Liz Irving in the first round, Natalie Pohrer in five (twice coming back from behind), Fiona Geaves in the quarters (another five-game victory) before losing to Sarah Fitz-Gerald in the semis. She was now beginning to understand what it takes to win the big ones."<br>
Nevertheless, she was losing every time to Cassie Jackman since that memorable victory. Finally, in April of this year, Atkinson kept to her game plan and beat Jackman in the final of the Irish Open and, just to show it was no fluke, she did it again a month later in the European Team Championships.<br>
Of the Irish victory she says: "That was another late charge. Cassie can also be up and down; she can really put the ball away and then come out with three or four tins to let you back in the game. In the fifth I could sense she was getting tired, so I told myself to keep the ball in court, under the top red line and above the tin. And it worked. It helps if you know the game plan and know what works and are able to stick with it, which is something I couldn't do before. Now with experience, maturity and fitness I am able to stick to a game plan and curb my instincts to go short.<br>
"Against someone like Cassie, you have to bury her in the back corners and not attack until she has gone short. This is against all my instincts and the way I normally play."<br>
This shows a new maturity and makes for a very positive prognosis from Liz Irving. "All her training and court work is beginning to kick in. She is still up and down a bit, but she has the game to go right to the top," promises Irving. "Her best is yet to come."<br>
Does Dutch Ginger Geordie agree with Irving's assessment? "Now that Sarah's gone, I do. I feel that now the number one spot is more within reach. I've beaten Natalie Pohrer, in the British Open last year; Carol Owens is the only one I haven’t beaten. She’s the only one that I regard as a real challenge. Her game is relentless; she gets everything back. While Carol is a bit scared of Natalie Pohrer because of her drops shots and her good drives, she doesn't have that fear with me and she seems to be confident when she plays me; I can't seem to get into the match.<br>
"Liz thinks that Carol is beatable and we've been working on deception because Liz feels that Carol tends to over-commit. So we're working on a bit of delay at the front. But you have to be prepared to stay on court as long as Carol, and that's hard because she's pretty tough," is Atkinson's realistic assessment.
I remind her of her jokes about a psychologist and whether she has actually had sessions with one.
"I probably should have, but I haven't. Liz loaned me a book on sports psychology which told you how to relax and get into a positive state of mind when you’re playing – especially if you get into trouble. I should read it again to refresh my mind. But no, I haven’t seen a psychologist."<br>
Atkinson is finally financially independent, owns her own flat and lives with her new boyfriend (who plays American football) and the old dog in The Hague. She is negotiating a new racket contract with Dunlop, gets free shoes and clothing from Nike (but no cash) and gets some funding the Dutch National Olympic Committee (NOC), which sponsors all sports in Holland whether they are Olympic or not.<br>
"I would get more funding if I wasn't so highly ranked," she says, implying that success has cost her. She is not moaning because the NOC, which is sponsored by Volkswagen, gives her a brand new VW Golf every 18 months.<br>
Despite her success, her biggest payday to date was just under US$3,000, but she is looking to beat that in the Grand Prix Finals in Qatar in May. How does she spend her money?<br>
"Going out, having fun, going to restaurants. I never seem to have any left. I like rock music, go to concerts. I like having a few drinks – unless a tournament is coming up. During a tournament I may have one beer or a glass of wine."<br>
Despite her slim figure, she says she has "a massive appetite" and she has to watch what she eats. She was a vegetarian for a while, "but I couldn't take it any more, watching everyone else eat meat. I physically feel better now that I’m eating meat," she claims.<br>
It's all falling into place now for the up-and-down Vanessa Atkinson. More recognition came when she was invited to join Sarah Fitz-Gerald on a WISPA promotional tour to Russia. It's a pretty full life, but she admits that the maternal instinct is “knocking at the door” and that babies are definitely in her plans. "I'll hold out for a few more years," she promises, which is good news for women's squash.<br>
