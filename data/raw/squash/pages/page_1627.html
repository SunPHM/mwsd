        <b>ABSOLUTE POWER DOES NOT CORRUPT</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <img src="../photos/toc2002/smPowerNicol50.jpg" width="350" height="288" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">Jonathon 
        Power took Peter Nicol apart tonight in Grand Central Station in a manner 
        that was not only unbelievable but also jaw-droppingly good. Not one person 
        in the packed seating would have predicted Power winning, never mind zipping 
        Nicol 3/0. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">It is a long time since I have seen 
        Power play this well and so consistently. It was, to use an overused word, 
        awesome. There were rallies where he jerked Nicol around the court as 
        though on the end of a piece of string. From about the midway point of 
        the first game, Nicol - normally totally unemotional - started to show 
        frustration at his inability to grab control back from Power. The Canadian 
        was in full flow, supremely confident , using his complete array of shots 
        and using every one of them at exactly the right time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>WINNERS ALL THE WAY</b> <br>
        From the very beginning of the first game Power showed his hand - he was 
        going to play his game: a backhand drop, followed by a backhand straight 
        nick, then a forehand drop into the nick and another backhand drop and 
        Power was 4-0 up. Nicol responded with a winner of his own to get his 
        first point and then an error put Power back in the driving seat and he 
        stretched his lead to 8-2. We have seen this slow start from Nicol before 
        - in fact in his matches against both Boswell and White.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> The expected resurgence this time, 
        however, never happened. He seemed a trifle slow and instead of burying 
        his opponent with his soft drops at the front, Power was tormenting him 
        there. Instead of Nicol stepping up the court, cutting everything off 
        and keeping Power on the hop, he was hanging back. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING? </b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smPowerNicol18.jpg" width="350" height="283" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">When 
        Power continued to dominate and take the game 15-6 in 12 ½ minutes, there 
        was bewilderment all round. Bewilderment, too at Power's behaviour, nearly 
        perfect. I think there was one appeal during the whole game and absolutely 
        no Power histrionics. That was a very good clue to his state of mind. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Still, Nicol has been one game down 
        before and come back with a vengance and so the second game was awaited 
        with some interest. No change. Five winners, two errors and a stroke and 
        he was 8-4 ahead: the course of the game depended on what Power did with 
        the ball…Nicol could nothing but react as Power continued to jerk him 
        around. Nevertheless Nicol pulled back to 7-8 threatening finally to take 
        control but Power won a dropping duel to get to 9-7 and then he led 10-8. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">On the next rally Power really started 
        to pull the strings and could be accused of cruel and unjust punishment. 
        If there was one rally that could have destroyed Nicol's confidence this 
        was it; he was pulled from front to back, back to front and inside out 
        and he lost it. Leading 11-8 Power turned the screw - a backhand drop, 
        a forehand baost another backahdn drop and he was at game point.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> On the next rally he put up a lob 
        and Nicol went for an overhead drop shot - and hit tin. Second game to 
        Power 15-8 after 19 minutes of exhibition squash by the man the dubbed 
        The Magician.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <b>NO WAY BACK </b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smPowerNicol109.jpg" width="300" height="281" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Nicol 
        has the perfect temperament for squash, rarely getting upset, rarely arguing 
        with the referees. Tonight he showed more emotion than I have ever seen 
        before. There was frustration, annoyance and finally - and this rare - 
        resignation. Power, who took two games from Nicol in the YMG Classic in 
        Toronto two months ago, was not about to let up. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">He hasn't beaten Nicol in 14 months 
        - the last time was in Toronto in December 2000, and he knew people were 
        beginning to write him off , especially in view of the way Nicol had been 
        playing for the last couple of month. Nicol led 1-0 in the third, but 
        it was meaningless. Power, who had beaten Lee Beachill in the second round 
        in a 1 hour and 50 minute match, had demonstrated that he had no trouble 
        with fitness and now he was going to prove it again. He got to 4-2 with 
        another cruel rally that had Nicol doing court sprints.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">He kept playing his unique game and 
        Nicol had no answer, no strategy to stop him. Power hit eight outright 
        winners in the game: he led 11-4 and relaxed slightly to allow Nicol to 
        get to 8-12. Nicol put him in the front right and Power played a shot 
        that I cannot name : the racket appears to go in several directions at 
        once (a quaquaversal deception?) and then makes contact with the ball 
        to perform a top spin forehand roll corner. Please don't ask me to explain 
        it again. The result is a winning shot and more misery for Nicol as the 
        crowd erupts in appreciation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <b>I DID IT MY WAY</b><br>
        A couple of more winners from Power and at game ball a dispirited Nicol 
        hit a forehand cross court into the tin. Power had earned - deserved - 
        this historic 53 minute victory and Nicol will go home knowing that he 
        is not yet undisputed king of the castle. When I asked Power what had 
        happened he said </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">" I played my game and was not going 
        to be caught into playing Nicol's running game. I had been watching Peter 
        running well all week, but tonight I noticed he was a little slow getting 
        to my drop shots." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">What was the difference between Boston 
        and New York? "To start with I didn't get back spasms in the first six 
        points. I was in good shape tonight and I knew that my fitness was ok. 
        I knew that my second round match against Lee Beachill was the premier 
        match of the draw and when I got through that in nearly two hours that 
        gave me a lot of confidence." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">A great night, a great surprise results, 
        but sadly the end of another terrific Tournament of Champions, which has 
        rapidly become my favourite tournament. John Nimick has found the secret 
        to putting on tournaments and the PSA players presented him with an award 
        to show their appreciation of his efforts. Nobody deserves that more and 
        I shall be in Boston in September for his next US Open, in Toronto in 
        November for his YMG Classic and, you bet, back in New York next January 
        for the Tournament of Champions. Order your tickets now! </font></p>
