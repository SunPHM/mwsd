        Jonathon Power battled third-seed David Palmer from Australia in a 
        five-game nail-biter<span lang="en-gb"> </span>to win the final match of 
        the US $40,000 Pace Credit Union Canadian Squash Classic at<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>BCE Place in Toronto. </font> </p>
        <p><font style="font-size: 8pt">Power defeated Palmer 15-4, 12-15, 15-8, 10-15, 15-12 before a<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>very supportive capacity crowd.</font></p>
        <p><font style="font-size: 8pt">Power took the lead early in the first game and didn’t look back, 
        winning 15-4 in a game<span lang="en-gb"> </span>characterized by superb 
        shot making and incredible rallies. In the second game, David<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>Palmer took an early 5-0 lead and won 15-12 in a game that Power 
        let slip away.<span lang="en-gb"> <br>
        <br>
        </span>“In the 2nd game I just lost concentration. I got a bad start, my 
        back was hurting, and I<span lang="en-gb"> </span>was thinking about it 
        and I lost concentration,” said Power. </font> </p>
        <p><font style="font-size: 8pt">“If I could have closed out<span lang="en-gb"> </span>the second game 
        I could have won in three, but he got in there and made it a tough fight<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>from there on out.” </font> </p>
        <p><font style="font-size: 8pt">And a tough fight it was, with numerous twists, tangles and<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>collisions.<br>
        <br>
        Power dominated the third game 15-8, but Palmer came back to take the 
        fourth. In the<span lang="en-gb"> </span>final game, Power disputed a 
        call and was penalized a point, dropping 4-6. Power battled<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>back in front of the rallying crowd with deft soft corner shots 
        and diving returns to win<span lang="en-gb"> </span>15-12.<br>
        <br>
        “I wanted to play my game and move well,” said an exhausted but thrilled 
        Power. “I<span lang="en-gb"> </span>knew that if I played well, I could 
        take him so I just settled down and played my game<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>and that’s what happened. Getting those few points at the end 
        helped. I found a rhythm<span lang="en-gb"> </span>in the 5th game.”<br>
        <br>
        David Palmer saw things somewhat differently. “I’m pretty happy with how 
        I played but<span lang="en-gb"> </span>I’m disappointed the way he 
        plays. I’m playing as fair as I can and I still feel I’m getting<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>disadvantaged by the way he plays. </font> </p>
        <p><span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">&quot;</font></span><font style="font-size: 8pt">It showed tonight and it’s disappointing. 
        If he<span lang="en-gb"> </span>chooses to play that way, that’s the way 
        he plays. He doesn’t play the ball. Every time I<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>play an attacking-type shot, he doesn’t want to play the ball.”<br>
        <br>
        The hometown crowd was obviously behind Power. “When you’re suffering 
        physically<span lang="en-gb"> </span>and you’re really feeling tired, 
        that type of stuff pushes you to grit your teeth and push<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>and dig deep,” said Power. </font> </p>
        <p><font style="font-size: 8pt">“This is where I grew up playing and I feel comfortable here,<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>and where I feel comfortable, that’s usually where I play well. 
        And I’m happy to win,<span lang="en-gb"> </span>obviously, in my home 
        town.”<br>
        <br>
        Power thanked the capacity crowd upon winning the tournament. “The 
        squash<span lang="en-gb"> </span>community in Toronto has always been 
        very good to me and very supportive. Thanks for<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>coming out and pushing me through in those last tough points. I 
        needed that. Believe<span lang="en-gb"> </span>me.”</font></td>

        <b><i>Doug Maybee reports<br>
        </i></b>The crowd got their money’s worth at tonight’s semi-final action 
        in the US $40,000 Pace Credit Union Canadian Squash Classic at BCE Place 
        in Toronto.<br>
        <br>
        In the first match of the evening, British Open champion and third-seed 
        David Palmer defeated #21 Omar Elborolossy of Egypt in three straight. 
         
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">This brought to an end the string of surprise victories by Elborolossy, 
        who upset top-seed Peter Nicol in the opening round. Getting to the 
        semi-finals tonight was the best-ever achievement for Elborolossy on the 
        tour.<br>
        <br>
        In an evenly matched first game, Palmer and Elborolossy had plenty of 
        long rallies but it all boiled down to who made the least amount of 
        mistakes. Palmer had the upper hand throughout most of the match while 
        Elborolossy couldn’t put together the string of points when he needed it 
        most.  </font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">In the second and third games, Elborolossy started strong with 
        early leads, but quickly squandered them.<br>
        <br>
        “Obviously I was very happy to win 3-love and get through to the 
        finals,” said Palmer.  </font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">“I really tried to stick to my game plan tonight 
        to move him around. He’s a big guy. My idea tonight was to get in there 
        and twist and turn him and make him stretch at the front as much as 
        possible. Physically I feel pretty good. I’ve got a problem with my ribs 
        so I’m having a little trouble breathing. I’m happy to get to the final.
        <br>
        <br>
        &quot;When I step on court tomorrow I’ll be there to play. The crowd is a big 
        factor with Jonathon. I won’t be changing my game plan. It should be a 
        really good match. I haven’t played him for the past 3 years. We played 
        twice in the PSA, he won one and I won one. I’m looking forward to 
        playing him. It will be a good experience.”<br>
        <br>
        Elborolossy was happy with tonight’s performance. “I thought I had a 
        chance today, but it’s okay. It was a very good week for me and a good 
        comeback. All the games were really close until the very end. I was 
        playing okay, but I missed three or four points, the last few points, in 
        every game that made the difference. And he was more consistent. He 
        didn’t do lots of mistakes and that’s why he got it.”|<br>
        <br>
        Power and White played a match of titans. Both moved the ball all over 
        the court trying to tire the other out. In the first game, Power came 
        back after trailing by five points at 7- 2 to take the game 15-9.  </font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">The 
        start of the second game mirrored the first up to 7-2, but Power was 
        never able to close the gap and began showing great frustration with his 
        play. The calmer White took that game 15-7. <br>
        <br>
        In the third, Power maintained the upper hand throughout the game, never 
        giving up the lead to finish it 15-11 as White appeared to begin to 
        tire. In game four, Power had the advantage up to nine, when the tables 
        turned in White’s favour up to 13-10. Power had to dig deep and 
        completely exhausted White to come back and finished the match 15-13.<br>
        <br>
        “I’m happy with that win. It was a good win for me,” said Power. “I 
        haven’t beaten John in a PSA bout before so it was good. I played a 
        little bit smarter against him. He reacts pretty well to my natural 
        game, so I had to play a little more tactical, and it seemed to work. It 
        was close though. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;I wasn’t too far from losing that one either, so it’s good. I just 
        tried to move well, pick up a lot of balls and get him tired and force 
        the play. I think he suffered a little bit physically in patches and 
        made some mistakes. I play well in Toronto, probably because I grew up 
        playing here. It takes a lot out of you physically, but I was psyched up 
        and the adrenaline was pumping.”<br>
        <br>
        After tonight’s bout, John White said: “I’m a little disappointed having 
        been up 7-2 in the first and losing 15-9. And I was up 13-10 in the 
        fourth. It’s just one of those things. It’s always exciting when you 
        play Jon Power and it was much as I expected from him and from us both.”</font></span></p>
        <p><span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">About facing Palmer in the final tomorrow, Power said: “Over my career 
        we have matched up pretty well. We’ve had some ugly pig fights and some 
        strong matches, too.”</font></span></p>

        of England.&nbsp;In classic form, Power<span lang="en-gb"> </span>dominated 
        all three games.&nbsp;His speed and incredible accuracy kept<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>Chaloner on the defensive throughout, making him chase balls all 
        over<span lang="en-gb"> </span>the court.&nbsp; When these two meet, there 
        are bound to be plenty of heated moments.&nbsp;Tonight was no exception. There were numerous appeals by both<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>players to referee decisions. Power also received a 'conduct 
        warning for<span lang="en-gb"> </span>decent' in game three.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        &quot;It was exactly what I expected,&quot; said Power of tonight's match.<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>&quot;Pretty much all our matches are a thousand let calls and a long<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>three-love. We both fight for the same positions.&nbsp;We don't give 
        up any<span lang="en-gb"> </span>space.&nbsp;He's quick and gets a lot of 
        balls back. He's strong on the<span lang="en-gb"> </span>ball so there 
        is a lot of physical play out there.&nbsp;I felt like I<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>controlled the ball well, and I didn't get too rattled, although 
        I<span lang="en-gb"> </span>disputed a few calls.&nbsp;I kept my composure 
        and kept going.&nbsp; I control<span lang="en-gb"> </span>the middle of the 
        court more than him and I make him do more work than<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>me and he gets tired towards the end, and I tend to get a run of 
        points<span lang="en-gb"> </span>when I break him physically a little 
        bit.&nbsp;It was a nice win today.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        In the last of four <span lang="en-gb">quarter-finals</span>, 
        second-seed <b>John White</b> of<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Scotland was 
        severely tested by #18 Paul Price of Australia, who won a<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>mid-level PSA tournament in Saskatoon earlier this month.&nbsp;In the 
        first<span lang="en-gb"> </span>two games, Price let his lead slip 
        through his fingers when White came<span lang="en-gb"> </span>from 
        behind to win them both.&nbsp;In game one, White was behind 10-12 and<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>finished it 15-12. In game two, White was six points behind and 
        managed<span lang="en-gb"> </span>to catch up to Price at 14.&nbsp; Price 
        held up three fingers to take the<span lang="en-gb"> </span>game to 17.&nbsp;White won three straight points to take the game 17-14.&nbsp;In<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>game three, Price started to unravel when White was leading 7-2.<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>Fighting to hang on, he closed to within two points of White.<br>
        <br>
        But White would have none of it and shut it down 15-1<span lang="en-gb">1</span>.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;It was a bit of a shooting match out there with Price,&quot; said White.<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>&quot;There weren't that many long hard gruelling rallies.&nbsp;His shots 
        were<span lang="en-gb"> </span>working and so were mine. I had to 
        tighten up half-way through the<span lang="en-gb"> </span>second when I 
        was down 12-6. I was giving up too much freedom in the<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>centre of the court.&nbsp; He was putting it away, just punishing me.&nbsp;I just<span lang="en-gb"> </span>kept it to the side wall and he made a 
        few errors and opened the court<span lang="en-gb"> </span>back up for me 
        which made his confidence drop down a bit let me get back<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>in the match.&nbsp;And that's what took me through.&nbsp;It was pretty 
        much the<span lang="en-gb"> </span>same thing in the both first games.&nbsp; 
        If I have a couple of extra yards<span lang="en-gb"> </span>along the 
        side wall on this court, I'm going to go for it. On this<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>court, you can actually put a few winners away.&nbsp;And if you put 
        it away,<span lang="en-gb"> </span>you frustrate your opponent like Paul 
        was frustrating me and I was<span lang="en-gb"> </span>frustrating me.&nbsp;If you make a couple of errors, then you've got to go<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>back to basics like I did here today and it paid dividends.&nbsp;I 
        put it<span lang="en-gb"> </span>together today which makes it feel a 
        lot better for the win three-love.<br>
        <br>
        About going against Jonathon Power tomorrow: &quot;Great stuff.&nbsp;I'm looking<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>forward to it already.&nbsp;It always great playing Jon.&nbsp;You just 
        don't<span lang="en-gb"> </span>know what to expect.&nbsp; With his antics

        </font>
        <span lang="en-gb"><font style="font-size: 8pt">always going to be an interesting match.&quot;</font></span></p>
        <p><font style="font-size: 8pt">The first two <span lang="en-gb">quarter-finals at BCE Place</span> 
        were crowd pleasing,&nbsp;closely fought matches. <br>
        <br>
        Canada's Graham Ryding of Toronto opened strongly and held firm control<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>at the beginning of the first game, forcing <span lang="en-gb">
        World Champion <b>David </b></span><b>Palmer</b> to the back of the<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>court.&nbsp;It took that first half of the game for Palmer to reach 
        his<span lang="en-gb"> </span>stride after a series of simple technical 
        mistakes that cost him<span lang="en-gb"> </span>precious points early 
        on.&nbsp; Palmer persevered to win the first game 15-13<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>earning a stroke on the final point.&nbsp; Game two was more evenly 
        played.<span lang="en-gb"> <br>
        <br>
        </span>Mid game, Palmer plowed into the right wall, potentially 
        aggravating a<span lang="en-gb"> </span>rib injury, but he managed to 
        shrug it off to take the game.&nbsp;In game<span lang="en-gb"> </span>three 
        the feisty Ryding surged ahead and maintained a healthy lead right<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>up to the 12th point.&nbsp;That's when Palmer moved ahead and hung 
        on to<span lang="en-gb"> </span>take the match in three straight.<br>
        <br>
        It wasn't one of my best matches.&nbsp;I am really lucky to win<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>three-love,&quot; said Palmer.&nbsp;&quot;I didn't find I had my rhythm 
        tonight.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Obviously I'm happy to have won.&nbsp;I 
        don't think Graham played his best<span lang="en-gb"> </span>either.&nbsp;There were some good rallies in there. To come away three-love<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>and head into the semis, I'm very happy.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I played OK, I competed well,&quot; said Ryding. I just made too many<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>mistakes at the end of the games.&nbsp;That was the difference - a 
        couple of<span lang="en-gb"> </span>points every game.&nbsp;My lead in the 
        third game got away from me.&nbsp;I tried<span lang="en-gb"> </span>to keep 
        him behind me to stay in mid court.&nbsp;I didn't want to cross<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>court too much, just keep it straight and deep. He won the first 
        game<span lang="en-gb"> </span>and settled down.&nbsp;The difference was 
        losing the first game.&nbsp;Yet I felt<span lang="en-gb"> </span>I could 
        have had him the whole time.&nbsp;I lost the first two but they were<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>close and it was just a matter of getting more into my game plan 
        and<span lang="en-gb"> </span>finding my timing.&nbsp;But I never really 
        found my rhythm.&nbsp;There were a<span lang="en-gb"> </span>lot of mistakes 
        and neither one of us controlled the match the way we<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>wanted to.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        In the second match of the night, #21 <b>Omar Elborolossy</b>, who 
        ousted<span lang="en-gb"> </span>top-seed Peter Nicol in last night's 
        opening round, accomplished what he<span lang="en-gb"> </span>set out to 
        do - to prove to the officials back home in Egypt that after<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>a year of nursing a knee injury, he was back in winning form.&nbsp;He 
        came<span lang="en-gb"> </span>out strong in the first match handily 
        beating his brother-in-law #11 Amr<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Shabana 
        15-7.&nbsp;The left-handed Shabana, the second best squash player in<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>Egypt, found his spark in the second game and started moving the 
        bigger<span lang="en-gb"> </span>Elborolossy around the court with a mix 
        of long shots and deadly<span lang="en-gb"> </span>accurate drops.&nbsp; 
        Elborolossy took charge of the third game, and lead all<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>the way through. In the fourth, it was right down to the wire.&nbsp;At<span lang="en-gb"> </span>13-12, Shabana crashed into the rear right 
        corner and favoured his right<span lang="en-gb"> </span>shoulder when he 
        got back on his feet.&nbsp; Elborolossy shut it down in<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>short order after that.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;We always play good matches.&nbsp;We are very good friends,&quot; said<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>Elborolossy after winning his second match in a row.&nbsp;&quot;We are 
        related<span lang="en-gb"> </span>and enjoy playing each other.&nbsp;I had 
        some problems with our national<span lang="en-gb"> </span>association in 
        the last few months.&nbsp;I wasn't selected for the Egyptian<span lang="en-gb">
        </span>team in the World Team Championships in Vienna&nbsp; in October. The 
        team<span lang="en-gb"> </span>didn't do as well as they should have 
        It's a good achievement for me to<span lang="en-gb"> </span>show them 
        that I'm still here. I'm looking forward to taking on Palmer<span lang="en-gb">

      The landscape of the 2003 Pace Credit Union Canadian Squash Classic

      <br>
      Elborolossy clearly dominated the first two games from the outset keeping

      Nicol burst ahead and held his momentum to the 15th point. In game four, 
      both were fighting for control of the court, Nicol facing elimination.

      &quot;I am very happy with the way I played,&quot; Elborolossy said grinning from 
      ear to ear. &quot;I had a bad knee last season and my ranking dropped. I am 
      ranked 21 now and I know that I can play some good squash again. My 
      strategy tonight was simply to play my best. The only good thing about 
      playing Nicol in the opening round is that there is no pressure. You just 
      go and do your best and see how it goes. I was very confident with my 
      shots and it went OK. In game three, I was a bit tired after the second. I 
      started a bit slower and he got a few good points and started to be very 
      quick. I didn't want to fight very much as the gap was very big. I wanted 
      to reserve energy for the fourth. It was very tough. I was feeling really 
      tired. In the fourth when I reached nine and ten, I could feel that he was 
      under pressure. He wasn't getting his shots. He wasn't very confident. 
      That's when I felt I had the chance and I had to go for it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Nicol so rarely loses in the first round. &quot;It hasn't quite sunk in yet,&quot; 
      said a dejected Nicol after the match. &quot;It's incredibly strange. I feel 
      like I'm just now ready to get going and take on the next round. But there 
      won't be a next round. So being out is really bizarre. It's strange not 
      going to the director and asking for a practice time.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      On his play tonight, Nicol commented: &quot;I did OK. I didn't play that well 
      but I didn't play that badly. Omar took it to me. He kept it straight and 
      tight. I wanted to go short too quickly and win it too easily and that 
      wasn't going to happen. I should have been more patient, hit the ball deep 
      and make him work a little more and then put it in. I was making myself do 
      more work and he was controlling the game. In the third, I stepped forward 
      and played really well. I think he eased off a bit and his concentration 
      was off a little bit. He adjusted in the fourth and swept up.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Jonathon Power</b>, defending his 2002 Canadian Squash Classic title, 
      took 49 minutes to win his opener against Jan Koukal of the Czech Republic 
      in three straight games in front of an almost capacity crowd. After the 
      match, the hometown favourite said:<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It went pretty good. It was a good match. He played well. He hit a lot of 
      balls making me hit a lot of balls and made me get into the flow of the 
      tournament. He's really tough to play. He's really quick. He's so light 
      and he moves so well he doesn't get tired doing all that running. I just 
      wanted to find my game early, not really worry a lot about it too much and 
      be relaxed. It was perfect. Long enough to get me in the swing of things, 
      get me seeing the ball again. I think my game is pretty good. I think I've 
      got a good chance. I'm playing pretty well these days.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      In earlier matches in the opening round played at the Fitness Institute, a 
      short distance from BCE Place, <b>Graham Ryding </b>of Canada took four 
      games for to defeat Jon Kemp of England, who advanced to the main draw 
      from the qualifying tournament this past weekend. Kemp put up a valiant 
      effort in the first two games but fell apart in the second two. Ryding's 
      fitness and precision allowed him to pretty much have his way with Kemp, 
      particularly in the second half of the match. <br>
      <br>
      Egypt's <b>Amr Shabana</b> was just too strong for Canadian Viktor Berg, 
      who also qualified for the main draw this weekend. Shabana, who cruised 
      through most of the four-game match, used his finesse to make Berg move 
      all over the court. Berg won the third game, but put out so much effort 
      that he ran out of steam by the fourth game and had trouble maintaining 
      focus and precision. </font></span></p>

      from Canadian Press</a><br>
      </b></i></span><font size="1">A return to his hometown may be just what 
      Canada's top squash player needs to turn his season around. Jonathan Power 
      is the No. 4-seed at the 2003 Pace Credit Union Canadian Classic which 
      starts Monday in Toronto. He has won the event two of the last three 
      years.<br>
      <br>
      The 29-year-old, who lives in Montreal, has had a tough season. The former 
      world No. 1 dropped as low as fifth in the&nbsp; world rankings before 
      rising to the No. 4 position this month.<br>
      <br>
      He made early exits from two tournaments in the last year because of eye 
      injuries. Power has also come up short in three straight matches against 
      archrival Peter Nicol of England, including a loss at the Canadian Open in 
      Edmonton earlier this month.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I'd like to avenge some of those losses,&quot; Power said. &quot;I've been playing 
      pretty much constantly since August so I think I'm in pretty good match 
      shape. I just hope the body holds up and gets through another week.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Power was struck with a racket during a match against David Palmer of 
      Australia at the World Open in Belgium last December.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;He just tried to clear me out a little bit, make me run the long way 
      around and sort of hit me full swing in the eye with the racket, Power 
      said. &quot;That set my whole year back because it was such a big tournament 
      rankings-wise.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      A few months later, Power was hit in the eye with a ball during a match 
      with Thierry Lincou of France.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It was a freak accident,&quot; Power said. &quot;It was between points, he just 
      went to hit the ball to himself off the wall and he hit it right into my 
      eye, he didn't see me.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Power lived in Toronto for several years before moving to Montreal a few 
      years ago. He hopes a victory in Toronto, in front of a partisan crowd, 
      will give him the momentum he needs to finish out the season strong.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The two biggest (events) are the last two tournaments of the year. If I 
      can win the <a target="_top" href="http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/qatar">
      Qatar Classic</a> and the
      <a target="_top" href="http://www.worldopensquash.com">World Open</a> in 
      Pakistan&nbsp; , then I can get back to No. 1, hopefully,&quot; Power said.
