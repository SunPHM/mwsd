Silicon Valley and the adjacent San Francisco Peninsula sport a roster of fine restaurants that hold their own with the best of the country&#146;s other culinary meccas. When lunch or dinnertime roll around, your toughest decision is simply to select the cuisine and atmosphere that suit your mood. Then just pick your spot from the appetizing menu on the following pages. </i></font>

						<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>WATERSIDE WITH A VIEW<br>
						</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">From vistas of San Francisco Bay to the cascading surf and rugged headlands of the Pacific Coast, select your preference of panoramic views, and any of the following restaurants will serve you up a meal to match the splendor of the scenery.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At <b>Kincaid&#146;s Bay House</b> in Burlingame, spacious picture windows offer waterside dining with mesmerizing views of San Francisco Bay from every table. Jetliners descending toward SFO will add another visual touch to your fresh seafood, chops and aged steaks. Savor nouvelle American cuisine in <b>Mistral</b>&#146;s comfortable waterfront patio, fronting a placid Redwood Shores lagoon. The San Mateo County Coast offers a plethora of restaurants with scenic sights to complement your meal, including the <b>Miramar Beach Restaurant</b> just north of Half Moon Bay. This historic dining establishment, once a speakeasy during Prohibition, includes a sweeping view from Pillar Point to Miramar with your lunch or dinner&#133;there&#146;s no better place to catch a sunset! On the southern edge of town, the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay features <b>Navio</b>, an elegant restaurant overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Half Moon Bay Golf Links. Farther north, the <b>Moss Beach Distillery</b>, another former speakeasy perched at the edge of a commanding coastal bluff, features dramatic cliff-top views and a resident ghost along with seafood favorites and steaks. Come early for a glass of wine on the back patio, where you&#146;ll look almost straight down at long rows of breakers crashing dramatically against the reef below. In Pacifica, <b>Moonraker</b> sits a few feet above a rocky beach. Floodlights highlight the dramatic view at night, creating a romantic atmosphere in which to enjoy delicious seafood, steaks and more. A scenic hour&#146;s drive south along the coast will take you to Santa Cruz Harbor and the <b>Crow&#146;s Nest</b>, another noted beachfront restaurant where you can kick back, relax and enjoy fresh fish, aged Midwestern beef, and of course, an outstanding view.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>FARM-FRESH FARE<br>
						</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">California&#146;s fertile Central Valley produces a vast majority of the country&#146;s fresh produce, so it makes sense that natives love their food seasonal, just-picked, and 100% organic. So relax, sip a refreshing glass of local wine, and enjoy your saffron pasta with just-picked artichokes, sundried tomatoes and portabello mushrooms.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Basin</b> in Saratoga serves modern American fare utilizing only hand-picked fresh produce, international cheeses and dry-aged meats to create super fresh, wildly colorful, eclectic dishes. Renowned restaurateur Bradley Ogden&#146;s traditional fare at San Mateo&#146;s <b>Lark Creek</b> features a menu blending classic and innovative dishes that share seasonal farm-fresh origins and satisfying flavors. Have you ever tried roasted pheasant with huckleberry sauce? Bradley Ogden also owns, along with Chef Bart Hosmer, <b>Parcel 104</b> in Santa Clara. Their focus is on seasonal, farm-fresh American favorites with a twist: hand crafted noodles with kabocha squash, pine nuts and potted cheese is a delicious example. Owned by self-professed &quot;organic princess&quot; Jesse Cool, Menlo Park&#146;s homey <b>Flea Street Caf&eacute;</b> is notable for utilizing only organic, locally-grown food items. Menu offerings are nourishing and satisfying, like the meals grandma used to make.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;HOT&quot; SPOTS<br>
						</b>If you&#146;re drawn to those lively, guaranteed-to-be bustling eateries that everyone clamors to go to, places that are &quot;all the rage,&quot; here are some spots where the high-spirited crowd itself is part of the attraction!<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The dining scene doesn&#146;t get much livelier than Palo Alto, where high-techies throng in search of solace after a long day&#146;s work. <b>Nola&#146;</b>s draws crowds for its great mixed drinks, fiery fusion food (think Cajun, Creole, Caribbean and Southwest flavors somehow blending harmoniously together on your plate) and convivial surroundings. Nearby, <b>Buca di Beppo</b> replicates the vibrant informality of an immigrant paisano eatery. It bustles nightly with boisterous action, with &quot;happy birthday&#146;s&quot; sung here and &quot;when the moon hits your eye&quot; played there. The flavorful food is often served in generous, family-style abundance intended to be shared by groups, but is also available in smaller portions designed for two. Also in the same vicinity, ever-bustling <b>Evvia</b> is another popular downtown restaurant offering outstanding nouvelle Hellenistic cuisine in a warm, rustic atmosphere. <b>La Bodeguita del Medio</b> (named after the Havana gathering place once frequented by Hemingway) boasts a tropical atmosphere where the rum mojitos are refreshing, the seafood is delicious, and the ambiance is friendly. <b>Niebaum-Coppola</b> is a caf&eacute;-style wine bar and restaurant owned by the famed director of The Godfather and numerous other acclaimed films. Locals gather for the warm d&eacute;cor, hearty Italian dishes, bold wines, al fresco seating, and a possible glimpse of Coppola himself.<br>
						In neighboring Menlo Park, <b>Wild Hare </b>is a happening restaurant with exotic cuisine and lively atmosphere. Owner/Chef Joey Altman&#146;s main focus is on wild game, but his menu also offers other food items based on farmstead products, like artisan cheeses and local produce. Also in Menlo Park, <b>Left Bank</b> is a regularly humming brasserie with a spacious indoor dining room as well as sidewalk seating, and d&eacute;cor evoking a European ambiance. It offers its patrons a choice of fabulous French fare, snacks al fresco, or cocktails at their glass-walled bar. Farther south, in the heart of downtown San Jose, <b>Stratta</b> is a terrific place to go to before the theatre or an evening sports event. It&#146;s a particular favorite with those seeking a classic, well-shaken martini or single malt scotch to enjoy with their juicy steak.<br>
						</font><font face="Verdana"><br>
						</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>SOPHISTICATED DINING<br>
						</b>Silicon Valley has justly earned its growing reputation for fine dining. The most recent Zagat Survey&#151;covering the entire Bay Area&#151;ranked two South Bay restaurants in the Top Ten overall. We&#146;ve come a long way, baby!<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">San Jose&#146;s <b>Le Papillon</b> is acknowledged to be one of the Bay Area&#146;s truly elite dining spots, rated by Zagat Survey 2002 as the top restaurant for food in the South Bay, and 4th overall in the Bay Area. (See &quot;Who's Cooking&quot; at the end of page) Another regular San Jose award-winner is <b>Emile&#146;s</b>, whose outstanding French-Swiss cuisine is buttressed by a mind-boggling collection of wines, a sophisticated setting, and a long tradition of culinary excellence. <b>Paolo&#146;s</b>, yet another renowned San Jose restaurant, has long-held a</font><font face="Verdana"> </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">coveted four-star rating for its fine Italian cuisine featuring both</font><font face="Verdana"> </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">contemporary and time honored classics from seafood to game, paired with an</font><font face="Verdana"> <img height="218" width="202" src="../photos/CafeGibraltar.jpg" align="left"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">award-winning wine list. <b>Viognier</b> in downtown San Mateo is notable for Chef Scott Giambastiani&#146;s menu, which reflects the seasonal bounty of Northern California infused with bold Mediterranean flavors. Redwood City&#146;s <b>Chantilly</b> transports you to a French chateau with silk damask walls and Louis XIV chairs. In addition to the exceptional French cuisine, the Paul Wyatt-designed wine cellar is a stunning showcase for the best California and French bottlings. <b>231 Ellsworth</b> in San Mateo is an elegant, eclectic New American restaurant in a class by itself. Also a Zagat Survey darling, its winning points include French-inspired basics enlivened with unexpected flavors, and a twelve thousand bottle wine list with over 800 different California and international selections.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>AL FRESCO DINING<br>
						</b>Silicon Valley residents love to boast about their 300+ days of sunshine a year and the delightful, Mediterranean-like climate that makes open-air dining an attractive choice virtually year-round. Bring your favorite sunglasses for lunch and a light sweater for dinner, and you&#146;ll be all set to dine under the open skies.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Palo Alto&#146;s <b>Caffe Riace</b> surrounds you with Old World charm. Seating can be indoors or out, in a marble and granite piazza centered by a fountain where you can enjoy the Carruba family&#146;s traditional Sicilian dishes. At <b>Bella Mia</b>&#151;a large and perennially popular dinner house in downtown San Jose brimming with lively turn-of-the-century charm&#151;the backyard garden is ideal for summertime dining. (Heated lamps keep it nice and toasty in the cooler winter months.) Al fresco dining is also featured a few miles west at Saratoga&#146;s charming <b>Bella Saratoga</b>, whose attractive outdoor patio beckons hungry patrons with a promise of tasty Italian dishes.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>TABLES FOR TWO<br>
						</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Do you want to take your date to a romantic place where the two of you can enjoy a quiet, relaxing meal and whisper softly to each other instead of shouting thro</font><font face="Verdana"><img height="216" width="202" src="../photos/Bittersweetdessert.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">ugh the din? Silicon Valley may be</font><font face="Verdana"> </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">known for its high-tech efficiency, but it does have a softer side. Here are some restaurants that can make hearts skip a beat.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stained glass chandeliers softly light <b>Sent Sovi</b>&#146;s dining room, whose walls are decorated with colorful paintings. The intimate dining room and universally acclaimed French menu make the pilgrimage to Saratoga a must. <b>L&#146;Amie Donia</b>, a French brasserie in Palo Alto, has white-linen banquette seating, French seasonal bistro cuisine, and features a prix fixe meal called &quot;Today&#146;s Market Whims.&quot; Located in downtown San Jose&#146;s historic San Pedro Square, <b>71 Saint Peter</b> combines the style of a European bistro with the friendly service of an American caf&eacute;. Creative, eclectic dishes are served either indoors or al fresco on the patio. A romantic, &quot;special occasion&quot; restaurant tucked in Mountain View, <b>Chez TJ</b> offers outstanding French cuisine, well-spaced tables and fresh flowers from the garden. OO LA LA.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>STEAKHOUSES</b><br>
						Amidst the growing plethora of restaurants offering virtually every type of exotic world cuisine, traditional American steakhouses still command an enthusiastic and loyal following. After a hard day&#146;s work, what&#146;s more satisfying than a thick but tender filet mignon, or a hot platter of juicy roast beef?<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stop by San Jose&#146;s San Pedro Square for <b>Blake&#146;s</b>, a spacious, high-ceilinged restaurant highlighted by an impressive wall mural of rural, turn-of-the-century Silicon Valley. While noted for its generous servings of beef and other meats cooked to your taste, you&#146;ll also find seafood, poultry, salads and other items on the menu. Also in San Jose, <b>The Grill&#146;s</b> elegant, wood-paneled ambiance sets the mood for its impeccably prepared selections of steaks and chops. <b>Sundance The Steakhouse</b>, an upscale Palo Alto dining institution, has been serving juicy steaks and prime ribs to hungry locals for over 28 years. The elegant mahogany dining room and fireplace lounge are equally ideal for impressing clients at business meetings or your evening date. Back in San Jose again, <b>Henry&#146;s World Famous Hi-Life</b> is a long-time favorite haunt, especially for San Jose Sharks fans before and after games at the nearby Arena. The atmosphere is lively, the d&eacute;cor casual, and the menu is guaranteed to make any carnivore think they&#146;ve found nirvana. Now in its sixth decade, <b>The Vans</b> in Belmont serves up sweeping views of the Peninsula and glimpses of San Francisco Giant and 49ers players along with its robust selections of prime rib, steaks, chops, seafood and other daily chef&#146;s specials.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>WORTH THE DRIVE<br>
						</b>Silicon Valley harbors a number of unique restaurants that are a little off the beaten track, but worth every minute of a short drive that will often be scenically as well as gastronomically rewarding. So gas up and sally forth.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The nearby Pacific Coast, reachable in about half an hour from most parts of Silicon Valley and the Peninsula, offers several noteworthy dining spots. <b>Pasta Moon</b>, located in the charming coastal town of Half Moon Bay, has been praised many times over by Zagat for its superb Italian cuisine served in a fashionably romantic setting. A few blocks up the street, <b>Cetrella</b> is a vibrant European Bistro whose ambiance is highlighted by a fireplace, as well as an extensive wine cellar perfect for that special occasion. A few miles up the coast in Montara, cozily petite <b>Caf&eacute; Gibraltar </b>is a gem that leaves you with strong memories and a craving to return. (See &quot;Who's Cooking&quot; at the end of page) South of Half Moon Bay, Pescadero&#146;s <b>Duarte&#146;s Tavern </b>is a page right out of a history book. Open since 1894, this culinary landmark is famed for its seafood dishes and country-style atmosphere.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winding along the top of the mountain ridge that divides the Peninsula from the Coast, sinuously scenic Skyline Boulevard will take you to Woodside&#146;s <b>Mountain House</b> for an entirely different experience. This mountain cabin nestled amid giant redwood trees has a rustic bar, stone fireplaces and a romantic dining room serving excellent California and American cuisine. A mile north on Skyline, venerable <b>Bella Vista </b>(built in 1927) is another evocative, redwood-forested retreat. Sit at a table by the back windows, and your eyes can feast on airplane-high Bay views while your palate feasts on fine French and Italian Continental cuisine.<br>

						<p><font face="Verdana"><img height="180" width="216" src="../photos/paella.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the South Bay, San Jose&#146;s elegant <b>Orlo&#146;s</b> in the stately Hayes Mansion offers diners a memorable combination of classic, Mediterranean-inspired cuisine presented in the graceful elegance of a magnificently restored 1905 mansion. A beautiful drive along a winding country road through the hills of Almaden Valley takes you to <b>La For&ecirc;t</b>, a restaurant perched on the banks of a quietly meandering creek. Its comfortable setting and outstanding French cuisine (ranked in the Bay Area&#146;s overall top 10 by Zagat) make for an exceptional dining experience.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Head down to Aptos on the southern coast, where family-owned <b>Bittersweet Bistro</b> offers inspired cuisine served in a cozy atmosphere. Chef Thomas Vinolus, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, has developed an American bistro-style cuisine rich with Mediterranean influences. Located on the steep banks of the San Lorenzo River in picturesque Capitola-by-the-Sea, not-to-be-missed <b>Shadowbrook</b> is a spacious, multi-roomed log cabin originally built in the &#145;20s. It is best reached by a tiny cable car that descends through colorful flower gardens and drops you at this unique dining destination noted for its lovely surroundings, fine food, and wines served in an Old World ambiance.<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>WORLD CUISINE<br>
						</b>Silicon Valley&#146;s workplaces are a colorful melting pot of cultures. Not surprisingly, its multi-faceted dining scene reflects this with culinary treasures from around the world. A rich panoply of delicious global cuisines awaits you, from Thai and Persian to Ethiopian and Malaysian. When the urge to try something new and different strikes you, the opportunities are boundless. Hummus, anyone?<br>
						<br>
						Dining at <b>Zeni</b>, a small Ethiopian restaurant in San Jose, is an enjoyably different experience. Zeni herself prepares the flavorful dishes, which are infused with exotic spices ranging from mild to &quot;call the fire department!&quot; Diners at a table or sitting on stools around a messob (a tall, colorful woven basket in which the food is served) all eat with their fingers from the same central plate, an act that signifies the bonds of loyalty and friendship. <b>House of Siam</b>&#146;s two busy San Jose locations are Silicon Valley favorites for their authentic and delicious Thai cuisine. The friendly servers in pretty traditional silks, exotic d&eacute;cor and food perfumed with rare spices, herbs and coconut milk put them high on the list of places to try. Jumping north to the Peninsula, glorious Persian</font><font face="Verdana"> </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">cui</font><font face="Verdana"><img height="211" width="216" src="../photos/Menarafood.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">sine awaits you at <b>Yaas</b></font><font face="Verdana"> in </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">San Mateo. Here, a melange of interesting textures and ingredients blend with flavorful spices to create dishes with such wonderfully exotic names as ash-e reshteh (a plate of lentils, garbanzo beans, noodles, and garlic). Still on the Peninsula, take a virtual trip to Polynesia at <b>Trader Vic&#146;s</b> in Palo Alto, a restaurant long noted for its legendary South Pacific cuisine permeated with French, Creole, Indian and Chinese influences, as well as its exotic drinks. The matching d&eacute;cor features a museum-quality collection of Polynesian art and artifacts. Palo Alto&#146;s <b>Straits Caf&eacute;</b> brings the traditional dishes of Singapore to your table, served in a tr&eacute;s chic environment. Chef/Owner Christopher Yeo has been hailed by Gourmet Magazine for bringing this most seductive cuisine to the Bay Area. Farther south in Sunnyvale, the tantalizing tastes of the Middle East are presented at <b>Dish Dash</b>. This attractive little restaurant serves dishes from Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria, featuring a variety of beef, lamb, and vegetarian selections. Helios, a brand new and bustling brasserie in Cupertino, features a mixture of cuisines that takes you on a tour of the sun-soaked Mediterranean. San Jose&#146;s <b>E &amp; O Trading Company</b> brings the flavors of Malaysia, Bali and Southeast Asia to a historic downtown building decorated to suggest a fancy turn-of-the-century export warehouse. For the spicy flavors of Indian Cuisine, you can take your choice of many fine restaurants. Mountain View&#146;s international &quot;restaurant row&quot; along Castro Street has a distinctly Asian flavor, but a little farther south, elegant Amber India tops the list for its savory Northern Indian cuisine featuring curries as well as tandoori-style items. Farther south, in fact at the southern end of San Jose, <b>Tandoor&#146;s</b> varied menu ranges from tandoori and curry dishes to samosas, with a full bar for wine, beer and mixed drinks. Lunchtime features a popular all-you-can-eat buffet, so come prepared. Bon Voyage!<br>
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sushi has become such a Silicon Valley staple that supermarkets now sell pre-packaged servings, and some high schools even put it on their lunch menus. Cupertino&#146;s upscale <b>Hamasushi</b> includes a variety of authentic Japanese dishes like tempura and teriyaki along with its sushi offerings, with a full selection of Japanese sake and beer along with</font><font face="Verdana"> </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">Califor</font><font face="Verdana"><img height="198" width="202" src="../photos/Sushi.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">nia and European wines.

In addition to sushi, the extensive menu lists a wide variety of Japanese dishes. Santa Clara&#146;s <b>Kob&eacute;</b> treats you to a medley of sushi, sashimi and handrolls along with an assortment of tempura, and teriyaki dishes. A special banquet room includes karaoke, a dance floor and Japanese garden.

Choose from regular table seating, or a place at the three rotating sushi boat bars where you select and serve your own dishes from the flotilla of little wooden boats floating past. While San Jose&#146;s tried and true <b>House of Genji/House of Cathay</b> doesn&#146;t have sushi on the menu, it does offer options of either Japanese or Chinese cuisine in two side-by-side restaurants under the same roof and ownership. In Milpitas, popular Mayflower&#146;s three different locations specialize in serving fine Hong Kong cuisine, including 40 delicious varieties of lunchtime Dim Sum. Dinner items include soups, seafood, poultry, beef, vegetarian and barbecue dishes. For sparkling showmanship and teppan-style dining, <b>Benihana&#146;s</b> two locations in Burlingame and Cupertino are unsurpassed. Choose between delicious portions of beef, chicken, scallops, shrimp and lobster, cooked in razzle-dazzle fashion right at your table, by chefs whose sleight-of-hand wizardry will impress you almost as much as their culinary prowess.<br>

						<b>MEET WHILE YOU EAT<br>
						</b>An area that thrives on its ever-expanding high-tech achievements ought to offer a fair share of tables to break bread over while you&#146;re sealing a deal, and indeed it does. Catering to the white collar executives (a.k.a. the Hawaiian shirt and Birkenstock-clad CEO crowd&#151;after all, we ARE in California), these restaurants know how to mix a martini, sear a thick steak, and keep their VIP diners happy.<br>
						<br>
						In Palo Alto, <b>Ming&#146;s</b> is legendary for its Cantonese, Hunan, Hong Kong-style and Szechwan cuisine, including lunchtime Dim Sum, as well as for its perennially bustling atmosphere. The two busy dining rooms fill to capacity virtually every day with customers ranging from formal Chinese families to more casual groups of engineers and software designers. Whether its lunch or dinnertime, it seems half of Silicon Valley&#146;s workforce has made a beeline to <b>Birk&#146;s</b> in Santa Clara. This traditional city grill&#146;s good food and central location make it an enduring choice for the high-tech crowd. Farther south, the same can be said for San Jose&#146;s <b>840 North First</b>. Its cosmopolitan ambiance, spacious interior and fine contemporary American fare continually rank it high on the list of popular meeting places for the power elite. Pastas and flavorful sauces simmer while meats and vegetables roast over hot coals at all three<b> Il Fornaio</b> restaurants, located in San Jose, Palo Alto and Burlingame.

At the entrance to historic San Jose&#146;s San Pedro Square, <b>Spiedo Ristorante</b> anchors one of downtown&#146;s busiest dining and nightlife scenes. Its renowned rotisserie dishes are served to the accompaniment of jazz by world-class pianist Larry Vuckovich.

Between the restaurant&#146;s sensually colorful atmosphere, tempting five-course dinner, and Una&#146;s graceful performance, you&#146;ll really think you&#146;re in Casablanca.<br>

						<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PERENNIAL FAVORITES<br>
						</b>In the ephemeral world of dining, restaurants too often have relatively short life cycles. However, a select few manage to achieve success and then maintain it for years, or even decades. Dotted throughout Silicon Valley, these exceptional culinary institutions show that inspiration, hard work and dedication to excellence are lasting qualities.<br>

For years, the trio of <b>Hong Kong Flower Lounge</b> restaurants (two in Millbrae, one in Palo Alto) have been ranked among the Bay Area&#146;s premier Chinese restaurants, drawing legions of loyal diners for their authentic Hong Kong-style cuisine. Following its opening in 1952, Saratoga&#146;s <b>Plumed Horse</b> established itself as one of Silicon Valley&#146;s oldest and most revered dining establishments. This long-time destination for gourmets features panoramic views of redwood-forested mountains along with Old World charm and cuisine.<br>
						<br>
						<b>PUB CRAWLING<br>

One is Owner <b>Mike Mashayekh</b>, whose tenacious commitment to perfection has kept his restaurant steadily focused on the pursuit of excellence. The other is Executive Chef <b>Scott Cooper</b>, Mashayaekh&#146;s son-in-law, whose touch and creativity in the kitchen have continually won accolades from patrons and reviewers alike.

Chu moved to San Francisco from Hong Kong in 1963. After an introduction to the restaurant business at Trader Vic&#146;s, he was tutored in cooking by an elderly Chinese chef when his father opened a restaurant in 1965.
