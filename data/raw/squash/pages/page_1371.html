<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+2>HOW DO THE NAVAJO AND HOPI GET THEIR FOOD?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#A8181A" SIZE=+1>Traditionally, how have the Navajos
and Hopis gotten their food? How have they used the land? In &quot;Seasons
of a Navajo&quot; you watched a family move their herd in the summer and
winter months. In &quot;Hopi: Songs of the Fourth World&quot; you watched
the cycle of planting to harvesting corn. What did you learn from these
videos?</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Navajo traditional subsistence economy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Navajo subsistence economy is <A HREF="pastoral.html">pastoral</A>
with limited farming. Livestock, especially sheep, are usually consumed
(Navajos eat all the parts of a sheep, preparing blood sausages from the
intestines, using the lard for frying food, and sleep on sheep skins), though
they do occasionally provide a source of cash, and are sometimes used as
a guarantee of credit at trading posts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Livestock is also used as a vehicle for teaching children
their expected roles in the household, as well as the focus of social solidarity.
Large herds used to be the goal of all Navajo families, the measure of wealth,
and the focus of Navajo life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Pastoral life style provided the Navajo a capacity for
fast population and territorial growth, which they indeed exploited. While
a Southwest Indian farmer must cultivate enough land to feed his/her family,
s/he usually cannot farm more than that. This is because farming depends
on labor-force availability, and on long wet-dry cycles in the Southwest.
One herder, on the other hand, can handle 250 heads (enough to feed a family
of four) with as much ease as s/he can handle 100. This means that the pastoral
Navajos could expand their wealth and subsistence potential without expanding
their population. It also means however, that there is an inherent pressure
to expand the grazing territory.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheep and goats are individually owned, though herded in
a common herd. The head of the household or a residence unit (usually an
older woman) may often be the only person named on a tribal-issued grazing
permit. Still, each member of the family knows exactly which animals are
his or hers. Sheep and goats are grazed daily and corralled at night. Cattle
and horses are also individually owned, usually by men. They are often turned
loose in open range and rounded up for sale and use.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Traditionally, Navajo children were the sheepherders, and
they still are during the summer. At the present, the bulk of the herding
falls upon available men and women, often the elderly. Until not long ago
some Navajo families left one child out of school to do the herding. Nowadays
some Navajos hire poorer Navajos to the herding for them during the winter
months.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Women, men, and youngsters share the work of lambing and
shearing. Butchering is still done mainly by women. Members of a residence
group take turns providing sheep to be butchered, and the meat is shared
by all the residents. Mutton is particularly suitable to Navajo lifestyle.
Until recently, Navajos did not have refrigerators (many still do not) and,
thus, did not have the means to store meat. Meat from a butchered sheep
or goat could be consumed be members or a residential unit in a day or two.
This explains why raising cattle is still not as common among the Navajo,
and why cattle is used mainly for marketing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hopi are commonly classified as dry farmers. The prehistoric
foundation of Hopi agriculture was based mainly on the cultivation of corn,
beans, and squash. From the Spaniards they acquired horses, cattle, burros,
mules, and sheep, as well as peach and apricot trees. Since their initial
1848 contact with the Americans they begun adopting various consumer goods.
They also and begun shifting away from their traditional subsistence economy
in favor of cash economy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Each Hopi village has its own land. The land is divided
into large tracts assigned to the various matrilineal clans of the village.
Each clan has several tracts in various locations, so that if one or two
tracts fail to yield crops (Hopi farming was always contingent on wet and
dry spells), the other may still be productive. Every clan subdivide its
land between the women of the clan, and, in fact, each field is usually
associated with a specific household. The men of each households are responsible
for the actual farming. A man could also establish fields beyond the clan
allotment so long that he, or another man assigned by him, cultivate the
field.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hopi plant up to 24 varieties of corn (Whiting 1939:67-70),
classified by color, mostly blue and white. They also grow 23 varieties
of beans (Whiting 1939:80-83), squash, gourds, melons, pumpkins, and peaches.
They begin planting corn in April and continue through June. Most men assemble
in work parties and plant a host's field in a day. After the planting is
complete, their host and his wife feed all the participants. Other men plant
by themselves. The harvest usually takes place in October. The corn is sorted
by color and stored is a special storage near the household.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was and is no private property in grazing land. Horses,
mules, and burros roam the land unattended. Cattle is commonly guided to
open range with relatively permanent sources of water and pasture. Sheep
(not very common) are herded daily and are corralled at night.</FONT></P>
