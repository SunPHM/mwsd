			classes: Structural, Electronic, and Polymeric, although there is
			significant overlap between the classes.  All of these are represented in

			material, find them in the picture above (inspiration comes from the book

			Structural materials are the things we build with.  They have such historical
			importance that entire ages of mankind have been named after them, i.e., the
			<i>Stone Age</i>, the <i>Bronze Age</i>, and the <i>Iron Age</i>.  Important 
			natural materials have included wood, silk, and rubber. Other important 
			man-made structural materials include: ceramics, such as pottery, bricks, and 
			dental caps; composites, such as concrete; the carbon-fibre materials often seen 
			in sports equipment; and plastics. Plastics have become so important that we now 
			place them in a separate category: polymeric materials.  Tough, biocompatible 
			materials are used to make artificial joints and &quot;smart materials&quot; 
			have been developed that can return to a previously-molded shape when heated.  
			Due to the continued demand for stronger, lighter, and cheaper products, there is 
			no end in sight for research in this class of materials.

			Polymers are long, typically organic, molecules composed of chains of 
			subunits.  Familiar examples are plastics and rubbers, though nature also
			uses polymers: for example, proteins are chains of amino acids.  Most of 
			the applications of polymers have been structural, though they are 
			increasingly being used for protective coatings and lubricants - for
			instance, in teflon-coated frying pans.  Polymers are a subset of a broader 
			class of materials known as &quot;soft materials,&quot; which also includes 
			liquid crystals, colloidal suspensions, and foams, all of which are seeing 
			increased use in modern materials design.
