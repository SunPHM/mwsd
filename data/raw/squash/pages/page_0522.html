<p><font size="4"><b>Squash Hole School, Croghan District 14</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="crohgandist14.jpg" width="890" height="532"></p>

<p><font size="4">District No. 14 was located in the town of Croghan and 
partly in the town of Wilna, with its schoolhouse situated in the town of 
Croghan on the River road leading from Carthage to Naumburg.&nbsp; It was known 
as the &quot;Squash Hole&quot; School because of its proximity to a small creek which 
enters the Black River just north of the schoolhouse.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The River Road crosses this stream on a small bridge now; 
but many years ago, before the road was improved for autos, the spot was a 
dreaded morass to cross with horses, especially during the wet season.&nbsp; A 
short distance south of the Squash Hole school, the old State road joins the 
River Road from the east.&nbsp; The Black River detours away from the River Road 
in a wide arc near the school site, approaching the highway again at the &quot;squash 
hole&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The school building is parallel to the road, with its 
entrance facing north, and a cement sidewalk leading to the door.&nbsp; It is 
situated on a low bluff, overlooking the river, on the west side of the road.&nbsp; 
Originally, District 14 was known as No 16, having been created as such on May 
5, 1848, by order of School Commissioner B. R. Ellis.&nbsp; It became No. 14 on 
October 8, 1864.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">On November 2, 1887, District No.14 acquired its lot of 
one-quarter of an acre for the sum of $1, from David W. Ash and Orpha V., his 
wife.&nbsp; The deed, recording in Book of Deeds, page 88.&nbsp; There is good 
evidence that District 14 was supporting a school many years before its deed was 
drawn.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A clothier and tailor shop proprietor of Carthage, the late 
John W. Clark, often said that he had taught school at the Squash Hole school 
before the Civil War, of which he was a veteran.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">John Farr, Charles M. Holden and Edmond Stubbs were the 
trustees for District 14 when, in 1870, part of the district was siphoned off to 
form a new district, No. 17 whose schoolhouse was on the Wrape Road and was 
known, appropriately , as the Wrape school.&nbsp; No. 17 eventually was taken 
into Wilna District 13, which operated the Castle school at the time of 
centralization.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Little is known about the operation of District 14 school 
until about 1900.&nbsp; An old attendance record report, dated 1914 lists the 
school searing capacity as 21.&nbsp; Drinking water was brought from the 
neighbors' wells.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The last annual meeting at the Squash Hole school was held 
in 1953.&nbsp; Voters attending were plainly not deterred by talk of 
centralization for upkeep of their schoolhouse. District 14 adhered to this 
course for two more years, but its strength was waning, and as the spring of 
1956 blossomed into summer, the last pupils passed out the door, the teacher 
gathered up her things, and the door of the Squash Hole school was locked shut, 
never to&nbsp; open again.&nbsp; At a meeting in 1959, attended by three voters, 
permission was given for the building to be sold at auction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Black River still rolls silently by the Squash Hole 
school; the grass in its yard still greens in the spring and withers in the 
fall.&nbsp; The school sits on the windswept bluff and patiently waits; waits 
for the teacher to arrive and to make things orderly; waits for the pupils to 
come; waits for the learning to continue.</font></p>
