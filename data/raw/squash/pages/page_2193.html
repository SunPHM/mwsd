<P ALIGN="LEFT">Hohokam agriculture was an ingenious interaction between the people and
the desert environment where they lived.  The desert has few water sources.
The Hohokam constructed canals which purged water from perennial rivers.  
These canals were miles in length.  The canal networks required decades of
human labor to build.  The canals brought water to desolate areas far from
the rivers that flowed in the basins.  The water contained sedimentary nutrients
which were deposited in the sandy desert soil.  Short irrigation ditches were 
constructed as offshoots of the main canals.  This system funneled water to
the fields above the normal flood plain of the perennial rivers.  The Hohokam
also used a technique of flooding the fields with water to irrigate crops.</P>
<P>"... the Hohokam probably planted their crops in a series of earth mounds.
Corn, beans, squash, and cotton, could all be planted in the same mound, so
that each plant provided the others with nutrients and weed protection.  Planted
in March after the last winter frost, crops were ready to harvest in July.
Villagers prepared much of their harvest for use during winter and spring."
(P. 2, Hohokam Indians of the Tucson Basin, Gregonis & Reinhard)</P>
<P>The Hohokam raised several types of beans and squash.  They also raised maize
and corn. Corn was the main crop produced.  <IMG SRC="itcorn.gif" ALIGN="center">
The corn was roasted and eaten or
the kernel allowed to dry.  Some of the dried kernel provided seed for the 
following year.  Most of the kernel was groung into flour.  This flour was
used to make breads and placed into other meals.  Cotton was processed by hand
and made into yarn for clothing and blankets.  Surplus crops were used in trade
for items with other communities.</P>
<P>In addition to domestic crops, the Hohokam harvested deaert plants.  The
wild plants were used as another food source.  Plants such as agave, cholla,
prickly pear cacti and seed grass, i.e. bromme.  These plants grew on the edge
of the fields and were cultivated.  These plants withstood the harsh desert 
and drought environments.  Some of the plants were also used as building 
material in houses.</P>
<P>The Hohokam farming tools were made from slate rock, stone and broken
pottery.  Sticks were used to push seeds into the soil.  Stone and pottery
hand hoes were used to cultivate crops.  Stone knives were used to cut and 
scrape pulp from plants like cactus.</P>
<P>The Hohokam hunted small and large game animals.  Birds, reptiles, and rodents
were a large source of meat.  Rabbits were driven into nets and harvested
for the meat.  Larger animals such as deer and elk were hunted using bow and
arrow.  The stone knives were used to cut and chop meat into roast and stew
meat.  This strips of meat were cut and dried for later consumption.  The hides
were tanned and used for clothing, shelter, jewelry, and trade.</P>
<P>Why did the Hohokam disappear from the desert?  There are theories that
suggest selenation of the fields.  There could be other reasons for their
demise such as famine, drought, and war.  A severe drought would cause a 
reduction in food supply and population.  Warfare would further reduce
the population.  Suppose all these things happened for several years at the same
time.  This could have finished the Hohokam.  It is possible that small
groups of Hohokam survived and the decendants are the Hopi, Pima, and Popago
Indians.</P>
