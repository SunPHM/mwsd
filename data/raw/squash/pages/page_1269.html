            <p>Also know as Silk Gourd, Silk Squash or Chinese Okra. This dark green vegetable looks like a long, thin courgette (zucchini) or a very large okra pod, and has angular ridges down its length. A close relative, the smooth loofah is paler in colour, larger and more cylindrical, with a slightly thicker base. Both have a very mild taste, similar to cucumber, which can be used in its place in most cooked dishes.</p>            <p>The gourds are eaten young, while they are still sweet. They become unpleasantly bitter as they mature. Loofah is used in stir-fries and soups, and is often boiled and eaten with Nam Prik, It goes well with foods that will not overwhelm its delicate flavour, such as chicken, fish and shellfish. I is also a popular ingredient in a large number of vegetable dishes. When a loofah is young, all you need to do is wash and slice it. They seldom need peeling, but sometimes the ridges toughen as the vegetables ripen. If this is the case remove the ridges, but leave the skin in between, so that the loofah is striped green and white. If the skin is very tough, it is best to peel it completely. Loofah is always eaten cooked, but be careful not to overcook it.</p></td>

The flesh can be cut into slices or chunks. If the flesh is excessively bitter, layer with salt in a colander and then set aside for 30 minutes.

Each of these will have a pretty, lacy pattern, resulting from channeds in the flesh, and will be sticky with sap. Immediately add them to water that has been acidulated with lemon juice to prevent them from discolouring. For salads and stir-fries, lotus root must first be blanched in boiling water, although it can added directly to soups or stews. As it cooks, it will sweeten the liquid and turn it a pale pink. Thin slices of lotus root can also be deep-fried to make crisps (US chips). Dry the rounds very thoroughly before adding them to the hot oil.</p></td>

Also called giant white radish or winter radish, it is a long white root that resembles a slender, smooth-skinned parsnip in appearance. It can be up to 40cm/16in long, although the Thai variety is often considerably smaller. Large specimens tend to be fibrous and should be avoided. When raw, the flavour of mooli is cool, sharp and peppery, and the texture is crisp. Thais don't often eat it this way, but the grated flesh is sometimes used to tenderize seafood. When the vegetable is cooked, the characteristic texture is retained, but the flavour becomes quite sweet. It resembles turnip, which can be used as a substitute.</p>
          <p>To prepare mooli for soups or stews, peel off the outer layer and slice thinly or cut into thin batons. Alternatively, grate the peeled mooli into a bowl, add a few pinches of salt and toss gently, then leave for 2-3 minutes. Tip into a colander, rinse under cold water and squeeze dry before combining with other ingredients in your chosen recipe.</p></td>

It grows in marshy areas, near rivers and canals, and is ralated to the morning glory that riots over walls and fences in many European gardens. It has slender, hollow green stems and thin ovate green leaves which are pointed at the ends. In some parts of Asia, the stems are pickled, but in Thailand, only the leaves and tender shoots are eaten. The flavour is similar to that of spinach. In Thailand, the tender tips are often eaten raw, on their own or with other raw vegetables, and served with a selection of hot sauces. When cooked, the stem tips stay firm, but the leaves rapidly become limp. Morning glory is highly perishable and must be used promptly.</p></td>

Straw mushrooms are used extensively in soups, salads and curries, and taste particularly good with prawns (shrimp) and crab meat. Canned straw mushrooms are widely available from Asian stores and many supermarkets. They have neither the exquisite flavour nor the texture of the fresh mushrooms, but can be an acceptable substitute.

Both types are available in supermarkets and Asian stores. Dried shiitake mushrooms must be reconstituted in water before being used. The stems are usually discarded and the caps sliced or chopped for adding to soups or stews. The soaking water can be strained and used in s soup or stock as it takes on the flavour of the shiitake.

When soaked, the fungus expands to six or eight times its volume, so be sure to use plenty of water. After soaking leave the mushrooms to cool then pinch off and discard the hard stems. Drain, rinse well, then drain again, discarding any hard roots and bits of grit. The mushrooms can be cooked whole or thinly sliced for soups and stir-fires. They have a crunchy, chewy texture and distinctive woody aroma, but will also readily absort other strong flavours. All these mushrooms are available in Asian supermarkets and some organic stores.</li>
