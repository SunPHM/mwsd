              <p class="normaltext">First and foremost La Manga Club is
                renowned for its sports facilities. It has three international
                <a href="#golf">standard golf courses</a>,

                wall</a>, and a <a href="#bowls">pristine bowling green</a>,
                to name but a few of its many amenities. A <a href="healthandbeauty.html">health
                and beauty centre</a> also recently
                opened at La Manga Club. It also has an excellent <a href="#football">footballing
                centre</a> that frequently hosts top teams from throughout
                Europe.</p>
              <p class="normaltext">In addition to these, there are
                  also water sports available nearby, as well as great
                opportunities for mountain biking,
                  hiking, horse riding and jogging trails. We have split
                  the activities into two sections, those available at
                La Manga Club, and those that can be done in the surrounding
                  area.</p>

              <p class="normaltext">The bowling green is situated
                  at the tennis centre, and woods can be hired. It is one
                  of the few in Spain.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft"><a name="climbing"></a>Climbing</p>
              <p class="normaltext">It comes as something of a
                  surprise to learn that La Manga Club has its own climbing
                  wall at the Tennis Centre, and
                  that regular supervised sessions are held there.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft">Cricket</p>
              <p class="normaltext">Not a sport normally associated
                  with Spain, but La Manga Club has opened up an all weather
                  cricket facility at the
                  football centre, and was used as a venue for a cricket
                  tournament in November, 2003.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft"><a name="football"></a>Football</p>
              <p class="normaltext">La Manga Club is becoming increasingly
                  famous for its football complex which is frequently used
                  as a training
                  facility by some of Europe&#8217;s leading club sides
                  including Chelsea, Tottenham, Grasshoppers Zurich, Real
                  Madrid and
                  Dinamo Kiev in recent years. It has also been home to
                  the England international squad on numerous occasions.</p>
              <p class="normaltext">A footballing academy operates for
                youngsters at certain times of the year with daily training
                sessions from FA qualified coaches. It is highly recommended
                that you pre-book the Football Academy, as it is usually
                very well attended. Advance bookings can be made through
                the Tennis Centre on 0034 968 175000 extn 1666.</p>
              <p class="bodytexttitleleft"><a name="golf"></a>Golf</p>
              <p class="normaltext"><img src="images/golf.jpg" alt="Golf at La Manga Club" width="210" height="154" class="pagetopimage">La Manga Club&#8217;s golfing facilities
                  encompass so many amenities, it is difficult to know
                where to start.
                  The three courses, North (par 71) South (par 72) and
                West (par 73) offer different challenges for golfers of
                all
                  abilities. Golf can be booked via Golf Administration
                (0034 968 17500 ext 8081) and it is always advisable to
                pre-book
                  tee times, as the courses are very busy at certain times
                  of the years.</p>
              <p class="normaltext">All three courses have been designed
                to offer different challenges, and are likely to test the
                  talents of even
                  the most gifted golfers. The best way to experience the
                  different challenges the courses offer is to play each
                  one, but if you are limited in the amount of time you
                have
                  available, then our handy guide below may help you choose
                  which course you play.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft"><a name="northcourse"></a>North Course</p>
              <p class="normaltext">The Par 71 North Course
                  was completely remodelled in 2000-2001, and is more a
                test of accuracy than power. The course is
                  quite hilly, and is noted for its tight fairways and
                large greens. It is dotted with water hazards and ravines
                and
                  presents a real challenge to even the best golfers.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft"><a name="southcourse"></a>South
                  Course</p>
              <p class="normaltext">An interesting Par 72 course with a
                number of challenging holes. It is undergoing some remodelling,
                but is considered
                  to be the most suitable course for golfers of all standards.
                  Lakes, bunkers and gullies are located throughout the
                course, and help provide a stiff challenge for golfers
                of all abilities.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft"><a name="westcourse"></a>West Course</p>
              <p class="normaltext">Although shorter than the
                  South Course, the fact that it is a par 73 indicates
                the level of difficulty the course
                  presents. It is almost a course of two halves, with the
                  front nine littered with &#8220;barrancas&#8221; (storm
                  ravines). The front nine are very tight, demanding precision
                  play rather than power, whilst the back nine is more
                  open, but its hilly terrain adds to the level of difficulty.
                  The course, which is located amidst beautiful scenery
                  is
                  considered the most challenging of the three located
                  at La Manga Club and is sure to provide a test of all
                  facets
                  of your game.</p>
              <p class="normaltext">Please note, there is a dress code
                for all courses, and soft spikes must be worn.</p>
              <p class="subtitletextleft">Golf Academy</p>
              <p class="normaltext">If you are frustrated
                  by your golfing skills (or lack of them) then the Academy
                  of Golf located on the North
                  Course may be the place to help you improve. Its facilities
