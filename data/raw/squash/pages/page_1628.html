</font></B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Presentation College there is no official badminton club but there certainly is a badminton 'spirit' which shows itself in the eagerness and enthusiasm with which our players approach the game. Our players use the court at every possible opportunity, to do drills, to practice for tournaments, or for the mere pleasure of playing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The college team has established itself as one of the best in Trinidad and Tobago. This is clearly indicated by our tournament performances. In a round robin team tournament held in October of 1986, Presentation College teamed up with Naparima Girls High School and together captured the 1st and 2nd place in the 16-19 and 3rd in the under 14 age groups. In the Secondary Schools Badminton Association open tournament held in March of 1987, Pres again captured the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places in senior<B> </B>singles and doubles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special thanks is owed to Mrs. Henry of Naparima Girls High School for her generosity, patience and hard work in the organisation of our team. We also wish to thank Mr. Karl Khan for the time spent coaching our team and for his constant support at all tournaments in which we have participated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present players would like to see a continuation<B> </B>of this spirit, which, together with hard work, will ensure continuing success for our future teams.</P>
