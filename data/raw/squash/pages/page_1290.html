What is an Insect Pest?</H3>
For purposes of this fact sheet, we classify insects and mites as pests
based on their ability to damage vegetable plants and reduce your harvest
from the home garden. Many insects, and all spiders, found in home vegetable
gardens are beneficial and control of these insects is not recommended.
<H3>
Monitoring Pest Insects in the Home Garden</H3>
Insects and mites can move into your garden and then rapidly increase in
numbers. You should examine plants in and around the garden throughout
the season at least twice weekly. Use magnification to aid in identifying
insects and mites. Examine a few plants of each cultivar thoroughly, searching
under leaves, inside developing fruit, along stems and at the plant crown.
Note feeding damage signs such as insect excrement, holes in leaves or
fruit and/or twisted or deformed leaves. Make notes indicating the number
or extent of damage from week to week to aid in determining whether insects
and/or damage is increasing.
<H3>
Identify the Insect</H3>
Color photos of the most common insect pests and descriptions of others
are included in this fact sheet. You should be able to develop a general
classification of the pest based on this information. Once you have identified
the pest, you should classify the type and amount of damage it is causing.
<H3>
Identify the Damage</H3>
Damage is classified by how the pests feed.

<P><B>Chewing damage</B> - Insects with ‘cutting’ mouthparts tear off plant
tissue and chew it. Examples include beetles, caterpillars and grasshoppers
that feed on fruit or leaves and often leave holes in the plant tissue
or foliage. These insects defecate on plants and soil leaving, excrement
that may be brown, black or green in color and resemble small flecks or
balls.

<P><B>Piercing, sucking damage</B> - Insects and mites with piercing mouthparts
insert their mouthparts into the plant tissue and ‘suck’ liquids’ from
the plants. Examples include squash bugs, aphids, stink bugs, thrips and
mites. Many of the insects that feed in this manner defecate a sticky liquid
(honeydew) that often builds up on leaves or fruit, leaving a shiny residue
that may support the growth of a black or gray sooty mold. Damaged foliage
often will turn yellow and eventually brown in color or become malformed
in shape.
<H3>
Key Pests</H3>
Those pests that feed directly on the harvested portion of the plant are
the most destructive, since they compete directly with you for the food
you are trying to grow. You will have little tolerance for the key pests.
We recommend controlling key pests when found in the garden. Examples include
the corn earworm and the tomato fruitworm.

<P>Many insects and mites feed on leaves or on parts of the plants that
will NOT be harvested. Most gardeners can tolerate low numbers of these
in the garden. They often serve a useful purpose because they attract and
help maintain populations of predatory or parasitic insects or mites that
also feed on and control the KEY PESTS. You must decide how many of these
pests you are willing to tolerate, keeping in mind that large numbers can
cause leaf curl and other damage and reduce the vigor of your garden plants.
Examples include aphids and spidermites.
<H3>
Controlling Pests</H3>
The best control is prevention. Pest problems can often be prevented by
developing and maintaining a healthy crop through soil fertility, proper
irrigation, choosing crops suited to the climate and soil, and by removing
small infestations before they become a problem. Once you have identified
a pest problem based on the type and amount of damage and made a decision
to control the pest, you should consider the following. There are numerous
methods of controlling pests; the most effective control often is achieved
by combining control techniques.

<P>(For more information refer to the following fact sheets: F-6007, <I>Improving
Garden Soils</I>; F-6032,<I> Vegetable Varieties for Oklahoma</I> and F-7652,
<I>Non-chemical Methods for Managing Diseases in the Home Landscape and
Garden</I>).
<H3>
Cultural Control</H3>
Vigorous, rapidly growing plants often ‘outgrow’ pest damage. You should
plant recommended cultivars, maintain fertile soil with proper pH and moisture
providing your garden a means to outgrow pest damage.

<P><B>Sanitation</B> - dispose of infested plant and trash materials that
harbor pests and cultivate the soil to expose and destroy pests in the
soil.

<P><B>Weed control</B> - keep the garden border areas mowed and trimmed
and cultivate the garden to control unwanted plants (weeds) that serve
as hosts to insects that can move over to your vegetable plants.

<P><B>Time your plantings</B> - many insect pests, including the corn earworm
and squash bug, are less numerous early in the season and an early planting
of vegetables will often ‘escape’ with little to no damage.

<P><B>Traps </B>are devices that collect or cause insects to congregate,
such as flat boards on top of the soil in the garden. Check the traps frequently
and collect and destroy the insect pests in the traps.

<P><B>Barriers </B>serve to exclude pests from the crop and include the
use of paper collars around the stem collar of young transplants that prevents
cutworms from attacking and destroying plants. Other barriers include row
covers made of transparent or translucent covers of woven plastic that
allow light to enter, but block insects. Typically, these row covers are
supported above the plants with hoop frames although light weight woven
covers can rest on the canopy.

<P><B>Mechanical removal</B> by hand picking or washing with a directed
stream of water is effective for large insects or eggs and for small, soft-bodied
insects or mites.
<H3>
Biological Control</H3>
Many insects and other arthropods feed on and destroy insects that are
pests in gardens. Examples include the lady beetle and spiders that feed
on insect eggs, larvae, aphids and mites. These <B>BENEFICIAL</B> arthropods
are best used by preserving or augmenting their numbers. You can maintain
a diverse and healthy garden by NOT spraying the garden unnecessarily with
insecticides and by maintaining a diverse planting that provides alternate
sources of prey, nectar and pollen. Beneficial insects can be purchased
from suppliers and released in mass numbers but this practice has not proven
reliable with the exception of release and management in greenhouses. (Refer
to F-7307, <I>Beneficial Insects</I>). Many insects are attacked by pathogens
that cause diseases that kill the insect pests. Most disease outbreaks
occur during periods of wet and humid weather.&nbsp; Toxicity of Pesticides
Used to Control Common Home Vegetable Garden Pests. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency and the state of Oklahoma are charged with regulation
of the registration of pesticides. A common terminology is used among regulatory
agencies to describe comparative toxicity of the pesticides. Following
is a listing of and description of some of the more commonly available
insecticides for home garden use. Insecticides labeled as "General Use"
can be sold to the public for general unrestricted use. "Restricted Use"
pesticides are sold only to and used only by certified applicators. Categories
and Danger Rankings Used in Describing Insecticides. Highly Toxic Class
I DANGER (ex. endosulfan, nicotine sulfate) Moderately Toxic Class II WARNING
(ex. dimethoate) Slightly Toxic Class III CAUTION (ex. malathion)
<H3>
Pesticides</H3>
Pesticides are materials that are applied directly to pests or in their
environment that will kill the pests. Insecticides are specifically designed
to kill insects and many other arthropods. Insecticides sold commercially
must be registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
state of Oklahoma’s Department of Agriculture. The label attached to the
container with the insecticide provides specific information on proper
use of, safety precautions and disposal of the insecticide. Relative toxicity
of various insecticides and recommendations for use are listed in Tables
1 and 3. <B>ALWAYS USE PESTICIDES ACCORDING TO LABEL INSTRUCTIONS</B> (refer
to F-7450, <I>Safe Use of Pesticides in the Home and Garden</I>).

<P><B>Organic Pesticides</B>
<BR>Organic gardeners consider insecticides extracted from plants or derived
from a ‘naturally’ occurring source as suitable for ‘Organic’ production
techniques. Examples of botanical insecticides include Neem oil and pyrethrum.
Materials derived from other acceptable sources include ‘soaps,’ vegetable
and mineral oils, and sulfur dusts. Most of these materials have been evaluated
in university trials and have been shown to have short residual activity
and are at best, moderately effective in killing insect pests. Most are
detrimental to beneficial insects and with exceptions have low toxicity
to humans and pets.

<P><B>Synthetic Pesticides</B>
<BR>In contrast to most ‘Organic’ pesticides, these materials have been
synthesized from raw products using industrial technology. All currently
labeled and registered pesticides have been determined to be safe based
on current regulations from the United States Environmental Protection
Agency and the state of Oklahoma when used as specified by the label. Examples
of synthetic insecticides labeled for General Use Purposes include, malathion,
carbaryl, chlorpyriphos and diazinon. These materials were evaluated in
university trials and were shown to be moderately effective in killing
insect pests. Most are detrimental to beneficial insects and may have low
to moderate toxicity to humans and pets.
<H3>
Application of Pesticides</H3>
Whether applying synthetic or organic pesticides, the user is responsible
for reading the label and making applications in a proper manner including
the crop on which sprayed, the interval of time needed prior to harvest
after application and proper protection of other people, pets and beneficial
organisms including bees, predators, birds, and fish. Both synthetic and
organic pesticides can be toxic and/or irritating; therefore, you should
wear unlined neoprene gloves and keep materials, dust or mist out of contact
with your eyes, mouth or bare skin. Always wash thoroughly after applying
pesticides.

<P>Most pesticides approved for use around the home (General Use Purposes)
are moderately effective in killing pest insects. To achieve the best control
with these materials, it is important for you to direct the spray to the
plant surface where the pest is living or feeding. Also, since many pests
will continue to hatch from eggs or migrate into the garden, it may be
necessary to monitor pest infestations two to three days after the first
application and to repeat applications following label directions.&nbsp;

Common Pests of Gardens and Their Management</H3>
<B>Aphids.</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="f7313fa.jpg" >
<BR>Aphids are small insects, ranging in color from yellow to green to
red, which may or may not have wings. Look for these insects on the undersides
of the leaves. Aphids feed by inserting needlelike mouthparts in leaves,
stems, and fruit to remove plant nutrients. When numerous, aphids generally
cause damage; however, they can transmit viruses to your crops even when
present in low numbers. Aphids may be controlled by natural factors including
rain, wind, parasites (tiny wasps) and predators (lady beetles). Aphids
occur on almost all garden crops and are of special concern on tomatoes,
peppers, potatoes, squash, melons and cucumbers. They may transmit virus
diseases among crops and can be very damaging.<p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="f7313f1.jpg" ></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Aphids (note cornicles or 'tail pipes').</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B><I>Recommended Control:</I></B> To prevent virus transmission, place
row covers over new plantings and maintain until first flowers are present
or use an aluminum mulch. To control large populations on leaves, spray
with malathion, dimethoate, endosulfan, diazinon, chlorpyriphos or neem,
making certain to obtain good spray cover under leaves. ORGANIC methods
of control include the use of row covers, aluminum mulch, beneficial insects,
applications of neem, insecticidal soap or pyrethrum. A fungus based insecticide
is available under the Trade name Mycotrol, which is effective when sprayed
directly on the aphids under humid conditions. Sprays must be directed
at the feeding sites on the undersurface of leaves. You also can thoroughly
wash the plants with a directed stream of water early in the morning to
allow the leaves to dry before evening.<p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="f7313f2.jpg" ></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Aphids (come occasionally have wings).</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B>Bugs.</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="f7313fb.jpg" >
<BR>Bugs include stink bugs, leaffooted bugs, and squash bugs that have
piercing mouthparts used to ‘suck’ nutrients from plant leaves, stems,
and fruit. They often are KEY PESTS that feed on tomatoes, beans, and squash
causing discolored spotting, pimples or desiccation. The adults are excellent
fliers and can move long distances into and among gardens. There are few
natural controls limiting their numbers and damaging populations must be
treated with insecticides.<p>

spraying with neem or pyrethrum. Nymphs can be killed with insecticidal
soap. Spray applications must be directed towards the feeding sites under
the leaves and under the plant canopy. The SQUASH BUG is a perennial pest,
primarily of squash and pumpkin, which should be controlled by initiating
insecticide applications or hand picking when adults or egg masses are
first noted on plants.<p>

<BR>Leafhoppers are closely related to bugs and feed in the same manner.
They are generally much smaller and brighter in color. They can become
very numerous and are very active. The immature stage nymphs actively run
when disturbed and the adults actively ‘hop’ or fly when disturbed.<p>

<BR>Caterpillars and Cutworms are wormlike larval stages of insects that
will mature into moths or butterflies. They emerge from small eggs laid
on plant tissue and can grow to be several inches in length. Caterpillars
have chewing mouthparts and feed on leaves, stems, and fruit. Most caterpillars
are found feeding on leaves or fruit and are often noted when you observe
their excrement on leaves or soil beneath the feeding caterpillar.<p>

var <I>kurstoki</I> or <I>aizawai</I> (e.g., Dipel, Javelin, Xentari).
SWEET CORN - the corn earworm is a perennial pest and may best be controlled
by directly applying a spray mixture of pyrethrum with an emulsifiable
oil in water to the corn silk at 2 day intervals beginning with silk emergence.

<P><B>Grasshoppers.</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="f7313ff.jpg" >
<BR>Grasshoppers are fairly large green or brown insects that can jump
or fly, are extremely active, and difficult to catch in the act of damaging
your garden plants. If you notice them in and around the garden and see
ragged feeding holes on the edges of leaves, you can be certain they are
causing the damage. They are difficult to control because they can migrate
into the garden from areas outside the garden.

<P><B><I>Recommended Control:</I></B> Row covers will protect young plants.
Maintain well trimmed borders around the garden to act as a ‘barrier’ and
to prevent their migration into the garden. Several synthetic insecticides
(carbaryl, endosulfan, diazinon) effectively kill grasshoppers in the garden;
however, grasshoppers have a tendency to continuously migrate into gardens
and thus repeated applications are often necessary. ORGANIC control may
best be achieved using repeated applications of neem or pyrethrum. Insecticide
applications, whether synthetic or organic, are most effective when targeted
against the small immature nymphs. Larger and adult grasshoppers are more
difficult to kill.

<P><B>Thrips.</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="f7313fg.jpg" >
<BR>Thrips are very small insects that rasp, tear, and remove nutrients
from leaves causing a silver streaking of the leaf tissue and leaf curling.
They often are very abundant early in the season and the damage may be
very notable on cotyledons and first true leaves. Generally, plants outgrow
the damage and control often is not necessary.

<P><B><I>Recommended Control: </I></B>When extremely abundant, or if they
are damaging fruit or edible leaves, control may be warranted. Applications
of dimethoate or endosulfan are most effective in reducing numbers, but
must be repeated because eggs are laid in the plant tissue and are not
affected by pesticides. ORGANIC control may be achieved by repeated, direct
applications of neem or pyrethrum.&nbsp;

<P><B>Soil Insects.&nbsp;</B>
<BR><IMG SRC="f7313fh.jpg" >
<BR>Soil Insects (wireworms, grubs, cutworms) live in the soil. Those that
are pests, feed on roots or other portions of the plant in contact with
the soil, including fruit. Healthy, vigorously growing plants can outgrow
the damage from a limited number of root feeding insects; however, large
numbers can limit your harvest or kill your plants.<p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="f7313f10.jpg" ></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=-1>Grub.</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P><B><I>Recommended Control:</I></B> There are few effective methods of
killing soil insects once they are damaging the plants, therefore prevention
is the best policy. Prevent problems by planting into well cultivated soil
that has not been in sod for the previous year. Several granular insecticides
(e.g., diazinon, chlorpyriphos) are available and application prior to
planting will effectively control pest insects.

<BR>Spider Mites are not insects but are closely related arthropods. Look
for mites on the underside of leaves. They cause a general yellowing and
stippling of the leaf tissue. Webbing similar to spider webs will be present
around colonies on leaves, stems and fruit. Large populations can kill
leaves and reduce yield.<p>

<P><B><I>Recommended Control:</I></B> Dicofol is the most effective miticide
but is labeled for use only on specific crops and label instructions must
be followed. Dimethoate, endosulfan, malathion and diazinon are moderately
effective in killing mites, but applications must be directed to the lower
surfaces of leaves and repeated applications are necessary. ORGANIC methods
of control include applications of neem and insecticidal soap at repeated
short intervals.&nbsp;

Toxicity of Pesticides Used to Control Common Home Vegetable Garden Pests.</H3>
The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Oklahoma
are charged with regulation of the registration of pesticides. A common
terminology is used among regulatory agencies to describe comparative toxicity
of the pesticides. Following is a list of and description of some of the
more commonly available insecticides for home garden use. Insecticides
labeled as "General Use" can be sold to the public for general unrestricted
use. "Restricted Use" pesticides are sold only to and used only by certified
applicators.&nbsp;

<P><B>Categories and Danger Rankings Used in Describing Insecticides.</B>&nbsp;
<BR>Highly Toxic- Class I- DANGER (ex. endosulfan, nicotine sulfate)&nbsp;
<BR>Moderately Toxic- Class II- WARNING (ex. dimethoate)&nbsp;
<BR>Slightly Toxic- Class III- CAUTION (ex. malathion)&nbsp;
