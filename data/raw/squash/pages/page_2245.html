<p>The pumpkin, squash, and potato patch out behind the greenhouse. The Lumina 
pumpkins are anywhere from golf ball to soccer ball size at the moment.</p>

<p>Squash, beans, peas, tomatos, herbs, eggplant, cucumbers, melons, and who

<p>A few grapes are still coming along, though at the moment they are hard as 
little rocks.</p>

<p>The greenhouse is still full of stuff: swisschard, cabbage, okra, parsley, 
broccoli, carrots, kale, dill, squash, sage, mint, and a lemon tree.</p>

<p>The sweet potatoes are doing well aboveground. Who knows what they're up to 
underground?</p>

<p>There are lots of green tomatoes. Here's some of the many Italian Gold plum

<p>Baby corn on its way up. Note cat for scale.</p>

<h3>August 4, 2001</h3>

<p>Some of the eggplant plants are flowering, so we might get a crop out of them 
this year. I'm amazed, because when I transplanted them out I was sure they were 
all just going to die (as did the peppers that I transplanted at the same time).</p>

<h3>August 15, 2001</h3>

<p>Looks like we'll have corn this year. The Serendipity corn has both tassles 
and silk; the Country Gentleman corn has tassles but no silk yet. My mouth is 
watering already.</p>

<p>I harvested the first of the plum tomatoes today. At least, I think they were 
plum tomatoes -- the tomatoes have grown into such a thicket that I can't tell 
which branch belongs to which plant, or find the plant labels that would tell me 
for sure.</p>
<h3>August 16, 2001</h3>
<p>I harvested a big bucket full of elephant garlic today. The only hard part 
about this was separating the garlic from the six-foot tall weeds. Ah well, less 
of the garden got overgrown this year than last year. With luck next year I'll 
do an even better job of keeping it under control. As long as each year is an 
improvement on the one before, I'm content.</p>

<h3>August 19, 2001</h3>

<p>Harvested the first baby eggplant today. Because we bought Territorial's 
seedling variety pack, it's hard to be sure precisely what variety it is, but I 
think
<a href="http://www.territorial-seed.com/testcat/vegetables/eggplant/EG325.html">
Dusky</a>.</p>

<p>I also harvested the
<a href="http://www.territorial-seed.com/testcat/vegetables/garlic/XG205.html">
Bavarian Purple</a> garlic. It does live up to its billing of being hot -- I ate 
part of a clove raw and it had quite a bite to it. A full clove gave a very nice 
flavor to a plate of scrambled eggs.</p>

<h3>August 23, 2001</h3>

<p>A couple of the avocado pits that I put in a bucket of dirt in the greenhouse 
several months ago are finally sprouting.</p>

<h3>August 26, 2001</h3>

<p>Ripping out played-out snow pea vines, I discovered that some of the peas are 
sprouting right now. Seems like a silly time of year for them to be doing this.</p>

<p>Still harvesting like mad. Yesterday: five pints of wax beans, about a quart 
of cherry and plum tomatoes, one big onion, a handful of basil.</p>
