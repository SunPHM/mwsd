<TD>Squashes, pumpkins and gourds are mostly annual, warm season species in
the genus Cucurbita. They are closely related to cucumber, muskmelon and
watermelon. All have an optimum growing temperature between 18 and 24 C.
There are four major species in the <I>Cucurbita</I> genus: <I>pepo, mixta,
moschata</I>, and <I>maxima</I>, and one minor species, <I>ficifolia</I>,
which is a perennial plant that grows in the Andes. The terms pumpkin and
squash have no precise botanical meaning and may refer to any of the above
New World species. Squashes are also called vine crops because, originally,
the cultivars in this family all grew on vines. While most of these crops
still grow on vines, some of the newest cultivars have a bush growth habit,
making them easier to grow in smaller spaces. Botanically, the fruit of
these plants is called a pepo; a pepo has the ovary wall fused with the
receptacle to form a rind. If the fruits are harvested in an immature stage,
they're called summer squash; if harvested at maturity it's a winter squash
or pumpkin. To enter your prize pumpkin in the official World Pumpkin Confederation
Annual Weigh-Off, it must be cream-yellow to orange; if it is green to gray
or mottled in color it must be entered as a squash!</TD></TR>

<TD>Cucurbitaceae includes hundreds of species of vines with climbing tendrils
and some of the most unusual fruits in the world. The fruits come in an
astonishing assortment of shapes and sizes, from tiny, marble-sized pumpkins
of the Caribbean islands to giant gourds more than seven feet long. All
of the New World species, except ficifolia, are annuals. The plants are
monoecious, with separate female and male flowers on the same plant. Usually
the first four or five flowers produced are male, then the next eight or
so are female, followed by a few more male flowers. Male flowers have 3-5
erect stamens bunched within the corolla of 5 fused petals. Female flowers
have 3 spreading stigma lobes and an immature fruit (ovary) below the perianth.
The spiny, sticky pollen requires insects for pollination.</TD>

<TD>Gourds have been used throughout history to make music, in percussion instruments
like rattles, maracas, drums, horns, marimbas; and in some stringed instruments
that resemble the lyre. Gourds have also been used as pipes, masks, canteens,
water jugs, dippers, birdhouses, and sponges. Many have been decorated with
intricate designs. So important were gourds to Haitian people in the early
1800s that gourds were made the national currency. To this day, the standard
coin of Haiti is called a &quot;gourde&quot;. Archeological evidence from
the seeds, rinds, and peduncles (stalks) of gourds show that Native Americans
were cultivating cucurbits at least 8,000 years ago. Aztec, Inca, and Maya
Indians, in South and Central America, along with many North American tribes,
were dependent upon a combination of corn, beans, and squash for the bulk
of their nutrition. According to the authority on gourds, Thomas W. Whitaker,
early people in the New World first domesticated native squashes and pumpkins
for their tasty seeds rather than the fruit flesh. They can be eaten raw
in salads, or fried, boiled, steamed, pickled, candied, dried, baked, or
made into pies and bread.</TD></TR>

<TD>Archeologists Bruce Smith and Wesley Cowan claim that a variety of <I>C.
pepo</I> native to the Ozark region of Arkansas and Missouri may be the
ancestor of today's many varieties of summer squash and related gourds.
Their research indicates that is was cultivated in the Ozarks more than
3,000 years ago. For decades this remarkable gourd was thought to be a garden
escape by botanists, and it hadn't been recognized as the possible ancestor
of summer squashes. According to another squash expert, S.D. Coe, <I>C.
pepo</I> may have been domesticated twice in North America, a long-day variety
in the eastern United States, and a short-day variety in Mexico. Squash
domestication in the New World probably followed two major independent lineages
of cultivars. <I>Cucurbita pepo ssp. 'pepo</I>,' which comprises pumpkins,
marrows, and Mexican landraces, apparently had its origins in Mexico. Subspecies
<I>ovifera</I>, which includes scallop and crookneck squashes and most ornamental
gourds, appears to be native to the Eastern United States. Another fascinating
piece of evidence for a New World origin of squashes and pumpkins is their
natural pollinators. According to Coe, the original distribution of these
gourds in the wild coincides with the range of various bees in the genus
<I>Peponapsis</I>, whose sole source of nectar and pollen are the squashes.
The largest present-day concentration of <I>Peponapsis</I> species is Mexico
and Central America, with another indigenous population in South America.
Today, in many areas of North America, including your vegetable garden,
the introduced European honey bee (<I>Apis mellifera</I>) has taken over
this vital pollination role.</TD>
