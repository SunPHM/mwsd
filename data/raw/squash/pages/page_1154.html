income comes from agriculture that produces products for exporting to different 

countries.  My country has twenty two departments with different climates that help to 

produce their agricultural products.  Products that have given major benefit are, coffee, 

cotton, sugar wheat, chewing gum, rubber, fruits and vegetables. Also, My country has a 

specific area in cattle.  The departments are doing their exporting and importing by boat 

and also by air.</P>

<P>	However, I put emphasis on the production of vegetables because I have many 

years experience in this area.  The vegetables have excellent production and major 

potential for demand.  For example, peas, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, potatoes,

onions, zucchini squash beans, carrots, and cabbages. <img src="images/agprod2.jpg" alt="Photo of vegetable crops" align=left width="371" height="253"> In my photo you can see caulifower and broccoli.   When I started to work in the 

productive coordination, I did this in regions with major potential, such as, Sacatepequez,

Chimaltenango, Solola and Quetzaltenango (Altiplano Occident).  In Solola and 

Quetzaltenango, I worked in internal and external exporting.  I had responsibility for 

the coordination of those departments at the institution with the name Fund Especial Of

Assistance Technical (FEAT/CARE) of Guatemala. Before that, I established agricultural

projects to develop productivity, such as, conservation of forest, soil and irrigation. I 

made fifteen farmer groups of twenty each, and I coordinated these groups with leaders.  </P>

<P>The association had approximately three hundred fifty (350) farmers, and they and


I worked together soliciting credit for the Project ALA/88-22, company of Europe.  We 

established the production according to the resources of the environment at the areas 

selected.  This production was coordinated in an autocratic form, such as, in market 

(price), quality, quantity seeding and harvesting crops.  In the planning, I accomplished 

all the tasks from the buying of seeds, planting, supplying technology, supervision of 

products, to when the crops are transported and the profits distributed.  I gave advice to 

all the farmers’ groups about growing the vegetables.</P>

	<P>The seeding of area management was about 24,710 acres or 10,000 Ha. divided 

into seven products.  These products always were classified at the storing center before 

being exported..  This project of production was for three years, from 1993-1995.  Now, 

the farmers have been working on production because they were benefited as owners of 

the market.  The FEAT project worked with the farmers’ communities for five years to 

develop technology. These farmers today produce vegetables of the first quality, and they 

are known as the best producers of vegetables at the Altiplano Occident area.  They gave 

thanks for the benefits accomplished in their communities, and they celebrated at a 

special party to end the project.  In addition, the vegetables exported were in demand in 

Europe, Canada, the United States and Central America.</P>

	<P>In conclusion, as I worked with the farmers for three years, I know the needed 

economics in the area of agricultural technology.  Thanks for the help of the international 

institution, I brought my knowledge of agriculture.  Also, I give special thanks to God for 

all this success, and I want to find some markets in America (the United States) to sell 

vegetables that are produced in Guatemala.
