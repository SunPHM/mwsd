<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFDF00">The Navajo word describing this type of
necklace means &quot;bead that spreads out.&quot; Although these necklaces
appear to have a design that resembles a squash blossom, it is very possible the
Navajo copied the design from the pomegranate blossom motif originally worn as
silver trouser ornaments by the Spanish and, later, by the Mexicans.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFDF00">Usually, a squash blossom necklace will
have at the lower center a curved, open pendant, called a naja (meaning
&quot;crescent&quot;). This motif was borrowed from the Spanish horse headstall
or bridle which was adopted from the Moors. It is referred to as the Moorish
crescent moon motif. The Moors probably got the design from the Middle East,
possibly Mongolia. It was a form used in many early civilizations. The earliest
known are solid gold crescent shapes found in stone age graves in Ireland.
Whatever the origins of this design, the Navajo had the great ability to combine
it with other elements into a beautiful piece of jewelry.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFDF00">Some squash blossom necklaces are made
entirely of silver. Others are a combination of silver and turquoise. Until
about 1880 silver necklaces made by the Navajo consisted of plain beads hung
with a pendant in naja form. Beads on early necklaces like this one have the
largest beads placed on the middle of the strand. Like the pendant, graduation
of the beads serves to define the center, both visually and by the weight of the
larger, heavier beads. Each bead is made from two pieces of silver. Each half is
domed by hammering the piece of silver in a wooden mold with a smooth round
punch. Holes are punched in the center of each. The halves are soldered
together. The bead is then buffed and polished; then the beads are strung. (The
idea for hollow silver beads may have come from two button halves soldered
together. The idea of buttons would have come from Spanish clothing decoration.)
A simple strand of beads, graduated or not, suggests a rhythmic progression.
Navajo song has been described as making creative use of repetition by
introducing subtle patterns of alternation and progression. The evolved formal
arrangement of necklace beads suggests a similar interest in repetition with
variation. Similar rhythmic structures exist in music. The same interest in
order, stability, and harmony found in this squash blossom necklace can also be
found in Navajo music.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFDF00">Silversmiths began to make what are commonly termed
squash blossom beads and to intersperse them after every third or fourth plain
bead. The squash blossom (or pomegranate shaped blossom) would have been made
separately in three parts: first, the round form, then the petals and then the
small shank with a hole punched in it for stringing. These would all be soldered
together. Because they were mounted by means of a shank rather than strung
directly on the necklace cord, both the bead and the blossom extended beyond the
body of the necklace, setting up a more complex visual rhythm.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFDF00"><b>Stevie's Squash Blossom: </b>I have not yet been able to determine where or when
Stevie acquired his squash blossom necklace, but he wore it on stage a number of
times during 1983-1987, including at the El Mocambo in Toronto, captured in the
live video released by Sony Music. I have been told by a local jeweler that the stones are
low grade turquoise. The naja
has stamped on the back what appears to be &quot;HVM Mexico .925.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFDF00">Where is it now? </font></b><font color="#FFDF00">He gave
it to a good friend in Austin who preserved it all these years (thank you
Patty). She graciously allowed me to acquire it from her in March 2002. It is NOT for sale. It will be displayed on
the fan club tours and at other appropriate events.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFDF00"><b>Where can I get a similar one?</b> There are
numerous places to buy squash blossoms on the internet or at stores in the
Southwest. The styles are as numerous as the artists who make them, and prices
run anywhere from $200 to $1000.</font></p>
