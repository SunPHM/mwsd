				<font color="#228b22">USING THE PRE-SIDEDRESS NITRATE TEST FOR PUMPKINS</font></CENTER></H3>
		<P>The pre-sidedress soil nitrate test (PSNT) has been used to
improve nitrogen (N) management in field corn and sweet corn.
The test involves collecting a soil sample from the surface foot
of soil when corn plants are 6 to 12 inches tall. If the soil
nitrate-N concentration is greater than about 25 ppm, no fertilizer
N needs to be topdressed. If the concentration is less than 25
ppm, topdressed fertilizer is needed. Use of the PSNT to estimate
N needs for field and sweet corn usually results in a large reduction
in the amount of N fertilizer applied to these crops.</P>

<P>The reduction in N fertilizer rates from use of the PSNT usually
is the result of elimination of extra N fertilizer that growers
often apply to corn. This extra N fertilizer is called &#147;insurance
N&#148; by many growers because the extra N insures that the crop
will not be deficient in N, especially towards the end of the
growing season. Growers can apply &#147;insurance N&#148; to corn
without the fear of yield reductions from excess N fertilization
because excess N does not reduce the yield of corn. Unfortunately,
&#147;insurance N&#148; guarantees a reduction in profit because
most corn fields in most years are substantially overfertilized
when growers apply &#147;insurance N&#148;. The PSNT reduces the
amount of &#147;insurance N&#148; needed by providing previously
unavailable information about the N status of the soil immediately
before the time of topdressing.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../styles/pkin.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="125" 
ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="pmpkn">Application
of &#147;insurance N&#148; to annual vegetable crops, such as
pumpkins and tomatoes, is not advisable because the yields of
these crops often are reduced from excess N fertilization. Excess
N fertilization of pumpkins and tomatoes often results in a C-shaped
response to fertilization, or a response where the yield increases
with increasing rates of fertilization, reaches a maximum, and
then declines with the application of more fertilizer. This type
of yield response to fertilization makes the practice of applying
&#147;insurance N&#148; a guaranteed profit reducer.</P>

<P>Development of a soil nitrate test for pumpkins should improve
N management in pumpkins, improve the profitability of pumpkins,
and minimize the potential for nitrate contamination of water
supplies. The objective of this study was to determine if the
PSNT is a useful tool for estimating the N topdress requirement
for pumpkins.</P>

<H4><font color="#dc143c">METHODS AND MATERIALS</font></H4>

<P>Thirteen nitrogen rate experiments were conducted in Connecticut,
New Hampshire, and New York. The N rates were 0, 30, 60, 90, 120,
and 150 lbs N/acre arranged in a randomized complete block design
with four replications. The experiments were direct seeded to
pumpkins in the first half of June. The plot size was either 24
feet long by 30 feet wide, or 20 feet long by 15 feet wide. Plants
were thinned to one plant/hill about two weeks after seeding.
Weeds were controlled by using the stale seedbed method or Curbit
herbicide, and the fields were then mechanically cultivated, and
hand-hoed.</P>

<P>The N fertilizer was applied before planting. Soil samples
were collected from the surface foot of soil about one week before
the vines began to run. The soil samples were spread to air-dry
within a few hours of collection, and the dried soil was passed
through a 2-mm screen. Calcium chloride (0.10 <I>M</I>) was used
to extract the nitrate from the soil and the nitrate concentration
was determined by using the Cd reduction method. Yields were estimated
by weighing all the pumpkins, except the totally green pumpkins,
in each plot. Relative pumpkin yields were calculated for each
N treatment as a percentage of the plateau yield from the quadratic
model relating yield to fertilizer N applied within each experiment.
If the quadratic model could not significantly (alpha=0. 10) describe
the relationship between yield and fertilizer N, then single-degree-of-freedom
contrasts were used to determine the plateau yield.</P>

<H4><font color="#dc143c">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</font></H4>

<P>The average yield response to N for the 13 experiments was
a quadratic response, or a C-shaped curve (<A NAME="anchor198304"></A><A
HREF="#anchor189308">Table 1</A>). The average yield for the 13
experiments reached a maximum of 15.91 tons/acre at the 90 lb/acre
treatment. The yield for the 90 lb/acre treatment was 4.19 tons
/acre greater than the zero N treatment. The two highest N treatments,
120 and 150 lbs N/acre, produced yields significantly lower than
the 90 lb/acre treatment. These results suggest that 90 lbs N/acre
<IMG SRC="../../styles/pkin.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="125" ALIGN="RIGHT"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="pmpkn">should be the recommended
rate of N for pumpkins and not the current recommended rate of
130 lbs N/acre in the <A HREF="../../general/forms/eordrvgml.htm">New
England Vegetable Management Guide</A>. Looking only at the average
yields, however, does not provide complete information about the
yield response to N. The yields from the individual experiments
provide much more complete information.</P>

<P>The yields at the individual experiments were quite variable.
At 5 of the 13 experiments there was no response to N fertilization.
At four of the experiments there was a quadratic or C-shaped response,
and at four other experiments there was a response to only 30
or 60 lbs N/acre. These results suggest that it will be impossible
to recommend a single rate of N that will be the most profitable
rate for every growers&#146; fields.</P>

<P>The PSNT provides information about the N fertility status
of the soil immediately before the time of topdressing that can
improve the reliability of N recommendations. In these experiments,
relative yields less than 90% were associated with soil nitrate-N
concentrations less than about 25 ppm, and relative yields greater
than 90% were associated with soil nitrate-N concentrations greater
than 25 ppm. This suggests that fields with nitrate-N concentrations
greater than 25 ppm do not need topdressed N fertilizer, and fields
with nitrate-N concentrations less than 25 ppm will respond to
applications of N fertilizer. Calculation of the relative yields
in this data set is difficult because of the variable yield response
to N fertilization. The yields were especially variable for the
treatments with the higher rates of N. We believe the response
to N fertilization was variable because of erratic fruit set.
We plan to collect one more year of data to further quantify the
yield response to N fertilization.</P>

<H4><font color="#dc143c">CONCLUSIONS</font></H4>

<P>These results suggest that the reliability of our N fertilizer
recommendations for pumpkins could be improved by using the PSNT
to guide fertilization. Preliminary analysis of the relationship
between relative pumpkin yield and soil nitrate concentrations
in the surface foot of soil about one week before the vines begin
to run suggest that fields testing greater than 25 ppm N will
not respond to N fertilizer applications. Fields testing less
than 25 ppm nitrate-N likely will respond to N fertilizer.</P>
