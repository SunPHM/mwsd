  July 6, two weeks after planting. Growing fast! <br>
  <img src="photos/6-76.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
July 12th, 3 weeks after planting. Huge! This is when you could start to see little pinky-sized zucchini and summer squash starting up. The summer squash plant is on the right.</strong></p>
      <p class="style1"><strong><img src="photos/squash-problems-727.jpg" width="432" height="576"><br>
        July 24th. It's hard to see any problems here, but this was when the rotting was starting in the root area. </strong></p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/zucchini-rotting-724.jpg" width="576" height="553"><br>
      First signs of a problem showed up in July. This photo taken July 24th shows how the fruits, which before this had been growing beautifully, started to rot. There were other signs that we noticed at this point, but probably the roots were starting to do strange things that show up better later. </p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/6-719.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
  July 19th. 1 month after planting. Look at those prehistoric sized leaves and that huge zucchini under there! You can just see, in the middle left, the big one we picked that was 15 inches long! . <br>
  Here it is below, on the left with 2 slightly smaller cousins.<br>
  Destined to be part of an incredibly delicious etouffe sort of dish. </p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/harvest-719.jpg" width="576" height="379"><br>
        July 19th Harvest, when it seemed like the beginning of an endless barage of zucchini and summer squash. And only 2 weeks later, the dream is dead! </p>      
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/6-727.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
  July 27. 5 weeks after planting. They look healthy, but underneath there, some of the squashes are suddenly rotting and the roots are looking weird. </p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/6-728.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
        July 28th. Just a couple of days later, the plants show extreme wear and tear.</p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/squash-rootrot-730.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
      July 28th - Here the roots started to look like they are emerging from the ground. We wondered if it was because the container is too shallow (it's 4&quot; in some parts, but mostly 8&quot; deep). At this point the leaves looked a bit spotted, like they might have a fungal infection. </p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/6-730.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
        July 30. Beautiful in the light, but suffering.</p>
      <p class="style1"><img src="photos/squash-rootrot3-727.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
      July 30th. The roots emerging from the ground, looking mangled and rotted.</p>
    <p class="style1"><img src="photos/squash-rootrot2-730.jpg" width="432" height="576"><br>
      July 30th. Mangled roots, upon closer inspection, have tiny black bugs.</p>
    <p class="style1"><img src="photos/6-93.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
      The morning of August 3rd. The mighty have fallen. It's time to gather the sample to send off to the lab.</p>
    <p class="style1"><img src="photos/squash-diggingup-93.jpg" width="576" height="432"><br>
      August 3rd, digging up the sample. We'll send the whole thing to the Extension Service for analysis.</p>
    <p class="style1"><img src="photos/squash-worm-93.jpg" width="576" height="432"> <br>
      August 3rd. Oh my god - big white worm crawls out of the roots as we're putting the thing in a ziplock. He was wily, but we got him in there and sent the whole thing to the lab.</p>
