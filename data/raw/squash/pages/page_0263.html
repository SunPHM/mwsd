<h2>A First Nations Legend<br />
 How Indian Corn<br />
 Came Into The World</h2>
</div>
<p>Long, long ago, in a beautiful part of this country, there
lived an Indian with his wife and children .He was poor and found
it hard to provide food enough for his family. But though needy
he was kind and contented, and always gave thanks to the Great
Spirit for everything that he received. His eldest son, Wunzh,
was likewise kind and gentle and thankful of heart, and he longed
greatly to do something for his people.</p>
<p>The time came that Wunzh reached the age when every Indian boy
fasts so that he may see in a vision the Spirit that is to be his
guide through life. Wunph's father built him a little lodge
apart, so that the boy might rest there undisturbed during his
days of fasting. Then Wunzh withdrew to begin the solemn
rite.</p>
<p>On the first day he walked alone in the woods looking at the
flowers and plants, and filling his mind with the beautiful
images of growing things so that he might see them in his
night-dreams. He saw how the flowers and herbs and berries grew,
and he knew that some were good for food, and that others healed
wounds and cured sickness. And his heart was filled with even a
greater longing to do something for his family and his tribe.</p>
<p>Truly, thought he, the Great Spirit made all things. To Him we
owe our lives. But could He not make it easier for us to get our
food than hunting and catching fish? I must try to find this out
in my vision.</p>
<p>So Wunzh returned to his lodge and fasted and slept. On the
third day he became weak and faint. Soon he saw in a vision a
young brave coming down from the sky and approaching the lodge.
He was clad in rich garments of green and yellow colors. On his
head was a tuft of nodding green plumes, and all his motions were
graceful and swaying.</p>
<p>I am sent to you, O Wunzh, said the sky- stranger, that Great
Spirit who made all things in sky and earth. He has seen your
fasting, and knows how you wish to do good to your people, and
that you do not seek for strength in war nor for the praise of
warriors. I am sent to tell you how you may do good to your
kindred. Arise and wrestle with me, for only overcoming me may
you learn the secret.</p>
<p>Wunzh, though he was weak from fasting, felt courage grow in
his heart, and he arose and wrestled with the stranger. But soon
he became weaker and exhausted, and the stranger, seeing this,
smiled gently on him and said: My friend, this is enough for
once, I will come again to-morrow. And he vanished as suddenly as
he had appeared.</p>
<p>The next day the stranger came, and Wunzh felt himself weaker
than before; nevertheless he rose and wrestled bravely. Then the
stranger spoke a second time. My friend, he said, have courage!
To-morrow will be your last trial. And he disappeared from
Wunzh's sight.</p>
<p>On the third day the stranger came as before, and the struggle
was renewed. And Wunzh, though fainter in body, grew strong in
mind and will, and he determined to win or perish in the attempt.
He exerted all his powers, and, lo! in a while, he prevailed and
overcame the stranger.</p>
<p>O Wunzh, my friend, said the conquered one, you have wrestled
manfully. You have met your trial well. To-morrow I shall come
again and you must wrestle with me for the last time. You will
prevail. Do you then strip off my garments, to throw them
away?</p>
<p>In the morning Wunzh's father came to him with food. My son,
he said, you have fasted long. It is seven days since you have
tasted food, and you must not sacrifice your life. The Master of
Life does not require that.</p>
<p>My father, replied the boy, wait until the sun goes down
to-morrow. For a certain reason I wish to fast until that
hour.</p>
<p>Very well, said the old man, I shall wait until the time
arrives when you feel inclined to eat. And he went away.</p>
<p>The next day, at the usual hour, the sky stranger came again.
And, though Wunzh had fasted seven days, he felt a new power
arise within him. He grasped the stranger with superhuman
strength, and threw him down. He took from him his beautiful
garments,and, finding him dead, buried him in the softened earth,
and did all else as he had been directed.</p>
<p>He then returned to his father's lodge, and partook sparingly
of food. There he abode for some time. But he never forgot.</p>
<p>Weeks passed , the summer was drawing to a close. One day
Wunzh asked his father to follow him. He led him to a distant
meadow. There, in the place where the stranger had been buried,
stood a tall and graceful plant, with bright- colored, silken
hair, and crowned nodding green plumes. Its stalk was covered
with waving leaves, and there grew from its sides clusters of
milk-filled ears of corn, golden and sweet, each ear closely
wrapped in its green husks.</p>
<p>It is my friend! shouted the boy joyously; it is Mondawmin,
the Indian Corn! We need no longer depend on hunting, so long as
this gift is planted and cared for. The Great Spirit has heard my
voice and has sent us this food.</p>
<p>Then the whole family feasted on the ears of corn and thanked
the Great Spirit who gave it. So Indian Corn came into the
world.</p>

<td>Agriculture provided the First Nation Peoples with foods that
hunting or fishing did not supply. The Three Sisters were Maize,
Beans, Squash.<br />
<br />
In addition to these cultivated foods, they gathered berries and
nuts to add to their diets.

They grew several varieties of maize. They had sweet corn,
popcorn, corn for flour, white, yellow, red, and blue corn. It
was pounded into a flour and then cooked as hominy, mush and
grits. Corn has also played a part in North American Art as a
motif dating back to prehistoric times.<br />
<div align="center"><img src="squash.gif" width="135"
height="136" vspace="4" hspace="0" border="0" alt="Squash" /></div>
<br />
Squash was another important part of Native agriculture, and was
cultivated the Huron and other related Native Peoples in Ontario
1400 AD. Kids are familiar with the Pumpkins which are carved
into Jack O Lanterns for halloween.

<br />
Another Native agricultural product was the bean. They used
it as a substitute for meat. The Native Peoples cultivated lima
beans, kidney beans, string beans, shell beans and pea beans, all
of which are in use today.<br />

The First Nation Peoples that practiced Agriculture never had a food shortage. The produce they produced
stored easily, and provided for them when hunting and fishing was poor. They also gathered and stored nuts, berries, and edible roots.
