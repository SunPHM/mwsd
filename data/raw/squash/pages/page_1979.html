Our realtor emailed us to say he finally had the farm we were looking for.  It was natural for us to be skeptical since we had been looking for a couple of years.  And just two weeks prior we had checked out some properties only to be disappointed.  But he sent along pictures and a description, and we thought he might just be right.  We had been looking for good farm land with at least 5 acres open, enough for crops, a small orchard, and several grazing animals.  But we also wanted land that had woods for firewood, lumber, and taking walks in.  We felt we needed around 20 acres.  The land had to have water on it.  A creek, a pond, a spring, it didn’t matter.  Ideally, we wanted good mountain views.  After all, we were moving towards the mountains, so we wanted to see them.  It would give us something to look at when we were too tired to work or when we got too old to run the farm.  We wanted to be away from things for peace and quiet but close enough to neighbors.  We also wanted to be within 45 minutes of Winston-Salem, Ed’s hometown.  If the land already had some farm buildings on it, that would be a plus.  We had been looking long enough that we knew what we wanted.

Three days after receiving the email, we drove up to Westfield to take a look even though we weren’t sure the roads would be clear from the snow the day before.  Through the snow covered ground, we were pleased to see that it was indeed what we had been looking for.  The 35-acre tract had around 6 acres in pasture land surrounded by a split rail fence.  There were maybe 25 acres wooded with mountain laurel and rhododendron.  There was a large fishing pond and a smaller silt pond.  The creek running into them was fed by a spring that didn’t go dry even during the drought of 2002.  There was an old log cabin and two log tobacco barns, one surrounded by a wide roof overhang.  The top of the property is at 1400 feet, high enough to be 4-5 degrees cooler than Raleigh.  From there we can see Chestnut Ridge, a low mountain range that runs next to the farm.  In the distance we can see the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia.  It was the view that sealed the deal for us.

February was a month of waiting.  Waiting for the loan approval, the survey, the perc test.  It all took longer than anyone thought.

We finally closed on the farm on March 24.  The first weekend that we worked at the farm, we hardly knew where to start.  There was so much to do, so much we wanted to do.  We started cleaning the overgrowth off the fences and around the barn and cabin.  We soon realized we needed more tools…more powerful tools.  We were a little scattered with our first few attempts to start working the farm, but we finally decided to focus on just a few things: set up camp, get the garden started, and prepare for a picnic Memorial weekend.
<p>
Not realizing what the bare vines were that he was pulling up, Ed got a very bad case of poison ivy on both arms that first weekend.  He’s a lot more cautious now, but the poison ivy is everywhere, and it can’t always be avoided.  He now uses long sleeves and gloves when he’s anywhere near where it might be, and he washes at each break.  He also learned about a couple of products that help.  Ivy Block helps prevent the urushiol oil in poison ivy from being absorbed into the skin, and Technu helps remove the oil if it gets on the skin.  We keep both in stock on the farm.

Things started to green up in April.  It was nice to see the farm come to life.  We began to meet our neighbors, primarily through their wandering over to see us.  We repaired the fence around what used to be a corral and arranged for the ground there to be plowed.  Our nephew, Justin, helped us out.  He’s very interested in sustainable agriculture.  He recently returned to the states after spending several months in France living from one organic farm to another with the WOOF Program.  He liked the farm, especially the Stony Knoll area where he wants to build a stone dwelling.  We also started clearing a path to the small pond and cleared away some of the overhang along the farm road.  Slowly we got some things done, but we began to learn everything takes longer than imagined, and we had less time working than we thought we would.  We’ve also learned that we need to factor in time for visiting with neighbors.  We’re thankful we have good, friendly neighbors, and it has been a pleasure getting to know them.
<p>
We set up a couple of bluebird houses Ed made, and a week later they were both occupied.  We were thrilled.  Bluebirds had become something of a symbol for us.  On the first day we looked at the property, we saw bluebirds, and we took that to be a sign that this was the farm for us.

We hadn’t been able to get to the farm as much as we had wanted in April, so we were focused on getting a lot accomplished in May.  Ed took the first week of May off from work to get started on a long to-do list.  We pulled the old pop-up camper up to the farm, and set it up under the overhang of the barn.  The wide overhang makes a nice sheltered area for the camper and a good work station for our tools and supplies.  We purchased a gas trimmer with brush cutter, a chain saw, and a tiller.  We were ready to go.  Then it rained.  And it continued raining.  It’s been a very wet spring.  Needless to say we had to scale back our plans, but we still got our major goals accomplished.
<p>
May tenth was a long hot day, but Sheryl managed to till up much of the corral with our “new” tiller.  We purchased a couple of rain barrels and hooked them up to a drip irrigation system regulated by a battery operated timer.  We’re still evaluating how well it works, but we’ve had so much rain, we haven’t needed any irrigation.  At least the rain barrels are full!  We have a lot of deer and ground hogs around, so we tried to set up the fence to discourage both – a double fence with the second fence being 7 feet high.  When we have time and equipment, we’ll try burying some wire fence to discourage the ground hogs from digging under.  For now, it’s a pleasure to see a variety of sunflowers growing neatly and dill spouting.  We have corn popping up in rows, flowering buckwheat, potatoes, herbs, mixed flowers and melons.  Flag Day planting will consist of sweet potatoes and winter squash.  Scheduled for the end of June are Sugar Pie and Jack O’Lantern Pumpkins.

When we started cleaning the log cabin, we found a bird’s nest inside and snakes basking in the sun on the outside.  When Ed went up the latter to hammer down loose tin, we heard a lot of loud humming from agitated bees.  We decided that maybe winter time would be a better time to work on the cabin.

After our son, Edwin, finished his spring semester, he drove up to see the farm.  He worked on clearing areas around the pond.  But with all the rain, it was all overgrown again in a few weeks.

We found out that the farm also has ticks.  Lots of ticks!  We quickly learned a number of things about ticks.  We now know the difference between deer ticks and dog ticks and the symptoms of Lyme’s Disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.  Before we go out the door of the camper in the morning, we put insect repellant on our legs, around entry points like sleeves and neck, and uh… anywhere else we don’t want ticks to go.  Then we pull our socks over our pant cuffs.  It has worked pretty well.  We learned that Guinea hens are good for eating ticks, so they may be the first animals we get when we move to the farm full time.

Access to the farm is by a farm road owned by a neighbor.  It’s a nice farm road leading down to the log cabin.  But leaving by the farm road is can be a dangerous thrill.  As it approaches Westfield Road, it is steep and doesn’t have much gravel for traction.  When it’s wet, it gets very slippery.  We don’t have a vehicle with 4-wheel drive.  Our pickup truck does okay with a load in it…when it’s dry, but it hasn’t been dry much.  Even under ideal conditions, we have to make a running start to get up the hill with enough momentum to make it onto the road.  The trouble is, we can’t see traffic coming from the right, and we only see well enough to the left to make a last second decision whether to stop or keep on going.  So if we want to go left, we have to turn right and then turn around at the old store a few houses up the road.  I know we’ve scared a few drivers when we pop up onto the road like we do, but so far we’ve had no mishaps.  We also have a driveway that leads to the land that has a level entrance to Westfield Road.  But it only goes to the upper section where we plan to build our house, and then it’s a long walk down to the barn and cabin.  So we plan to put in a new farm road with a more gentle slope that will go around where our future home will be.  We’re just not sure how soon we can build it.

After much planning and preparation we had our Memorial Weekend picnic to meet our neighbors and have family members come see the farm.  We also had good help from some of our neighbors in getting things ready.   It was well attended and we enjoyed meeting neighbors and showing off the farm.  The desserts they brought tasted great.

The day after the picnic was a day of rest.  We were up early enough to see the sun rise.  It was a thrill just to see the sun.  We went fishing in the pond for the first time.  We caught brim, bass, and catfish.  We hiked around and saw the mountain laurel in bloom.  We tried to identify some of the species of trees and other plant life.  We relaxed and just enjoyed the quiet.  We decided that while there is a lot of work to do, we must make sure we do stop and just enjoy being there.
