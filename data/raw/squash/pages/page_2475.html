<p align="left">After doing very little in my first year here, I
thought I might actually do some exercise this year. So I have
now gone to the other extreme as I am now an active member of the
university boat club. Having done this at school for a few years
I knew what I was letting myself in for but somehow I'm still
doing it. If you enjoy getting up at 6.30am in mid-winter in
Scotland and getting cold and wet, this is the sport for you. No
apart from that, it is actually a fantastic sport and it's great
being part of a squad and the social side of things are a good
laugh.</p>

(slightly better than our canal but nevermind!)</p>

<p align="left">Apart from that am keen on windsurfing but felt
it was a bit cold to bring my board up here to Edinburgh. But in
the summer I try and get down to the coast as much as I can.</p>

<p align="left">Also do a bit of sailing, diving, tennis and
squash.</p>

<h2 align="left">MUSIC</h2>

<p align="left">I come from quite a keen musical family so I
started learning the piano and violin from about the age of six
and have been playing ever since. I got a music scholarship to my
school so I took it pretty seriously then as I kind of had to.
But since leaving school I have found it hard to find the time to
do all the necessary practice and play only occasionally now
which is bit of a shame. However, I am a member of the University
Sinfonia which meet every saturday morning and that's good fun.</p>

<h2 align="left">TRAVEL</h2>

<p align="left">I have caught the travelling bug since leaving
school and now wish I had taken a gap year before starting
university. In 2000 I went inter-railing around Europe with a few
friends visiting Belgium, Holland, Germany, Czech Republic and
Italy. Last summer I went the long haul to Australia for five
weeks, backpacking up the east coast which ws just fantastic.
Highlights included sailing round the Whitsuday Isles on an 85ft
yacht for four days and learning to dive on the Great Barrier
Reef. Cool huh!</p>
