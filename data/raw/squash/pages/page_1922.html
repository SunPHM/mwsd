			<p>&nbsp;PA: <i><font color="#FFFF00">[voice over]</font></i> Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater had a wife
			and couldn't keep<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her. So, he put her in a pumpkin shell and there he kept her very well. And<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since hard squashes contain high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beta-carotene, she lasted a couple of months.</p>
			<p>PW: What? You better let me out of here!<br>
				&nbsp;PP: What? Good enough for Cinderella but not good enough for you?<br>
				PW: At least she met a prince.<br>
				&nbsp;PP: Why I ought a ...<br>
				&nbsp;PA: Whatever, kids. The pumpkin is not the only magical gourd in the valley.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's the acorn squash, the buttercup, the delicata, the hubbard.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;PP: Hey. Hubbard. Sounds like another nursery rhyme.<br>
				&nbsp;PA: Maybe for you, but to me it just sounds like ... <i><font color="#FFFF00">[curtain falls with Good<br>

				The Kitchen<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
			<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When cooking with hard or winter squashes, one must reckon with the bowling ball principle which states that when
				dealing with foods that are exceedingly hard and unwieldy, one should use a knife as little as possible. In fact, when it comes to hard squash I
				like to keep my good cutlery safely slotted and reach instead for very inexpensive Asian style vegetable clever. Okay?<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now approach your squash. And the first thing to do is to make sure that it's stable on
			the cutting board. If it's
				not, you're going to have to take a little slice off of the bottom. This looks pretty good to me. Now take your blade and place it right over
				the center. Then tap <i><font color="#FFFF00">[with another item such as a wooden mallet]</font></i>. There. No fingers damaged. Now I like
			to split this again—quarter it. There. And one more. I like to quarter not only
			because it's easier to cook but it's a lot easier to
				seed. You'll notice that there are a lot of seeds and they're held together with some really kind of nasty looking, alien membrane kind of
				things. It's really tough to get out of there. I like to use an ice cream scoop, the kind that's got
			the sharp little edge there. Just reach
				in and scoop it out. But don't throw these away. Just like pumpkins, these seeds can be laid out and roasted and added to a lot of dishes which
				we will get to shortly.</p>

				coverage</font> <i><font color="#FFFF00">[dons a apron]</font></i><font color="#00FFFF">, if you know what I mean.
			And make sure
				that you've got as much room as possible to work with. And if you've got just a small counter use the counter, don't use a cutting
				board. It'll, it'll never work. Next thing, cover this with just a little bit of flour. But try to make it a very even coverage. Kind of
				throw it like you're planting seeds. There. Now we're going to turn out this entire mass right into the middle.
			And dust the top with
				flour. Kind of think of this as a big ball of biscuit dough. Don't think of it as potatoes and squash. It's not. It's an actual
				dough.</font></p>

						gets balled up and split again. So now we're talking about quarters, right? Each one of these gets balled up and guess what. Divided
						again. So that you end up with eight pieces that are basically the same size. One two, three four, five six, seven eight. If they're

				as one big mass but believe me it would be a little too much for you. Now this dough, it's pretty, pretty smooth so I'm not going to try and
				get a lot more flour into it. What you want to do is very gently roll it into a snake shape. I'm really just applying pressure with my two middle
				fingers, okay? That's what's actually doing the pushing. The point is to try to get it nice and long and about half an inch thick without actually
				breaking it. You're going to have to make your moves more and more gentle the longer you get. And it if does break, just stick it back together.
				Believe me, it's no big deal.</font></p>
