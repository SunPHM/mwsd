<h4><em><a name="Crop Reports"></a>Crop Reports</em></h4>
<strong>In northern Illinois</strong>, good weather during the last two weeks has allowed most farm activities to
be accomplished. Soil moisture is adequate for most crops. Most apple varieties have 4-cm
diameter fruits, and growers are applying third cover sprays to control codling moth, redbanded
leafroller, white apple leafhopper, apple maggot, aphids and San Jose scale.  It is also time to
apply third cover fungicide sprays for control of scab, fruit rots, sooty blotch, and flyspeck. 
Miticides should be used only where scouting detects infestations greater than 2.5 mites per leaf. 
Some growers tend to leave their orchards unmowed during this time to acts as a habitat for the
natural enemies of spider mites. Fruit thinning is still going on in some orchards and calcium
chloride sprays can be repeated because of the heavy rainfalls we have experienced in the last two
weeks. The calcium chloride spray will improve fruit quality and control calcium deficiency
diseases such as cork spot, bitter pit and Jonathan spot. Some grape varieties have formed fruits,
but most of them are at petal fall stage.  

<p>Striped cucumber beetles are out and feeding on cucurbits. Their feeding habit on these plants can
cause serious injury to the pumpkin, watermelon, squash, cucumber and other cucurbit seedlings.
They are also carrier of bacterial wilt causing organism.  Growers need to monitor this insect pest
and follow the spray recommendations in the 2001 Illinois Agricultural Pest Management
Handbook.

It is June, the growing month and orchard visits confirm this.  Apples are growing and sizing
nicely, and some early peaches are being picked for sale.   I expect to pick my first apple (Quinte)
this weekend, which is about the same date as last year.  Phenology-wise, we continue to be
ahead of "normal" and about the same as last year on most crops. The first Japanese beetle was
earlier, but the main attack began last week almost on schedule.  Once again, they found my
Honeycrisp apples and they have the only scarified leaves on the back 40. 

<p>The Honeycrisp leaf discoloration that mimics potato leafhopper injury is present on a few trees
with the first siting on Jun 18.  It is present on weak and nonbearing trees.  I have not seen a
potato leafhopper  this spring.  In apple orchards, some mites are being found, and knockdown
treatments have been applied. Codling moth larvae have been found in tops of larger trees, but
smaller trees in these orchards are clean, which may indicate preference of high elevations for egg
laying by mama codling moth, but might also indicate less spray deposit and more rain erosion of
that deposit.  Diseases remain at low levels, as no apple scab has been seen, powdery mildew is
minimal, and fire blight is sporadic but light in the orchards I've been in. 

<p>Peaches show some plant and stink bug feeding.  Oriental fruit moth shoot flagging has not been
seen in commercial orchards, but is present in mine.   However, trapping for the 2nd generation
has been at low numbers.  Bacterial spot has appeared since the rainy period of two weeks ago--being much more severe in orchards without Mycoshield and Tenncop M.   

<p>Black raspberry harvest is past, red raspberry and blueberry harvest is peaking, and Shawnee
blackberries are at first pick.  Winter injury continues to show in some of the blackberry varieties,
as Shawnee had some die-back and lower yields, and Triple Crown has some canes that leafed out
and are now going gold to brown as the injured vascular system breaks down. 

<p>My grapes intercepted some phenoxy herbicide drift from somewhere during the week of the
10th.  For the initiates, the symptoms are fasciated, distorted, twisted leaves and shoots, especially
the terminals, and this is followed by many lateral bud breaks which create a thicker canopy.
Affected grape plants tend to ripen later, more unevenly and have lower yields.   

<p>More on peaches.  <strong>According</strong> to National Peach Council reports, Illinois production this year is
predicted at 23,000,000 pounds, the same as last year.  The national projection is 1.1 percent
higher than 2000.  Georgia production is up and South Carolina is down about 10 percent, while
our neighboring states are about the same.     And, <strong>preharvest summer pruning </strong>is best
performed 2-4 weeks prior to harvest to improve light conditions that will improve fruit color,
size and sugars.   The pruning should remove upright watersprouts in the middle and lower part of
the tree that are more than 18 inches long and show signs of lateral branching.  Some of the
heavy, vigorous shoots growing on the exterior part of the tree can also be removed. 

<p><strong>More observations: </strong>

<ul>
  <li>It is a year for white Dutch clover, as many orchards, fields and lawns have a lot of flowers. </li>
  <li>Shoot growth of apple is much less than it was a year ago.  Our soil moisture, both surface and
subsurface has been less, and the trees show the difference. </li>
  <li>Cover crops were wilting in St. Clair county peach orchards this week, and the soil probe
showed more soil moisture at 7  inches than at 14 inches. </li>

<p>No lengthy discussions yet, but just a quick heads-up ... Japanese beetle adults are emerging and
beginning to feed on a variety of fruit, vegetable, and landscape plants in much of the state.  In
addition, "<a href="http://www.entomology.umn.edu/cues/IPM-turf/falsebeetle-pic.htm">false Japanese beetle</a>" (<em>Strigoderma arbicola</em>, a dull brown beetle that resembles
Japanese beetle, is also present now throughout the state.  Expect numbers of Japanese beetles to
increase and persist over the next several weeks.  Look for these insects on susceptible crops
(including apples, peaches, brambles, grapes, green beans, and lots of other plants).  The 2001
tree fruit and small fruit spray guides and the Illinois Agricultural Pest Management Handbook
(Chap. 6 covers vegetables) list insecticides registered for Japanese beetle control.

<p><strong>Raspberry crown borer</strong> 

<p>If you have blackberry or raspberry canes that are wilting or dead, it would be wise to dig some
up and inspect them for raspberry crown borer larvae (white caterpillars with brown heads, larvae
of a clearwing moth).  Virginia Tech's fact sheet on this insect is available at:

<p><a href="http://www.ento.vt.edu/Fruitfiles/raspcrown.html">http://www.ento.vt.edu/Fruitfiles/raspcrown.html</a> 

<p>The following note on crown borer control was prepared last summer by Vern Grubinger of
University of Vermont Extension ...

<p>"In the past diazinon was sometimes used for raspberry crown borer control as a soil drench
around the base of plants early in the spring. Diazinon is no longer labeled for use on raspberries,
and only "old" containers specifically labeled for such use may be "used up" in this way. Remove
and destroy infested plants and canes and remove nearby wild brambles to reduce future problems
with this insect. [Guthion] is also listed in the small fruit pest management guide [for the
northeastern states] for control of crown borers - this should be applied as a heavy drench before
harvest. Some trials of soil drenches using insect-pathogenic nematodes as biological control
agents have been successful against crown borers. These nematodes infect and kill only insects,
not plants or other organisms. Mike Cherim of The Green Spot (603)942-8925 recommends
applying several drenches of Hb nematodes (<em>Heterohabditis bacteriophoba</em>) a couple of weeks
apart. Since overwintered larvae may be moving around from cane, to crowns to roots in the
spring, this would appear to be a good time to apply nematodes.Apply 1 million nematodes (about
$13) per 2,000 sq. ft. of row area to be drenched. Cost to treat an acre (25 million nematodes) is
about $116."  Source:  VERMONT VEGETABLE AND BERRY NEWS, April 15,2000)

<p><strong>Canopy Management: The Solution to Premium Grapes and Wines</strong> 

<p>Successful wine industries such as California have reached worldwide recognition as a result of
step-by-step improvements. According to Dr. James Wolpert, Chair of the Department of
Viticulture and Enology at UC Davis, improvement of California wine in recent years has come as
result of closer relationships and better communication between growers and wineries. I have
witnessed the same phenomenon from my experience in the east (Virginia) and my visits to wine
regions in the northwest including Washington and Oregon. It seems that we cannot over
emphasize enough the importance of this message to our young and blooming industry. Our
growers should realize that they are the real winemakers. 

<p>With the tremendous planting that has occurred the last 3 years, production is estimated to double
each year. Wineries would have more grapes to choose from and become "picky" about what to
purchase.  Winemakers unanimously agree that grape quality is the number one criteria in deciding
what and where to buy, and for how much. The best way to ensure quality grapes, growers should
embrace canopy management (CM) practices. These practices are usually conducted in fine wine
regions to produce premium fruit and wine. However, they are becoming a routine practice for
vineyards seeking maximum wine quality. If our wine industry becomes and continues to be
successful, it is critical we produce the finest grapes possible in all of our vineyards. The following
describes one of the ways to achieve that goal: 

<p><strong><em>What is CM?</em></strong> 

<p>According to Dr. Richard Smart, author of 'Sunlight into Wine': "Canopy management is the
practice which results in the modification of position or amount of leaves, shoot and fruit in space
to achieve a desired arrangement." 

<p>Vine canopy is the shoot system, which includes the stem, the leaves, and fruit clusters. In the
viticulture world, canopy is described by its <u>length</u>, <u>height</u>, <u>width</u>, <u>leaf area</u>, and <u>shoot density.</u>
Shoot density refers to the number of shoots per foot of row or foot of cordon. 

<p><em><strong>Why CM and what are the benefits?</em></strong> 

<p>Canopy management has several viticulture advantages such as maximizing sunlight interception,
which means minimizing shading, and very importantly maintaining a balance between shoot
growth and fruit production.  

<p>Benefits? YES!! The extra work undertaken by growers has a significant pay off both for their
pockets and the grapevines: 

<ul>
  <li>Increased air movement, which leads to faster drying time from rain and dew; thus, less disease
pressure.</li>
  <li>Better spray penetration and disease control.</li>
  <li>Improved fruit composition and varietal character.</li>
  <li>Increased bud fruitfulness.</li>
  <li>Improved winter hardiness.</li>
</ul>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><strong>Steps of CM</em></strong> 

<p>There are 5 major steps or practices that growers should follow and apply to their vineyards.
There are grape varieties that require all 5 steps, some require less, and others require repeat of
some of the 5 steps. The growing season also has a major impact on CM. Dry summers (like in
1999) require less CM steps than a wet summer (2000). Growers have to follow the basics and
fine-tune the steps according to variety, site, season, and own experience.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><u>Step 1 &#173; Shoot Thinning (Suckering)</em></u> 

<p><em>Suckering trunks and cordons</em>:<em> </em>This consists of removal of suckers (unwanted shoots which grow
on the trunk or cordon). One or two suckers are left at the base of the trunk only if a new trunk
needs to be trained in second and third year vines; or if trunk replacement is deemed necessary
due to injury (cold, disease, or mechanical). On the cordons, unfruitful shoots are removed first
unless they are needed for spur renewal.  Once all shoot thinning is done, shoots should be spaced
evenly along the cordon length and have a density of 4 to 6 shoots per foot of cordon or canopy. 
With 8-foot vine spacing, this corresponds to 32-48 shoots per vine on a single curtain/high
cordon system, and 64-96 shoots per vine on a Geneva Double Curtain (GDC) training system.
Remember that with a divided canopy (e.g. GDC, and Scott Henry), there are two feet of canopy
for each foot of row. 

<p><em>When</em>: This is best done early in the season when shoots are about 1-3" (trunk suckering) to 8-12"
(cordon suckering) long. At this stage, shoots are easily rubbed off; fruit clusters are visible to
distinguish between fruitful and unfruitful shoots; and less labor is involved. Suckering may
require more than one pass. Some of the vineyards in southern Illinois were severely hit with frost
injury in mid-April. Therefore, growers with frost-prone vineyard sites should plan to shoot thin
after the spring frost threat has passed.

<p><em><u>Step 2 &#173; Shoot Positioning</em></u> 

<p>The best scenario is when shoots grow <u>vertically</u> (parallel to the trunk), either up or down
depending on the training system. In the real world, however, shoots tend to grow sideways and
attach to the cordon wire with their tendrils. This is why shoot positioning is conducted to
disallow lateral and horizontal shoot growth. Shoot positioning also allows the spread of shoots
to promote an open canopy, improve spray penetration, and adhere to the shape of the given
trellis system.

<p><em>Combing: </em>This is the generic term of positioning shoots downward. Combing is conducted on
high training systems such as High Cordon and Geneva Double Curtain. Shoots are combed in a
vertical downward position. 

<p><em>Tucking</em>: This is the generic term of positioning shoots upward and is used on low training
systems such as Vertical Shoot Position (VSP). Shoots are held upright by using one or two pairs
of moveable catch wires 10 to 12 inches apart. Sometimes extra tying with tape is needed in order
to keep the shoots upright.  

<p><em>Combing/Tucking</em>: Both practices are required in vertically divided canopies such as Scott Henry
and Smart Dyson training systems. The upward growth of both systems is tucked between catch
wires and the downward growth is combed. 

<p><em>When</em>: This practice seems difficult and time consuming to growers. This is primarily due to
missing the ideal time to shoot position. Unlike the other practices, timing is extremely crucial and
the time window of this practice is narrow (about two weeks). Shoots should be long enough and
strong at the base so that they don't break; and tendrils are not active enough to slow the
positioning process. This time window ranges between bloom and fruit set. Note that shoot
positioning needs to be repeated more than once as shoot growth continues.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><u>Step 3 &#173; Cluster Thinning</em></u> 

<p>This is the least favorite practice for new growers. Recommending cluster thinning may sound to
some growers like dropping cash in the ground.  To cluster thin or not to cluster thin? That is the
question! Some attempt to take the risk and avoid cluster-thinning altogether for a quick vineyard
production. Others do cluster thin and have in mind the long-term benefit of this practice for the
well-being and life span of the vineyard. 

<p>Cluster thinning is a MUST for some peculiar varieties that have very fruitful primary buds and
tend to produce 3+ clusters per shoot. Examples include Seyval, Chancellor, Vidal, and
Chambourcin. Among these varieties, some also have fruitful secondary and base buds, which in
turn produce several clusters per shoot. Seyval and Chancellor are good examples. These 2
varieties still produce a normal crop after losing their primary buds to cold injury. Other varieties,
however, do not require cluster thinning.  Examples include Chardonel, Traminette, Norton,
Vignoles, and Frontenac. 

<p><em>When: </em>There are two periods: before bloom (Pre-bloom) and after fruit set (Post fruit set). 

<p><em>Pre-bloom thinning</em>: This consists of removal of flower clusters. This practice can be done at the
same time as shoot thinning. The advantage of this timing is that clusters are easy to see, thus
thinning can be done quickly. By removing flower clusters this early, several things happen: berry
set is improved (more berries per cluster as a result of less competition with fewer clusters); and
berries are bigger at harvest. Other advantages include increased yield, increased sugars and
flavors of the fruit, improved vine size and hardiness. 

<p>Setbacks of early thinning include tighter cluster (as a result of larger berries) thus, bunch rot can
be a problem. Seyval produces large and tight clusters and is susceptible to bunch rot. Therefore,
thinning before bloom is not recommended for Seyval. However, this practice is beneficial to
varieties that have loose clusters and are not susceptible to bunch rot such as Chambourcin and
Chancellor. 

<p><em>Post fruit set thinning</em>: In this case, berry set is less than that of pre-bloom thinning. There are
fewer berries per cluster; thus clusters are looser and bunch rot is lower. This practice is more
common and recommended for varieties susceptible to bunch rot such as Seyval. With this
method, yield, sugars, vine size, and hardiness are not negatively affected but rather improved.
This method, however, is more time-consuming, hence more expensive (more difficult to see the
fruit due to a more developed canopy). 

<p>At this stage of shoot development, vine canopy is about 75% formed. Use the following rule of
thumb guidelines to cluster thin your vines: Remove all clusters from shoots less than 12" long;
Leave one cluster per shoot for 12-24" long shoots; Leave 2 clusters if shoot is more than 24"
long.

<p><em>Special cases: </em> 

<p>In almost all commercial vineyards, there are always some vines that seem to fall behind in growth
and production. They look like one- or two-year old vines in a 5 year-old vineyard. In this case,
those underside vines should be cluster thinned heavily sometimes completely. This will allow the
vines to recover by diverting the carbohydrates to trunks and roots. Follow the same procedure
with vines that have not filled the trellis yet. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><u>Step 4 &#173; Leaf Removal (Pulling)</em></u> 

<p>Leaves are removed in the fruiting zone in order to accomplish two goals.  The first is to improve
air movement and spray penetration, thus reducing bunch rot infection. This is especially critical
for varieties susceptible to botrytis bunch rot such as Vignoles and Seyval.   The second is to
improve fruit and basal buds exposure. This results in better color for red wine varieties, lower
potassium and pH in the juice (Norton benefits the most), and more fruitful buds and hardy canes
the following year.  

<p>Leaf pulling is done on the "shade" side of the canopy, which is either the east side of a
North-South row or the north side of an East-West row. One to three leaves are removed at the
base of each shoot and around clusters. Leaf pulling is either minimally done or completely
avoided (depending on the canopy thickness) on the "sun" side of a canopy in order to avoid sun
burning of fruit. A set-back of leaf pulling is possible bird damage as result of exposed berries.  

<p><em>When: </em>Leaf pulling is first done after fruit set. One more cleanup pass may be necessary before
veraison by removing old and yellow leaves. BUT, NEVER REMOVE LEAVES AFTER
VERAISONIT IS TOO LATE AND WILL CAUSE FRUIT SUNBURN!  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><em><u>Step 5 &#173; Shoot Hedging</em></u> 

<p>Shoot hedging consists of cutting shoots that grow beyond the allocated space in a given trellis in
order to control shoot length. It is called "hedging" for upward shoot training such as on a VSP
system; and "skirting" for downward shoot training such as on a high cordon system. Shoot
hedging is required for VSP systems and upper canopies of Scott Henry systems. High cordon
(HC) and GDC systems do not usually require "skirting" unless shoot tips interfere with traffic in
row middles.   In general, a minimum of 12 leaves per shoot should be left after hedging in order
to mature the fruit and wood. DO NOT HEDGE SHOOTS BACK TO THE FRUIT ZONEYes,
this sounds silly, but I have seen more than one vineyard where growers did just that last season. 

<p><em>When</em>: Shoot hedging is done when shoots grow beyond the trellis space and desired length; about
3.5 feet for VSP and about 5 feet for HC and GDC. The amount of summer rain will determine
the number of hedging passes (typically 1 to 3 passes). However, do not hedge shoots after
veraison since this may result in delay of fruit maturity, and reduces wood maturity thus hardiness.

<p>Squash vine borer adults are active now in much of the state.  These "clearwing moths" are
colored with red and black, they resemble wasps, and they fly and lay eggs on squash during the
daytime.  Larvae tunnel within vines, causing them to wilt.  They most often cause damage in
squash and pumpkins.  Scout as soon as vines begin to run, looking for the moths and for
entrance holes at the base of vines (from larval tunneling).  Treat when first damage is noted and
again about a week later.  Several insecticides are effective for vine borer control, including
Capture, Sevin, Asana, Pounce, Ambush, and methoxychlor.  At the small scale, mounding soil
around the base of vines can encourage adventitious root growth from portions of the vine
beyond the point of vine borer damage.

<p>Squash bug adults are active now too.  Like vine borers, they most often injure squash and
pumpkins.  Adults lay eggs on foliage, and nymphs and adults suck fluids from vines and leaves. 
Scout for egg masses, and use a treatment threshold of 1 to 1.5 egg masses per plant.  If counts of
egg masses exceed this threshold, treat as soon as nymphs begin to hatch.  Capture, Asana,
Pounce, and Ambush are registered for squash bug control ... Capture is the most effective.

<strong>Another Reminder on Pesticide Drift</strong> 

<p>Each year the Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) handles about 75 pesticide drift
complaints.  The IDOA and University of Illinois Extension have important but different roles in
aiding growers dealing with pesticide drift complaints.   The University of Illinois Extension's role
is education and problem solving.   The IDOA has three roles that include education as well as
investigating complaints and enforcement of pesticide laws.  

<p>As a grower, you have an important responsibility NOT to make pesticide applications when
conditions favor drift.   The way you apply pesticides impacts surrounding crops and landscape
plants.   In addition, you may be the one drifted upon by other agronomic pesticide applications.  
In either case, before doing anything, both parties should make an effort to discuss the suspected
drift incident and rule out other possible causes of damage.   This is where the University of
Illinois Extension fits in, as a neutral third party.  Unit- and center-based educators, state
specialists, and the University of Illinois Plant Clinic may help in identifying herbicide injury.  If
the process needs to continue to the complaint stage, start by calling the IDOA's Bureau of
Environmental Programs at 1-800-641-3934 or 217-785-2427 for a complaint form.  Complaint
forms must be completed and returned to the IDOA within 30 days of the drift incident or within
30 days of when the damage was first noticed.

<p>A field investigator from the IDOA will be assigned your case and will investigate.  If a violation
has occurred, penalties may range from advisory or warning letters to fines of $750 to $10,000,
depending on the severity and type of violation.  Realize that the IDOA's role is to determine
whether a violation occurred during a pesticide application.  It cannot help a grower recover any
monetary damages for that violation.  Legal recourse of that type is the responsibility of the

<p>When pesticides drift onto desirable plants, usually a few common questions are asked.  Will the
damaged plants recover?  The simple answer is most likely.   Are the damaged plants safe to eat?  
The simple answer is no. To address the first question in more detail, many (but not all) landscape
plants will recover from minor injury that is caused by drift.  If a plant dies from pesticide drift it is
most likely caused by multiple exposures to pesticide drift over several occurrences or over a
number of years, or it creates an additional stress to plants where other problems such as insect
injury, disease or freeze damage have already lowered survival.   Regarding the second question,
it is impossible to know beyond a shadow of a doubt whether the fruit, leaves, or roots of a plant
exposed to pesticide drift is safe to eat.  The best answer is it should not be eaten.   From a label
standpoint, if the pesticide drifted onto a non-labeled crop, it is an illegal use of the product and
the commodity should not be eaten.  Even if the fruits or vegetables were listed on the pesticide
label, it may be difficult to know whether the residue from the pesticide was below the safe and
legal level for consumption. In addition, the drift exposure may have occurred too close to the
harvest date for safe consumption.
