<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">Welcome to this Cue Sports site.&nbsp; 
On this website our aim is to be able to keep players, organisers and keen 
spectators up to date with the current events of cue sports in New Zealand, with 
the occasional Oceania and World results too.&nbsp; Unfortunately due to a bad 
run of ill health in 2004 this site was not updated as often as it should have 
been.&nbsp; I will endeavour to do it more regularly this year.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">It is important that you get your 
Association to send through results so that they can be updated.&nbsp; Without 
everyone doing their bit, this site would not be as popular as it has become.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">They say Cue-Sports is dying, but I 
believe that it is only going through a slow phase due to too much politics and 
not enough good publicity.&nbsp; Come on everyone, lets make playing the game 
fun and enjoyable, not a political statement.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">All comments on this site are my 
personal opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyn McFall</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">Yet, only the Cue-Sports could make a claim that virtually
every person above the age of a toddler has played the game.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">Most games are played socially in homes, pubs, hotels,
motels, church halls and social clubs. Lets not forget rugby clubs, rowing,
sailing and boating clubs, and probably all other sport's clubs you can think of
would have a pool or a billiard table.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">
Interestingly enough, I had never seen a pool and billiard
hall with an attached rugby field so the players could relax by playing a
friendly game of rugby, after a hard game of 8 ball or snooker.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">
<img border="0" src="images/Misc/Island_Bay.jpg" style="border: 3px double #FF0000" align="left" alt="Aotearoa New Zealand Island Bay Wellington" width="272" height="191">There is numerous Cue-Sports Clubs around New Zealand. Many
players are very good at their craft and would most certainly &quot;give a good
scare&quot; to most of the world's best professionals. But here in New Zealand,
they not only play the game seriously to be able to obtain World Recognition,
but also play Socially to enjoy the camaraderie of all participants and
spectators.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">From talking to players and watching from afar I get the
feeling that during most meetings and competitions games are played furiously
and with a great deal of dedication to the sport, but the underlying foundation
is the social aspect of the game. And that can't be bad.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">Clubs and Associations are well organised, but if we take
into account that most of the administration tasks are performed by unpaid
volunteers, and club's incomes consists of members fees and grants, it is a
small miracle that they survive at all. Players travel substantial distances to
various competition venues, sometimes at their own expense. Again, I do not hear
anyone complaining.<img border="0" src="images/Misc/Wellington.jpg" align="right" alt="Aotearoa New Zealand Wellington" style="border: 3px double #FF0000" width="288" height="161"></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">Being an outsider to both, the country (I was born in Europe)
and to the game (I've only played socially), I am impressed by the dedication
and the Kiwi do-it-yourself attitude.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">If you are already an Aotearoa resident with time on your
hands, consider yourself lucky. Lend a hand and your heart to the nearest
Cue-Sports Club, and have a game. The fact that you have visited this web site
shows your interest in the sport. Are you one of our future champions?</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial Narrow">Or are you elsewhere on this planet looking in to see what
New Zealand is all about? Well, it is probably a bit like your homeland. Peel
away a few over-zealous politicians, one or two noisy agitators, and you will
find our nation's heart. Soft, warm, welcoming and generous. And yes, you will
find plenty of milk, cheese and wine. Green grass everywhere, snow on mountain
tops and clean water in rivers and lakes. Land filled with four million people
proud and friendly, forty million sheep mostly white, and beautiful,
breathtaking places like nowhere else on this planet.</font></p>
