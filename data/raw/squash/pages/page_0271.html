The concept is to build planting frames 3 foot wide, 5 foot long and 1 foot deep constructed from wood on top of the tough soil. The boxes will be filled with nice topsoil and compost mix. Heavy plastic, creek rock and pave stones will be placed between boxes so we don't get muddy working in the garden. In addition an arbor will be built on each box so viny plants grow up the arbor and keep summer heat off the ground veggies. In addition, heavy 6 mil clear plastic can be mounted on the arbor frame in order to provide a greenhouse environment to tender sprouts early in the growing season. I saw this in practice near Philadelphia and the results were great.</b><P><b><big><big><center>Photos</center></big></big><P>Photo links are listed below.

So I harvested the crop after a few days of rain and they came without too much effort. Our carrots were not thinned very well so I was surprised. With a few 1-3 inch guys I pull a lot of standard sized (8 inch or so) and a few huge (12-15 inch or more) ones. I have more growing from sprinkling a few seeds here and there in lighter populated garden areas. I need to sew some more green onion since Amy uses them for cooking and most of the crop is harvested. I have not seen any more squash forming although the vines want to take over the world. The only canteloupe that sprouted late is about softball size and may not reach ripeness before frost. Several dozen tomatos live in the garden about plum size and will probably get ripe before season end. There are maybe 1/2 dozen cucumbers in various stages of maturity on their vines. And everything else is going to seed or has died out. After completing phase 2 of my landscaping project which involves the garden I am finding that the path along the new vinyl fence is walkable but more narrow than I prefer in places. So I have decided to replace the 6 planting boxes with a single large planting area bordered by landscaping blocks in order make the path along the fence about 8 inches wider. Currently each box is 2.3 foot wide and 5 foot deep for a total planting area of 5x14 feet or 70 square feet. The new area set back from the fence will have a planting area of 4.5x30 feet or 135 square feet because the generous paths between boxes are eliminated and the removal of landscaping timbers and rebar to hold them recovers the 8" border space required for landscaping blocks. Furthermore the new space will be more adaptable to use of the 100 feet of soaker hose and timer I have. It would also be more simple to construct a controlled environment in that kind of planting space. I got that idea from my latest visit to a nursery to place a bulk rock order and was surprised I had not noticed the technology before. It will be explained later should I actually have time to reconstruct my garden.<P><big>2003-08-30:</big><P>This is wierd. This spring I planted seeds from a store bought package labelledcanteloupe. But we have harvested several squash from what sprouted and took over one of the trellises I built. The squash formed from some of the large white flowers that have bloomed all summer long. Recently I noticed a vine with smaller yellow flowers blooming amongst the squash vines. I checked it out closer and found what I think is baby canteloupe and some other real tiny ones starting. Only time will tell if it really is the canteloupe which I intended to plant. Don't get me wrong about the surprise squash because Amy enjoys them so much I am a hero in our house.<P><big>2003-06-30:</big><P>I have heard this is the wettest June ever. We have a few dozen tomatoes between a penny and 2.5 inches in diameter. But none are turning color yet. Corn has sprouted tassels and about 1/2 dozen baby ears have silk flowing out their tops. Quite a few cucumber flowers with baby fruit pushing them out exist. Green onions, green beans, peas, some chinese greens and herbs are being harvested every few days. Garlic is slow growing but the sunflowers are as tall as I am. Carrots look good but not ready yet. Green peppers and Sweet Basil never did sprout nor did the reseeding. Canteloupe vines are climing as tall as me but no sign of fruit yet. Cucumbers are flowering with baby fruit between flower and stem.The Chinese squash is not dying but it just does not seem to want to grow and something is nibbling at it. I still need to finish the 2 arbors I started building. I seeing how they work out before starting to build the remaining 4 arbors. <P><big>2003-06-04:</big><P>We have had many rain days which is good but it makes it hard to get stuff done. The garden is now being fed regular. Leaf mulch now covers the soil. A temporary hose and sprinkler system has been installed until elevated mist sprayers become available at the hardware store. Decorative rock paths have been installed in front of 3 of the 6 garden boxes. I also managed to get the rest of my potted flower plants in the ground. This evening I found that one of my pressure sprayers has a crack in the wand handle and the other has a crack in the brass wand to where it does not retain the spray nozzle. So my bug and weed killer sprayers need to be replaced. This evening I found Home Depot wants $20 each for 2 gallon sprayers and I was happy with my old 1 gallon sprayers. So while there I bought a couple of tree arbor pans and cypress mulch to mulch around a couple of trees instead. I want to look at Sam's, Big Lots and Aldi prices on a rainy evening if they have sprayers to get the best deal. The only gardening tasks left other than routine maintenance are those of mulching a new supply of fall leaves, spraying weed killer on problem lawn areas and building above ground supports for viny plants as they grow. Of course my permanent arbors and seasonal greenhouse panels need to be built as time permits.<P><big>2003-03-22:</big><P>My ambition was greater than my physical condition and desire. I managed to endure the heavy customer traffic at Home Depot to obtain 36 landscape timbers, 3 rolls of clear plastic, 1 roll of black plastic, 54 rebar sections, staple gun, staples, roll of wire fencing and 5lb box of galvanized nails. My truck rode on the axle all the way home and I was so tired from loading and unloading materials I ate lunch while watching the war on TV and fell asleep until dark. <P><big>2003-03-23:</big><P>I went to Home Depot again to get the remaining 54 rebar sections and 30 pave stones. I also had to get tools out of storage. Then I cut the 8' timbers into 3' and 5' sections, took some photos, got boards, rocks and trash out of the garden and then started moving compost out of the garden until dusk at which time tools had to be put away and tarps put over wood and steel materials. <P><big>2003-04-02 thru 2003-04-03:</big><P>Most of the compost was moved out of the garden. Most of the weeds and vegetation were removed from the garden. Short timbers were used along the upper retaining wall to plan the location and spacing of planting box frames and paths. 3 of 6 box frames were constructed using landscape timbers, 2 ft 1/2 inch rebar stakes, and right angle square with bubble level both evenings until after dark.  <P><big>2003-04-07 thru 2003-04-12:</big><P>All compost and vegetation removed from garden space. Grade and build remaining 3 of 6 garden box frames. Fill all 6 garden boxes with 90 cubic feet of topsoil and composted manure. Till and rake garden box contents to mix. Cut and staple 6 mil black plastic between boxes for path underlayment. Lay 1" limestone rock in paths. Place 5 faux brick stepping stones in each path on limestone rock fill around brick stepping stones in paths with creek bed rock. Purchase table saw, fine saw blade, dado blade kit, sawhorse kits, galvenized screws, grommet kit and price lumber for future trellis and greenhouse panel construction. </b><P><!-- End of main info ---><HR WIDTH=85%><CENTER><!-- ** Change this date everytime you update the site ------------><FONT SIZE=2><B>Last Updated: 2003-09-08</B><BR></CENTER></TD><!--- End of Right Column --------------------------------------------------><!--- Do Not Edit Below this line or else! --></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
