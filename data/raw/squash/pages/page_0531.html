Almonds grow on a medium sized tree that is related to the peach, and like the 

peach, the almond tree produces beautiful pink or pinkish-white flowers.&nbsp; 

The almond tree is native to the Mediterranean, but it is now grown commercially 

in other areas of the world, such as California.&nbsp; Almonds have a high 

nutritional ratio to calories when compared to other nuts, but like all nuts, 

they are high in calories.&nbsp; See nutritional chart by clicking on the photo

Nuts</a>)&nbsp; The towering Brazil nut tree was originally discovered growing 

in hard, well-drained land along the Amazon River in South America.&nbsp; The 

Brazil nut tree produces a large round or pear-shaped fruit with an outer skin, 

a hard outer shell, and a core containing twelve to twenty Brazil nuts.&nbsp; 

Brazil nuts are hard to crack open and to retain the whole nuts (as pictured), 

as the nut usually breaks up with the shell.&nbsp; We have found that the best 

way to open Brazil nuts is to place them in the freezer.&nbsp; When frozen, the 

nuts crack open easily, retaining the whole inner nut kernel.&nbsp; See

The cashew tree is relatively small, usually not growing over twenty to thirty 

feet in height.&nbsp; One nut grows on the end of a pear-shaped &quot;apple&quot;.&nbsp; 

The nut is then roasted in its shell to release a toxic substance.&nbsp; It is 

then cracked open and the kernel (edible portion) removed and marketed.&nbsp;

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="4">(<a href="i-chestnuts.html">Chestnuts</a>)&nbsp; 

The chestnut tree is related to the Beech tree and is a native of the 

Northeastern United States.&nbsp; The commercial growing of chestnuts in the 

United States was wiped out by a blight in the early 1900's.&nbsp; Today, most 

of the commercially available chestnuts seem to be imported from Italy.&nbsp; 

The fruit of the chestnut tree is prickly and contains two or three chestnuts; 

the outermost ones are rounded to the outside of the cluster and flattened to 

the inside.&nbsp; Chestnuts that are flat on both sides are the inner nut of a 

&quot;three cluster&quot;.&nbsp; We have found that store purchased chestnuts are 

extremely prone to fungus (mold), especially later in the season.&nbsp; See 

nutritional chart by clicking on the photo or link.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="4">(<a href="i-flaxseed-dark.html">Flaxseed, 

Dark</a>)&nbsp; Flaxseed comes from the same plant from which we get linen.&nbsp; 

The seed is very high in Omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential to good 

health.&nbsp; The Omega-3 in flaxseed has been associated with reducing LDL 

cholesterol, improving immune function, and reducing the risk of blood platelet 

aggregation.&nbsp; The nutritional value of flaxseed is released only if the 

seed is ground or crushed.&nbsp; We cannot digest the whole seed.&nbsp; Flaxseed 

has a pleasant nutty flavor, and crushed seeds can be added to a salad.&nbsp; 

The soluble fiber in flaxseed acts as a thickening and binding agent.&nbsp; We 

add flaxseed to our fruit and vegetable smoothies.&nbsp; Flaxseed should be 

stored in the freezer to preserve its freshness.&nbsp; See the nutritional chart 

by clicking on the photo or link (we could not find any nutritional data that 

distinguished between light and dark flaxseed).</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="4">(<a href="i-hazelnuts.html">Hazelnuts</a>)&nbsp; 

Hazelnuts grow in clusters on a shrub.&nbsp; The nuts are covered with a 

prickly-haired husk, which can easily puncture the skin, but which the squirrels 

seem to be most adept at penetrating.&nbsp; They are often used commercially in 

candy and baked goods.&nbsp; See the nutritional chart by clicking on the photo

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="4">(<a href="i-peanuts.html">Peanuts</a>)&nbsp; 

Peanuts are not really a nut, but an underground growing bean or pea, which led 

to their being called &quot;Goober's peas&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dry roasted peanuts are good 

tasting, a fun food (especially when in the shell) and not a junk food; but they 

are very high in calories because of their high oil content.&nbsp; The 

nutritional chart, which can be seen by clicking on the photo or link, is for 

the shelled nuts.</font></span></p>

Pecan trees are native to the Southern United States and were commercially 

planted as early as the 1600's by the Spaniards.&nbsp; The name comes from an 

Algonquin word for all nuts that have to be cracked open with a stone.&nbsp; We 

use pecans mostly for top decoration of our <a href="ovencakes.html">oven cakes</a> 

( baked pancakes) and <a href="fruitcake.html">fruit cake</a>.&nbsp; We also eat 

the nuts plain.&nbsp; See nutritional chart by clicking on the photo or link.</font></span></p>

'Then God said, &quot;I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth

all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move

on the ground-- everything that has the breath of life in it-- I give every green plant

for food.&quot; And it was so.&nbsp;&nbsp; God saw all that he had made, and it was very

good.' (NIV)&nbsp; Let no animal suffer or die that we may live!&nbsp; (d-<span lang="en-us">7</span>)</p>
