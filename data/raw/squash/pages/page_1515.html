There has been radical change, from the administration of the associations, countries competing, new champions and new events.
					<p><img height="202" width="343" src="../../photos/hugurda1.jpg" align="right">WISPA is the backbone of the women's professional World Tour, formed in 1983 by top ranked players with the objective of creating a professional ranking system and event calendar. Now in 2000, the association has grown into a true worldwide professional tour, with plans to expand further into new countries.</p>

					n 1999, the association completed its first promotional tour aimed at stimulating interest and participation in the Czech Republic. In the new millennium WISPA will build upon this success with similar promotional activity in other developing nations.<p></p>
					<p>The women's game is no longer positioned as a 'warm up' event for the men's tour. WISPA started over 15 years ago with approximately US$100,000 in 1983, but will pass US$600,000 by the turn of the century, and stands on its own merits, providing the shop window for the sport worldwide alongside the men's tour.</p>
					<p>History has shown the future of women's squash is discovered and born at the World Junior Championships. This event has proved to be the stepping stone for talented young players, where many winners have continued on to a<br>
					successful senior career. Presently two young players, Tania Bailey and Nicol David, who having won World Junior championships, are making a rapid rise up the ranks and defeating many seniors established players.</p>
					<p><img height="199" width="207" src="../../photos/seattle/bailey_scheone1.jpg" hspace="15" align="right">Tania Bailey of England burst onto the world scene when she became World Junior champion in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in August 1997. Tania enjoyed a glittering junior career and has lost no time in establishing herself on the WISPA World Tour. In her first senior pro tournament in August 1998, she fought through the qualifying rounds, and only a few months later forced her way into the first round of the Women's World Open in Germany after winning four rounds of qualification. It was in the second round of these World Championships that I played Tania for the first time and

					during a competitive match, showed great confidence and no signs of being intimidated by a higher-ranking player.<p></p>
					<p>Since turning professional in August 1998, Tania won her first WISPA world tour event within 6 months and is now established as a top 16 player with automatic entry into premier world tour events. Greater achievements are<br>
					predicted in the future.</p>

Nicol, the youngest ever winner, swept through the championships without conceding a single game. Nicol made a remarkable achievement by reaching the quarterfinals of the previous world championships as a thirteen-year-old.</p>
					<p>Since winning her title, Nicol has claimed the Asian junior and senior titles, as well as the gold medal in the Asian Games last December and will be eligible to defend her world junior title in 2001.</p>
					<p>These two exciting players, along with many other new talents f

					rom a vast array of squash playing countries, are making the women's game more exciting and competitive than ever before. WISPA will be playing its' part in helping to raise the profile, prestige and prize money of the professional world tour.<p></p>
					<p>It is interesting to observe the new countries that have produced our present day athletes and champions in both the men and women's game. Traditionally the champions, events and competing nations came from the dominating Commonwealth countries. Malaysia and Canada produced our world men's and junior champions in 1998 and 1999, while Egypt has returned to forefront of the sport once again.</p>
					<p>The Melbourne International Festival of squash is bringing the worlds best men, women and masters players together in Australia to compete for the individual titles, men's team event and all the age groups, which will total<br>
					16 titles over 3 weeks in one venue, in October 2001. This exciting initiative is a great investment in our sport and will be a fantastic spectacle. As a Melburnian and member of the festivals organizing committee, I am proud to have been given the opportunity to contribute to what promises to be the greatest squash event ever.</td>
