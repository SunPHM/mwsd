<img src="eylesnicol.jpg" align=right>
<p>As if all that squash in the Winter wasn't enough, there is also a 
thriving Summer League in existence, named after the popular Chippenham
Team player Ed Mainwaring, who was tragically killed in a road accident in 
1998. 
The League is run along broadly the same lines as the Winter League, but with a 
few subtle differences.
<ul>
<li> Fewer teams compete - there are usually about 16 teams, split 
into two Divisionsor sometimes a single division if 12 teams or less are in action.
In the case of two leagues running, the top teams from each Division play off against 
each other at the end of the campaign to establish the overall League winners.
<li> It tends to be a little more light-hearted than the Winter League, 
though a lot of the Big Guns still turn out for the better teams.
<li> There are less matches to play as the fixtures are home <i>or</i> 
away rather than home <i>and</i> away.
<li> Entertainment costs (food, drinks, lap-dancers, etc) are split 
between the teams rather than just being the home team's responsibility.
<li> A match comprises four singles ties and one doubles, meaning that teams 
can turn up with 4, 5 or 6 players.
<li> Bonus points are on offer for teams who play ladies and juniors.
