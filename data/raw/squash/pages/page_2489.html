<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><a name="to Garden in May"></a>May is&nbsp;a
glorious month in the garden. The sudden onset of hot weather followed by a
winter with heavy rains and cold temperatures, has led to the garden abruptly
awakening.&nbsp; It is filled with the sweet scent of orange blossoms and the
riotous color of many of the perennials.&nbsp; The nepeta mussini, lilac bush,
and wisteria are all doing their part. The low growing verbenas and Felicias are
all clamoring for attention.&nbsp;&nbsp; The red climbing roses are coming into
bloom&nbsp; with the periwinkles at their feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">It is a very active month for the
gardener in Greece.
Spring has progressed far enough to require the removal of the dried up leaves of daffodils and
tulips.&nbsp; The weeds have go be kept in check, the greenhouse needs to be
emptied with the tomatoes, zucchini, and decorative squash seedlings planted
out.&nbsp;</font></p>

<img border="2" src="../photographs/garden%20shots/pelargoniums_small.jpg" alt="pelargoniums" align="left" width="100" height="51"></a>The&nbsp;
Ivy-Leaved geraniums, <i>Pelagonium peltatum</i> 'Summer Showers&quot;, which are in a window box are protected
by the house from the drying winds .&nbsp; They are in all their glory now after having been cut back in
February and fertilized in March.&nbsp; I expect them to keep up this display
until August.&nbsp; I will have to look out for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7410.html">
Cottony Cushion Scale</a> which attacks these plants during a hot dry spell.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; My sweet-smelling white <i> Dianthus
alba&nbsp;</i> is
looking great--especially the one which is planted next to the Blue/purple spiked
Salvia farinaceous &quot;Victoria&quot;.&nbsp; The dianthus needs to be
deadheaded once a week to keep up its appearance.&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><a href="../photographs/garden%20shots/verbena.rigida.jpg">

rigida</i>
with its heads of vibrant purple flowers has popped up everywhere.&nbsp; This is
an invasive plant and has to be controlled by having stray plants, along with
their
roots, pulled out every so often.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now I enjoy seeing its new flowers and leaves appear in all the&nbsp;
garden's nooks and crannies. Later on in the season the leaves turn hard and
prickly and the plant will need to be cut back to encourage another period of new growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><i>Lantana
montevidensis</i> is a trailing ground cover with a spread of one meter.&nbsp; It is
planted in raised beds and trails over the stone walls.&nbsp; Two varieties are
present sporting purple or white flowers.&nbsp; This Lantana has been cut back
severely in December and now that it has begun flowering&nbsp; will continue to
do so until it will be cut back&nbsp; again next December. <a href="../photographs/garden%20shots/Lantana%20and%20vine.jpg">
<img border="2" src="../photographs/garden%20shots/Lantana_and_vine_small1.jpg" align="left" alt="Lantana and vine" width="100" height="150"></a> Here it can be seen
next to <i> Trachelospermum jasminoides</i> or &quot;Star
Jasmine&quot; which is </font><font size="4">t</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">he
first vine to flower in the garden. This evergreen twining climber grows over an
arch.&nbsp; The vine is presently covered in fragrant white flower
clusters.&nbsp; Its glossy leaves turn vivid bronze in the winter.&nbsp; It will
need to be pruned after the flowering period which will last well into
June.&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><i>Sisyrinchium
striatum </i>an easy to grow member of the Iridacae family<a href="../photographs/garden%20shots/Sisyrinchium.jpg"><img border="2" src="../photographs/garden%20shots/Sisyrinchium_small.jpg" align="right" alt="Sisyrinchium" width="100" height="159"></a> with Iris-like
foliage and slender stems bearing tall spikes of creamy-yellow flowers&nbsp;
which reach a height of 1-2 feet (30-60cm). It is drought resistant, requiring
no additional water in the summer.&nbsp; In the winter the leaves turn black
and can be left or cut down.</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">The last two perennials
that are are at their prime now are <i> Stachys byzantina </i> and <i> Alyssum
argenteum</i>.&nbsp; A description of both these plants can be found if you follow
the link taking you to <a href="../Medgarden/Evergray-plants.htm">Evergray plants.</a></font><p>
<font size="4">&nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">Many
of the bushes in the garden are beginning&nbsp; to bloom.&nbsp; The flowering maple,
<i>
Abutilon.
x hyridum </i> is a fast growing evergreen open shrub. I have planted it in a raised
bed where its graceful red bells can be seen from below.&nbsp; It can grow to 2 meters
if left unchecked but then the stems have a habit of splitting.&nbsp; I keep it trimmed to one meter, cutting it back after the
flowering season.</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><a href="../photographs/garden%20shots/phildelphus.jpg">
<img border="2" src="../photographs/garden%20shots/phildelphus_small.jpg" alt="phildelphus" align="left" width="100" height="147"></a> 
 <i>Philadelphus coronarius </i>
&quot;the Mock Orange&quot; is a deciduous&nbsp; shrub&nbsp; which blooms this month. It&nbsp;
reaches a height of 2-3 meters, is
native to Southern Europe, and sports white fragrant
flowers. After flowering, several of the older stems will be cut out down to the ground to promote
fresh growth with abundant flowers for next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><i>
<a href="../photographs/garden%20shots/cerastomigma2.jpg">Ceratostigma
willmottianum&nbsp;</a> </i>or &quot;Blue Leadwort&quot; is a deciduous subshrub with &nbsp;gentian blue flowers and
growing to 1 meter.&nbsp; The plant needs to be cut back almost to the ground every February and then comes
back to life in March/April.</font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">When I
look through past photographs, I realize that many plants which I thought would
do well in the garden have in fact disappeared.&nbsp; All of the plants
mentioned above have been in the garden for at least three years and have stood
the test of time.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><span style="background-color: #00FF00">Frost
Damage</span></font><p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4">This winter was very
hard on the garden.&nbsp; The bougainvilleas and jasmines have died leaving only
dead wood in their stead. They have had to be cut back right down to the ground.&nbsp; Only time will tell if they will re-sprout and eventually
re-gain
their former glory.&nbsp; The Polygala have died out completely and will need to
be replaced by other shrubs. This is sad because I had come to depend on their
drought tolerance and long flowering season.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
