<h2>NRDGA</h2>
<p>The Inter-district match between the Northern Rivers, South East Queensland and the Gold Coast saw the Northern Rivers Colts team win their section by the barest of margins. The team of Rhys McGovern (73), Lloyd Kelly (75), Brenton Minshall (76), Robert Penman (77), and Adam Wiseman (79) shot a total of 302, one ahead of the Gold Coast with South East Queensland just one shot further back.</p>

Line and Sinker</h2>
<p><b>with Lindsay Doust - Suffolks Sports Store</b></p>
<h2>Stick to the limits</h2>

<p>A recent letter has asked for the legal lengths of some of the common species that would be taken in our area. A full list of species, lengths and bag limits is available on the Suffolks Sports Store tide charts. Please contact the store if you would like a copy.</p>
<p>The most common lengths, in centimetres, are as follows:</p>
<p>Flathead 36, Bream 25, Whiting 27, Snapper 30, Luderick 25, Mulloway 45, Tailor 30, Mud Crabs 8.5, Blue Swimmers 6. </p>
<p>Be mindful that bag limits also apply to these species.</p>
<p>Early this week, NSW Fisheries announced new regulations concerning the taking of freshwater Crayfish. These rules apply particularly to those of us who live east of the Newell Highway. We will bring you full details as soon as we are able to interpret them correctly but basically it seems to mean that traps cannot be set for these in any waters where there are platypus or turtles. However, as I am writing this, we are yet to obtain full details but the new regulations did start from November 1. If in any doubt, I suggest you contact NSW Fisheries.</p>
<p>Last Sunday it was interesting to be on the water and see the number of people fishing with lures and soft plastics. Fishing habits have changed so much in recent years as tackle has evolved and people are more interested in sport fishing and releasing more than their immediate needs. There seems to be a culture that now associates using artificial lures and flies with the need to conserve our stocks for the future. The other revolution that has occurred is in the development of purpose built boats and motors.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I made mention of the fishing conditions on Fraser Island and that weed had seemingly spoilt good tailor catches. Speaking this week with people who had just returned, the tailors were really good from mid to late October. </p>
<p>Reports I had from last weekend were that the flathead were keenest at about lunchtime, which was as we predicted from the moon and tides. This weekend, for a good bit of estuary fishing for bream, flathead and whiting, be on the water again from about 10.30am to 3.30pm, both Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<h2>Flames debut and Suns under lights</h2>

<p>The North Coast Suns have set up their first Summer Super League home game at their new ground this weekend with a 2-1 victory over South West Queensland in Toowoomba last Saturday night.</p>
<p>The Suns will host Brisbane's Rochedale Rovers at the Italo Stars Barrow Lane ground from 7pm this Saturday night.</p>
<p>The North Coast Flames will make their competition and season debut in the women's competitition at 5pm against the Holiday Coast team from Coffs Harbour. A 3pm game will also be played featuring the North Coast Academy squad against a Rochedale junior outfit.</p>
<p>Stars successfully tendered to host the Summer Super League home games this season on the back of the new lights that have been installed at their ground.</p>
<p>The game against South West Queensland continued the Sun's dominance over teams based in Toowoomba. Last year they recorded two 4-0 victories over the Toowoomba Raiders.</p>
<p>Both teams started with plenty of enthusiasm and created scoring chances, although no goals were forthcoming.</p>
<p>South-West's Nick Posada struck in the 38th minute to put the home team into a short-lived lead. North Coast Suns responded immediately through Adam Bostock in the 39th minute. Four minutes later the promising Bostock struck again to send North Coast to the break leading 2-1.</p>
<p>The second half was competitive and passionate with neither team giving anything away. Plenty of opportunities were there for both sides with North Coast having more of the play but neither side was able to capitalize. </p>
<p>North Coast Suns coach Paul Foster was positive, believing the match to be a good workout for the season ahead and singled out Adam Holmes and Adam Bostock as players who impressed.</p>

<p>Casino has continued its impressive start to the season with a first innings victory over Eastern Districts at Nesbitt Park on Saturday. Chasing Easts first day total of 174 Casino passed the target for the loss of only six wickets. The star for the Casino Cavaliers was captain Adam Shields with 52 runs.</p>
<p>Daniel Cox (82) and Tony Shaw (33) set the foundation for a successful run-chase by Norths-Goonellabah RSL against Tintenbar East Ballina. The coastal team had been dismissed for just 147 the previous week, with Cox and Shaw resuming on Saturday at Oakes Oval with 29 runs already wiped off the target. Josh Hanley chimed in at number 4 with an unbeaten half century to see Norths home.</p>
<p>A judicious declaration by the Ballina Bears created a tense finish at Fripp Oval against Lennox Head. The Bears rolled Lennox for just 115, giving Ballina a 78 run first innings lead. They then declared for just 1-28 in their second innings, giving Lennox Head a target of just 107 for victory. At 4-77 Lennox had a sniff of a rare outright victory. They then lost four quick wickets and the tail shut up shop to avoid defeat. Lennox finished on 8-88.</p>
<p>Brunswick Valley were rolled for just 75 on the first day of their match against Marist Brothers. The Brethren posted 7-230 in replay thanks to some fine middle order batting, including a 61 by Corey Bradley. Playing two batsmen short in the second innings Brunswick were never in the hunt and were dismissed for just 78, giving the outright points to Marist Brothers.</p>
<p>Souths bounced back from their loss to Easts in the first round to knock off Alstonville at Hill Park Oval, Wollongbar. The Southerners extended their overnight score of 7-204 to take their tally to 8-242 at the end of 80 overs. Despite Greg Potters fine 55 from Number three Alstonville were behind the pace all day and eventually succumbed for 208 to give Souths first innings points.</p>

<h2>Bruggy on top of the world</h2>
<p><img src="images/squash_champion.jpg" width="250" height="191" vspace="0" hspace="5" border="2" alt="Ben Bruggy proudly displays his World Championship trophy. " align="right"><i>Ben Bruggy proudly displays his World Championship trophy. </i></p>

<p>Lismore has a new World Champion in Ben Bruggy.</p>
<p>Ben has just returned from Zoetermeer in the Netherlands where he won the World Deaf Squash singles title. Ben also won a team silver medal.</p>
<p>Ben told The Echo that the Dutch were very friendly and put on a great event. Day one saw the teams event decided with Ben running through the day undefeated. Unfortunately they were rolled by England in the final.</p>
<p>The final of the individual event on Sunday saw Ben, 27, playing in his 14th game in two days.</p>
<p>In a 21/2 hour marathon against 17-year-old Brain Rawlinson from England, Ben went to an early two games to one advantage, leading 9-6, 7-9, 9-6. Bruggy was starting to run out of energy and his younger opponent was taking advantage of his 10-year age advantage. Bruggy dropped the fourth set 0-9 and was staring defeat in the face.</p>
<p>At this point Ben drew on his inner reserves and determination to prevail 9-7 to win his first individual world title.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Bruggy had an operation only two months before the championships and could not train until three weeks before going to Holland. In that time he was only able to get in three practice games.</p>
<p>Ben said that he would not have been able to get to the championships, let alone win, without the support of many in the Lismore community. </p>
<p>A trivia night raised over $2,200. Donations were also made by Lismore Council, East Lismore Squash Centre, the Deaf Club, Bob Hoff, Neil Pollard, Nick Vlandis, Hayden Hamshaw and many others.</p>
<p>Ben also wanted to thank Jan and Terry Rigby, Ian Salkeld, Paul Latta, Lismore mayor Merv King, Toby Daley, Paul Corcoran, Sam Bruggy, The Northern Rivers Echo and many others for their support.</p>

" align="right"><i>Lismore's Brad Lofts send a ball through gully on the way to compiling 40 runs as part of a 79-run opening partnership with Rex Parrish. </i></p>


<p>Alstonville's Jake Campbell could be forgiven if he happens to mention this week that he is sick of the sight of South's batsmen Rex Parrish and Brad Lofts.</p>
<p>Between them Parrish and Lofts contributed 71 of Southern Districts 8-242 against Alstonville, setting up Souths 34 runs victory on Saturday. It could have been a lot worse if Campbell had not caught and bowled Lofts for 25. Lofts was looking to be an ominous form at the time.</p>
<p>On Sunday Lofts and Parrish opened the batting for Lismore District Cricket Association (DCA) against Ballina DCA in the second round of the Country Cup knockout competition at Oakes Oval. Chasing Ballina's 172, Parrish was supreme on the day finishing with an unbeaten 92. With Lofts contributing 40 the pair put on an opening partnership of 79 as Lismore cruised to victory by 5 wickets.</p>
<p>Parrish was only denied a century by the small size of the target.</p>
<p>In the other local Country Cup fixture Casino DCA took a stranglehold on their match against Lower Clarence DCA thanks to an outstanding effort by opening bowler Al Nowlan. Nowlan demolished the visitors middle order to finish with 5-36.</p>
<p>Ballina 172 (D Williams 30, D Wright 30, D Wells 3-28, M Robb 3-39) lost to Lismore 5-178 (R Parrish 92no, B Lofts 40, Andrew Gordon 3-24); </p>
<p>Lower Clarence 136 (G Simmons 48, A Nowlan 5-36) lost to Casino 4-140 (M Wood 45, W Sweeney 38, L Many 2-16, M Essex 2-36).</p>

<p>13 of the 700hp &quot;things with wings&quot; are expected for the event with drivers such as Cameron Gessner, last feature winner Ricky Mitchell, Terry Bracken, Ben Wright, Brock Dean&nbsp;and more.</p>
<p>With the lap record set at 10.95 seconds for the 400 metre clay track, the action is sure to be thick and fast.</p>
<p>Ben Wright, driver of the 69 XXXX car (pictured) is looking forward to the night. &quot;These tracks can be so much fun. There is always a big chance of a wreck, but that's part of the thrill I guess.&quot; Recently at Grafton Speedway, Ben excited the big crowd with some very impressive wheelstands from his Chevrolet powered machine.</p>
<p>With the disappointment of the rain interrupted meeting two weeks ago, track manager Greg Coombes&nbsp;is going to add classes over the next 2 meetings to make sure the crowd&nbsp;are treated to plenty of great racing. &quot; We&nbsp;actually have 8 classes racing this Saturday night. The Production Cars were not on the original program, but they will be racing as well as AMCA's, Limited Sedans, Stockers, Streeters 4 Cylinders and Juniors.&nbsp;It will be one of the more hectic nights we've had.&quot;</p>
<p>Gates open&nbsp;at 3pm and racing starts at 6pm.</p>

<h2>Tennis champs may miss nationals</h2>
<p> Lismore High School have taken out the state schools tennis championship, qualifying for the elite National Schools titles to be held in Wagga Wagga from November 28-December 2</p>
<p>The team had to face ten schools in elimination matches across the state over six months to win the state title. The last time a team outside Sydney won the state title was Grafton in 1985.</p>
<p>One of the major hurdles facing the squad is the cost. The quartet of Toby Fielding, Luke Devlin, Luke Edwards and Alex Fielding have unfortunately run down the resources of their families and usual support crew. This is where the local community can step in. The cost to send the team to Wagga Wagga to represent Lismore in the Australian Championships comes to just over $3,600.</p>
<p>For contributions contact the school on 6621 5185.</p>

<p>The competition will cover five different types of.22 Rimfire and Air Rifle target shooting.</p>
<p>Members of the local club regularly compete throughout NSW and Queensland. In turn numerous clubs across both states will be sending competitors for this weekend's championship. </p>
<p>David Gaze, the local 50-metre bench rest champion, will be looking to maintain his deadly gaze this weekend to ensure that a fair share of the silverware stays on the north coast.</p>
