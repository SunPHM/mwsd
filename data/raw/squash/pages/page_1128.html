      <h4>Blueberries</h4>

      <ul>

        <li> 

          <p>Nitrogen uptake and distribution: A graduate student (Pilar Banados) 

            is evaluating the uptake of N15 and (depleted ammonium sulfate -- 

            rate and time of application) on yield, fruit size, and N partitioning 

            in new and mature plantings of &#8216;Bluecrop&#8217;. We are also 

            evaluating the effect of a late N application on growth/yield and 

            how N is stored in the plant. [with T. Righetti]</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>Early cropping: In &#8216;Bluecrop&#8217; we found that plants cropped 

            in 1994 and 1995 had a significantly higher yield/plant than those 

            in which blossoms were removed with early-cropped plants producing 

            14% and 21% greater yield at the 1.5' and 4' spacing, respectively. 

            This &#8220;surprise&#8221; led us to establish a new planting in 

            1999 to look at the effect of early cropping (no blossom removal the 

            first two years) on subsequent yield of &#8216;Duke&#8217;, &#8216;Elliott&#8217;, 

            and &#8216;Bluecrop&#8217; at 1.5' and 4' spacing. Early cropping 

            (year one and two after planting) reduced the dry weight of all plant 

            parts in February, 2002 in all cultivars. In year 3 (blossom removed 

            treatments cropped for the first time), total yield per plot, picking 

            efficiency and berry weight were significantly affected by cultivar, 

            in-row spacing, and early cropping. Early cropping reduced yield in 

            year three (2002) by 18% in &#8216;Bluecrop&#8217;, 26% in &#8216;Duke&#8217;, 

            and 54% in &#8216;Elliott&#8217;. Yield was much higher at 1.5&#8217; 

            in-row spacing than at 4&#8217; spacing. This study is still in progress. 

            <br>

            We are also evaluating the effect of cultivar and in-row spacing on 

            populations of mycorrhizae [with W. Yang and C. Scagel] <br>

          </p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p> In-row spacing and trellising on machine-harvested yield of Bluecrop: 

            This eight-year study has just been completed. Cumulative yield (1996-01) 

            was 106% higher at the 1.5' spacing (41 tons/a) and 46% greater (29 

            tons/a) at the 3&#8217; spacing than the 4' spacing (20 tons/a). In-row 

            spacing had no effect on percent of total yield lost on the ground 

            during machine harvest. Losses to machine harvest in un-trellised 

            plots averaged 12 to 24% of total yield. Trellising improved machine 

            harvest efficiency by as much as 7.8% of total yield. Pruning has 

            taken as much as 98% longer at the high density.</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>Pruning of blueberries: We studied pruning method/severity in mature 

            &#8216;Bluecrop&#8217; and &#8216;Berkeley&#8217;: 1) &#8220;conventional&#8221; 

            pruning with removal of unproductive canes, thinning of one-year-old 

            shoots at the base of the bush, and removal of any unproductive wood 

            or thinning of excessive fruiting wood near the top of the bush, as 

            required; 2) &#8220;speed&#8221; pruning involving removal of one 

            or two of the most unproductive canes at the base of the bush; and 

            3) &#8220;un-pruned&#8221; where no pruning was done for 5 years. 

            Un-pruned plants had greater yield than conventionally pruned plants 

            while speed pruning resulted in intermediate yields. Un-pruned and 

            speed-pruned plants produced berries that were 19 to 27% smaller than 

            conventionally pruned plants. The harvest season of un-pruned plants 

            began 3 to 5 days later and lasted a week longer than that of conventionally 

            pruned plants. The harvest efficiency of un-pruned plants was reduced 

            as much as 51% in the later years of this study and was most closely 

            correlated with berry weight. Conventionally pruned plants had a significantly 

            higher percentage of the above-ground dry weight allocated to one-year-old 

            wood and crown than un-pruned plants. Strik, B., G. Buller, and E.

          <h4>Aronia</h4>

        </li>

        <li>Cultivar evaluation: Evaluated Aronia melanocarpa ( &#8216;Albigowa&#8217;, 

          &#8216;Darbrowice&#8217;, &#8216;Egerta&#8217;, &#8216;Kutno&#8217;, 

          &#8216;Nero&#8217;, and &#8216;Nowa Wies&#8217;) planted in 1997. Yield 

          in 1999 ranged from 4.4 to 12.4 kg/plant with 'Nero' having highest 

          yield. Plants were pruned for the first time in winter 2000/01. In 2001, 

          'Nero' produced the highest yield (24.1 kg/plant ) and 'Egerta' the 

          lowest (13.1 kg/plant ). Berries were 2.0 to 2.8 g. Strik, Finn, and

      <h4>Blackberries</h4>

      <ul>

        <li>Alternative production systems in Marion: We are looking at various 

          combinations of in-row spacing and primocane management to improve yield, 

          cold hardiness, reduce thorn contamination, and potentially facilitate 

          machine training in the &#8220;off year&#8221;. 

          <p>Minimizing thorn contamination in machine-harvested Marion: Work 

            is on-going to try to minimize risk of thorn contamination in machine 

            harvested &#8216;Marion&#8217; blackberry fruit by using a standard 

            machine harvester in February to remove debris or a machine equipped 

            with brushes. A machine harvester followed by brushing in February 

            reduced thorny petioles/plot by 66% compared to an untreated control 

            without adverse effect on yield. Strik and Buller, 200_. Reducing 

            Thorn Contamination in Machine Harvested &#8216;Marion&#8217; Blackberry. 

            Acta Hort. (in press)</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>No prune system in Marion: Training primocanes of &#8216;Marion&#8217; 

            over dead floricanes (without removing/cutting off dead canes) may 

            improve yield -- however, results have been inconsistent. This training 

            system should not be machine harvested as it increases thorn content 

            in harvested fruit. Training primocanes over dead floricanes has increased 

            incidence of cane disease.[with J. Fisher and W. MaHaffee].</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>Raspberry Bushy Dwarf Virus: (RBDV) was discovered in &#8216;Marion&#8217; 

            blackberry at the NWREC. RBDV had no effect on cane growth or fruit 

            number, but reduced yield (40 to 50%), fruit weight (23 to 40%), and 

            drupelet number per fruit (36 to 39%) compared to uninfected plants. 

            In 2000, we surveyed 32 commercial fields to test for the presence 

            of RBDV using ELISA. Three grower fields tested positive for RBDV.

            on &#8216;Marion&#8217; Blackberry. Plant Disease (in press). We are 

            also evaluating the incidence of RBDV in other blackberry genotypes 

            [with R. Martin and C. Finn].</p>

      <h4 align="left">Raspberries:</h4>

      <ul>

        <li>Nitrogen uptake and distribution: A graduate student (Hannah Rempel) 

          is evaluating the uptake of N15 (ammonium sulfate -- rate and time of 

          application) on yield, fruit size, and N partitioning in red raspberry, 

          &#8216;Meeker&#8217;. [with T. Righetti]</li>

      </ul>

      <p align="center"><small><a href="#top">(Top of Page)</a></small><br>

      </p>

      <h4>Strawberries</h4>

      <ul>

        <li> 

          <p>Pre-plant options in strawberry: We are looking at various pre-plant 

            options for strawberry: fallow; meadowfoam grown until bloom and incorporated; 

            meadowfoam grown until seed set and incorporated; and peas grown for 

            an early crop. We are looking at impact on plant growth, yield and 

            various pests. No yield or pest effects were found in the first fruiting 

            season of &#8216;Totem&#8217;. Work in progress [with D. Hemphill]</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>Nitrogen management in &#8216;Totem&#8217;: We just finished studying 

            the uptake, remobilization and storage of nitrogen using N15. Treatments 

            included foliar applications of urea-N15 at various stages of development 

            of &#8216;Totem&#8217; and granular fertilizer (Ammonium nitrate-N15) 

            applied in spring or at renovation. Treatments were imposed in 1999. 

            We also repeated some labeled treatments in 2000 to compare uptake 

            to an unfertilized control. [with T. Righetti]</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>Deblossoming &#8216;Totem&#8217; in the planting year had no significant 

            effect on yield, berry weight, or plant yield and vegetative components 

            in the first and second fruiting seasons. Late planting of &#8216;Totem&#8217; 

            (on flat ground) decreased yield in the first fruiting season, but 

            not the second fruiting season. Berry weight was greater with later 

            planting dates in both fruiting seasons. Production system had no 

            effect on yield. </p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>Annual production systems: Late planting in annual systems increased 

            populations of the two?spotted mite (Tetranychus urticae) the following 

            spring. Populations then dropped due to suppression by the predatory 

            mite, Neoseiulus fallacis. Late planting of &#8216;Totem&#8217; on 

            raised beds did not reduce yield the following season. Second year 

            perennial plots of &#8216;Totem&#8217; had a higher yield than all 

            annual treatments except those plots fumigated and planted in August 

            of 1997. Data comparing annual plots to a third year perennial were 

            collected in 1999; an economic analysis is planned [with R. Rosetta].

        at the base of the sidewall (0% water storage), drainholes raised on the 

        sidewall to provide 20% water storage (based on a water-filled pot), or 

        drainholes raised on the sidewall to provide 40% water storage. The experiment 

        was a 3 irrigation frequency X 3 container design factorial treatment 

        arrangement within a randomized complete block design using 10 representative 

        plants of each species within each of three replicate blocks. The largest 

        'Hetzii' holly, 'Hino Crimson' azalea and 'Claridge Druce' geraniums were 

        grown using high-frequency irrigation with 0% water storage or using medium-frequency 

        irrigation with 20% water storage. Geranium shoot weight was significantly 

        less only when grown using low-frequency irrigation in containers with 

        0% water storage, or when grown using high-frequency irrigation in containers 

        with 40% water storage. Of the three species tested, only 'Hetzii' holly 

        grew roots below the level of the raised drainholes, with these roots 

        exhibiting thickened, enlarged diameters. No increased incidence of root 

        disease was observed during the study. Potential advantages and disadvantages 

        of production using containers with raised-drainholes are discussed.</p>

      <h4>Retractable Roof Systems Improve Cold Protection of Nursery Crops</h4>

      <p>When retractable roof structures operated with &quot;cold trapping&quot; 

        were used for unheated cold protection of container grown nursery crops, 

        plants required fewer irrigation applications and fewer pesticide applications. 

        Rhododendron flowering was delayed about 4 weeks in the retractable roof 

        structure, providing an opportunity to ship blooming plants at a later 

        date. Based on delayed initiation of vegetative growth, crops grown in 

        the retractable roof structure maintained cold hardiness for a longer 

        period of time. Crops grown in the seasonally-covered Quonset structure 

        were susceptible to frost damage before Nov. 1, and after Feb. 16 and 

        suffered some damage, while crops grown in the retractable roof structure 

        were always protected from extreme temperatures and had no frost damage.</p>

      <h4>Retractable Roof Systems Reduce Soil Temperatures in Containers</h4>

      <p>Ornamental crops were established under 0, 30, 47 or 63% stationary black-polypropylene 

        shading, under 50% white-poly retractable shading, or under 30% black-polypropylene 

        shading placed below the 50% white-poly retractable shading. Plants arranged 

        under each shading system in a completely randomized design with a minimum 

        of three replicate shading blocks for each shading treatment, and a minimum 

        of five plants within each block. Substrate temperatures were recorded 

        in 1-gal containers planted with <em>Picea</em> 'Conica'. The southwest 

        (SW) region of individual containers was the hottest in mid-afternoon. 

        Substrate temperatures were lowest under retractable shading. Observation 

        of the SW region of the root ball revealed no root death under retractable 

        shading. Of the 12 taxa studied, three showed increased shoot dry weights 

        when grown under retractable shading. The cooler substrate temperatures, 

        and maintenance of a healthy root system under retractable shading may 

        help explain the increased growth, reduced plant &quot;losses,&quot; and 

        reduced incidence of root rot diseases of some plants when produced under 

        retractable shading facilities.</p>

      <h4>Liverwort Control Studies</h4>

      <p>A series of experiments were performed to study how irrigation practices 

        interact with other cultural procedures to influence liverwort development. 

        Liverwort infestation increased as irrigation and N fertilization increased. 

        The combination of hazelnut shell mulch and the herbicide oxadiazon provided 

        good suppression of liverworts for up to 12 weeks using low frequency 

        irrigation application. In general, reducing irrigation frequency enhances 

        the liverwort suppression of mulches, herbicides and fertilizers. The 

        data supports speculation that the recent increase in liverwort infestations 

        in Oregon nurseries is related to the increased rainfall in the region 

        over the past few years. High frequency irrigation increased liverwort 

        coverage of the surface of the growing substrate.</p>

      <p>Increasing the amount N from a 20N-9P-17K fertilizer increased liverwort 

        coverage, with nitrogen levels from 100 to 200 mg/liter (ppm) supporting 

        the most coverage.</p>

      <p>Hazelnut shells, oyster shells and copper-treated geotextile disc provided 

        good suppression of liverwort growth for up to 6 weeks. Coarse sand, perlite, 

        pumice and untreated geotextile discs suppressed liverwort growth under 

        low frequency irrigation, but not under high frequency irrigation. Liverworts 

        grew on the substrate surface below the untreated geotextile discs.</p>

      <p>Surface-applied microelement fertilizers and surface applied preemergent 

        herbicides suppressed liverwort growth with low-frequency irrigation. 

        However, high frequency irrigation eliminated or reduced the effectiveness 

        of these treatments. The combination of hazelnut shells and oxadiazon 

        provided good suppression of liverwort growth for up to 12 weeks with 

        low frequency irrigation, and the combinations of hazelnut shells or pumice 

        with oxadiazon provided suppression for 8 weeks with high frequency irrigation. 

        Liverwort growth appears to be optimized by high frequency irrigation 

        and nitrogen rates between 100 and 200 mg/liter (ppm). irrigation frequency 

        enhances the suppression of liverworts by mulches, surface-applied fertilizers 

        or preemergent herbicides, whereas high frequency irrigation allows liverwort 

        to avoid suppression. The best treatment for liverwort suppression in 

        this study was a combination of low frequency irrigation, a hazelnut shell 

        mulch, and the application of oxadiazon at label rates.</p>

      <h4>Root Weevil Controls (with Robin Rosetta as Co-PI)</h4>

      <p>For <em>Thuja</em>, no treatment influenced adult root weevil mortality 

        until three days after application. Cryolite had the highest percentages 

        of dead or moribund adult weevils three days after application. Eight 

        days after application, Pinpoint and Cryolite had killed more weevils 

        compared to Topcide or the untreated controls.</p>

      <p>For <em>Rhododendron</em> one day after application, the percentage of 

        dead adult weevils was higher for Cryolite and Gowan 1885 compared to 

        all other treatments. Seven days after application, Cryolite, Gowan 1885 

        and the Pinpoint treatments had higher percentages of dead weevils compared 

        to the Topcide treatments or the untreated controls.</p>

      <p>Soil-applied insecticides provide a useful alternative to foliar cover 

        sprays for adult root weevil control. Cryolite, Gowan 1885, and Pinpoint 

        15G (high rate) had the highest mortality (70% to 79%) compared to untreated 

        or Topcide-treated plants. Pinpoint 15G and both sodium aluminofluoride 

        bait treatments may provide an effective, viable option for adult root 

        weevil control when pesticides cannot be applied in the evening, or when 

        foliar cover sprays may harm nontarget organisms.</p>

      <h4>Controlling Weeds and Rooting-Out in Sandbed Subirrigation Systems (with 

        Dr. Robert L. Ticknor, emeritus, and Dr. Dave Adams, emeritus, as CO-PI's)</h4>

      <p>Both Surflan and Snapshot provided good control of fireweed growth on 

        the surface of the sandbed. <em>Daphne</em> shoots were shorter when grown 

        on SnapShot-treated sandbed plots, but shoot weight was not influenced 

        by herbicides. Both Surflan and Snapshot completely prevented rooting-out. 

        Using a low water level in the sandbed reduced the number of fireweeds 

        by about one third. Use of treated or untreated weed barriers significantly 

        reduced fireweed growth at both low and high water levels, with the copper-treated 

        barrier improving weed control in the high water level treatment. Compared 

        to all other treatments, <em>Forsythia</em> shoot size was smaller when 

        grown on copper-treated barriers in the low water level plots. <em>Erica</em> 

        shoots were larger when grown on barriers in the high water level plots. 

        While rooting-out of Erica was eliminated by placing treated or untreated 

        weed barriers on the sandbed surface, rooting-out of <em>Forsythia</em> 

        was controlled only by copper-treated barriers). Richards (1975) suggested 

        that the water level in the sandbed could be regulated to prevent rooting-out. 

        In this study, both <em>Forsythia</em> and <em>Erica</em> rooted-out on 

        uncovered plots when the water level was at the surface of the sandbed, 

        or when the water level was two inches below the sandbed. When sandbed 

        subirrigation is an acceptable option for nursery production, weed growth 

        and rooting-out can be reduced or eliminated using either herbicide treatments 

        or weed barriers placed on the sandbed surface. Since herbicides may not 

        be labelled for this type of use, weed barriers are currently the best 

        available option. Weed barrier pretreated with copper is presently available 

        (Texel Industries, Spartanburg, SC), but the copper treatment may not 

        be needed to control rooting-out for all crops.</p>

      <ul>

        <li> 

          <p>Green bean yield was highest at 90 kg N/ha. At this rate, residual 

            nitrate-N in the surface 30 cm of soil at the end of the growing season 

            was 33 kg/ha, compared to 24 kg/ha for unfertilized soil.</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>In 1995, yield of sweet corn was highest at 265 kg applied N/ha, 

            but yields with as little as 135 kg N/ha were not significantly lower. 

            Yield of sweet corn did not respond to sidedressed N when the pre-sidedress 

            soil nitrate concentration exceeded 30 ppm. Application of up to 135 

            kg N/ha to sweet corn did not significantly increase residual nitrate-N 

            in the surface 30 cm of soil. At the recommended N rate of 200 kg/ha, 

            residual nitrate was 50 kg/ha, compared to 3 kg/ha at planting. Results 

            were similar in 1996, but the highest yield was at 180 kg N/ha.</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>On-farm research on the relationship of sweet corn yield to pre-sidedress 

            soil nitrate levels indicated that very few growers will be able to 

            skip a mid-season sidedressing of N. However, at 9 of 16 sites in 

            1995 and 8 of 12 sites in 1996, a 33% reduction in sidedress N application 

            did not reduce yield significantly. In 1997, the PSNT successfully 

            predicted the need for additional N application in 9 of 10 grower 

            fields. Results from 1995 through 1998 resulted in a modification 

            of the PSNT in which sweet corn yield is optimized when the total 

            of sidedressed fertilizer N plus soil N equals 175 lb/acre.</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>A survey of 34 grower fields indicated that residual soil nitrate 

            was highest with sweet corn and beans, intermediate with broccoli 

            and cauliflower, and lowest with beets and carrots. The highest rates 

            of N were applied to the broccoli and cauliflower.</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>A winter cover crop of either cereal rye, triticale, or triticale 

            plus common vetch, reduced the <a href="nleach.html">amount of nitrate 

            leached</a> below the root zone nearly 50% compared to a winter fallow, 

            as measured by passive capillary samplers. This effect has been consistent 

            for eight of the last nine winters.</p>

        </li>

        <li> 

          <p>A winter cover crop of red clover increased yield of a subsequent 

            sweet corn crop in 1996 when fertilizer N was reduced. The N contribution 

            of the clover crop was about 50 lb/acre. Sweet corn yield was reduced 

            slightly following a triticale cover crop compared to winter fallow. 

            In 1997, broccoli yield, when averaged over rates of applied N, increased 

            following a cover crop of relay-interplanted red clover or fall-planted 

            triticale plus winter pea. A triticale cover crop reduced subsequent 

            broccoli yield.</p>

        <li> 

          <p>In 1998 and 1999 trials of the effects of between-row spacing and 

            N rate on three varieties of edamame (vegetable soybean), 'Shironomai' 

            outyielded 'White Lion' and 'Butterbeans'. Highest yields were with 

            the high rate of N (120 kg/ha) and 0.5-meter rather than 0.75-m spacing.</p>

          <p>Incidence of white mold (<em>Sclerotinium</em>) and grey mold (<em>Botrytis</em>) 

            tended to increase when snapbeans were planted through a triticale
