<i>Billy Christian (right) scored the tying and winning goals when the U.S defeated Russia, 3-2, in the pivotal game of the 1960 Olympics. Roger Christian (#9 at left) and Tommy Williams were his wings. Bobby Owen (#5) joined the celebration on this winning goal.</i>
</center>

<p>The final trials for the 1960 U.S. Olympic team were held at the West Point Military Academy in December 1959. From the 40 players who had made it through the previous cuts, 20 from the east and 20 from the west, a squad of 22 was selected by Oympic Coach Jack Riley, who was the coach of West Point. </p>

<p>Bill and Roger Christian were among the 22.</p>

<p>That team, whose make-up would keep changing right up until the start of the Olympics, wasn't considered to have much of a chance. It was rated a decided underdog to at least three other teams — the defending champion Russians, the world champion Canadians and the experienced Czechs. </p>

<p>By comparison, the U. S. team was considered a team of "pick-ups." But something happened between Jan. 1 and the start of the Olympic games on Feb. 16 at Squaw Valley, Calif. </p>

<p>Jack McCartan, St. Paul, a goalie from the University of Minnesota who would eventually play a huge role for the team, was among those sent home during the early trials. </p>

<p>"(Coach) Riley had cut McCartan when we were still in Minneapolis. It's kind of a funny story now," Bill says. "McCartan had expected to make the team, so when he noticed his name on one of the two lists that had been posted, he assumed it was a list of those who had made the team. Actually, it was a list of those who had been cut. He told us later that he had said to himself as he read down the list of players who he thought had been cut, 'Gee, they cut some pretty good hockey players here.' Come to find out, that list was really the one that named the players who had made the team, and the one Jack was on was the cut list."</p>

<p>Bill and Roger were among those who later recommended bringing McCartan back to the team. "In a given practice," Roger says, "we would put 30 to 40 goals past the goaltenders. We weren't going to win any Olympic medals that way."</p>

<p>Bill centered one line with Roger on his left wing and Tommy Williams from Duluth on right wing. "It was kind of funny," Bill says. "I had Roger on one side saying everything always went to the right, and Tommy was saying I only played with my brother."</p>

<p>In the preliminary round, the U.S. needed only to win one of the two games (against the Czechoslovakia and Australia) to advance to the Medal Round. Against the Czechs, the U.S. won 7-5. Then it was no contest in a 12-1 U.S. win over Australia. </p>

<p>In the first game of the Medal Round, Roger scored the hat-trick as the U.S. posted a 6-3 win over Sweden. Against Germany in the second game, the U.S. was a 9-1 winner.</p>

<p>"In that game," Bill jokes, "Tommy Williams was mad at the manager. He was going to sit out the game because he thought the manager hadn't gotten tickets for his mother and dad. Finally, before he would get dressed, the manager had to take Tommy up in the stands and show him where his mom and dad were sitting."</p>

<p>"The pivotal win," according to Coach Riley's report in the 1960 Olympic Winter Games book, "was the 2-1 conquest of Canada. The Canadians were, as usual, big, strong, fast and rough. Beating them gave impetus to our cause, instilled new confidence in the squad and set the stage for the sterling 3-2 victory over Russia. The win over Russia was historic in that it was the first for a U.S. hockey team over the Soviets." </p>

<p>The crowds in Blyth Arena grew with each game. It was a standing-room-only crowd of 8,500 for the U.S. vs. Canada game. Then 10,000 jammed their way in when the U.S. and Russia played. The Olympic Games Book reporter offered this description of Bill Christian's two-goal effort in the 3-2 win over the Russians:</p>

<p>"Midway through the second period, Billy Christian, the smallest player on the squad, grabbed a pass from this brother, Roger, swooped down the left side and fired the puck past the incoming goalie for the tying score. </p>

<p>"The 5-foot-9, 145-pound Billy Christian foiled the acrobatic Puchkov again at 14:59 of the last period. Getting the puck on a play set up by his brother, Roger, and Williams, Billy outsmarted Puchkov when the goalie came out to cut down the angle of the shot. The puck went in and the USA players and jubilant crowd jumped for joy. That was it as McCartan and the stalwart defensemen fought off the Russians the rest of the way."</p>

<p>Against the Czechs in a game at 8 a.m. the next day, a U.S. loss plus a Canadian win against Russia might have meant that the gold medal could go to the Canadians on a goal-spread basis. With the Americans trailing 4-3 after two periods, Russian captain and defenseman Nikolai Sologubov, who knew many of the U.S. players, went into their dressing room to suggest that they "take a few whiffs of oxygen to restore their pep," the Olympic book notes. "A great fuss was made over this friendly overture at the time. Some players did take the oxygen and some did not, but the gesture did light a fire."</p>

<p>The Olympic  book continues: "'It was that gold medal that spurred us on,' said Roger Christian, the hero of the hour in the great six-goal, last period comeback. Roger, a 5-foot-11, 180-pounder, fired the tying marker at 5:59 of the final period on a pass from Billy.</p>

<p>"Then, Bob Cleary went to work. He converted a pass from (John) Mayasich at 7:40 for what proved to be the winner. Within four minutes, he (Roger Christian) put the icing on the cake by scoring a power play with brother Billy and (Jack) Kirrane.</p>

<p>"There was no holding the inspired team now. Roger Christian and Billy Cleary racked up goals within a 38-second period and then Roger closed out the scoring at 17:56 on a pass from brother Bill."</p>

<p>The Cleary brothers, Rob and Bill, and the Christian brothers finished 1-4 in individual scoring as the Americans posted a perfect 5-0 record.</p>

<p>Riley's report for the Olympic book singled out the play of McCartan, who "was virtually unbeatable in goal." And, it continued, "John Mayasich was a potent factor defensively and his slapshot was a menace to most goalies. Billy and Bob Cleary of Boston, and Roger and Billy Christian of Warroad, Minn., were not only the leading scorers, but also contributed memorable clutch performances."</p>

<p>About the Christian  brothers in particular, Riley had very high praise:</p>

<p>"Roger Christian's four-goal effort in the climactic game with the Czechs is one of the most memorable feats in Olympic annals. The United States trailed, 4-3, after two periods when Roger came to the rescue with a hat-trick in the final period.</p>

<p>"Bill Christian's two goals against the Russians undoubtedly will be recalled as one of the most brilliant individual efforts ever by an American in Olympic competition."</p>
