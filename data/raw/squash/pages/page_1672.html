              officers with the Atlanta chapter of the National Black MBA
              Association and were working in senior marketing and sales
              positions,” Brooks explains. “We both had large sets of
              contacts around the country. And, both of us were heavily involved
              in community service.”</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brooks says it was
              not unusual for an acquaintance working in human resources to
              e-mail them job descriptions to circulate. “The HR person would
              get a lot of good resumés and end up hiring someone,” says
              Brooks, who received his MBA in marketing from the Smith School in
              1992.&nbsp;<o:p>

              Smith School. Before then, the University of Pittsburgh electrical

<p><font color="#333399" face="Geneva,Arial,Helvetica" size="4"><a name="1"></a>A
Business Graduate Changes Course</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Linda Fitzgerald</b> has spent her career in
international business. But, last year, when she had the opportunity to join the
John S. and James L. Knight Foundation as deputy director of its Community
Partners Program, the Smith School alumna followed her convictions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The leap from international business
development services to a community-based program at a large U.S. foundation was
not a strictly logical one,&quot; Fitzgerald admits. However, she says, &quot;I
wanted to work closer to the decision-making end of supporting social
programs.&quot; The Community Partners Program oversees long-term investments in
the vitality of 26 communities throughout the United States. Fitzgerald is
involved in administration of the program, including budgeting and grant
monitoring.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As an undergraduate at George Washington
University, Fitzgerald majored in French and Spanish with dreams of working for
the United Nations. But, she says, she soon realized she had chosen &quot;a
less-than-practical route that might prevent me from ever supporting
myself.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Fitzgerald switched her major to economics, and
after graduation, came to the Smith School to study international business as an
MBA student. &quot;I was fascinated by the challenges of conducting business
across cultural, linguistic, and geographical barriers,&quot; she says.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After receiving her MBA in 1986, Fitzgerald
became director of operations for a start-up company developing business
opportunities for U.S. firms in what was then Yugoslavia. She later moved into
international economic development, working in the Brazilian subsidiary of an
American consulting firm. The firm was interested in studying best practices in
the use of vouchers as a tool for building sustainable business development
services for microentrepreneurs. Fitzgerald visited training programs from
Cordoba, Argentina, to the Cape Verde Islands, and even interviewed
microentrepreneurs in a Bolivian jail outside Cochabamba.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Upon returning to the United States, Fitzgerald

Homecoming Tailgate Party</font></p>
<p><img border="1" src="images/homecoming2.jpg" alt="Homecoming" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="183">The
calendar said November 1, but the weather felt more like September as the Smith
School welcomed alumni from all over the country to Ludwig Field for the annual
Homecoming Festival and Tailgate Party. Alumni mingled with current students,
faculty, and Smith School friends while enjoying exceptional tailgate fare
provided by Chuck Corcoran '81 of Corcoran Caterers. As young guests played with
balloons and maracas, their parents were reunited with friends from their
college days. The fun did not end there, as many alumni headed over to Byrd
Stadium to watch the Maryland Terps squash the North Carolina Tar Heels, 59-21,
with tickets to the game compliments of the Smith School Alumni Chapter. It was
a great day all around.</p>
<p><img border="1" src="images/homecoming1.jpg" alt="Homecoming" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="200" height="134">Homecoming
is a great way to introduce kids to Terp traditions <i>(above)</i>.</p>

Cancels 2003 Tournament but not Alumni Spirit</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><img border="1" src="images/golf1.jpg" alt="Golf" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="200" height="157">After
Hurricane Isabel wiped out the 14th Annual Robert H. Smith School of Business
Alumni Chapter Golf Tournament September 18, 32 teams of golfers were looking
forward to the November 6 rain date. As luck would have it, a tornado swept
through the area the day before, and overnight storms had golfers bracing
themselves for a wet day on the links.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Joe Scolaro '85, of Santos, Postal &amp;
Company, watched the sky all morning: After playing in 12 consecutive Smith
alumni golf tournaments, Scolaro wasn't about to sit this one out. But heavy
morning rains forced the superintendent of the University of Maryland Golf
Course to call off the tournament before the scheduled noon start.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The rain failed to dampen the enthusiasm of most
of the Smith School teams, however, as more than 100 golfers showed up in
November ready to play under any conditions. Although the golf portion of the
event was cancelled, the day was not a total washout. Golfers enjoyed a gourmet
lunch courtesy of Chuck Corcoran '81 of Corcoran Caterers, and participated in a
raffle and silent auction to support alumni programs and scholarships. The
auction topped last year's effort, raising nearly $5,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><img border="1" src="images/golf2.jpg" alt="Golf" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="250" height="135">Golfers
joined Golf Tournament Committee Chair Ted Rose '89, MBA '93, in the clubhouse,
taking advantage of the opportunity to network with Smith alumni and corporate
partners. Every golfer received a certificate to play the University of Maryland
Golf Course at a later date, or at the &quot;Smith Day on the Links,&quot;
scheduled for Wednesday, May 26, 2004. All team members also received tee gifts,
which included the new &quot;Fear the Turtle&quot; golf umbrella-a handy item,
given the day's wet conditions.</font></p>

Program Kicks Off the Academic Year</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><img border="1" src="images/mentor1.jpg" alt="Mentor" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="200" height="142">On
Saturday, October 11, 2003, more than 200 Smith alumni mentors and MBA
protégés met for the first time in Van Munching Hall's Grand Atrium. The
kick-off coincided with the Maryland vs. Duke football game and served as an
opportunity for the students to network with the business professionals who will
serve as their mentors in the 2003-04 academic year. Mentors interact regularly
with their cluster of protégés, sharing their insight into particular
industries and career fields. <i>Pictured, Mentor Richard Greenberg (l), MBA
'89, learns more about one of his new protégés, first-year MBA student Michael
Grenier.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The evening began with an introduction by Smith
School Director of Alumni Affairs Francena Phillips Jackson. Jackson described
the Mentor Program as &quot;an opportunity to build contacts within the Smith
community while sharing information that benefits the alumni and the
protégés.&quot; MBA Alumni Committee Chairperson Kelly Nelson, MBA '99,
introduced the members of her committee: Ricardo Benn '94, MBA '99; Landon
Johnson, MBA '99; Jodi Sweed, MBA '02; and Theresa Brown-Shute '95, MBA '02.
They described the mentoring process and offered insight into what protégés
could expect to gain from the experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><img border="1" src="images/mentor2.jpg" alt="Mentor" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="200" height="146">The
advice was welcomed by first-year MBAs such as Yan Ji (Estella) Rong, a member
of Cluster 23, Marketing. &quot;I'm expecting to have someone with experience
share advice and knowledge to help me with my career development,&quot;
explained Rong.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is the second year as a protégé for
Geoffrey Pickett, a member of Cluster 7, Corporate Finance, who will graduate in
May 2004. Pickett said, &quot; I like the new structure this year of larger
clusters and small groups within each cluster.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The mentors and protégés feasted at a tailgate
barbecue by Corcoran Caterers. Everyone received a Smith School water bottle and
maracas to take to the football game. For some, the party continued for the rest
of the afternoon at Byrd Stadium, as they had many reasons to shake their
maracas during the Terps' bedeviling of Duke, 33-21.</font></p>
