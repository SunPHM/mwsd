<p>Cucumber beetles are a major problem for vegetable gardeners because they damage foliage and spread bacterial wilt disease to cucumber, squash and muskmelon plants.  However, many gardeners don't realize that they also feed on fruits, producing a rasping and gouging type of injury.</p>

The <strong><A HREF="../graphics/large/striped_cuke_beetle_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalA', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalA">striped cucumber beetle</a> </strong>is a common and damaging pest of cucumbers, <A HREF="../graphics/large/striped_cuke_beetles_lopes_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalB', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalB">melons</a>, <A HREF="../graphics/large/cuke_beetle_squash_fruit_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalC', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalC">squash</a>, pumpkins and corn.    It will also feed on beets, cabbage, eggplant, pea, potato, asparagus, and tomato.  The adult beetles chew holes in <A HREF="../graphics/large/cuke_feeding_leaves_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalD', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalD">leaves</a>, flowers and <A HREF="../graphics/large/cuke_beetle_cuke_fruit_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalE', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalE">fruits</a>.  They also transmit cucumber mosaic virus and bacterial wilt, a devastating disease that primarily affects cucumber and muskmelon.  The adults are 1/4 inch long, yellowish green in color with 3 black stripes.</p>  

<p>The <strong><A HREF="../graphics/large/spotted_cuke_beetle_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalF', 'width=320,height=420,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalF">spotted cucumber beetle</a></strong> is a related pest with similar feeding habits that has a yellow-green body and 12 black spots.  It is also known as the southern corn rootworm (feeds on the roots of bean, corn and cucurbit plants) and is a more general feeder than the striped cucumber beetle.</p>

<p>Adults of both beetles emerge in early spring and begin feeding on pollen, <A HREF="../graphics/large/cuke_beetle_flower_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalG', 'width=320,height=420,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalG">flowers</a> and leaves of a wide range of host plants.  When cucurbits are transplanted into the garden or emerge as seedlings, these beetles enter gardens and begin chewing holes in leaves and feeding on stems above and below ground level. The female beetle lays orange eggs in the soil at the base of host plants.  The larva is white, slender and ¼ of an inch long and feeds on the roots of host plants.  There are 1-2 generations per year.  Adult beetles over-winter in plant debris in the garden and in surrounding wooded areas.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#00FFFF">Management:</font></strong>
It is very important to control cucumber beetles early in the season on transplants and seedlings.  Plants are less prone to damage after fruit set begins.  This pest is fast moving and difficult to handpick- they drop when disturbed.  They are most often found on leaf undersides, in flowers or at the base of plant stems.  To prevent infestations, cover vulnerable plants with a floating row cover, being careful to remove the cover during flowering to allow for insect cross-pollination.  Insecticide sprays containing pyrethrum, rotenone or neem, can also be used.  These are botanical insecticides- they are derived from plants- and are classified as organic.  Monitor the plants and repeat applications if necessary.  Be sure to cleanup and remove plant debris at the end of the season to reduce over-wintering habitat.</p>

<p>Grow 'County Fair', a cucumber cultivar with genetic resistance to bacterial wilt.  Select cucumber varieties resistant to cucumber beetle feeding (they have lower levels of the attractant compound cucurbitacin)- 'Gemini', 'Little Leaf-19', 'Saladin'.
