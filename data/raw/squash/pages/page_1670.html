        <b>CAMPION LOOKING GREAT WHILE LOSING</b> Cassie Campion is a former world 
        number one and world champion but has not looked that good so far this 
        week, due to a six month forced absence due to back </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">surgery. 
        But she has been saving it all for today when she faced everybody’s favorite 
        for the title, Sarah Fitz-Gerald. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../photos/britishopen01/fitzcassiesm.jpg" width="300" height="251" align="right"></font></font></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Without 
        being unkind to the women’s game, this was the first quality match of 
        the championships. Indeed, the doyen of British squash coaches, Malcolm 
        Willstrop, opined – after praising Campion’s performance (he is, you should 
        know, her father-in-law) – that this was one of the best women’s matches 
        he has seen for some time. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WHAT 
        A DIFFERENCE A COURT MAKES<br>
        </b></font></font><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Campion 
        lost in four but that really wasn’t the point; what the WISPA people and 
        Brit squash fans were looking for was a sign that Campion can make it 
        back to the top. After this performance the question disappears. Given 
        a good summer training schedule and constant match practise, she will 
        be back in the top four by the end of the year and in the next British 
        Open a firm favourite for the title. The new glass court had a hand in 
        Fitz-Gerald’s performance, taking away the advantage of her power, she 
        claimed at the press conference.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        But Campion had lost all her nerves and her silly habit of going for a 
        winner too soon, to push Fitz-Gerald for three games and show why she 
        was once the world champion. The first game lasted 16 minutes with Fitz-Gerald 
        leading all the way, but she had to work: Campion was on to all her tricks 
        and virtually took the backhand wall, Fitz-Gerald’s golden avenue, away 
        from the Australian. This was wonderful squash with intelligent shots 
        combined with unbelievably quick court coverage. This was the sort of 
        challenge that Fitz-Gerald has not had to endure and she weathered it 
        well. From 6-all Cassie seemed to fade, worryingly, and Fitz-Gerald took 
        the game 9-6.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        <b>THE FATEFUL BACKHAND BOAST</b><br>
        Fitz-Gerald took a brief 2-0 lead at the start of the second game, the 
        second point with a forehand boast that took Campion by surprise. But 
        that was the last time Fitz-Gerald won a point that way and you could 
        almost feel Campion’s confidence growing as she read her opponent’s game 
        and started to dictate. Her forehand cross court drives forced Fitz-Gerald 
        into backhand boasts which found the tin. And when she did try her patented 
        backhand volley drop, Campion was there like a whippet to counter drop 
        or send it to the back of the court. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Her 
        racket work was superb when she had to react quickly, but on three occasions 
        poised in textbook pose to execute a forehand drop she put it in the tin. 
        It didn’t worry her and she finally she was at game ball 8-6. She gave 
        it away with an error on a backhand drop, Fitz-Gerald got to seven with 
        a forehand drive and Cassie got the serve back again with a wonderful 
        backhand volley. Fitz-Gerald kept fighting, got the serve back, evened 
        at 8-all and served for the game at 9-8,. But Champion was full of fight; 
        she got the serve back tied it at 9-9 and won the game 10-9 when Fitz-Gerald 
        hit the tin with an ambitious overhead volley drop. It was 17 minutes 
        of revealing squash and Cassie had answered all the questions in style. 
        </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>FINALLY 
        THE LEGS GO</b> <br>
        The third game was even longer - 19 minutes and started with Campion taking 
        an easy 4-1 lead. It was the sort of lapse that in the past could send 
        Fitz-Gerald into a tail-spin. Had Campion won the next point there might 
        have been a different ending, but it was Campion who let up and Fitz-Gerald 
        took the next five points to take the lead and while Cassie didn’t fold 
        (she saved three game balls), she was never able to quite catch up and 
        lost it 9-7.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        The final game was quite clearly a case of fatigue setting in and, as 
        Campion put it herself later, “I had no legs left”. Fitz-Gerald has been 
        playing almost non-stop this year and she had no trouble with fitness 
        and took the game 9-2, ending an engrossing 62 minute match. “Cassie was 
        totally relaxed and I was nervous,” Fitz-Gerald said later, agreeing this 
        was a different game from the power game she had played in Hurghada. “On 
        this court power doesn’t matter - you have to find the right place on 
        the front wall. You’ve got to learn to use this court – the other girls 
        are getting used to it .” </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>SUCH 
        A GENEROUS PERSON, THIS JOYCE WOMAN </b><br>
        Stephanie Brind had her birthday today and playing on this stage in front 
        of a huge crowd is not a bad way to spend it. Unfortunately she had to 
        share the court with Leilani Joyce, the world number one and Open title 
        holder. It was fairly brief and painful: Joyce won the first game 9-0 
        in 3 ½ minutes, the second 9-6 in 10 minutes and the third 9-0 in 4 minutes. 
        Brind did not look at home on the court and while she showed some of her 
        stuff in the second game, she has not often climbed to this level. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
        Fiona Geaves said: “That was the performance of a player who doesn’t believe 
        in herself.” When Leilani Joyce was asked if she had bought Brind a birthday 
        present she replied: “Those six points in the second game were her present.” 
        Perhaps she would have preferred a toaster?</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b> 
        WITH MEN IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER. </b><br>
        That amazing man Chris Walker (his 34th birthday is on Monday) is now 
        through to the semi-finals after his victory over Ong Beng Hee in the 
        quarter-finals, a magnificent feat for a man who has spent six months 
        of the last year on a round –the-world tour. But he is fitter than any 
        33 year old man has a right to be and matched his 21 year old opponent 
        shot for shot, long rally for long rally throughout the every one of the 
        117 minutes. Beng Hee allowed himself to be pushed into some negative 
        squash and Walker is an old hand at marathons. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
        all came down to an incredible ten minutes when the score reached 11-all 
        in the fifth game.Suddenly they were both ultra careful, the ball being 
        carefully guided high and tight down the wall, almost like a training 
        drill. There were three lets at ll-all, two more lets when Beng Hee led 
        12 –ll , three more lets at 12-all and another four lets when Walker led 
        at 13-12, with long length rallies between each let. Finally Walker won 
        the last two points from a depleted Beng Hee to win 15-12 and give himself 
        a fine birthday gift, a semi-final place in the British Open. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>FIREWORKS 
        AT LAST<br>
        </b> The second men’s quarter-final was a complete contrast, fireworks 
        occasionally interrupted by the odd long rally. Both John White and Del 
        Harris have talent and explosive firepower in their rackets providing 
        lightning boasts, nicks and reverse corners by the bucketful. Sometimes 
        the action was too fast to follow. </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
        Harris had won the second game after losing the first 15-12, he may have 
        been encouraged to dig deeper. He led to 11-10 and then trailed 11-13 
        and then served for the game at 14-13. White came back and then exchanged 
        points to 16-all when Harris sadly got stroked and found himself two games 
        down. He too is over 30 and White, who has found new levels of fitness 
        through Plyometrics (it entails jumping up and down to increase explosive 
        leg power to get to and off the ball quickly) knew he had the match as 
        Harris tired in the third to lose it 15-9 </font></font><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
