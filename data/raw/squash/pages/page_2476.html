					<p><img src="tomato.jpg" width="137" height="121" border="0" align="right" hspace="4">If you turn down a city street in New Haven and you see a group of people tending little rows of tomatoes, squash and string beans in a vacant lot, chances are you&#146;ve run into a neighborhood community garden project. The Community Foundation for Greater New Haven and the City of New Haven together give grants for gardening projects in the City. Collaborating with the two organizations is the New Haven Land Trust.</p>
					<p>The New Haven Land Trust helps people take over vacant lots and transform them into food-producing or flower gardens. It also teaches gardeners about soil improvement, planting, caring for and reaping the rewards of the garden. There are 53 community gardens within the city that are overseen by the Trust. Some gardens are located on private lots, others in public or elderly housing complexes. In 2000, the gardens involved over 650 families, who planted 500 strawberry plants, 630 perennials and over 6,800 bulbs. They grew two tons of food. Back in 1992, when the community gardening program was established by the Foundation, there was no water at the gardens, so gardeners had to carry jugs and buckets of water to the sites to irrigate their plants. Today, thanks to the continuing efforts of the Regional Water Authority, 41 of the 53 gardens have water connections: an example of how we are part of your community.</p>

And now, our own &#147;Whitney&#146;s Pure Bottled Water&#148; has been recognized by the Connecticut Quality Improvement Award (CQIA) with a Silver Connecticut Innovation Prize for its community outreach efforts using the bottled water.</p>
					<p>By incorporating the bottled water into our outreach efforts, we are able to support many nonprofit groups in the region. The nonprofits purchase the water at a reduced rate and then sell it to help raise funds for their respective organizations. In addition to being a source of income for these groups, it helps to educate people about who supplies the water and where it comes from.</p>
					<p>Over 70 businesses and restaurants in Greater New Haven carry the bottled water and some of the nonprofits using the bottled water are: American Red Cross, International Festival of Arts and Ideas, Long Wharf and Yale Repertory Theatres, as well as the New Haven Road Race.</p>
					<p>There were 91 applications from 50 organizations submitted to the CQIA. The Authority was one of 29 silver winners.</p>
