			2000. The event honours high tech 'local heroes'.<BR>
			<BR>
			Antoine Paquin, CEO of Philsar Semiconductor Inc., was named Ottawa Citizen Year 2000 Innovator of the Year while
			Spectral Technologies and Iogen Corp. shared the Mitel Year 2000 Innovation of the Year Award. <BR>
			<BR>
			Cowpland received the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award for Innovation in recognition of his contributions
			to the development of the local high technology sector, his success as an innovator in building Corel Corp. and,
			in general, for his efforts over the years to further Ottawa's reputation around the world as a centre for high
			tech development.<BR>

			<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;This award means a lot to me,&quot; Cowpland told the Awards night
			assemblage. &quot;Together, regional high tech companies like Corel put Ottawa on the map as a centre of high tech
			advancements. I'm proud to be considered among that group and deeply honoured to receive such a prestigious award.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Dr. Michael Cowpland has been a leading innovator in the Ottawa region for more than 30 years,&quot; noted
			NRC President Dr. Arthur Carty in his preamble to the Award presentation. &quot;He played an instrumental role
			in the creation of Mitel Corp. and was founder of Corel Corp., now one of the leading software companies in the
			world. Dr. Cowpland is a true entrepreneur — bold and brave, always willing to move in new directions, lay down
			new challenges and to take risks which others might eschew. Typical of his innovative spirit are the new directions
			Corel is taking in embracing Linux and bringing new products based on this platform to the marketplace.&quot;<BR>

			<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Dr. Michael Cowpland, CEO of Corel Corporation, is known to most people
			with whom he works and deals simply as 'Mike'. He is known for his boundless energy — which he maintains, at least
			in part, through active participation in tennis, squash and various winter sports — and his forthright, eye-to-eye
			manner which is echoed in Corel's relatively flat, highly-flexible and responsive corporate structure.</FONT></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="cowpland.gif" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="238" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Dr. Michael Cowpland" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">In conversation, one can still detect the residue of a British accent.
			Cowpland was born in Bexhill, Sussex, England on April 23, 1943, in the midst of the Second World War. He earned
			a BSc in engineering at Imperial College, Britain's leading engineering university, before moving to Canada in
			1964.<BR>
			<BR>
			Ottawa was his first — and last — stop. Continuing his education, Cowpland earned a Master's degree and a Doctorate
			in electrical engineering at Carleton University. In recent years, he has been awarded several honourary degrees.<BR>
			<BR>
			Cowpland began his working career in 1964 at Bell Northern Research, working on electronic telephone systems, before
			moving to MicroSystems International where he became manager of silicon chip design.<BR>
			<BR>
			He and Terry Matthews founded Mitel Corp. in 1973, focussing once again on electronic telephone systems. Cowpland
			served as Mitel's CEO for ten years before both he and Matthews left the company to pursue different paths in 1984.
			In 1985, Matthews veered off toward telecommunications and data networking starting up Newbridge Networks Corp.
			while Cowpland ventured into business applications launching Corel Corp. Corel was initially a supplier of turnkey
			desktop publishing workstations based on 'IBM' type PCs and the then brand-new </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Ventura
			Publisher</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> software package. A collection of proprietary publishing
			and graphics utilities developed by Corel and included in the publishing workstation package grew, in response
			to user demand, into a full-fledged graphics suite, </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">CorelDraw</FONT></EM><FONT
			SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">, which was launched in 1989. The first professional graphics suite for what we
			now call Wintel PCs, the </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">CorelDraw</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="2"
			FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> package quickly became a best-seller and continues to be the company's flagship product.
			At last year's tenth anniversary celebration, Cowpland noted, with pride, that more than ten million copies of
			the product were currently in use worldwide.<BR>
			<BR>
			The success of the </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">CorelDraw</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">
			package prompted Corel to get out of the hardware business in the early 1990s and concentrate almost exclusively
			on software. In 1996, Corel acquired the </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">WordPerfect</FONT></EM><FONT
			SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> family of productivity applications which currently have a collective registered
			usership, worldwide, of more than 35 million.<BR>
			<BR>
			Following another brief flutter with hardware, in the form of Corel Computer Corp., in the late 1990s, Cowpland
			again sharpened his focus and divested the hardware operation to the Ottawa company known today as Rebel.com. Corel
			continues to work closely with Rebel.com developing operating system and application software for the NetWinder
			family of Linux-based, Web-centric sub-miniature PCs.<BR>
			<BR>
			Recognising the potential of the upstart Linux operating system — and seeing a shortage of productivity software
			for the platform — Cowpland decreed a crash program to port the </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">WordPerfect</FONT></EM><FONT
			SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> suite over to Linux. That product shipped last fall. Early this year, Cowpland
			unveiled the first official release of Corel's own Linux OS package, based on the highly-regarded Debian distribution.
			The Corel graphics applications are now being ported over, as well, and </FONT><EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">CorelDraw
			9 for Linux</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> was unveiled just last month.<BR>
			<BR>
			In addition to his duties at Corel, Cowpland is also a director on the boards of Rebel.com, in which Corel holds
			a significant stake, and WorldHeart Corp. </FONT><STRONG><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">M</FONT></STRONG><BR>
