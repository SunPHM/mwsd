  2 p.m. &quot;Boost Your Brain Power: Lifestyle Strategies for Optimum
        Brain Health&quot; <br>
&#8212; Paulette Chandler, MD, MPH</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="text"><img src="speakerphotos/paulette_chandler.jpg" alt="Paulette Chandler" width="104" height="132" hspace="8" vspace="2" align="left">Dr. Chandler is a graduate of Princeton University,
        Duke Medical School, and Harvard School of Public Health. She practices internal
        medicine at Brigham
          and Women's Hospital. She is an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School.
          In addition, she is director of Natural Healing Pathways, Inc., a not for profit
          organization committed to providing a wholistic approach to helping people
          with chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity
          through the union of mind, body, and spirit.<br>
      <br>
      You must protect your most valuable asset, your brain. Learn how managing
    stress and daily exercise can boost brain power. Learn how fruits, vegetables,
    nuts, and whole grains nurture and nourish the over stressed nervous system.
    Meals should increase mental clarity, energy, and health rather than produce
    lethargy, confusion, and irritability.<br>
      <br>
      At birth, the infant's brain is the most primitive organ in the body. Life
      experiences create robust tree-like neural networks in the brain, or prune
      delicate saplings of neuronal activity resulting in chaotic signals. The
      life of the brain is in the blood. Lifestyle habits determine the nutrients
      your brain receives through the blood. <br>
      <br>
      What type of fuel do you give your brain? Are toxic emotions sabotaging your
      brain power? Pressure at home, work, and on the road! Lower stress levels
      encourage better memory and learning because nerve cell expansion is greatly
      inhibited in the presence of chronic stress. What is good for the heart is
  also good for the brain.</p>

      fish. Some popular fillings include avocado, cucumbers, asparagus, and shiitake
      mushrooms. Having the right tools for the job is helpful in preparing these
      rolls. Chef Ken Bergeron will explain the items needed and how to substitute
      in a pinch. Chef Ken will also provide examples of, and preparation instructions
      for, the needed condiments such as wasabi. In a departure from rolls typically
      served in restaurants, our filling will be brown rice in place of white to
      increase the nutrient content.<br>
