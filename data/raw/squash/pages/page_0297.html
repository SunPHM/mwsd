<p><strong>When To Harvest Vegetables</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/vegbasket.gif" align="right" valign="bottom">
Ever wonder the best time to harvest those garden veggies?  There always seems to be a critical time 
when the produce is at its best, both nutritionally and for your taste buds.  Your local county extension 
office has the answer in a pamphlet, "<a href="http://www.ces.uga.edu/pubcd/L291-w.htm" target="_top">"<b>When To Harvest Vegetables</b></a>." 
Get your personal copy by contacting a county extension office near you.  You may find other pamphlets that are of interest to Georgia gardeners.

 X-rated?  No, not really!  However, a common garden complaint is that a squash vine has lots of flowers 
 but no fruit.  Perhaps the blooms you see are only male flowers which, thankfully, are followed in a few 
 weeks by female blooms.  Walter demonstrates how to pollinate a squash by hand.  Don't miss his tip on 
 how to pollinate tomatoes - using a chopstick!</p>
