          Here is the story of Swiss Chard. We will review one of the vegitables 
          going into this years garden as a highlight for study each week. <BR>
          <BR>
          Swiss Chard is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean area, 
          spreading eastward in prehistoric times. In the 4th century BC, Aristotle 
          wrote of red chard, and Theophrastus mentioned light-green and dark-green 
          kinds. The Romans as well as the Greeks knew chard well and wrote frequently 
          of its use. It was apparently unknown in the Far East until the Middle 
          Ages, being mentioned in China only from the 7th century. Swiss Chard 
          is one of the easiest most versatile summer vegetables to grow. It will 
          tolerate poor soil conditions, extreme heat, and is generally free of 
          insect problems and diseases. Chard is a relative of the garden beet 
          and sugar beet--belonging to the same species (Beta vulgaris) and will 
          intercross readily. The pollen of these biennials are wind-borne and 
          may fertilize any plant of the same species over long distances. But 
          unlike the beet, it is not grown for its root, but for its edible stems 
          and leaves. <img src="images/green_leaf.jpg" width="197" height="144" align="left">The 
          leaves, which have thick midribs and wide veins, can be eaten either 
          raw or cooked. The tender young leaves can substitute for lettuce while 
          older leaves, when cooked, taste similar to spinach. Chard is grown 
          from seeds sown directly in the soil in early spring through late summer; 
          it will continue to grow until the first hard freeze. The chard seed, 
          like a beet seed, is actually a small fruit that contains several seeds. 
          To prevent overcrowding, thinning must be done immediately after germination. 
          Then, when the seedlings are 6 to 8 inches high, thin them again to 
          stand 6 inches apart. Enjoy the thinnings in a salad. Harvest outer 
          leaves when they are 6 to 8 inches long, and leave the inner leaves 
          to develop for later harvesting, or cut the entire plant off about 1 
          inch above the ground. The plant will then produce new leaves that will 
          be ready for cutting in a few weeks. One of the best varieties is Fordhook 
          Giant. It has dark green crumpled leaves that are thick and fleshy. 
          Stems are 2 ½ inches wide and white; leaf veins are also white. It's 
          drought-resistant and does extremely well in our clay soils. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS" font="font" color="Green">
