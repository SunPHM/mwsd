To the many SquashTalk readers from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, I will convey some of the wonder and excitement that the new Yale Brady squash center provides. The new Yale squash center most probably is the best squash facility in the world today.</font>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">T<img height="292" width="389" src="../../photos/usjuniors2000/yalecourts1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">he three-hundred-fifty participants and the impressive concentration of world-class coaches demonstrated graphically the growth and vibrancy of squash in the USA.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Coaches working with the US&nbsp;juniors include world greats Ken Hiscoe, based in Virginia, Bryan Patterson from Brooklyn, Khalid Mir from Portland Oregon, and Sharon Brady, based at Bowdoin College in Maine; as well as Richard and Pat Millman, Damian Walker, Geoff Mitchell, Peter Briggs, Paul Ansdell, Richard Chin, Don Mills, Tom Rumpler and many others. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="red"><b>FAVORITES&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THE&nbsp;MARQUEE&nbsp;EVENTS</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">In the boys under 19, a highly competitive crowd includes favorite Richard Repetto who will be closely challeged by Pat Malloy, Greg Park, and Asif Mir; with Ryan Brynes and Eric Wadhwa from Taft school hoping to break into the elite four. In the boys under 17, Asher Hochberg and Will Broadbent challenge the impressive duo from Portland Oregon, Julian Illingworth and William Davis.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">In the girls under 19, Michelle Quibell and Louisa Hall will be challenged by Alex Pearson and Lindsey Wilkens. The girls under 17 are paced by Amy Gross with Kate Rapisarda hoping that this will be the weekend for a big win over Amy.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2" color="red"><b>NEWS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;THE&nbsp;BRADY&nbsp;CENTER</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">But t<img height="292" width="389" src="../../photos/usjuniors2000/yalecourts3.jpg" align="right">he big news is the squash center itself. With five hundred plus players, coaches, and parents playing, spectating, and strolling about, this incredible center and its excellent layout swallowed up the crowds.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">The new Yale Brady center, masterminded by Yale official Sam Chauncy, without question sets a new world standard for squash facilities. The Brady Center stands today as the finest facility in the world. The center boasts one permanenet ASB four wall glass court (pictured above). The Nicholas F. Brady '52 exhibition court is flanked by flags signifying the countries represented by current and past Yale squash players. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Additionally, the center boasts two additional permanent 3-glass-wall ASB&nbsp;exhibition courts. The courts are shaded so as to allow play with the standard Dunlop black balls. (pictured right) </font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Complementing the three exibition courts are 12 additional courts, making for a total of fifteen courts.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">But the Brady center is not only courts. The aesthetics of the center are breathtaking. In order to create the center within the venerable Payne-Whitney gymnasium at Yale, six million dollars was expended on the renovation to the space and the courts. The walkways and spectator areas are carefully designed for light, space, viewing convenience and traffic flow. The six-hundred plus people in attendance never seem to come close to filling the facility.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Additionally, the center pays close attention to the history of the game of squash, at Yale, in North America, and worldwide. The center is decorated with photos of all past squash teams, dating back to their first varsity team in 1920, posters showing most of the major professional tournaments held in North America, both under the once flourishing WPSA&nbsp;tour and the present PSA&nbsp;tour; and additionally photographs of squash greats ranging from Hashim Khan, Heather McKay and Sharif Khan to Mark Talbott and John Nimick. Along one wall is a wall-length panel describing the history of the game of squash. David and Mark Talbott (David pictured below), the Yale coaches, have played a strong role in designing this wonderful permanent exhibit.</font></p>
