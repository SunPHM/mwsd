<H4>Professional photographs were taken at the church and the reception, but we have to wait two weeks for those. In the meantime here are impressions taken by the mother of the groom. I missed taking photos of some dear people who were there to celebrate with Toni and Davis because I was having such a nice time myself.

<P>Davis and his boys, Victor and Spencer, came up to Columbia on Thursday night. We met them at the hotel. Friday, Toni arrived with her two boys, Scott and Kyle, and Stephanie from San Jose. She had time for a quick glance at her room, then we all rushed off to the church in Sonora for the rehearsal.</H4>

<H4>Christina, the wedding coordinator, taught everyone their proper places and moves. The boys learned about their important roles of lighting the candles during the ceremony and bearing the rings. We then went out for a lunch together.</H4>

<H4>It was soon time to dress for the wedding. Davis made sure the boys were all buttoned up and ready to go to the church for photos</H4>.

<H4>The wedding dinner was a sumptuous repast. The menu featured winter squash bisque, baby mixed greens with toasted hazelnut dressing, and a choice of either grilled shrimp with pappadelle pasta and saffron cream or grilled fillet of beef tenderloin with whipped potatoes and blue cheese sauce.</H4>
