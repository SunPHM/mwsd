    Graveyard Shift<br>
    When naming rights deals meet their untimely demise, facilities look to 
    protect their interests</font></b><p><i>
    <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF6600">
    By R.V. Baugus</font></i></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <img border="0" src="issueart/Graveyard.jpg" align="right" hspace="0" width="300" height="292">I’m 
    telling ya, it’s a naming rights graveyard out there. What do you mean that 
    we didn’t pay our proper final respects to the Trans World Dome in St. 
    Louis? Faster than the facility’s high-octane tenant St. Louis Rams can go 
    up and down the football field, we blinked and the signage was taken off the 
    venue. Now it’s six feet under while a temporary fix called The Dome at 
    America’s Center became the new name only to later beget the Edward Jones 
    Dome.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And what of those that still refuse to 
    acknowledge they are now among the dearly departed? We’re talking to you Pro 
    Player Stadium in Miami. Heck, for the longest we didn’t even know that you 
    were a division of the Fruit of the Loom company. Next thing we know, 
    bankruptcy briefs are being filed for the company known for its briefs. 
    Suddenly, Pro Player is No Player. But go gently into the night you do not. 
    Instead, it’s almost two years later and Pro Player signage still adorns the 
    stadium while other signage awaits you at your final resting place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Speaking of that final resting place, mind if 
    PSINet bellies up to you? For like Pro Player, PSINet remains the name on 
    the stadium in Baltimore that is home to the football Ravens. Like several 
    other Internet providers, PSINet is one of those dot.coms that became a 
    dot.bomb. Besides, you guys with acronyms in your name make it that much 
    easier when it comes to etching the inscription on your headstone: “RIP PSI” 
    awaits you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But for the truly macabre, we offer for your 
    consideration the eulogy of Enron, the Houston-based energy giant whose 
    legal entanglements are enough to dizzy even the most polished of attorneys. 
    In court proceedings after a mere two years as the name of the stadium where 
    the Houston Astros play baseball, Enron stands on the pedestal as the 
    largest bankruptcy reorganization filing ever. As many a baseball announcer 
    shouts after a home run ball is launched and on its way out of the park, to 
    Enron we say, “See ya!”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Or do we? For now, Enron continues to make 
    payments on its $100-million, 30-year deal. So while the Enron Corp. takes 
    the witness stand, the stands at the baseball stadium continue to be under 
    the Enron Field moniker. For how much longer, though, is anyone’s guess.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It’s all a part of the unavoidable latest 
    phase and craze in the facility naming rights game, that of the collapsed 
    deal way before the term of the contract expires. To think it seemed like 
    just yesterday that all the talk was about the newest facility going up and 
    the huge mega-million dollar naming rights deal accompanying it. To some 
    extent, the luster of the sweet deal has worn off, only to be replaced by an 
    air of uncertainty as future naming rights deals are negotiated. That’s not 
    to suggest, though, that it’s time to shovel dirt on the naming rights game, 
    even if the business does show periodic signs of gasping, wheezing 
    and—ahem—coffin.</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Here Today, Here To Stay</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">
    <img border="0" src="issueart/Enron.jpg" align="right" hspace="7" vspace="2" width="325" height="205">Funereal 
    overtones aside, it’s going to take a lot more than a handful of failed 
    naming rights deals to squash the industry. Naming rights are simply too 
    lucrative, too powerful and too worthwhile to ever vanish from the 
    landscape. Today, there are 62 major league stadiums bearing the names of 
    companies who have spent a collective $3.4 billion to get off the bench and 
    into the game. The first facility to have naming rights was Buffalo’s Rich 
    Stadium in 1973 (named after Rich Foods, which dropped $1.5 million for the 
    rights), and as the 30th anniversary of that landmark date approaches, one 
    can only stand in awe at the changes that have taken place. Most recently, 
    those changes have involved just who plays the naming rights game, and for 
    how long they are able to do so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The biggest change has been the removal of 
    several business sectors that had been big players in the naming rights 
    game,” said Rob Yowell, vice president of naming rights for Envision. “The 
    economic recession has eliminated the cash-rich, exposure-hungry dot.com 
    companies and the numbers of potential partners has become more contracted. 
    Rights holders are much more conscious about the stability of the company 
    today, rather than who will pay the highest price.”<br>
    Rights buyers are also looking at deals a little different these days, again 
    thanks in part to a staggering economy. Where they choose to spend their 
    money is a much more thought-out process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The economic downturn has corporations and 
    brand managers scratching their heads as to how valuable an asset a naming 
    rights deal actually is in comparison to traditional mass media,” said Rick 
    Devero in the consulting group division of The Marketing Arm, based in 
    Dallas. “Another factor may be the fact that many corporations have gone or 
    are on the verge of going bankrupt, which in turn has negatively affected 
    the naming rights business.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As last rites are being performed on more and 
    more failed deals, a check in the rear view mirror reveals that perhaps not 
    enough consideration was given to the possibility of failure when those rich 
    deals were being hammered out on boardroom tables. Whether both parties were 
    too consumed with their sweetheart deals or whether the thought of failure 
    never entered the minds, the happenings in recent months have been a harsh 
    eye-opener.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Probably very little thought was given to 
    this type of scenario, but as with any business deal there is probably 
    always that very risk,” said Devero. “The rapid rise and fall of the 
    technology sector will undoubtedly have venues re-thinking this.”<br>
    Dean Bonham of the Bonham Group in Denver agrees that perhaps not enough 
    consideration was given to financial insolvency, but he also remembers that 
    at least some venues brought up that very issue with their buyers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“I negotiated the naming rights for PNC Park 
    in Pittsburgh about five years ago, and at that time we dealt with issues on 
    our side of the fence,” he said. “They raised the issue of financial 
    insolvency. The other analyses that I have done on naming rights deals 
    around the country all had clauses that dealt with the possibility of 
    financial insolvency. Today the contracts are much more detailed and teams 
    and venues are focusing more on the organization (buyer) and its long-term 
    financial prospects than certainly they did four or five years ago.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yowell believes it is all about 
    accountability, something he has spelled out in the contracts he has 
    negotiated. “We’ve had clauses covering bankruptcy and acquisition scenarios 
    that protect the venue and provide definitive accountability to the naming 
    rights sponsor,” he said. “A company goes out of business, they are still on 
    the hook for the payment when they emerge from Chapter 11 or the company 
    that acquires them assumes the payments. There are some cases where the 
    rights holder can negotiate a buyout should a partner default, and the same 
    goes for the company acquiring the naming rights sponsor if it doesn’t meet 
    their strategy. In the case where the naming rights was paid in full up 
    front, then technically the name would remain on the venue.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the contracts of yesterday left both 
    parties with the feeling that anything not specified in the wording was the 
    equivalent of one foot in the grave and another on a banana peel, then 
    today’s naming rights contracts are certainly the clause that refreshes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“If a property is smart, it will have 
    contingencies for scenarios involving bankruptcy and acquisition,” said 
    Devero. “In every naming rights deal that we have been associated with, 
    there is at the very least a clause in the contract which spells out the 
    rights of the property and the sponsor if such a situation occurs.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“The long and the short of it is the vast 
    majority of the clauses protect the team and the venue in the event of 
    insolvency to the point where the team has absolute rights over the naming 
    rights benefits should the company that holds those benefits become 
    insolvent,” said Bonham. “We’ve seen a couple of instances where maybe it’s 
    not as clear cut as that, but certainly we recommend strongly that our 
    clients incorporate very strong language that the moment insolvency is 
    imminent or that it’s announced, that the contract can be terminated by the 
    team and all the benefits revert back to the ownership of the team.”</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">More Homework</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the whole process sounds slightly more 
    complicated than it was just a few years ago, well, it is. Besides the extra 
    verbiage that is likely to be found in today’s contracts, there is also the 
    homework the seller must do on potential suitors. Facilities must also 
    consider in advance the possibility that their eventual buyer may or may not 
    be in business in the future. It all makes for a crazy guessing game.<br>
    “Yes, but that’s the risk they are willing to take,” believes Yowell. “More 
    likely today is that the company’s name will change through acquisition or 
    rebranding, so we try to include one name change in our deals at no 
    additional cost (i.e., renegotiation of terms), and the sponsor just covers 
    the hard cost of changing out the signage.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The easy thing would seem to be for the buyer 
    to align with a seller that boasts a strong pedigree. But even that is not 
    always a guarantee that there will be no future bumps in the road.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Sellers are having to do a lot more due 
    diligence from two perspectives,” said Bonham. “First, they have to make 
    sure they can identify and defend the value of the package that they’re 
    selling. Two, they’re having to be extraordinarily cautious on the front of 
    making sure that they have the legal protections in the event of insolvency. 
    We see a good bit more due diligence being practiced in those two areas 
    today than we did five years ago.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">But just how cautious and how much due 
    diligence can a venue exercise only to still find a dance partner with two 
    left feet? “Realistically, a property should align itself with the type of 
    corporation that has a history of prosperity and growth,” said Devero. “Big 
    brands are always going to be better bets than the Johnny-come-lately 
    dot.com types. But then you just never can tell. Take a look at Enron, for 
    example.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More people would probably actually prefer to 
    not take a look at Enron. Aside from the fact that the failed energy giant 
    is for now making on-time payments to still have its name on Houston’s Enron 
    Field, most know the company as one reported to have had all kinds of 
    management improprieties and as the company that has filed for the largest 
    bankruptcy reorganization ever known to an American court. So for now it 
    continues to be Enron Field, which raises the question of whether a facility 
    should continue to use the name of a company which is actually defunct or in 
    bankruptcy proceedings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“If you ask 10 people you would probably get 
    10 different answers,” said Bonham. “My own opinion is you’re better off 
    leaving the name until you can replace it. You have a choice of having a 
    name and replacing or having a name and then going through two additional 
    name changes. The less that you can confuse the public as to the name of the 
    facility, the more likely you are to be able to deliver value in the long 
    run to the sponsor who is replacing the defunct company.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some venues believe that a new partner can be 
    found immediately, only to find that isn’t always true and they are still 
    left with the name of the deceased. “St. Louis did the right thing in naming 
    the Dome at America’s Center,” said Devero. “Miami should have gone back to 
    Joe Robbie Stadium. It’s real tough to guess how long it will take to find a 
    new suitor. Miami took a gamble that they would find a new partner 
    immediately and it failed.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Plus, too many changes means there is less 
    value in the name for future suitors, believes Yowell. “The more times you 
    change the venue’s name, the less impact the next one has,” he said. “A 
    building with one previous name is more valuable than one that had three or 
    four names. Our philosophy is to keep status quo until a new deal is done. 
    The only reason to change is if it is part of the buyout to remove the name 
    or if keeping it has a negative impact in some way.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Back when the naming rights boom really 
    started picking up steam, a loud roar arose from the general public as well 
    as from a sarcastic media mocking and deriding the proliferation of 
    corporate names attached to heretofore simple-named facilities. Arguments 
    ranged from people no longer being able to identify with what city the XYZ 
    Stadium was located to the issue of teams and facilities prostituting 
    themselves for the almighty dollar. Even the naming rights experts have 
    their own thoughts about public perception.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“As a practical matter, sports fans are 
    pretty resilient when it comes to remembering the facility’s name that their 
    favorite team plays in,” said Bonham. “If they’re not a fan then it probably 
    doesn’t matter a lot anyway. We haven’t seen a lot of criticism from fans on 
    this count. We may at some point in the future, but so far I think sports 
    fans have been pretty resilient.”</font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Shorter-Term Deals</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Many of the deals that were made over the 
    past decade were for a whopping 30 years, which in today’s climate means the 
    deal is quite likely to outlive the facility. Because of that, Bonham 
    believes that the length for naming rights deals will be shortened somewhat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“Frankly, I don’t think that we’re going to 
    see many 30-year deals,” he said. “I do think we’ll continue to see 15- to 
    20-year deals. I doubt very much that we’ll go to 5- to 10-year deals 
    because teams and venues are very reluctant to change the name of facilities 
    while they still have a useful life. I would expect about 20 years to be the 
    norm.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Whether it’s as few as five years or as many 
    as 30 years, don’t expect naming rights to go away just because a handful of 
    companies are no longer around after having previously signed on the dotted 
    line. “Companies will be more cautious, but naming rights will still be a 
    major revenue stream for venues,” said Yowell. “The costs of new venues and 
    the exposure values will always keep naming rights on the table.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Besides, added Devero, it’s not fair to look 
    at every wayward deal as a failure. “TWA, for example, was bought by its 
    rival, a company which just happened to have its name on two other 
    facilities (American Airlines Arena and American Airlines Center),” he said. 
    “The economy is the more likely culprit for the slowdown. When you look at 
    most of the deals, they are usually based in a corporation’s hometown or 
    most important market. In most cases it is not an example of a real sound 
    business decision, but rather a way for the corporation to put a stake in 
    the ground or hang out its shingle. In any event, as long as there are 
    corporations that deem that as important, there will be naming rights 
    deals.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Indirectly, the tragic events of September 11 
    are even acknowledged as part of today’s shaky naming rights climate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“That didn’t cause any of the failures, but 
    it certainly took naming rights deals off the forefront for the business 
    community (and rightly so), and put an emphasis on better ways to spend $5 
    million on the relief efforts,” said Yowell. “We had several companies 
    (financial and insurance) looking at the Superdome that had to cease 
    conversations because of the direct impact on their business. We are seeing 
    the interest return now and expect to see deals starting to happen.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">“It’s probably the main reason that 17 
    existing venues and eight new ones have yet to be named,” added Devero. 
    “Corporations are really taking a wait-and-see attitude right now with 
    relation to the economy.”</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bonham expects the rebound to occur sooner 
    than later as the country and the industry recover from the tragedy and the 
    economy. “The industry will continue to not only survive but thrive in spite 
    of September 11 and the bottoming economy for one simple reason: there’s 
    extraordinary value to be delivered to corporate America in these deals. 
    We’ve analyzed 26 deals nationwide and every one has delivered significant 
    value to corporate America. There’s been a short-term effect, no question. 
    But as I say, the industry will not only continue to survive, it will thrive 
    in the years to come.”</font></p>
