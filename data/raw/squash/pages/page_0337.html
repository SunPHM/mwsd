                <P align=justify><h4>Sport</h4>
                  
                <p>Oriel has a fine tradition of sporting excellence. Past members 
                  of the College have represented the University, and frequently 
                  have played for one of the many successful College teams at 
                  rugby, football (soccer), cricket, hockey, squash, tennis, table-tennis, 
                  basketball, American football, golf, fencing and darts. Many 
                  have rowed for the College in the inter-collegiate races which 
                  take place twice a year on the nearby Thames. In rowing, one 
                  of Oxford's most popular sports, Oriel has been pre-eminent, 
                  generally providing the most successful crews in Torpids and 
                  in Summer Eights since the 1970s. The College has its own sports 
                  ground and pavilion, with football and rugby pitches and a squash 
                  court, as well as its own boathouse. Teams from the College 
                  have twice been finalists in consecutive years on TV's University 
                  Challenge recently. In short, the cultural, social and sporting 
                  activities of Oriel students are as diverse as the students 
                  who take part in them. </P> </p>
