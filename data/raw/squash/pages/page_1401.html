<h1>On-Line Tour</h1>

<h2>Walk with us through the Exhibit Hall</h2>

When you enter the Museum, you will begin a journey that takes you through 15,000 years of Native American history on the North American continent.  
The quoted words of <a href="/news/name.asp">noted Indians</a>, and the displays of hundreds of artifacts, depict life as it was for America's original inhabitants and takes you on a journey from the Eastern Woodlands, to the Plains, to the Southwest.  
The Mt. Kearsarge Indian Museum has often been referred to as the &quot;museum with a voice,&quot; for instead of identifying labels throughout the exhibits, our history of the Native American is represented orally rather than written…the way it was.  
Our trained and extremely informed <a href="/activities/tours.asp">Tour Guides</a> explain not only the artifacts, but also about the people who created and used them, often relating stories originally told by Native Americans. 
You will be able to explore the harmonious relationship that existed between these people and their environs. 
You will marvel at the collection of baskets, beadwork, fishing equipment, canoes, weaving, quillwork, pottery, and more.  
<P>
The guided tour through the Mt. Kearsarge Indian Museum Education and Cultural Center is an inspirational journey, that leads you on an historic trail across our continent from east to west.  
As you walk through the simulated woodland, home to a variety of native creatures, you become aware of our Mother Earth and the interconnecting of all earth's living inhabitants.   
<P>
<IMG SRC="tour3.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=105 ALT="" BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
The trail proceeds past displays of creative handiwork using natural materials:  canoes, dugouts, birchbark containers, intricate beadwork, and moosehair and porcupine quill embroidery.  
Beyond the woodlands, you learn about the farming techniques and wisdom as to why the Indians will grow corn, beans and squash together.
<P>
<IMG SRC="tour4.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=163 ALT="" BORDER="0" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10>
Soon, the intense warmth and dryness of the southwest - where human survival was a struggle and pottery-making was, and still is, prevalent - surrounds you.  
Your guide continues to share knowledge with you of other southwest crafts, such as Navajo rug weaving and exquisite basket weaving of the Pima, Pomo, Herpa and Apache people.
<P>

Continuing on, one can almost feel the breezes picking up and hear the wind whipping across the Plains as your group enters the section representing the prairie, home of buffalo and the horse.  
There you see the bright colors and vivid beadwork designs that dominated the handiwork of the Plains Indians in their decorated horse saddles and saddle bags…all of which reflect their respect and awe for their beautiful surroundings.  
You become aware of the intensity and enthusiasm with which the Lakota, Crow, Cheyenne and Blackfoot lived their lives.
<P>
And then…a hush settles around you as your group quietly enters the Ceremonial Room.  
Here, you observe objects of a spiritual nature:  serious, meaningful artifacts like sacred pipes, pipe bags and ceremonial drums.  
It is the end of the trail, where the philosophy and culture your guide has imparted to you all come together;  the harmonious union of man with the environment culminates here, and is summarized by these famous and final words:
