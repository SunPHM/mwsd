<p><em>Men's Squash Cross-over </em>

   <br /><b>TORONTO, Ont. (Jan. 21, 2006)</b>The men's squash team participated in the cross-over against the 
western teams in the league this past weekend in Toronto. This was an 
important tournament for the Queen's team as it would decide whether or 
not we would qualify for the team championships. We were well down in the 
standings after the our sectional against Toronto and McGill.</p> 

   <p>The outcome against Western was the expected short end of a 6-0 defeat. 
However a 6-0 win over McMaster kept our hopes alive. What was needed was 
a good result against Waterloo Sunday morning. Unfortunately that did not 
materialize and Queen's lost that encounter 5-1. The 6-0 win over Brock 
later in the day wasn't enough to push us into the playoff pool and, for 
the first time in more than ten years, Queen's unfortunately did not 
qualify for the team championships.</p>

  <p> Our disappointment is balanced by the improvement and solid performance 
of most of the team members in a rebuilding year. Our standout at the 
cross-over was Matt Twiddy who won 3 of his 4 matches, losing only to his 
opponent on the stacked Western team. Also to be mentioned is Sean Horton 
who without question is the most determined and grittiest player on the 
team. He certainly has the record for the most 5-game match wins this 
year. Both these players are returning next year and their continued 
improvement will be crucial to the hoped-for success of next year's team.</p>


<br />
<p><em>Men's Squash at McGill</em>

<br /><b>MONTREAL, QC (19 Nov. 2005)</b> - McGill hosted the Eastern Sectionals on Saturday between McGill,  Toronto and Queen's. Both McGill and Toronto fielded stronger teams than last year while Queen's, having lost a number of key players to graduation, are in a rebuilding phase. Thus the outcome was not  entirely unexpected, as Queen's lost its encounters with McGill and Toronto by the same 1-5 margin in matches won and lost. However, the 
scoreline does not indicate the closeness of many of the matches and the determination and effort put in by all of the Queen's players. With 
Toronto's 4-2 win over McGill, the final match count was Toronto 9, McGill 7 and Queen's 2.</p>

<p>The standout on the Queen's team was Sean Horton, the #3 player, who won both of his matches, by a 3-2 margin against Toronto and 3-1 against 
McGill. The win over Toronto was particularly noteworthy. Sean was down 8-2 in the fifth and deciding game of the match but settled down to play 
consistent and errorless squash when it was most important, and finally took the game with a 10-9 score. His effort was a big boost to Queen's 
morale and has inspired the team (at least going by road-home chit-chat) to train and practice even harder than before. This will be needed if the 
team is to reverse its fortunes at the Western Sectionals in January and continue its long run of playoff appearances.</p>

<p><em>Men's Squash Finishes with One Tie, One Loss Against McGill Team</em>

<br/><b>KINGSTON, Ont (29 Oct. 2005)</b> - Queen's hosted the McGill Men's Squash Team on Saturday in a double-round  exhibition tournament. In the first round Queen's and McGill tied 4  matches apiece while McGill won the second round 5 matches to 3. The  standout for Queen's was Sean Horton who won his matches against the #2  and #3 seeds on the McGill team. Queen's will meet McGill again, together  with UofT, at the East Sectional taking place on November 19 at McGill.</p>
