I said     it. I really love working here. It doesn't get much better than 20 computers     in one room, just waiting to be used.... mwmwmwahahaha.... oh. sorry.</font></p>  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What is     ITW, you ask? (Well, actually, you're probably not asking it if you made it     here, but we'll pretend anyway...) ITW is the Instructional Technology Workshop     at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.</font></p>  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">What do     we do? A little of everything: namely web design, flash, digitizing multimedia,     creating presentations for classes, and have fun. It's a great workplace.     (Very avant garde with our beige, red, and blue walls, too.)</font></p>  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why are     we here? ITW is here to assist teachers in (as the name implies) instructing     with technology. Yes, we are the means by which an otherwise technophobic     professor can break into the realm of (surprisingly easy-to-use) technological     instruction.</font></p>  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why am _I_     here? As I have already stated, ITW is a great place to work. &lt;shameless     flattery&gt;My boss, Vicki Sells-Lewallen, is an incredibly-easy-to-work-for-and-fun-to-be-around     person&lt;/shameless flattery&gt;, and runs an incredibly smooth operation.     Any student at Sewanee with a technological bent who likes a fun place to     work should be here. Can't stress that enough... trust me. :)</font></p>  <p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Where is     ITW? ITW is located in the bottom of Jesse Ball DuPont Library here in Sewanee,     in our new facility at ATC (heh. I don't even know exactly what that stands     for.) Enough blabbing.

(note: avoid having containers     of food within the immediate 20 mile radius of this individual. He's been     known to chase down an ice cream truck and eat the driver on occasion). He     plays a mean game of squash, and could outdrink a fish. If you live in Metropolitan     Sewanee you should look him up.

What was &quot;Fahd&quot;'s knee is,     it now appears, melded into the former &quot;Mahvash&quot;'s back.) No scientist     knows who initiated this union, but it seems to work well. When speaking to     either of it, (heh), you have to address every question to both parts, or     it becomes hopelessly infuriated. Rumor has it that the &quot;Mahvash&quot;     unit forced the &quot;Fahd&quot; unit to chop his hair off because the &quot;Fahd&quot;     unit refused to make her Macaroni &amp; Cheese.
