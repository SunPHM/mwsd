<p><em>DISEASES</em></p>
<font face="Arial" size="4"><b>

<p></b>W,F</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> APPLE SCAB. Many trees in some areas of the
state are nearly defoliated. However, some crabapples have suffered little damage,
attesting to the value of planting scab resistant cultivars. Apple scab lesions appear as
small, irregularly shaped olive green spots, often located along veins in the leaves.
Infected leaves will turn yellow and drop from the tree later in the season. It is too
late to provide any effective suppression of scab on heavily infested ornamental trees but
treatment should continue on bearing apple trees. Fungicides such as <i>Captain</i> and <i>Benlate</i>
should be effective (read label for directions).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> BACTERIAL WILT.
Typically infected cucumber, melon or squash plants or individual vines suddenly wilt
during hot, dry weather and but may partially recover during the night. Infected plants
may be diagnosed by cutting a stem, near the base of the plant with a very sharp knife or
razor blade. Squeeze the cut ends and stick them back together. Slowly pull the stems
apart again and watch for the presence of tiny, sticky strands that will adhere between
the two cut surfaces. If these tiny strands are present, diagnosis for this bacterial
disease is almost certain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">No treatment is possible for infected plants. The bacteria
overwinters in cucumber beetles which then spread the disease to young cucumber plants the
next season when they feed. Since cucumber beetle feeding was heavy this spring, lots of
bacterial wilt is expected. Early season control of the beetles should reduce the spread
of the disease in the garden. Remove Bacterial Wilt infected plants from the garden to
reduce the chances of further spread of the disease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> SQUASH MOSAIC and
related mosaic diseases have been seen on squash and other cucurbits. These virus diseases
<a href="../images/Squash%20mosaic%20leaf%20symptoms.jpg">cause a mosaic pattern of green,
lite green and yellow streaks</a> to develop in the leaves initially. A bit later in the
season, the fruit will become distorted and discolored, typically exhibiting <a href="../images/Squash%20mosaic%20fruit%20symptoms.jpg">raised spots which may be a very
prominent yellow colo</a>r. Infected fruit may also have an off-flavor. The disease can be
spread by insects like cucumber beetles and aphids and also by physical contact or
mechanical injury among the plants. Once a plant is infected, there is no treatment for
the disease other than to remove the plant from the garden to lessen the chances of spread
to other healthy plants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> EARLY BLIGHT on
tomato, potato and eggplant continues to develop but has been slowed by recent hot and dry
weather. This disease causes <a href="../images/Early%20blight%20on%20tomato%20leaflet.jpg">small spots</a> that start out
at about 3/8&quot; in diameter on the leaves. The spots are also characterized by a target
pattern of lines within the spots. Many spots may merge together to cause larger areas of
the leaves to die but the spots will generally not cross a leaf vein. Like Septoria leaf
spot, this disease overwinters on diseased plant debris from last year and is then spread
to the lower leaves by splashing rain or irrigation water. Control is similar to that for
Septoria leaf spot with <i>Chlorothalonil</i> (Daconil 2787) treatments beginning at the
first sign of the spotting for best control.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> PURPLE BLOTCH OF
ONION: Gardeners with a love of onions have seen a common disease developing over the past
week or two. Purple blotch, a disease caused by an Alternaria fungus, has been seen
causing dieback of the onion tops. Purple blotch can also affect garlic and leeks. The
disease is expressed as <a href="../images/Onion%20purple%20blotch.jpg">dark spots on the
leaves</a> that may show a target pattern. Sometimes, if the day and night temperatures
are not far apart, the ring pattern may not be as obvious. As the spots grow larger, they
develop a brownish to purple color. The leaves will yellow above the spots and as the
spots girdle the leaves, the leaf will die back above that point. Purple blotch is a
common disease of onions in South Dakota during periods of high temperatures and very high
humidity. In years with those conditions it is probably even more common than Botrytis
diseases.&nbsp; Purple blotch will be more severe as the season progresses and leaves age.
Sweet Spanish onions are among the most susceptible onion varieties. Fungicide
applications with <i>chlorothalonil</i> can reduce the spread of purple blotch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> SEPTORIA LEAF SPOT is
causing the characteristic spotting of lower tomato leaves. Typical symptoms <a href="../images/Septoria%20leaf%20spot%20on%20tomato%20leaf.jpg">include small dark
colored spots</a> on the leaves, followed by yellowing and leaf drop. The disease
overwinters on diseased plant debris from last season and is spread to new plants by
splashing rain. The first diseased leaves may be picked off to reduce spread but fungicide
treatments are usually the best means of control. <i>Chlorothalonil</i> (Daconil 2787)
treatments should begin with the first signs of the disease and continue throughout the
rest of the production season.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>INSECTS</em> </p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">

<p>F</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> APPLE MAGGOTS are probably emerging now and will
begin laying their eggs on apple fruit. The &quot;railroad worm,&quot; as it is called, is
the larva of a small insect that resembles a house-fly but has dark markings on the wings.
The adult emerges from the soil and goes off in search of apples. The adult lays an egg
just under the skin of the apple. The egg soon hatches into the maggot that feeds inside
the apple. Infested apples will typically have a small black speck on the skin of the
apple. The apple may also be &quot;dimpled&quot; where the egg has been laid. Small brown
streaks will be seen in the flesh of the apple where the maggot has fed. Infested fruit,
while unattractive, is still edible but has a much shorter storage life. Sticky red ball
traps may be used to monitor for the emergence of the adults. Begin treatment when five
adults have been captured on a sticky ball. Apply protective sprays of <i>malathion,
diazinon, Imidan</i> or use a combination orchard spray to reduce infestations. Some
people have reported good results by simply using 6 to 8 sticky traps in a few trees in a
yard to reduce damage to tolerable levels without using insecticides.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../images/colopotatobeetle.JPG">COLORADO POTATO BEETLES</a> continue to plague home
gardeners. Adults and larvae may be hand picked from the plant. Also, the <a href="../images/Colorado%20potato%20beetle%20eggs.jpg">bright yellow-orange egg clusters</a>
can be crushed when found on the undersides of leaves.<i> Carbaryl</i> (Sevin), <i>esfenvalerate</i>
(BugBGone)and <i>rotenone</i> can be effective but there is a lot of potential resistance
problems. <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> var. <i>tenebrionis </i>(<i>M_Trak</i>) is an
option. There are no known resistance problems to it, but <i>Bacillus</i> is only
effective against very young larvae. Keep potatoes well_watered to decrease susceptibility
to defoliation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V,H,F,W </font><font face="Arial" size="2">GRASSHOPPERS are
continuing feeding on many vegetables, flowers and turf. Some protection and control can
be gained by spraying with <i>Malathion, carbaryl</i> (Sevin),<i> Acephate) </i>(orthene)<i>,
chlorpyrifos</i> (Dursban), <i>esfenvalerate</i> (BugBGone)and<i> cyfluthrin </i>(Tempo)
on ornamental plants. Vegetables and fruit trees can be treated with sevin or <i>malathion</i>.
The garden will be best protected by treating them with <i>malathion</i>, <i>esfenvalerate</i>
(BugBGone),or <i>carbaryl</i> (Sevin) in combination with a treatment to areas bordering
the garden with <i>Tempo</i>. Wheat bran baits containing Sevin can also be used in the
garden. Re-spraying will be necessary as often as the grasshopper population continues to
rebuild. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">F</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> RASPBERRY CANE BORERS
may be attacking raspberry plants in the garden. This adult borer <a href="../images/raspberry%20cane%20borer.jpg">chews two rings around the stem</a>, near
the top and lays her egg in the stem. Later, the top of the stem dies while the larvae
begins feeding and tunneling in the stem. Best control is to prune out any canes that show
this feeding activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> SQUASH VINE BORER
DAMAGE is now readily apparent on squash and pumpkins. Examine vines that are wilting
during hot days. Infested plants will have stem bases that are swollen and may have a <a href="../images/Squash%20vine%20borer%20hole%20with%20frass.jpg">wet sawdust-like material
coming out of small holes in the stem</a>. If the stem is cut open, it will reveal
tunneling and a <a href="../images/Squash%20vine%20borer%20larva.jpg">cream colored worm</a>.
The adult is an attractive bluish moth, which looks like a wasp. The female deposits eggs
near the base of squash, pumpkin, and occasionally melon vines. Newly hatched larvae
immediately burrow into the stem where they continue to feed until they reach
approximately one inch in length. This feeding eventually kills the vines, although it
appears to happen quickly because the vines suddenly wilt. Vines must be protected from
late June through mid August from egg laying adults and newly hatched larvae with an
insecticide application to the base of plants. Dust formulations are probably best for
this insect, including <i>carbaryl</i> (Sevin),<i> rotenone</i>, and <i>methoxychlor</i>,
which is available as Ortho Vegetable Garden Insect Dust. Once the plant is infested, one
can try to &quot;surgically&quot; removing the larvae with a sharp knife, put the stem
back together and cover with soil. The plant may be saved by encouraging roots to develop
at other points along the stem by covering it with soil as well.</font></p>

<p><em>OTHER NOTES</em></p>
<font face="Arial" size="4">

<p>V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> POOR FRUIT SET is a common concern among many
gardeners on a number of vegetables. There have been many calls about tomatoes that look
great but have not set any fruit, the flowers just fall off. Fruit set is a rather
complicated process, dependant on many factors. Weather, specifically temperature and
moisture conditions being of primary importance. If conditions are not right, fruit set
will not occur. Plant development and nutrition levels in the soil are also important
factors. Cucurbits are also affected by these same factors with the added dimension of
having separate male and female flowers. Generally, the first flowers to be produced on
cucurbits are male, with more female flowers developing as the season progresses. High
temperatures will also greatly shorten the viable lifetime of pollen, decreasing the
chances of ovules in the fruit from being successfully fertilized. The general
recommendation for all garden plants is to keep water stress at a minimum, do not
over-fertilize and be patient. A healthy plant will eventually set fruit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4">V</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> POTATOES READY FOR
HARVEST can be found in many gardens around the state. Many of the early varieties have
already died down to the ground. In some cases this is because the plants have matured
naturally, but in most cases the vines were killed by various diseases, with early blight
being a prime factor. Many gardeners now have potato tubers that are at the soil surface
and are being exposed to sunlight which will turn the tubers green. Potato plants should
have soil pulled (hilled) up around the plants as they are growing to prevent tuber
greening also to provide space for more tubers to develop. Potatoes can be allowed to
remain in the garden soil for some time after the vines die down but can be subject to
re-sprouting or decay if soils get too wet. Potatoes are best stored in a cool (40-45F)
and humid location (80-90 %RH) for best results. </font></p>
