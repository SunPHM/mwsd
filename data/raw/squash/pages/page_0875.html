Just when we thought popular cookery guru Delia Smith was "all recipe-ed out" she turns over her chopping-board
and presents us with yet more fail-safe recipes - this time to suit our faster pace of life. If, in the past,
you have searched through her previous collections for that simple foolproof scone recipe, her inspired way with
fish, or those perfect Christmas cake ingredients, you might have wished there was a quicker way of navigating
through Deliadom (without clicking on to www.deliaonline.com).<BR>
What Delia's devotees (like me) really need is a library of popular favourites and this October sees the publication
of just this in <I>The Delia Collection</I> (BBC Worldwide, £9.99 each) in four titles: <I>Soup, Fish,
Chicken</I> and <I>Chocolate</I>, each containing 50 recipes.<BR>
"In compiling these collections I have chosen what I think are the best and most popular recipes. It is my hope that
my dedicated followers will appreciate an ordered library to provide easy access and a reminder of what has gone
before," says Delia.<BR><BR>

BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP WITH TOASTED SWEETCORN</FONT></B><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<BR>
"This is a very fine combination: the soft, velvety texture of the butternut makes the soup deliciously creamy
and the toasted sweetcorn provides contrasting flavour and crunch."<BR><BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Swiss,Helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#30C040">
Serves 6</FONT></B><BR><BR>

<B>1 lb 8oz (700g) butternut squash, or pumpkin, peeled, deseeded and chopped into 1-inch (2.5 cm) dice<BR>

1 lb 4oz (570g) sweetcorn (off-the-cob weight, from 5-6 cobs)<BR>

1oz (25g) butter, plus 1 teaspoon melted butter, for the sweetcorn<BR>

1 medium onion, finely chopped<BR>

10 fI oz (275ml) whole milk<BR>

1¼ pints (725ml) vegetable stock<BR>

salt and freshly milled<BR>

black pepper</B><BR><BR>

Begin by melting the butter in a medium (3 pint/1.75 litre) saucepan, then add the onion and soften it for
about 8 minutes. After that, add the chopped butternut squash (or pumpkin), along with half the sweetcorn,
then give everything a good stir and season with salt and pepper.<BR>
Put the lid on and, keeping the heat low, allow the vegetables to sweat gently and release their juices - this
should take about 10 minutes.<BR>
Next, pour in the milk and stock and simmer gently for about 20 minutes. Put the lid on for this but leave a
little gap (so it's not quite on) because, with the presence of the milk, it could boil over. Keep a close eye
on it anyway.<BR>
While that's happening, pre-heat the grill to its highest setting for 10 minutes. Mix the rest of the sweetcorn
with the melted butter, spread it out on a baking tray, season with salt and pepper and pop it under the hot
grill about 3 inches (7.5 cm) from the heat - it will take about 8 minutes to become nicely toasted and golden,
but remember to move the sweetcorn around on the baking tray halfway through.<BR>
When the soup is ready, leave it to cool a little, then pour it into a food processor or blender and blend it
to a purée, leaving a little bit of texture - it doesn't need to be absolutely smooth. You will probably need
to do this in two batches, in which case you'll need to have a large bowl handy to put the first batch into.
Serve the soup in warm bowls with the sweetcorn sprinkled over.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

ROASTED SALMON FILLETS WITH A CRUSTED PECORINO AND PESTO TOPPING</FONT></B><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<BR>
"This recipe, given to me by my friend Lin Cooper, has proved to be one of the most popular fish recipes I've
ever published. The combination of fresh pesto sauce with all its bold Italian flavours and fresh salmon is
sublime, and that's not all - the whole thing takes about 15 minutes from start to finish."<BR><BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Swiss,Helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#30C040">
Serves 2</FONT></B><BR><BR>

<B>2 skinless salmon fillets (5-6oz/150-175g each, and about ¾ inch/2cm thick)<BR>

1 rounded tablespoon finely grated Pecorino cheese<BR>

2 tablespoons fresh pesto sauce<BR>

juice of ½ lemon<BR>

2 tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs<BR>
 
salt and freshly milled black pepper<BR>

You will also need a baking tray, 10 x 14 inches (25.5 x 35cm), lined with foil and lightly oiled<BR>

Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 8, 450°F (230°C)</B><BR><BR>

Begin by trimming the fillets, if needed, and run your hand over the surface of the fish to check that there
aren't any stray bones lurking. Now place the fish on the prepared baking tray and give each one a good squeeze
of lemon juice and a seasoning of salt and pepper.<BR>
Next, give the pesto a good stir and measure 2 tablespoons into a small bowl, mix one-third of the breadcrumbs
with it to form a paste and spread this over both fish fillets.<BR>
Then, mix half the cheese with the remaining breadcrumbs and scatter this over the pesto, then finish off with
the remaining cheese.<BR>
Now place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and cook for 10 minutes, by which time the top should
be brown and crispy and the salmon just cooked and moist. Serve with steamed new potatoes.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

THAI GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN</FONT></B><BR CLEAR=ALL>

"This recipe was inspired by The Oriental's Cookery School in Bangkok. The unique flavours of Thai cooking are
so simple - and because you can use a good-quality cooked chicken from the supermarket - this recipe is actually easy."<BR><BR>

<B>1 lb (450g) cooked chicken, sliced into shreds<BR>

1 lemon grass stalk, sliced thinly and soaked for 30 minutes in 2 tablespoons lime juice<BR>

1 rounded teaspoon thinly shredded kaffir or normal lime peel<BR>

1-inch (2.5cm) piece peeled fresh galangal or ginger<BR>

1 heaped teaspoon chopped fresh coriander stalks<BR>

3 garlic cloves<BR>

5 Thai or normal shallots, peeled<BR>

1 teaspoon shrimp paste</B><BR><BR>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Swiss,Helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#30C040">
<I>For the finished sauce</I></FONT></B><BR>

<B>3-4 dessertspoons Thai fish sauce<BR>

1 teaspoon palm or soft brown sugar<BR>

3 dessertspoons fresh green peppercorns or green peppercorns in brine, drained<BR>

7 kaffir lime leaves, if you can find them<BR>

½ mild red chilli, deseeded and cut into hair-like shreds<BR>

1 oz (25g) fresh basil leaves, preferably Thai, torn</B><BR><BR>

The curry paste can be made well ahead of time and there's absolutely no work involved if you have a food
processor or a blender because all you do is simply pop all the curry paste ingredients in and whiz it to
a paste (stopping once or twice to push the mixture back down from the sides on to the blades). In Thailand,
of course, all these would be pounded by hand with a pestle and mortar, but food processors do cut out all
the hard work. What you need to end up with is a coarse paste, but don't worry if it doesn't look very green
- that is because I have cut the chilli content; in Thailand they use about 35! If you want yours to be green,
then this is the answer. Your next task is to prepare all the rest of the ingredients.<BR>
To make the curry, first place the tins of coconut milk on a work surface, upside down. Then open them and
inside you will see the whole thing has separated into thick cream and thin watery milk. Divide these by pouring
the milk into one bowl and the cream into another.<BR>
Next, place a large flameproof casserole or a wok, without any oil in it, over a very high heat and then as
soon as it becomes really hot, add three-quarters of the coconut cream. What you do now is literally fry it,
stirring all the time so it doesn't catch. What will happen is it will start to separate, the oil will begin
to seep out and it will reduce. Ignore the curdled look - this is normal. You may also like to note that when
the cream begins to separate you can actually hear it give off a crackling noise.<BR>
Next, add the curry paste and three-quarters of the coconut milk, which should be added a little at a time,
keeping the heat high and letting it reduce down slightly. Stay with it and keep stirring to prevent it sticking.<BR>
Then add the Thai fish sauce and sugar, stir these in and then add the shredded chicken and the peppercorns.
Stir again and simmer everything for about 4-5 minutes until the chicken is heated through.<BR>
Then just before serving, place the lime leaves one on top of the other, roll them up tightly and slice them
into very fine shreds, then add them, along with the red chilli and torn basil leaves.
