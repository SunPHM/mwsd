<font color="#E0FFFF" face="Arial" size="2">At the end of the 17th century, in the London central prison, an new sport was born:
<b>squash</b>. The name is derived from the effect a wall has on a ball when it is hit very hard. The game is played by two players in a closed room. There should be a wooden floor of 9,75 x 6,40 m. A squash ball is made of rubber and filled with air. It has a 4 cm diameter and a weight of about 24 gr. The ball has to be hit against the far wall at the first stroke. Then it can be played via the back- or side walls. </font></p>

<p><font color="#E0FFFF" face="Arial" size="2">There are different types of balls:<br>
-yellow dot: very slow<br>
-white dot: slow<br>
-red dot: medium<br>
-blue dot: fast</font></p>
<p><font color="#E0FFFF" face="Arial" size="2">In contrast to what you would think, the slowest balls are the most difficult to play. Official games are played with a yellow-dotted ball. At the beginning of the game, the ball is cold, resulting in less elasticity. After a while, the temperature of the air inside ball heats up by being hit, making it more springy. </font></p>
