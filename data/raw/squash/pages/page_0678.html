            Our most often asked question in the wintertime when everyone is pouring<span class="style11"><span class="style15"><strong></strong></span></span><span class="style11"><span class="style15"><strong></strong></span></span> 
            over those seed catalogs and ordering all of the new selections is, 
            “What variety of squash is a vine and which ones will climb?” 
            <p>Answer: Any that are not labeled or marked 
              “ <em>bush variety </em>” will probably be a vine. Some varieties 
              will grow very long vigorous vines easy to train vertically while 
              others will have short stumpy vines not as easy to train up your 
              vertical frame. </p>
            <p>Vertical growing of squash 
              is quite a unique procedure in the general gardening field, and 
              was virtually unknown by most of the traditional gardening authors, 
              methods and seed companies until SFG came along. The planting spacing 
              is quite different so it is not easy to find the right varieties 
              that will do what you want to do in your Square Foot Garden. Let's 
              see what sense we can make out of the whole situation. </p>
            <h1 class="style1 style16">Winter 
              Squash </h1>
            <p>First lets identify the 
              different types of squash. The first group is winter squash with 
              varieties like hubbard, acorn, and the favorite of many people, 
              butternut. These varieties are usually left to ripen on the vine 
              and are good for storing inside your house well into the winter. 
              You usually don't harvest them when they are young or eat them until 
              they have become full size. That usually happens only after the 
              vine has been killed by the first frost. After that frost, the vines 
              will turn yellow and die then become quite brittle. At that time 
              or slightly before, you can harvest the squash by cutting off and 
              leaving a stem on the squash for proper storage. They can be eaten 
              at any time after that. Just about every variety of winter squash 
              grows with a very vigorous vine and is very easy to grow vertically 
              as they will all climb by themselves. In fact, you have to keep 
              them from jumping from one vertical frame to another or from dropping 
              down from the vertical frame and starting to grow on the ground 
              crowding out the rest of your square feet of crops. In an old fashioned, 
              inefficient, single row garden, they just virtually take over the 
              whole patch. They spread rapidly, growing very long vines, but in 
              Square Foot Gardening, you can contain them on your vertical frame 
              and still receive the same harvest from just a few square feet on 
              the ground. Besides all that, they look spectacular growing on a 
              vertical frame. It is almost a living wall of green. </p>
            <h1 class="greenheaderbold">Summer 
              Squash </h1>
            <table width="199" border="0" align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
              <tr> 
                <td><div align="center">
                  <img src="images/Mel_squash_website.jpg" hspace="0" width="179" height="255"></div></td>
              </tr>
              <tr> 
                <td><span class="style21 style18"><strong> Just think how impressed 
                  your neighbors will be when you grow all your squash vertically 
                  in just a few square feet of ground space. </strong></span></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The next group of squash 
              are called summer squashes and these include varieties like straight 
              or crook neck, patty pan, and any soft variety of squash that you 
              eat right away. You harvest while the plant is growing and before 
              the squash gets too large. All of these varieties except those labeled 
              bush will grow in a vine type with some being very vigorous and 
              long vined while others have short stumpy vines. All the vine type 
              can be grown vertically by just keeping the end of the plant or 
              the vine up into your vertical netting or strings. They will hang 
              on all by themselves with their tentacles. You just have to keep 
              the top pointed up once a week or so. Remember now, this type of 
              squash you do not grow to maturity, as they will get quite large 
              and very tasteless. You harvest them very small, some just shortly 
              after their blossom phase where the fruit is only four to six inches 
              long. This type of squash does not store very well, certainly not 
              for a long period of time like winter squashes do. </p>
            <h1 class="greenheaderbold">Zucchini 
            </h1>
            <p>The last is also a summer 
              squash but is in a class all by itself. In fact, it is quite often 
              considered the queen of the garden. Everyone grows zucchini and 
              let me tell you, zucchini loves all the attention. She will take 
              over the garden with her leaves so big that each one will shade 
              out an entire square foot of some other plant. The plants get huge 
              although they do not have a long vigorous vine. Because the leaves 
              are so big and the leaf stem is so long and thick it is very hard 
              to coax them to grow vertically. They want to lay down on the ground 
              and spread out. In fact is very hard to figure out how to grow them 
              vertically. </p>
            <p class="greenheaderbold">My 
              Secret </p>
            <p>The trick is to have the 
              vertical support whether it be string or netting or just a stake, 
              very close to the plant. You can do that by putting a stake in the 
              ground first and then planting the seed or young plant around it 
              so you don't drive the stake into the roots of a growing plant. 
              That way it is much easier to gently lift and bend the plant end 
              up and tie to the stake or string. After you get it started up your 
              string or netting every few days it will have grown out a few inches. 
              Not up, but out and it will try to lay down again. You just gently 
              talk to it, lift that head up, and tie it again to your vertical 
              support. You just keep doing that every couple of days. </p>
            <p class="greenheaderbold">Why 
              Vertical </p>
            <p>Because of all of the 
              advantages. What are the advantages and is it all worthwhile ? It 
              seems like a lot of work doesn't it. Well first it is a challenge, 
              next it is kind of fun and third it looks great in your garden. 
              Of course, the real reason is so it doesn't take up so much space 
              in your Square Foot Garden, only a couple square feet. Now here 
              is the “ <em>coupe de grace” </em>? Or in gardening terms, here's 
              the “ <em>cooty grow </em>”. After I perfected this method of growing 
              vines vertically on a frame or Stake, I noticed a completely different 
              growth pattern of the basic squash plant, particularly the summer 
              squashes. In single row gardening, the plant spreads out with its 
              single stem having blossoms and fruit forming near the near. Back 
              near the base the leaves start dying and the stem becomes quite 
              ugly. The end continues to grow new leaves and fruit but only out 
              there at the end. With Square Foot Gardening and growing the squash 
              vertically I noticed almost the opposite growth pattern. Once the 
              plant got a few feet high instead of the bottom stem being bare 
              and ugly, the plant started sending out new leaves and fruit all 
              along the bottom and middle of the plant. No ugly bare base was 
              visible, hence it was not only much more attractive, took up less 
              space, but turned out to be more productive, more fruit per plant 
              as well as more fruit per square foot. Now you can't beat that so 
              why not give it a try. </p>
            <p>Please don't write us 
              or call us and ask what is the best variety that you can order so 
              you can grow it vertically. Call or email the seed company and tell 
              them that you want to grow a strong vigorous vine vertically for 
              your Square Foot Garden. They know their own varieties better than 
              we do and can advise you on the best variety to select for that 
              purpose. Good Luck and have fun! </p>
            <p>P.S. One of the reasons 
              it's hard to get up to date practical advice for vertical gardening 
              is that most of the gardening world is still teaching everyone how 
              to grow the old-fashioned, inefficient single-row gardening method. 
              In addition, they do the same thing with the vine crops—their advice 
              is give them plenty of room so they can spread out and grow. In 
              addition, the same wasteful practice of planting many seeds, then 
              going back and thinning them out again, is still preached. For example, 
              I'm looking right now at one of the prominent seed company's package 
              and the directions for their zucchini squash is to “plant four to 
              six seeds in groups or hills, spaced 1-1/2 to 2 ft. apart along 
              rows spaced 4 ft. apart. Then they say thin to the two strongest 
              plants in the group. Now think about that for a minute. All the 
              companies guarantee that about 95% of their seeds will sprout. It's 
              called the germination rate. So, if 95% of 4-6 seeds will sprout, 
              that's 4-6 plants. Then they say thin to two. So why plant six if 
              you only want two ? That's a lot of extra work and many wasted seeds. 
            </p>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">And next, I'm going to 
              quote from one of the very well recognized garden writers of America, 
              on how to plant your squash. He suggests (uh-oh—I've given away 
              who it could be, by at least 50%) plant a seed about every 8 inches 
              in a row with the rows being 3-4 ft. apart, with the final distance 
              between the plants 36 inches. Now why plant one every 8 inches only 
              to rip out 3 of every 4 you plant ? Does that make any sense ? Why 
              that's 75% WASTE. Using his directions, you would need between 9 
              and 12 sq. ft. per plant. Now if you look at the SFG book for summer 
              squash grown vertically, it's recommended that three plants be spaced 
              in a 4 sq. ft. which equals one and one-third sq. ft. per plant. 
              That sure is a huge difference from the 9-12 sq. ft. needed. Actually, 
              it's almost 10 times as much. Why waste all that space? Space that 
              has to be amended, fenced, fertilized and roto-tilled, watered then 
              weeded. It just doesn't make sense does it? So, stick with SFG and 
              grow all your vine crops vertically on a strong frame like the one 
              I've described in the book.</p>
