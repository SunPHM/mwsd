							After many weeks of playing with a certain piece of blu tack i had lying around
							my room, I got quite attached to it, and so, decided to give the little sucker
							a name, and make a dodgy website about him
							<P>
							He lives at the top corner of my monitor, living a peaceful life, until it is
							interupted by the poking and prodding (by me) when i'm bored. 
							<P>
							So I asked a few chaps off msn to suggest names for a lovely lump of blue tack,
							and a vote was held, it was a fearcly fought event (see news), and it turned
							out that my lump of tack would forever be known as Burk!
							<P>
							Nehu, have fun on the site, have a look at the pictures of the wee chap, he's
							quite friendly, and remember to visit often, Burk does like lotsa friends to
							play with :)

									well, it's been a while ...

								<P>
								Not much has happened over the past 3 weeks or so, mainly because of the many
								election parties Burk had to attend, it's a stressful life being a piece of
								blutack, especially such a high profile piece of tack as our friend Burk!
								<P>
								He's been up to his antics again, and i've updated the pictures, remember to

								</font size>
								<P>
								After a short enquiry into the somewhat suprising number of Votes for Burk from
								a Single Voting Party, the board is 
								sufficiently happy with the evidence provided to Award the name of "Burk" to
								the piece of blue tack!
								<p>
								I offer my commiserations to the other names submitted... it was a well faught
								fight, with over 20,000 votes in the end, over 
								10 000 coming in on the last day, and over 4000 in the last hour, that averages
								over 1 clicks per second! Superhuman!
								<P>
								Now the voting's over, Burk can carry on with his life, but feeling more
								fulfilled and happy, as he's finally realised as a 
								real person!
								<P>
								Please come visit us again soon, to keep up with the adventures of burk!

									WE HAVE A NEW LEADER!
								</B>
								<P>
								Late on during the night, after a dull day of few votes, a new leader emerged 
								.. from nowhere...!
								<P>
								It seems a single, anonymous voter has racked up over 2000 votes which were
								required to bring Burk into the leader position!
								<P>
								In other news, Jim Bob Edged up past Bluie, and could be another candidate for
								the leader position!

								Anyway, it's late, and i have scary exam tomorrow, wish me luck chaps:)

									Could Jim Bob Make a Comeback?
								</B>
								<P>
								After a reasonably mundane day of voting, with very little activity occuring on
								the results, it appears that Jim Bob could be making a comeback!
								<P>
								After Brian crossed the 2000 votes mark, and all interest in Bluie seemed to
								disappear, it was beginning to look like it was becoming a one horse race. But
								during the later part of the day, the votes for Jim Bob started slowly racking
								up...
								<P>
								This seems to have tallied with the fan pic that was sent in earlier today,
								showing there must be a healthy fan base for Jim Bob
								<P>
								However, Jim Bob Still has a way to go before catching vote leader, Brian, and
								Bluie may yet make a comeback into the voting stakes!

									Well ... what an interesting 2 days it's been in the voting world!
								</B>
								<p>
								The votes started off, with 2 clear leaders taking a brief lead, It was tied
								between Burk and Weebl for a short while, but it was a short reign of power...
								<p>
								Another 2 candidates became the favourites, none other than Arnold and Jim Bob,
								work continued on these two champions for many hours raking up around one
								thousand votes between them!
								<p>
								This was ofcourse until a third contender entered the scene...
								<p>
								Bring in Brian ... Making an astounding Run from the back, left Jim Bob and
								Arnold in it's dust, quickly building up over 1000 votes became the ruler of
								the voting board!
								<p>
								At voting Close (when I went to sleep) The order was as follows ...
								<p>
								<ol>
									<li>
									Brian
									</li>
									<li>
									Jim Bob
									</li>
									<li>
									Arnold
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
								But ... on viewing the voting board today, it emerges we have a new leader on
								the board, None other than Bluie! making a suprise debut onto the naming list!
								<P>
								Things can only continue to heat up as the Voting Continues!
