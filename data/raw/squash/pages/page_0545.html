Prettiest Garden Pest</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in" align="center"><font size="5">
Late June, 2002</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">Many of us in the southern 
Appalachians are watching with delight as our tiny garden plants finally begin 
to take off. Now, at last, they seem to be responding to our care, safely 
outgrowing the pests that have threatened to devour them. The late frosts are 
finally past, the cool mornings are gone, and the garden seems unstoppable.&nbsp; 
Right now, however, the loveliest, but most insidious of garden pests arrives: 
the squash borer moth. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">These moths lay copper-colored 
eggs on the stems of squash plants just above the level of the ground. The eggs 
are not easy to see, but look like a row of tiny b.b.’s on the green stems. In 
only a few days, the eggs hatch and the hungry caterpillars cut their way into 
the center of the stem. There the caterpillars live, safe from predators and 
from pesticides. They eat the heart of the squash stem, eventually killing the 
entire plant. A little pile of sawdust-like feces oozing from a hole in the stem 
is all you’ll see.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">You mostly don’t know that your 
squashes harbor the caterpillars until it is too late. If you catch them early 
enough, either split the stems lengthwise and remove the worms, or ram a piece 
of wire into the hole and skewer them. The squash stem will heal, and if covered 
over with soil, it will sprout more roots. Unfortunately, once the plants are 
wilted and dying because of the feasting caterpillars, there isn’t much you can 
do. Prevention is the only medicine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">The adult moths are present for 
just a couple of weeks in late June, sometimes lingering into early July. Some 
people cover their plants with row covers during this time so that the moths 
can’t get to the plants. However, this also prevents honeybees or other 
pollinators from pollinating the flowers. Others use organic pesticides such as 
neem, pyrethrin, or rotenone to dust the bases of the plants, which is also a 
bit of a trick. Those same pollinators are killed by pesticides just as 
effectively as the squash borer. Still others pile soil around the plants right 
up to the first true leaves, which discourages, but doesn’t prevent, the moths 
from laying eggs. A daily spritzing of the squash stems with soapy water will 
kill the eggs and is also a great way to kill aphids on other plants without 
harming pollinators. If you must use pesticides, only apply them in the late 
evening after the blooms have closed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">If your zucchini, pumpkin, and 
yellow squash plants died last year, be on the look-out for the moths. They less 
often bother butternut squash, cucumbers, or melons because the stems are small 
and hard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">The moth itself is 
beautiful—hardly the picture of devastation! Almost all the moths whose larvae 
are borers are clear-winged moths. You can actually see through their 
hind-wings!&nbsp; Squash borers are about an inch long. They have brightly-colored, 
orange and black, furry tufts on their bodies and legs. They fly low and very 
fast. The clear wings, bright colors, size, and flight pattern make them look 
like wasps instead of moths.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">So if you see pretty wasps 
visiting your squash plants in late June and early July, look a little closer. 
They might be the beginning of the end of your squash plants! Catch and destroy 
any adult moths, and protect your plants. If your plants are severely infected, 
pull them up and either burn or crush them flat to kill the larvae. Check daily 
for the eggs on the stems, and Good Luck!</p>
