    <td width="100%">We would like you to meet Tyler and Sagar.
      Tyler is seven years old and Sagar is seven as well. Tyler lives in upstate New
      York in a city called Oswego, while Sagar lives in Northern India in a
      city called Lucknow. We followed each child for a day to get an idea of
      what they might do in a typical day. The purpose is compare and contrast
      the lives of two children of relative age living in opposite sides of the
      world. What are the similarities and differences. As you might imagine there
      are both. Take a look at their story&nbsp;</td>

      loves to color and even won a local coloring contest.&nbsp;Tyler is very inquisitive and loves to learn. His favorite
      dinner food is macaroni and cheese with chocolate milk. After dinner his
      Grandmother came over to visit and they worked on building a small garden
      in their side yard. They would grow squash and cucumbers. Tyler was very
      excited and worked hard at turning the soil.</p>

        Here we have our Sagar Gandhi playing the Harmonium and singing. I wonder
      whether you have seen this instrument? Its kind of a portable piano invented by a famous medieval
      Indian musician about 400 or 500 years back.&nbsp;Sagar doesn't collect anything but is learning music and singing.
        He can play a number of instruments and sings in Hindi and English (western music) styles.
        He knows a number of devotional songs and can sing them rather well.</p>
