A year ago today we burned with questions. Will Tom and Nicole really do it on
screen? Just how unbearable can Jar-Jar Binks be? Yet this season, with May
scarcely upon us, many filmgoers have already have caught what may be the
summer's hottest ticket: Russell Crowe scowling, squinting, and slashing his
way through <i>Gladiator</i>, Ridley Scott's $100 million toga party. It's like
opening your biggest Christmas present in October. What more could there be? <p>
Well, plenty. Some 140 films crowd the cinematic slate, reflecting everything
from supersized blockbusters and rowdy teen pics to auteurist comedy and the
inevitable ripoffs of hits past. Still, expect the unexpected: given a line-up
that features the first Revolutionary War picture in decades, new releases by
Woody Allen, John Waters, and the Farrelly Brothers, and the debuts of Martin
Lawrence in drag and the Blair Witch chick without her stocking cap, the odds
are good that Hollywood isn't peaking with Crowe's Roman holiday.<p>
Once again, a lot depends on Tom Cruise. Indeed, his headlining role in last
summer's much anticipated but coolly disappointing <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>
stalled the release of what should be one of this season's bona fide megahits:
<i>Mission: Impossible 2</i> (May 24). Cruise reprises his role as the slick
Ethan Hunt, who here must save the world from something even more lethal than a
long speech by Sydney Pollack: a synthetic virus. Filmed Down Under by
<i>Face/Off</i>'s John Woo, this Memorial Day opener also stars Anthony Hopkins
and <i>Beloved</i>'s Thandie Newton.<p>
Locally, at least, Wolfgang Petersen's $100 million adaptation of Sebastian
Junger's Gloucester-set bestseller <b><i>The Perfect Storm</i> </b>(June 30)<b>
</b>should wallop theaters like a hatch-battening nor'easter. It boasts the
reunion of <i>Three Kings</i> buddies George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg; what's
more, if memory serves, expensive movies about waterlogged boats tend to do
pretty well.<p>
At one point, Mel Gibson was tagged for the Clooney role in <i>Storm,</i> but
this Fourth of July he takes a cue from Will Smith and joins forces with
<i>Independence Day</i> director Roland Emmerich for the $80 million epic
<b><i>The Patriot</i></b><i> </i>(June 30). Imagine a colonial-era Mad Max, or
<i>Braveheart</i>'s William Wallace in a three-cornered hat, and you'll get the
gist of Gibson's turn as a Revolutionary War soldier out to kick some serious
British butt. <p>
Maybe Gibson liked this role <i>too </i>much: he then swapped his Yankee Doodle
for some cockadoodledoo to voice an American rooster stuck in a Yorkshire
henhouse in DreamWorks' feature-length animated romp <b><i>Chicken Run</i></b>
(June 23)! This farmyard flick is directed by Nick Park and Peter Lord, the
Oscar-winning team behind the wildly popular "Wallace and Gromit" shorts. Other
animated offerings ditch the traditional Disney approach as well: <b><i>Titan
A.E.</i></b> (June 16), a $55 million cool-boy cartoon, taps the voices of Matt
Damon and Drew Barrymore; Disney's <b><i>Dinosaur</i> </b>(May 19), the tale of
a motherless baby iguanodon, blends computer-generated imagery with live-action
backdrops; and the big-screen version of <b><i>The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle</i></b><i> </i>(June 30) stars real people, including Robert De Niro
as Fearless Leader, Jason Alexander as Boris Badenov, and Rene Russo as Natasha
Fatale.<p>
From the pages of Marvel Comics comes Bryan Singer's <b><i>The X-Men</i></b>
(July 14), the first in a series of adventures about genetic mutants -- played
by Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, and Halle Berry -- who use their
freakiness to fight evil. Bad-ass Jackie Chan is also on the side of the law in
<b><i>Shanghai Noon</i></b> (May 26) as a Chinese imperial guard sent to the
Old West to rescue a princess (<i>Ally</i> <i>McBeal</i>'s Lucy Liu).<p>
<IMG SRC="/archive/movies/00/05/11/image/WhatLiesBeneath.gif" ALT="'What Lies Beneath'" ALIGN=left WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="170" BORDER="0" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="5">
But the most formidable pairing of the summer may come in Disney's <b><i>The
Kid</i> </b>(July 7), which ingeniously matches Bruce Willis
with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a cute tyke (Spencer Breslin). This time, though, the
boy doesn't see dead people; he's the eight-year-old version of Willis's
bristly baby boomer. Director Robert Zemeckis (<i>Forrest Gump</i>), on the
other hand, is drawn to the underworld with <b><i>What Lies Beneath</i></b>
(July 21), a supernatural thriller that finds Harrison Ford and Michelle
Pfeiffer investigating spooky goings-on in a small town.<p>
Big movies aside, the summer will unveil the latest efforts of a cadre of big
directors. Woody Allen returns to <i>Take the Money and Run</i> territory with
<b><i>Small Time Crooks</i></b> (May 19), a closely guarded Manhattan-set caper
starring Hugh Grant, Tracey Ullman, Michael Rapaport, and Woody himself.
<i>Afterglow</i>'s Alan Rudolph unleashes Nick Nolte as a randy senator and
Emily Watson as an undercover casino cop in <b><i>Trixie</i></b> (June 30). The
Farrelly Brothers follow up <i>There's Something About Mary</i> with <b><i>Me,
Myself and Irene</i></b><i> </i>(June 23), another nothing's-sacred comedy in
which Jim Carrey stars as a Rhode Island state trooper with multiple
personalities. Also next month, the Coen Brothers will release a directors' cut
of their flamboyantly clever 1984 homage to film noir, <b><i>Blood
Simple</i></b> (June 2).<p>
John Waters mines his own early kooky career in <b><i>Cecil B. Demented</i>
</b>(August 11), a farce about a band of underground filmmakers who kidnap a
famous actress (Melanie Griffith). James Garner and Tommy Lee Jones join
director and star Clint Eastwood in <b><i>Space Cowboys</i></b> (August 4), a
drama about aging astronauts. Fellow actor-turned-director Robert Redford
rounds up Matt Damon, Charlize Theron, and Will Smith for the mystical period
piece <i>cum</i> golf movie <b><i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i></b><i>
</i>(August 4). Meanwhile, Peter Greenaway (<i>The Pillow Book</i>) keeps
things kinky with <b><i>8-1/2 Women</i></b> (May 26), the story of two guys
who, after sleeping together, start their own harem.<p>
Sex and relationships are also the subject of a handful of young hipster
dramas. Based on a <i>GQ</i> magazine article, <b><i>Coyote Ugly</i></b>
(August 4), tracks the pretty bar help at a chi-chi Manhattan watering hole.
Greg Harrison's <b><i>Groove</i> </b>(June 9) gets down with the San Francisco
rave scene. But Gwyneth Paltrow isn't exactly partying in Don (<i>The Opposite
of Sex</i>) Roos's <b><i>Bounce</i></b> (July 7), which casts her as a widow
who's ignorant of the connection between her dead husband and new lover Ben
Affleck.<p>
The crumbs of last year's baked-goods blockbuster <i>American Pie</i> are all
over this season's fare. Star Jason Biggs reunites with castmate Mena Suvari
(<i>American Beauty</i>) in Amy Heckerling's <b><i>Loser</i> </b>(July 21) and
then joins last year's summer It Girl, <i>The Blair Witch Project's</i> Heather
Donahue, in <b><i>Boys and Girls</i></b><i> </i>(June 2). Also prominent is
director/writer Chris Weitz, who stars in <b><i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i></b> (July
14) and, with his director/writer brother Paul, helms a remake of 1948's
<i>Here Comes Mr. Jordan </i>by way of the 1978 remake <i>Heaven Can Wait</i>;
it's called <b><i>I Was Made To Love Her</i> </b>(July 28). <i>Dogma</i>'s
Chris Rock lands the Robert Montgomery/Warren Beatty role of the dead man given
a second chance at life.<p>
<IMG SRC="/archive/movies/00/05/11/image/Shaft.gif" ALT="'Shaft'" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="232" BORDER="0" HSPACE="15" VSPACE="5">
Several other old films will also get that chance. Brendan Fraser livens up the
Dudley Moore role in a modern version of the 1967 comedy
<b><i>Bedazzled</i></b> (August 11), Angelina Jolie and Nicolas Cage team up in
a rehash of the 1974 crime-drama <b><i>Gone in 60 Seconds</i></b><i> </i>(June
9), and Samuel L. Jackson reincarnates that mean mutha -- shut yo' mouth! -- in
John Singleton's update of the 1971 blaxploitation classic <b><i>Shaft</i>
</b>(June 16).<p>
Eddie Murphy dominates one of the summer's few sequels: <b><i>Nutty 2: The
Klumps</i></b> (July 28). No small feat -- here the comedian not only reprises
his dual role of Sherman Klump and Buddy Love but also expands the brilliant
dinner scene from the original, in which he hilariously played all the Klump
clan. Still, he's not the only guy wearing a dress this summer. Martin Lawrence
dons a D-cup and more as an undercover cop in <b><i>Big Momma's
House</i></b><i> </i>(June 2). And <i>The End of the Affair</i>'s Ralph Fiennes
tackles three roles in <b><i>Sunshine</i></b> (June 9), the award-winning drama
by director Istv&aacute;n Szab&oacute;.<p>
John Travolta packs on the special-effects make-up as the nine-foot alien star
of the first in a constellation of sci-fi flicks, <b><i>Battlefield
Earth</i></b><i> </i>(May 12). Based on the bestseller by Scientology founder
L. Ron Hubbard, the adventure is directed -- no joke -- by Roger Christian.
Director Paul Verhoeven, who won cult favor with 1997's <i>Starship
Troopers</i>, makes Kevin Bacon disappear as a military scientist who discovers
a formula for invisibility in <b><i>The Hollow Man</i></b><i> </i>(July 28).
<b><i>Impostor</i> </b>(August 11) finds Gary Sinise and Madeleine Stowe
chasing extraterrestrial life. Jennifer Lopez takes a trip through, well, inner
space when she literally gets into the psyche of a comatose serial killer in
<b><i>The Cell</i></b> (August 18).<p>
And, finally, if Russell Crowe with bared teeth and bared knees doesn't do it
for you, that old standby William Shakespeare waits in the wings. Kenneth
Branagh sets <b><i>Love's Labour's Lost</i></b><i> </i>(June 23) in the late
1930s as stars Alicia Silverstone and Alessandro Nivola sing and dance their
way through a score by Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin, and Jerome
Kern. And Michael Almereyda's modern-day <b><i>Hamlet</i> </b>(May 19) casts a
bed-headed Ethan Hawke as the melancholy one, who aspires, of all things, to be
an independent filmmaker.
