        The USA is fighting an uphill battle on the use of protective eyewear. 
        They wanted to amend the rules with a motion to ensure that junior players 
        competing in senior events should wear protective goggles. Australia expressed 
        concern that, if a top junior player is competing in senior event and

        <b>SUSIE Simcock for Prez, Part 11 </b><br>
        At the next AGM in Melbourne in October, there will be a move to allow 
        <a href="wsfpr231.htm">President Susie Simcock</a> to stand for a fourth 
        term, as reported in my last Gallery. This is how George Mieras of Scotland 
        uses his eloquence to persuade the members: </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"We 
        do have a unique situation at the moment with squash at one of, if not 
        the most, decisive moment ever faced by the sport: Possible entry to the 
        summer Olympic Games. This is <img src="../../photos/britishopen01/simcock.jpg" width="230" height="268" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">undoubtedly 
        the most important issue in the minds of probably all Members. Massive 
        efforts have been put into the bid by successive boards with considerable 
        progress made, especially in the past 5 years. Several members have made 
        the point that the current President of the WSF is uniquely placed to 
        further this work and provide vital continuity. </font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;President 
    Susie Simcock has gained massive experience over the past 11 years: it is 
    also the case (rightly or wrongly) that having a woman President of a World 
    Federation is a distinct advantage in such negotiation and also our President 
    sits on some key committees giving her –and, as a result, us - access to important 
    decision makers in the IOC. These are personal positions which would be most 
    unlikely to be gained by a successor for some years. All of these factors 
    point to the WSF having in our current President a uniquely valuable asset 
    when it comes to progressing the Olympic bid. Whilst wishing to retain the 
    principle of change, Scotland recognises that during this critical period 
    practical expedience should perhaps take priority over principle. What we 
    propose, therefore, would allow our current President to offer herself, if 
    she chooses, as a candidate for the elections in 2002 and 2004 for two further 
    periods of 2 years." </font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Well 
    said George. You certainly got my vote. </font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>THE 
    WORLD OPEN IS ON (WHEN THEY FIND THE MONEY) </b><br>
    When the PSA and ProCam became partners in an agreement for four world Opens 
    to take place in Mumbai, they completely ignored the </font><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Squash 
    Rackets Federation of India (SRFI)</font></font><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
    who then said the event would not be sanctioned because they were not consulted. 
    (All world championships are held with the co-operation with the governing 
    body of the host country).</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
    Which is why I wrote, a couple of months back that the Men’s world open in 
    November would not take place. According to the WSF handbook: "After long 
    and difficult communications the SRFI secretary general, N. Ramachandran, 
    met with PSA, ProCam and WSF representatives in July 2001 and was given sufficient 
    reassurance on future relationship to withdraw the veto on sanctioning. The 
    World Open is now confirmed in December 2001 with the SRFI fully involved." 
    All they have to do now is find a sponsor and $150,000 of prize money. </font></font></p>

    BIDDER ? In Squash ? YOU MUST BE KIDDING </b><br>
    With the Peter Nicol, switching from Scotland to England, John White from 
    Australia to Scotland, Carol Owens from Australia to New Zealand and Carla 
    Khan from England to Pakistan, some org. people in squash are getting a bit 
    queasy. Ireland are proposing a WSF regulation that would bar a player from 
    representing a country at senior level if they have already played for another 
    country as a senior in a world championship.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
    This would not affect a player who represented his/her country as a junior 
    and then switched countries when s/he became a senior. Switching countries, 
    in the opinion of Irish Squash: "negates the whole principle of International 
    competition. Unlike professional sport, international competition is not about 
    money but rather the honour of representing your country of birth." </font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
    must say I simply don’t understand the inclusion of the phrase, ‘unlike professional 
    sport.’ I always thought Nicol, Owens, White and Khan played for money.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
    The Irish Motion continues: " We believe if athletes are allowed to move from 
    one country to another there is a real danger that "the highest bidder" scenario 
    may become the norm…we believe that some players would not be above using 
    the threat of leaving their country to extract unreasonable favours from their 
    governing bodies." On the other hand, those sort of threats could help to 
    wake up the dullards and tinpot dictaros who so often inhabit the governing 
    bodies and who treat the players as their serfs. </font></font></p>

    After the tragic, shocking and unreal terrorist activities in New York, airline 
    security went into overdrive with anything sharp being confiscated from bags 
    and purses. But Dave Peck, the pro at Colets Club (where I play squash) got 
    a nasty headache when booking his team on to Air France for the hop across 
    the Channel to Rennes for the European Club championships. "No racquets on 
    board," he was told. "We’ll put them in the hold," replied Dave. </font></font></p>
  <p><font size="1"><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">"No 
    racquets on board, either in the hold or in the cabin," they said firmly. 
    Dave collared me in the dressing room, knowing that I was going by train via 
    Eurostar, like a real gentleman should. "You may have to carry 20 or thirty 
    rackets," he said. My pleasure I replied, wondering how much I could get for 
    top rackets on the streets of Paris. If you think that a racquet is not a 
    dangerous weapon, watch a beginning with a wide backswing. </font></font></p>

        taken away after two days, which would have meant all the players paying 
        hotel fees as well as their lost airline ticket. Luckily Sharon Brady

    a mark of respect to the disaster, he would <a href="../../usopen/reports_01_2.htm">take 
    away the five stars from the event</a>, de-sanction it. Really! How does de-sanctioning
