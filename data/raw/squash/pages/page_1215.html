<TD ROWSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"><P>Although <B>striped cucumber beetle</B> (see
photo, left) and <B>squash bug</B> (below, left) infestations have been very
low throughout the summer, we are beginning to see an increase in insect counts
this week. This time of year, it is common to see either or both pests
aggregating on pumpkin or squash fruit, often feeding near the top of the
fruit. Beetles are likely moving to cucurbit fruit as vine/leaf tissues begin
to die down (watch for first frost). Although fruit damage may currently be
low, growers should continue to monitor fruit quality between now and harvest.
Plant samples taken at Rosemount this past week (Sept. 10th) indicated approx.
3/60 pumpkins (5%) with some feeding damage. However, one reason for concern is
that beetle counts increased dramatically in the past 3 days. Counts increased
to 35-120/trap between Sept. 10-13, at Rosemount (Dakota Co.). Feeding damage
is usually aggregated in fields (due to beetle feeding/aggregation behavior),
and &#147;spot&#148; treatments, vs. whole-field sprays, can often alleviate
the problem. Because treatment may be needed, and may occur near harvest,
growers should be very careful to note the pre-harvest interval (minimum number
of days before harvest) for a given insecticide. A few selected options, with
pre-harvest intervals, are shown below. </P>
