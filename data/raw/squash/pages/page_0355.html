            This vascular wilt disease caused by the bacterium <em>Erwinia tracheiphila</em> 
            affects only certain members of the cucumber family including cucumber, 
            squash, muskmelon, pumpkin, and gourd. Watermelon is immune and certain 
            varieties of cucumber and squash show varying degrees of resistance 
            to this disease. Bacterial wilt causes losses of 10 to 20 percent 
            in unsprayed plantings of susceptible cucurbits.<br>

            </font><font size="5"><u>Symptoms</u></font></p>
          <p><font size="3">Symptoms of the disease first appear on a single leaf 
            which suddenly wilts and becomes dull green (Figure 1.). The wilting 
            symptoms spread up and down the runner sometimes as a recurring wilt 
            on hot, dry days. Soon infected runners and leaves turn brown and 
            die. The bacteria spread through the xylem vessels of the infected 
            runner to the main stem, then to other runners. Eventually the entire 
            plant shrivels and dies. Less susceptible plants, such as certain 
            squash varieties, may show dwarfing of growth before the wilt symptoms 
            become apparent. <br>

          <p><font size="3">A creamy white bacterial ooze consisting of thousands 
            of microscopic, rod-shaped bacteria may sometimes be seen in the xylem 
            vascular bundles of an affected stem if it is cut crosswise near the 
            ground and squeezed. This bacterial ooze will string out forming fine, 
            shiny threads (like a spider's web) if a knife blade or finger is 
            pressed firmly against the cut surface, then slowly drawn away about 
            1 cm. Two cut stem ends can also be put together, squeezed, then separated 
            to look for shiny strands of bacteria. The sap of a healthy plant 
            is watery and will not string. Sometimes it helps to wait several 
            minutes after cutting to perform the test. This technique is useful 
            in field diagnosis to separate this disease from other vascular wilts. 
            Beware, however, that the technique may not always work (i.e., no 
            bacterial strings occur yet the plant is still infected). The test 
            works better for cucumbers than for muskmelons.<br>
            <br>
            Fruit may also show symptoms. Small water-soaked patches form on the 
            surface. These patches eventually turn into shiny decayed spots on 
            the fruit.<u><br>

            </u></font><font size="4"><u><br>
            </u></font><font size="3">Bacterial wilt is an unusual disease in 
            that the bacterial pathogen can survive the winter only in the digestive 
            tract of striped cucumber beetles and spotted cucumber beetles. In 
            spring the overwintered bacteria land on cucurbit leaves within the 
            fecal droppings of beetles which have begun to feed on the plants. 
            The bacteria can then infect the plant through wounds produced by 
            the feeding of the beetles or other chewing insects. Bacteria cannot 
            infect the plant through normal plant openings (stomates and hydathodes) 
            nor are they carried on or in seed. The beetles' mouthparts become 
            contaminated with the bacteria while feeding on infected leaves. In 
            this manner the beetles carry the bacteria to the next three or four 
            plants on which they feed. Beetles apparently prefer to feed on plants 
            with bacterial wilt symptoms. Fortunately, only a small number of 
            beetles become active carriers of the bacteria and infection can only 
            take place when there is a film of water on the leaf sufficient for 
            the bacteria to reach a wound and gain entry into the inner leaf tissue.<u><br>
            <br>
            </u>Weather conditions have an indirect effect on the disease. Environmental 
            conditions which favor the ovenwintering, feeding, and reproduction 
            of the cucumber beetles will affect the prevalence of bacterial wilt. 
            A year with a good winter snow cover followed by a warm March and 
            April could be expected to increase the number of beetles and therefore 
            increase the incidence of bacterial wilt.<u><br>

            </u></font><font size="5"><u>Management Strategies</u></font><br>
            <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
            Bacterial wilt may be reduced by controlling the cucumber beetles. 
            They may be prevented from feeding on plants in the home garden by 
            enclosing the plants in wire or cheesecloth tents supported by a wooden 
            or wire framework as soon as they come through the ground in the spring. 
            The cheesecloth is stretched over the frame and its lower edges weighted 
            with stones or soil to prevent beetles from crawling underneath. This 
            tent should be removed as soon as the plant becomes well established.<br>
            </font><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
            Larger plantings must be protected by insecticides. Some carbaryl 
            (Sevin), malathion, or rotenone insecticides or combination products 
            are registered to treat cucumber beetles in the home garden in New 
            York State. They will provide control of the beetles if applied when 
            beetles first appear in the spring. Early control, beginning as soon 
            as the plants emerge, is most important as a single beetle can introduce 
            the bacteria. One to four generations of the beetle may occur on unprotected 
            plants and applications of these insecticides at weekly intervals 
            may become necessary. Apply a light even coating of the insecticide 
            over the entire plant, especially where the stem emerges from the 
            soil (that is where the beetles often congregate). <br>
