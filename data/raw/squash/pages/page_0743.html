				<p>I found more space for tulips in our backyard, so I planted fifteen more bulbs the other day.&nbsp; If they all come up, I don't think that we'll be filling in with many annuals next spring! I am trying out these varieties: </p>

<p>Two of them are&quot;bouquet&quot; tulips - apparently each stem has multiple blooms. I haven't seen any in real life, but they looked neat in the photo at the garden centre. </p>

<p>Shrubs were also being cleared out at 50% off the regular price, so I picked up a <a href="http://greenwoodnursery.com/page.cfm/4703">drawf burning bush</a> for $15. If it doesn't survive the next year, I can get a credit for the $15 from the garden centre, so that's not bad. I've never planted a shrub before, so it's kind of scary and exciting!</p>

				<p>Tulips are planted. I stuck them about eight inches deep, with a healthy dose of bone meal mixed into the soil. <a href="http://laura.typepad.com/goingdomestic/2005/07/the_mystery_of_.html">I'd earlier speculated</a> that I didn't have any blooms this spring because the weren't planted deep enough (I probably only went six inches down), but now I think that my habit of trimming all of the foliage down after the blooms are gone was the culprit. I guess the foliage still nourishes the bulb for the season. Kind of annoying as I don't really like the appearance of saggy tulip leaves in my garden, but I don't really care for having to plant everything new every year, so I'll tough it out next year. I'm actually trying to plant the bulbs near other plants that will kind of disguise the limp leaves when they grow and green up themselves. </p>

<p>I am planning on 2006 being &quot;The Year of the Garden&quot; at our place. We have two places in our front yard where the flower beds are not very distinct and the grass in patchy. I'd love to extend them both, and fill one in with <a href="http://greenwoodnursery.com/page.cfm/12018">colourful phlox</a> and the other with <a href="http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=B170">goutweed</a>.&nbsp; I have an envelope of seeds for lovely double-petaled pink poppies from my mother-in-laws garden, and there is a perfect spot in our backyard for a <a href="http://www.naturehills.com/new/product/shrubs_productdetails.aspx?proname=Barberry-Red+Leaf+Japanese">barberry</a> shrub ...</p>

				<p>I'm putting this year's poor showing for tulips behind me and giving them another try. Madeline and I went off to <a href="http://www.greengate.ca/">Greengate</a> one afternoon last week and I was delighted to see that I could purchase tulip bulbs individually! Whee! I bought three each of six different kinds. </p>

<p>I'm entirely sure why the tulips I'd planted in the fall of 2003 didn't bloom this year, but my theory is that I needed to plant them a few inches deeper for this climate and shouldn't have been so quick to trim the foliage down. We'll see ...</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header">The Mystery of the Shrivelled Tulips</h3>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Last spring, my little garden plot has <a href="http://laura.typepad.com/goingdomestic/2004/05/pickmeup.html">these lovely lovely tulips</a> blooming in it ... this year, the tulips came up again, budded, and then shrivelled up into little dried nothings. I was really puzzled about what was going on, and had it in the back of my mind to call into CBC AM when during their regular Tuesday gardening call-in segment. Today I was listening to the gardening segment at breakfast time, and someone beat me to it!&nbsp; The gardening expert suggested to the caller with shrivelled tulips of his own to mulch around the tulips a lot so that the soil holds more water, and to plant them deeper - about a foot. I guess this depth works well for the local climate. Will have to try that ...</p>

<p>I'm not sad about not getting the chance to call about my tulips, as I am also wondering when we should prune our hardy rose bushes and the lilac ... more questions to ask!</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I think I understand now why people who have spectacular gardens and a lot of money often have a personal gardener. I loved our flowerbeds last year, but since all we planted were annuals, we now have to do all of the work all over again! I really don't want to re-plant pansies and snapdragons every May ... We've made one trip to the greenhouse so far this year, and this time we didn't stray outside the perennial section except to pick out some veggies. I tried to find perennials with lovely colours, so we have some bellflower, two kinds of foxglove, a few violets, an English daisy, and a few more that I can't remember.&nbsp; I also planted two dahlia tubers in the front yard last night - Chris picked them out. They're peach. I had a dream last night that I planted them all wrong *sigh*</p>

				<p>I'm determined not to have my pot of calla bulbs die over the winter.  I brought them inside when it started to get cooler at night, back in September.  They're currently residing in our mudroom, which is unheated.  I've never over-wintered bulbs before, but I'm hoping that I can find some good resources and instructions on the internet. So far, I've found <a href="http://tutorus.com/GardeningCallaBulbs.htm">this site</a>, and it looks helpful ... </p>

<p>I noticed today that all of the remaining blooms on my zucchini plants have turned a sad shade of purple and withered ... seems that the frost has got to them!  We did get to enjoy a number of them - Chris and I like picking them when they're really young and grilling them.  We harvested all of our tomatoes last weekend and they're riping indoors now.  That one in the photo is called a lemonboy and it's kind of cute - it really is lemon-shaped.  </p>

<p>Chris and I ventured into the world of home-canning and made a batch of crabapple jelly.  Our neighbour has a crabapple tree that mostly hangs into our backyard :)  We used the <a href="http://www.atcoblueflamekitchen.com/Preserving/Crabapples2.pdf">recipe</a> from the <a href="http://www.atcoblueflamekitchen.com">Blue Flame Kitchen</a>, and improvised by adding some cinnamon.  It turned formerly pink jelly brown, but it now tastes like apple pie :) The recipe called for a jelly bag, and we never did figure out what one of those was exactly, though!</p>

				<p>Well, after launching "Laura's First-Ever Gardening Experience" this past spring (or last fall, when I planted bulbs), I've concluded that I have an affinity for growing weeds.  They're flourishing.  I know that I've spent practically zero time in the gardens since Madeline was born, but I can't explain why one flower box of petunias and pansies died right out in July while the box beside it, containing the same flowers, didn't. I planted nastertiums that didn't bloom but sprouted leaves the size of apples (?), and I have no idea where my sweetpeas are.  I know that I planted seeds ... </p>

<p>It's to Chris's credit that we've had some romaine lettuce and zucchinis because he still manages to get outside and water from time to time ... </p>

				<p>So, Chris and I have been a little slow with putting together the raised garden bed that we were <a href="http://laura.typepad.com/goingdomestic/2004/05/living_off_the_.html#trackback">previously pretty excited about</a>.  For one thing, we're now only looking at one bed, and instead of buying a bunch of cedar or spruce boards, we bought a kit with a plastic frame and metal poles for stringing up tomatoes, beans, peas, etc. I realize that this is quite a change from previous plans, but this bed can be disassembled in the fall after the growing season and move across the country with us.  </p>

<p>Now that we have the frame, seeds (peas and romaine lettuce), compost, and soil, the only thing that's stopped us from planting already is that we need some sort of liner for the bed. Surely one just doesn't dump the dirt on the lawn, right? Our first thought was to line the bed with some sort of plastic, or maybe even a tarp, but now we're wondering if we don't perhaps need something that would allow drainage ... Maybe a formed plastic liner with some holes in the bottom?</p>

				<p>Amazing what a person can find in a garden when there's someone who knows something about green things is around!  When my parents rolled into town this past weekend, they came prepared to work.  My mom and dad helped us identify some of the shrubs in the backyard (the big overgrown one was a <a href="http://www.daytonnursery.com/Encyclopedia/Trees_Shrubs/Potentilla.htm">potentilla</a>, and the one that blocks off the outside tap and the electricity meter is suspected to be a <a href="http://www.naturehills.com/new/product/shrubs_productdetails.aspx?proname=Rose+of+Sharon+-+Ardens">Rose of Sharon</a> (which isn't a rose but a shrub with really pretty pink flowers).  My dad pruned down the potentilla (while providing instructions for future upkeep!) and the dead branches on the big yellow rose bush, and then planted the shoot from my grandmother's <a href="http://www.springvalleyroses.com/catalog/hansa.html">hansa rose</a> that they brought from Edmonton.  It's meant to be big hardy rose bush like the yellow one in the yard, so hopefully it will establish itself well!  Did some weeding and dandelion pulling, which amused my mom because my dandelion extraction technique removes quite a large section of lawn at the same time … she showed me a better technique, but it was little too late for some parts of the backyard lawn :)  </p>

<p>The tulips that I planted in the fall are just about ready to bloom now - just need a another day or so of sun!  And one of my mini-callas has sprouted - it's nearly and inch high already! - and I think that the other bulb is going to make an appearance anyday - there's a big crack in the soil!</p>

				<p>It's about time that Chris and I got a move on building some raised garden beds - planting season has almost arrived here in Alberta! I think that that we've toned down our garden aspirations for this summer from every veggie that we like to eat to merely tomatoes, romaine lettuce, and peas.  Maybe some carrots, but just maybe.  We're just concerned about having the time to get the garden put together and having the time to tend it properly, so maybe it's better that we start small and plan an expansion for the 2005 season. </p>

<p>We don’t plan on buying the frames for the garden beds but instead see the project as a good opportunity to bond with our cordless drill. HGTV has some instructions and illustrations on building the raised gardening frames <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/gl_design_raised_bed/article/0,1785,HGTV_3570_1398104,00.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/gl_design_raised_bed/article/0,1785,HGTV_3570_2608081,00.html">here</a>, including some good raised-gardening design tips.</p>

				<p>It looks like my very first adventure with gardening may turn out afterall, despite a few cold snaps.  The new tulips that I <a href="http://laura.typepad.com/goingdomestic/2003/09/the_neglectful_.html">planted in the fall </a>are all up and have buds, and some of the established ones that came with the house are actually blooming!  I was shocked to see that they're not the regular red or yellow variety, but a kind of variagated peachy-pink:</p>

<center><img src=http://img19.photobucket.com/albums/v58/Neatfreak/goingdomestic/peach_tulip.jpg></center>

<p>I think that it might be this variety - <a href="http://www.dutchgardens.com/Shopping/sell.asp?ProdGroupID=16465&DeptPGID=18572&lstCategory=18605">Apricot Beauty</a>.  There's only three, so not enough for a vase yet, but I can be patient!  I should have been looking at a bulb-ordering page as I now want to plant some <a href="http://www.dutchgardens.com/Shopping/sell.asp?ProdGroupID=16516&DeptPGID=18572&lstCategory=18606">Sweet Wendy tulips</a> and some <a href="http://www.dutchgardens.com/Shopping/sell.asp?ProdGroupID=16472&DeptPGID=18572&lstCategory=18606">Blue Herons</a> next fall …</p>

<p>I'm very chuffed today because my struggles to tame the stinky garbage disposal problem that we had in the fall came to the aid of <a href="http://www.megan.scatterbrain.org/notmartha">another blogger in need</a> :)</p>

				<p>The weather has been spring-like enough for the past month for me to know that I'm not a complete failure at bulb-planting - the tulips and the ornamental onions that I put into the ground in the fall have come up (I’m not are certain about the hyacinths and the anemones because I forgot exactly where I planted them). This early success was encouraging enough to prompt me to pick up a package of two pinkish-orange <a href="http://www.flowersbulbs.com/acb/stores/5/category.cfm?SID=5&Category_ID=7">mini-calla</a> bulbs at the garden centre last month.  The mini-callas caught the attention of both Chris and I when the garden centres started opening up in February.  I did a little research in the copy of <a href="http://www.calhort.org/bookstore/ourown.cfm">The Calgary Gardener</a> that Chris gave me last Christmas, and was pleased to find out that it's possible to grow callas in Alberta as long as they're not left outside for the winter.  Happy, I bought a small package of bulbs and a big pot to keep them in.  According to my book, I'm supposed to start the bulbs indoors at the end of April (so that's on my weekend to-do list), and I can take them outside after the threat of frost is gone.  In the fall, I'll bring them inside to the mudroom and keep my fingers crossed that they come back in the spring. </p>

<p>The tulips are still insisting on growing in the garden ... and I've identified some daffodils, and maybe even some hyacinths.  I think that it will be interesting to see what comes up this year - Chris and I didn't view this house until June of last year, so we missed seeing the spring flowers that the previous homeowners' had. </p>

<p>On Friday after work Chris and I stepped into a shop specializing in cedar wood products.  We're hoping to put together two or three <a href="http://eartheasy.com/grow_raised_beds.htm">raised garden beds</a> to house our veggies this summer, and from what we've read, there are some types of lumber that are more suited to that than others.  The shop also had some lovely square and rectangular planters for sale, which we were tempted to buy.  Our house is painted dark green, and I think that it needs some colourful blooms in the front asap!</p>

<p>I saw my first robin of the season on Sunday ... </p>

This winter, I fretted everytime Calgary would go through a warm spell, sure that the tulip bulbs were saying, "Hey, spring's here - let's start germinating!" even though it was only December, and another streak of - 25 degrees Celsius weather was surely around the corner.  </p>

				<p>There was a <a href="http://www.torontostar.ca/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1074596567687&call_pageid=1021543364560&col=1021543362325">very cool article</a> in the <a href="http://www.torontostar.ca">T*oronto Star</a> yesterday - about a couple who put out only about half a bag of garbage for collection a year! Gosh, I wish that we had the infrastructure to recycle like that where we live!  As long as some of my fellow metropolis-dwellers continue to protest municipal funds being spent on a curbside recycling test project, Calgary is not going to make any progress closing the ten-year gap between it and the recycling projects in other similar cities. Boo. </p>

<p>One thing that the article talks about a lot is something that I would love to do: compost! This is fed by my desire to put in a veggie garden in the spring, and also by my exposure to <a href="http://www.cityfarmer.org/wormcomp61.html">vermicomposting</a> when I worked as a co-op student for <a href="http://ec.gc.ca">Enviroment Canada</a> one summer (my office composted our lunch scraps).  Somehow I envision happier carrots, peas, and tomatoes growing in composted soil than whatever is lying underneath the sod in our backyard. </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It's kind of embarrassing, but it's not even spring and I'm already giving myself failing marks at gardening. I only planted my bulbs last night - I missed the "middle of September" target by about a week.  Hopefully things will still work out! </p>

<p>I planted two varieties of tulips (my second favourite flower after sweetpeas): these gorgeous <a href="http://www.tulipbulbs.com/cgi-bin/prodcatalog.cgi?prod=tse052" target="_blank">Princess Irene</a> tulips which should bloom in shades of orange and magenta, and some <a href="http://www.vandycks.com/fall/z31393.31708.phtml" target="_blank">Negrita Triumph</a> tulips in a lovely deep purple colour. Being a first-time tulip-planter, I did a wee bit of research and followed the methodology described in <a href="http://www.backyardgardener.com/linda/tulips.html" target="_blank">How to Plant Tulips</a> over at the <a href="http://www.backyardgardener.com/" target="_blank">Backyard Gardener</a>, which I think may be a local site. The things I learned from this are 1) having a big shovel to dig holes is probably a lot more efficient than a mere garden trowel and 2) bone meal creates a lot of dust and 3) I must learn not to be grossed out by earthworms. </p>

<p>The Negrita tulips were part of a package of purple flowers - there were also <a href="http://www.dutchgardens.com/sell.asp?ProdGroupID=17926" target="_blank">Blue Poppy Anemone</a> and some violet-coloured oriental hyacinths. The only problem is that this package of bulbs came without directions, so I'm a bit skeptical about whether all of the different varieties need the same type of growing environment as the tulips do! And I planted them all exactly the same!  It's kind of silly to package tulips and hyacinths together if they grow in completely different regions ... but possible, right?</p>
