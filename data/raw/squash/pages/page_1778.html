      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <b>THE BARADA MYSTERY</b> By Martin 
        Bronstein and Golestan Radwan </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">The big question in squash right now 
        is What has happened to Ahmed Barada? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">He has pulled out of the last three 
        tournaments and has split with Hashem El Attar, his charming and articulate 
        (in three languages) coach. This is written on the eve of a major<img src="../../photos/usopen/Beratta.jpg" width="334" height="209" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
        tournament in Hurghada in Egypt, the PSA Masters, and, once more, Barada 
        will be absent. This would have been unthinkable a year ago; Barada is 
        one of the great personalities of Egypt, inside and outside sport. No 
        squash tournament of any note could have taken place without his charismatic 
        presence. He was number three in the world and looking forward to taking 
        over from the two players above him, Peter Nicol and Jonathon Power, who 
        were both older than him. But then came….</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>THE STAB IN THE BACK</b><br>
        It was just over a year ago that Barada was mysteriously stabbed in the 
        back by an unknown assailant. It happened at night outside his house and 
        the <img src="../../photos/usopen/BarattaWhite.jpg" width="283" height="345" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">motive 
        has never been established. He was rushed off to Germany for specialist 
        attention where it was established the two knife wounds were not serious. 
        Concern subsided when 10 weeks later he was in London playing the Super 
        Series Finals and giving an excellent performance; it was, we were all 
        assured, a matter of months before Barada was back in top shape and once 
        more challenging Nicol and Power. After all, just seven months previously, 
        he had beaten them both, one after the other, to win the Heliopolis title 
        in Cairo.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <b>BACK AT THE TOP</b> <br>
        By August 2000 Barada was back to speed and pushed Nicol to four games 
        in the final of the Al Ahram International. But then it all started to 
        go wrong and nobody seems to know why. In the second round of the Hong 
        Kong Open, he retired in the middle of the third game against Steward 
        Boswell. A month later he lost to David Evans in the second round of The 
        Eye Group British <img src="../../photos/pncopen/ABarada1.jpg" width="281" height="302" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">Open. 
        A month after that, in November 2000, he lost to David Palmer in the Florida 
        Open quarter-finals, retiring in the middle of the third game. In December 
        he was in Toronto, playing in the first YMG Capital Classic where he beat 
        Del Harris in four, whipped Paul Price, the surprise British Open finalist, 
        in three straight before losing to Peter Nicol in the semis in four. Since 
        then, nothing. Nada. Rien. Pure Zero.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <b>THE MISSING PERSON </b><br>
        Amidst a Niagara of rumors, Barada has failed to play in one tournament 
        in the year 2001. His absence, said the rumors were due to injuries in 
        his leg, his lower back, his groin….in fact a complete tour of the Barada 
        body parts. Nothing confirmed. He was suffering from depression, said 
        another rumor. He had split from his future wife. Unliklely - they had 
        only become engaged in January. The big Black Hole in Barada's life was 
        caused by the disappearance of his long time coach, friend and mentor, 
        Hashem el Attar. That is over dramatic. Hashem told me that he simply 
        could no longer, nor did he want to, spend so much time away from his 
        wife and two very small children (13 months and 3 years in age) who live 
        in Turin. I contacted him by phone and he happily tried to solve the mystery. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"Barada insisted on having me as a 
        coach. I was with him for six years out of the last twelve. I started 
        coaching him when he was a ten year old kid and I was one of the better 
        players in Egypt. For the last four years I was on a 12 month contract 
        and I tried to do two months at a time, but it never worked out that way. 
        It couldn't go on forever, it was too hard for me and my wife.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> "I don't know what has happened over 
        the last few months; I'm not sure that he wasn't stressed because he knew 
        I was not going to carry on after Hong Kong. It was quite difficult for 
        him knowing that things were not going to be the same. You must realise 
        I had worked hard with him on and off court. I did the running with him 
        and I pushed him so he must have been affected by not having me near him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> "I still don't know why he stopped 
        training. I got an e-mail from one of my former assistants in January 
        saying Ahmed had stopped. I tried to phone him because I wanted to know 
        why but he had his phone switched off. He doesn't want the hassle of the 
        television and newspapers calling him wanting to know what was happening.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> "We parted on good terms. He understood 
        perfectly well that I couldn't go on forever. The last time I spoke to 
        him was when he called me in December to invite me to his engagement party 
        in January, but I absolutely could not make it." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>PRESSURE ON PRESSURE</b><br>
        I told Hesham that I found it strange that Barada would not call him after 
        such a close relationship. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"Once he has had two bad results in 
        a row he will have all the papers calling him asking 'what's happening 
        to you Ahmed?' and it puts more pressure on him, so he has another bad 
        result and it gets worse and worse, so he switches off the phone," was 
        Hashem's explanation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Did Ahmed recover mentally from the 
        stabbing incident, I wondered. "I thought he played very well just twelve 
        weeks later in the Super Series. I though he would only be back to normal 
        when he trained sand started believing in himself again. But from Hong 
        Kong he hasn't really played well at all - he had some stomach problems 
        there and he wasn't feeling well before the match," Hashem responded. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>THE POINT OF NO RETURN?</b><br>
        One top player, who shall remain nameless, thinks we've seen the end of 
        Barada. "He's out of the top eight, protected seeding, so he could well 
        meet one of us in the first round and he'll lose because he's rusty. And 
        he won't like that. And he's going to marry a very rich woman, which will 
        be another get out. I don't think we'll see him back again." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>THE NEW VALENTINO? </b><br>
        Barada's smouldering good looks makes him a natural for the big screen 
        and there are dozens of rumors floating around about offers for him to 
        turn to acting. Another rumor has it that Barada is now in the US either 
        to recover from injury or just for a holiday. Or talking to Speilberg 
        about a remake of The Sheik? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b><font size="3">SUMMER AT LAST</font></b><br>
        After one of the most miserable British winters since my return from Canada 
        16 years ago (rain, rail crashes, hoof-and-mouth disease, The Weakest 
        Link) I'm off to Egypt for two days in Cairo and five days in Hurghada 
        on the Red Sea to keep you up-to-date on the WISPA Grand Prix Finals (eight 
        top <img src="../../photos/womedin2000/sarahcarol_small.JPG" width="295" height="326" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">women) 
        and the PSA Masters. Sadly Cassie Campion won't be there as she has dropped 
        out of the top eight, but everybody else will be. Will Sarah Fitz-Gerald 
        show that she really is the best? Will Leilani Joyce manage to up her 
        performance? Can Carol Owens repeat her world open triumph? Will the newly-married 
        Linda Charman-Smith produce her best form? And will Nathalie Grainger 
        get rid of her nerves and show the world just how good she can be? After 
        a long lay-off, they will all be raring to go. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Same thing with the men, another long 
        layoff because of postponements…indeed only two tournaments of note this 
        year so far, so everybody will be in Cairo for the early rounds. Two notable 
        exceptions are Barada (but you already know about that) and Peter Marshall 
        who is still suffering from an injury. With Power back on the number one 
        spot, Nicol will be aching to get on court with him. David Evans will 
        want to prove his British Open win was no fluke and Simon Parke must want 
        to get his 3/4 spot back again. They won't be making the draw until April 
        12 and it will be right here on Squashtalk. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b><font size="3">THE NEW COMEBACK 
        KID</font></b><br>
        Well, hardly a kid. Damian Walker is 32 and just when we thought he'd 
        disappeared into the American squash infrastructure, he jumps out as the 
        new American champion. At 32! Furthermore, the man he beat in the final 
        was another ancien (polite French word for old bloke) Richard Chin, who 
        is also 32. Despite their combined ages being pensionable, they played 
        for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the final - the longest match of the tournament. 
        Marty Clarke was too busy playing doctors and nurses to enter so Walker 
        cleaned up after about 10 years off the circuit. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>MOST UN-ENGLISH SORT OF PLAYER</b> 
        <br>
        I first came across Damian in the mid-eighties, one of a mass of promising 
        juniors. What first struck me was that he not of the run-of-the-mill English 
        tradition of endlessly hitting the ball up and down the side walls through 
        fear of making a mistake if he went for a drop. He enjoyed making his 
        racket do the work, an attractive player to watch. He did well, representing 
        England ten times at junior level. Then he discovered flying and the United 
        States of America, probably at the same time. Soon he was taking flying 
        lessons and the next thing he'd flown Mother England for Uncle Sam. That 
        was ten years ago; since then he's plied his trade as a squash pro In 
        Santa Barbara, Sacramento, (where he met his wife seven years ago), Atlanta, 
        Maryland Naval Academy and now he's landed in Greenwich at the classy 
        Field Club.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> He spent two years at the Naval Academy 
        and left with mixed feelings. "I left because teaching is what you do 
        at the end of your career. But it was very satisfying because those kids 
        in the Academy were hungry. They really worked hard, for themselves and 
        for the team. For a coach it is the best situation," he explained with 
        genuine enthusiasm. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Perhaps there was a hunger to get 
        back to playing again, which a move to Greenwich allowed him to satisfy. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"I haven't really played for four 
        years because I just didn't have time to play. In the US championships 
        I was winging it on what I learned when I was under 16," he say with an 
        honesty that won't make him too popular with the other players in the 
        US Championships.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> "I was scared witless by Julian Illingworth 
        in the first round. He's very good and although I beat him in three, at 
        one point I thought I was going to get beaten by a junior. I was very 
        impressed with him and William Broadbent who is a member of the Greenwich 
        club. He's got a lot of promise," Walker said.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> Now Walker is nearer the seat of 
        USSRA power he feels he can start to achieve his main coaching goal - 
        the US team. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">"I want to get involved in a national 
        squad and I've put my name in the ring. I watch the American juniors and 
        while they are fine technically, when it comes to strategy, they need 
        a lot of advice. I think I can give them that advice," Walker claimed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> As the new American Champion ( I 
        bet the Keepers of Greenwich are very pleased with that) Damian will be 
        more than welcome and the kids will want to see this experienced player 
        in action. My advice to them is watch his racquet work and his feet. To 
        Damian I say, Welcome back. </font></p>
