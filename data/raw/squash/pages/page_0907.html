<p><b>Ingredients:</b><br>
8 (12-inch) round sheets rice paper<br>
2 cups green leaf lettuce leaves, chopped<br>
2 cups fresh alfalfa sprouts<br>
32 (2-inch) julienne-cut cucumber strips<br>
32 (2-inch) julienne-cut yellow bell pepper strips<br>

<p><b>Instructions:</b><br>

To prepare spring rolls, add hot water to a large, shallow dish to a depth of 1 inch. Place 1 rice paper sheet in dish; let stand 30 seconds or just until soft. Place rice paper sheet on a flat surface. Arrange a few pieces of lettuce in center of sheet. Top with 1/4 cup sprouts, 4 cucumber strips, 4 bell pepper strips, 4 shrimp halves, and 1 Tbsp mint leaves. Fold sides of sheet over filling; roll up jelly-roll fashion. Gently press seam to seal. Place spring roll, seam side down, on a serving platter (cover with damp paper towel to prevent drying).<br><br>

Repeat procedure with remaining rice paper, lettuce, sprouts, cucumber, bell pepper, shrimp, and mint. Serve with dipping sauce.

The rice paper was surprisingly easy to work with but it took me a few times to get the amount of filling and rolling technique correct. Makes a lovely presentation when cut in helf at an angle and seved on a long tray. (photo coming soon). Very good with a basic peanut dipping sauce. The mint makes the roll taste very fresh and clean, will certainly make again in the summer. I may try seasoning the shrimp next time as it seemed to get lost with the other flavors.</font></p>

cook 1 minute. Add pepper and onions; cook 1 minute. Stir in curry powder, curry paste,

<p><b>My review:</b><br>
The original recipe called for broiling the fish but since it's grilling weather, that's what
I did! I usually make a tilapia filet for me and a chicken breast for Eric. The sauce
works well with both meats. This recipe makes plenty of sauce for both the fish and the rice, so
don't worry about doubling it (which is what I usually have to do). Tasty and spicy!</p>

<p><a name="sungoldpasta"></a><b><font size="3">Shiloh's Creamy Sungold Pasta</font></b><br>
<font size="1">adapted from Weaver Street Market newsletter recipe</font></p>

<p><b>Ingredients:</b><br>
1 cup sungold tomatoes cut in half<br>
1/4 cup fresh basil-packed<br>
1 Tbs. butter<br>
2 cloves of garlic, minced or put through a press<br>
dash of salt and pepper<br>
1/3 cup heavy cream<br>
1/4 cup asiago cheese<br>
12 large peeled/deveined shrimp<br>
cooked and drained spaghetti

<p><b>Instructions:</b><br>
Heat the pan over medium heat and sauté the garlic in butter, being careful not to burn it. 
Add salt, pepper, and halved tomatoes and wilt them down a few minutes. Add cream and cook 
gently, allowing the sauce to thicken, about 3 minutes. Then add peeled shrimp directly to 
the simmering cream sauce. When the shrimp are pink (another few minutes), chop your basil 
and throw it in. Toss sauce with cooked pasta noodles and sprinkle with freshly grated cheese.

<p><b>My review:</b><br>
This was a wonderful recipe and another great way to use the sungold tomatoes in our garden, 
the other way being eating them straight off the vine. I'm sure all that heavy cream isn't that 
great for me, but I could handle this a few times each summer! The original recipe says you
can make it without the shrimp too, but I think they added another wonderful flavor dimension.
Delicious!</p>

1 cup rye flour<br>
1/2 cup whole wheat flour<br>
1/4 cup bread flour<br>
3 Tbsp dry milk powder<br>
2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
1/2 Tbsp caraway seeds<br>

1 tsp salt<br>
1 1/2 Tbsp molasses<br>
1 Tbsp vegetable oil<br>
1 cup (approximately) warm water (110 degrees)<br><br>

<p><b>Instructions:</b><br>
Place ingredients into large mixing bowl, using the dough hook, begin to mix. Add enough warm water to make a dry
dough. After the ball is soft and elastic, let rise in a warm draft-free place for one hour. Punch dough down 
and transfer to lightly oiled 9x5 loaf pan. Cover with towel and let rise for another hour.<br><br>

Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Let cool completely before slicing. </p>

<p><b>My review:</b><br>
Yum. It's not as dark as I normally like but with my complete lack of options this will certainly do. The caraway 
seeds give the bread a nice rye flavor while the molasses makes it moist. Went very well with the swiss cheese fondue.</p>

dash of cayenne pepper<br>

Combine sugar, corn syrup, water and salt in a heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook 25 minutes or until golden (my batch took about 35 minutes) and a candy thermometer registers 340 degrees, stirring occasionally. Stir in pistachio mixture and butter stirring rapidly. Remove from heat and stir in baking soda (mixture will start to foam and expand). Rapidly spread mixture onto a prepared jellyroll pan coated with cooking spray. Cool completely and break into small pieces.

I thought the candy cooked a tad too long, but everyone who's tried it really likes it, so I guess the slight burnt flavor is a plus. I love the buttery flavor of the pistachios with the sweet candy. I would make this again, but add more nuts! <b>****</b></p>

<p><b>My review:</b><br>
This really couldn't be easier and although I made it on the stovetop with a fry pan, it tasted great. The meat was tender and full of salty Chinese food-like flavor. I cooked mine for less time than Eric's since he likes his meat well-done while I'm a med-rare girl. I sampled both plates and the meat didn't lose any flavor when it was cooked a minute or two longer. I served this with white rice and aparagus. Yum! <b>*****</b></p>

The original recipe called for bacon, but I used pancetta instead. I also used <a href="http://www.centralbean.com/beantype.html">great northern beans</a>, fresh rosemary and a sweet, but dry, white wine. It smelled wonderful while it was simmering and I tried a bit last night that tasted fine, but I'm having this for lunch today, so I'll update after that. <br><br>

<b>Update:</b> I'll have to try this recipe again because the wine I used was apparently too sweet and the beans tasted funky.<!--<b>****</b>--></p>

This soup was full of earthy flavor... if you enjoy mushrooms, definitely try this soup. There is a lot of waiting time, but you can let the stock simmer for the hour without a lot of stirring. I used Better Than Bouillon instead of the fat-free chicken broth which probably made it more salty than the original recipe. I would serve this as a meal starter for company because it's low maintenance while I prepare other things. A wonderful aromatic cold-weather soup.<b>****</b></p>

<p><b>Ingredients:</b><br>
<b>Pizza Crust:</b><br>
3 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour<br>
2 packages dry active yeast<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1/2 tsp sugar<br>
1 1/2 cups lukewarm tap water<br>
1/2 tsp olive oil<br>
Flour, for the work surface<br><br>

1/4 lb pancetta<br>
1/2 cup sweet onion<br>
3/4 cup pizza sauce<br>
3/4 cup park-skim mozzarella cheese<br><br>
 
<p><b>Instructions:</b><br>
In a mixing bowl fitted with a dough hook, place flour, yeast, salt and sugar. 
While mixer is running, gradually add water and knead on low speed until dough 
is firm and smooth, about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Turn machine off. Pour oil down inside of bowl. Turn on low once more for 15 
seconds to coat inside of bowl and all surfaces of dough with the oil. Cover bowl 
with plastic wrap. Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.</p>

<p>Saut&eacute; pancetta and onions in a little olive oil until onions are soft and pancetta
is crispy. Let cool slightly.

<p>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Punch dough down, cut in half. Place half of the dough 
on generously floured work surface. By hand, form dough loosely into a ball and stretch 
into a circle. Using a floured rolling pin, roll dough into large rectangle until very thin. 
To prevent dough from sticking to counter, turn over the dough and sprinkle 
with flour. Transfer dough to pizza peel or cookie sheet with no lip. Add sauce and toppings. 
Carefully roll dough up with toppings inside and seal edges by pressing together the dough. 
Rolling the dough will be easier if the sauce is cool.</p>

<p>Bake 15-20 minutes or until golden. Roll out remaining dough and top with desired 
toppings or freeze in freezer bags.</p>

      <p><b>Makes 4 total servings.</b></p>

<p><b>My review:</b><br>
This is by far the easiest pizza crust recipe I've found and it's delicious! You can add any ingredients
you want for the inside, but I've found the mix of salty pancetta and sweet onions is very yummy. I also knead
some dried oregano and basil into the dough before rolling it out. The dough recipe freezes very well, so we
usually keep a half recipe in the freezer for pizza emergencies! <b>*****</b></p>

<p><b>My review:</b><br>
I know it's almost June, but I picked up a butternut squash during our trip to the farmer's market last weekend and I needed to use it. The soup was rich and creamy and full of fantastic flavor! The fried sage leaves were crispy and a good contrast to the thick soup. I had never cooked with squash before and this first experience was definitely a positive one. I will make this again in the fall.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> A co-worker made this soup for a party and it was a huge hit!</p>

Excellent! It tastes like a completely frozen pi&ntilde;a colada. We made this for my mom-in-law's birthday last weekend, it is super easy and extremely tasty. I also made some chocolate dipped macroons to go with the sorbet. We will be making this all summer long! <b>*****</b></p>

Chicken Cordon Bleu</font></b></p>

      <p><b>Ingredients:</b><br>
        2 large chicken breasts, skinless and boneless<br>
        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
        4 thin slices deli ham<br>
        8 thin slices Gruyere or Swiss cheese<br>
        1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves<br>
        2 Tablespoons cup flour<br>
        1/2 cup panko bread crumbs <br>
        1/2 teaspoon olive oil<br>
        1 egg<br>
        1 teaspoon water
      <p><b>Instructions:</b><br>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lay the chicken between 2 pieces of plastic 
        wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet, gently pound the chicken to 
        1/4-inch thickness. Take care not to pound too hard because the meat may 
        tear or create holes. Lay 2 slices of cheese on each breast, followed 
        by 2 slices of ham, and 2 more of cheese; leaving a 1/2-inch margin on 
        all sides to help seal the roll. Tuck in the sides of the breast and roll 
        up tight like a jellyroll. Squeeze the log gently to seal.</p>
      <p>Season the flour with salt and pepper; spread out on waxed paper or in 
        a flat dish. Mix the breadcrumbs with thyme, kosher salt, pepper, and 
        oil. The oil will help the crust brown. Beat together the eggs and water, 
        the mixture should be fluid. Lightly dust the chicken with flour, then 
        dip in the egg mixture. Gently coat in the bread crumbs. Carefully transfer 
        the roulades to a baking pan and bake for 20 minutes until browned and 
        cooked through. Cut into pinwheels before serving.</p>

      <p><b>My review:</b><br>
        The problem with these types of recipes is the issue of cheese leaking 
        everywhere before the dish is finished cooking. I must not have pounded 
        the chicken thin enough because there wasn't enough meat for me to wrap 
        around the insides to prevent this common problem. This in combination 
        with having to use american cheese left me with a messy main dish. The 
        overall taste was fine; I used a Boars Head peppered ham which added excellent 
        flavor to the inside, but the outside of the chicken was fairly bland. 
        I would make this again only I would use a harder cheese (like the recipe 
        calls for) and would marinate the chicken for a day in Italian seasonings 
        first. <b>**1/2</b></p>

      <p><b>My review:</b><br>
        This treat has a sweet light lemon flavor and excellent texture. Eric 
        didn't like it because the lemon's tart flavor was masked by the sugar. 
        But I think this dessert is a great light alternative for summer company 
        or lunch. It was easy to make and came right out of the ungreased glass 
        dish I used. The only difference from the recipe was that lemon filling 
        set in about 17-18 minutes instead of 20-25, so I changed the above recipe 
        to reflect that. I will make this again. <b>****</b></p>

        1/4 cup sugar<br>
        1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>

        dash of nutmeg<br>
        1/2 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
        2 medium thinly sliced, peeled apples</p>
      <p><b>Instructions:</b><br>
        1. Cut out 4 circles from the two pie crusts. Place one pie circle in

      <p><b>My review:</b><br>
        As you can see above the crust browned nicely in 25 minutes, but the bottom 
        crust was a bit undercooked and the apples weren't as tender as I wanted. 
        We think microwaving the apple mixture for a minute or two before filling 
        the ramekins would make the apples softer right off the bat. As for the 
        bottom crust, perhaps baking it for a few minutes first to brown it would 
        make for a better pie bottom, as the apples let go of a lot of liquid 
        during baking and could make the bottom crust soggy. Overall, the flavor 
        was great and eating your own little mini pie with Cool Whip is a special 
        treat. <b>***1/2</b></p>

        This was a seriously yummy pork recipe! The flavor was excellent (not 
        too garlicky or spicy) and the pork loin was juicy and completely cooked 
        in the listed time frame (it helps if you have a <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?order_num=-1&SKU=11720307">meat 
        thermometer</a>). I covered the pork with the seasoning about 24 hours 
        before cooking. The seasoning formed a flavorful crust in the frying pan 
        and the pork stayed moist while finishing in the oven. I served it with 
        a baked potato sprinkled with cheddar and jack cheeses. This is going 
        in the must make again recipe file. <b>*****</b></p>
