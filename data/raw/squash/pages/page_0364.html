<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	A bitter taste in cucumbers is the result of stress that can be caused by a number of
factors including heredity, moisture, temperature, soil characteristics and disease. Most often
this occurs during the hot part of the summer or later in the growing season.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Two compounds, cucurbitacins B and C, give rise to the bitter taste. Though often only
the stem end is affected, at times the entire fruit is bitter. Also, most of the bitter taste is found
in and just under the skin. Bitter fruit is not the result of cucumbers cross pollinating with
squash or melons. These plants cannot cross pollinate with one another.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Often newer varieties are less likely to become bitter than older ones. Proper cultural
care is also often helpful. Make sure your plants have the following.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	- Well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. Plenty of organic matter also helps.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	- Mulch. A mulch helps conserve moisture and keep roots cool during hot, dry weather.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	- Adequate water especially during the fruiting season.</SPAN></P>

<img border="0" src="../../HortImage/Squash%20Bugs.JPG" width="323" height="200"></STRONG></SPAN></h3>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The short answer is you can't! Squash bugs are sucking insects. They suck juices from
the plants and release a toxin that can kill vine crops in a short time when populations are high.
Squash bugs don't like exposed locations. They hide under foliage and vines in shaded,
protected areas. A hard, protective shell serves like armor protecting the bugs from anything you
spray on them. It is almost impossible to kill adult squash bugs even with the most powerful
insecticides. When they are young and their bodies are soft, they are easily controlled with
various insecticides, but you must spray thoroughly under the leaves and vines. Look for
hatching egg masses under leaves and spray soon after the hatch. Use a pressure sprayer and take
your time, moving the vines around and achieving complete coverage to kill all that you can.
Squash bugs will over winter in our area, so those that remain will be ready to attack again next
year. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	General-use insecticides such as Sevin, malathion, Thiodan (endosulfan), methoxychlor,
rotenone, and diazinon can be used for control. Avoid using Sevin for vine crops such as
melons, cucumbers, squash and pumpkins. It can be destructive to bees needed for pollination
and may increase mite problems in hot weather. (CWM)</SPAN></P>

<h3><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><b><a name="Pesticide Effectiveness">Pesticide Effectiveness</a></b></SPAN></h3>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	We sometimes have complaints from homeowners regarding the lack of effectiveness of
various pesticides.  There can be a number of reasons for this lack of efficacy.  Some of the
common ones follow.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	1. Lack of good penetration of foliage.  This often is a problem when spraying for
bagworms on junipers.  The spray must penetrate the foliage and reach the bagworms toward
the inside of the plant.  High pressure commercial sprayers are able to get the spray to the
insects but homeowner models are much more problematic.  With pump-up sprayers, you may
have to push the wand through the outer layer of foliage to reach insects toward the inside of the
plant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	2. Not spraying where the insect is.  Many of our insects and mites feed on the underside
of leaves.  If the plants are sprayed over the top, little to no pesticide reaches the pests.  This
problem is often seen with spider mites on broadleaf plants and cabbage worms on cabbage,
broccoli and cauliflower.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	3. Maturity of pest.  Insects become much more difficult to control when they become
adults.  For example, Sevin does a good job of controlling young, early instar grasshoppers but
is much less effective on adults.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	4. Level of disease pressure.  Most of our fungicides are better used as preventatives than
as curatives.  If a disease gets firmly established, it may be very difficult to bring it back under
control.  For example, chlorothalonil is effective in controlling early blight and Septoria leaf
spot on tomato if used as a preventative. However, chlorothalonil will not control these diseases
on badly infested plants.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	5. Choosing the wrong product.  Homeowners often use a product because they have it
on hand.  However, products differ markedly in how well they control specific pests.  Make
sure the pest you wish to control is on the label. Unfortunately, even labeled products may vary
in effectiveness.  Check Extension recommendations for the recommended products.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	6. High pH spray water.  Certain pesticides are not stable in high or low pH water. 
Following are some examples.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	* Captan </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has a half-life of 3 hours at a pH of 7.0 but only 10 minutes at a pH of 8.0.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	* Carbaryl (Sevin) has a half-life of 24 days at pH 7.0, but only 1 day at pH 9.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	* Diazinon is most stable in pH 7 water, with a half life of 10 weeks; at pH 5, it is 2
weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	* Malathion is stable at pH 5.0-7.0 but rapidly hydrolyzes in more acidic or alkaline
conditions. (WU)</SPAN></P>
