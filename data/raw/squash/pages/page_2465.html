<h4>1.  Codling moth</h4>
The codling moth was inadvertently introduced to North America over 200 years ago, and it is a
major pest of apples wherever they are grown on this continent.  Mature larvae overwinter in
silken cocoons under loose bark and on packing crates in warehouses.  They pupate in the spring,
and moths emerge during <u>petal fall</u>.  They mate, then females lay eggs on twigs, leaves, and
developing fruits.  Larvae hatch, crawl to a fruit, chew through the skin, and tunnel to the core to
feed on seeds.  When mature, the larvae exit the fruit to find a sheltered place to pupate.  A
second generation of moths emerges in midsummer, and subsequent larvae tunnel into ripening
fruits.  In southern Illinois (and often in much of the state), a third generation of moths may
develop before the season ends.  The timing and number of generations (2 versus 3) depends on
the temperature each season.

<p><u>Codling moth management:</u> 

<ul>
  <li>The standard approach to codling moth control is to use insecticides as "cover sprays" so that
residues are present on fruits whenever codling moth larvae are hatching.  Organophosphate
insecticides such as Guthion, Imidan, Lorsban, and Penncap-M have been used most
commonly.  Recent regulations have outlawed the use of Penncap-M and on fruits, prohibited
postbloom uses of Lorsban on apples, and reduced allowable residues of Guthion on apples.</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">  <ul>
    <li>Key steps in improving (and often reducing) the use of insecticides for codling moth
control include the use of pheromone traps and degree day models.   WHAT IS A
PHEROMONE TRAP?  HOW MANY DEGREE DAYS LAPSE BETWEEN EGG
LAYING AND EGG HATCH?  WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD FOR DEGREE DAY
COMPUTATIONS FOR THE CODLING MOTH?  WHAT IS THE "BIOFIX" FOR
STARTING TO COUNT DEGREE DAYS?</li>

<h4>2.  Apple maggot</h4>
The apple maggot is a more serious pest in northern than southern portions of the United States. 
In Illinois, it is a serious pest from Champaign northward, but rarely or never a problem south of
I-70.  The apple maggot is univoltine ... only one generation develops each year.  Pupae
overwinter in soil on the orchard floor, and adult flies emerge in the early summer.  They normally
fly out of the orchard, mate, and then return to the orchard to lay eggs.  Females insert eggs
directly under the "skin" of apples, and larvae (maggots) tunnel through the flesh, leaving "tracks"
that discolor and decay.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><u>Apple maggot management:</u> "Cover sprays" comprise the standard approach to apple maggot
control, with timing determined by the use of traps.  For apple maggot, the traps are attractive
because of their appearance (bright red spheres); volatile compounds that resemble the odors of
apple can be used to increase the attractiveness of the spheres.  

<p>In small orchards or back yard trees, red sphere traps can be used in "removal trapping" --
catching most flies before they lay eggs and greatly reducing damage to fruit.  One to three traps
per tree are needed to accomplish removal trapping.  WHY IS THIS APPROACH NOT USED
IN MOST COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS?

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>3.  Plum curculio</h4>
The plum curculio is a pest of stone fruits and apples, and it damages these crops wherever they
are grown in North America.  It overwinters in woody areas outside orchards and is  most
common in more wooded areas of the state and region.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="pcadult.JPG" width="280" height="185" align="bottom" ><img src="pcdam1.JPG" width="297" height="182" align="bottom" >

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="pcdam2.JPG" width="289" height="163" align="bottom" > 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Plum curculio adults re-enter orchards at petal fall each spring, and females lay eggs on fruits as
soon as they begin to develop.  To do so, they chew a crescent-shaped slit through the "skin" of
apples and peaches, then place their eggs under the resulting flap of tissue.  Larvae that hatch
from these eggs tunnel within peaches, plums, and other stone fruits, and mature by late summer. 
In most apple cultivars, plum curculio larvae die soon after hatching, mostly because of the
pressure of the rapidly growing fruit.  Damage in apples is therefore limited to the scar that
develops at the egg-laying site (a significant problem when numerous scars cause fruit
deformities).

<p><u>Plum curculio management:</u> Cover sprays (primarily the organophosphate insecticides listed
above) form the basis for plum curculio management.  Scouting programs and thresholds for this
pest have been difficult to develop ... most orchardists routinely use an insecticide at petal fall
(and sometimes again 10 days later) for curculio control.  

<p>(NO QUESTIONS TO ANSWER ON THIS STATION.)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>4.  European red mite</h4>
The European red mite is the "poster child" for illustrating the idea of a "secondary pest" ... an
insect or related arthropod that is a pest only because insecticides have killed its natural enemies
and allowed it to reach densities that did not occur under previous levels of natural control.  

<p>European red mites overwinter as eggs, exposed on the surface of twigs.  They begin hatching as
apple trees begin to bloom, and they develop from egg to adult in 10 to 25 days.  Six to eight
generations develop each season.  Immature stages and adults rasp away the leaf epidermis and
feed on plant sap, causing leaves to turn yellow, bronze, or brown.

  <ul>
    <li>Among the insecticides to avoid because they destroy populations of predaceous mites
are pyrethroids, Sevin, Lannate, Vydate, and Carzol.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Reintroduce predaceous mites if they are entirely lacking.</li>
  <li>Use selective miticides IF samples indicate red mites have exceeded threshold numbers.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Miticides include Apollo, Savey, Pyramite, Agri-Mek, and Vendex (as well as "summer
oils").</li>

<h4>5. Lesser peachtree borer</h4>
The lesser peachtree borer is the most serious of the clearwing moth pests of fruit trees in Illinois. 
Larvae overwinter in various stages under the bark of peach, cherry, and plum trees, then
continue development as temperatures increase in the spring.  Moths begin emerging in late
spring, but moth flight is NOT limited to a short period of time.  Instead, moths continue to
emerge, mate, and lay eggs through much of the summer.  Eggs are laid under rough areas of
bark, and larvae tunnel beneath the bark, girdling and killing trees.  

<p><u>Lesser peachtree borer management:</u> To reduce damage from this pest, orchardists try to limit
winter injury to trunks and scaffold branches; coating the lower portions of trees with dilute white
latex paint helps to reduce winter scalding, thereby reducing bark damage that favors borer entry.  

<p>Insecticides are key to the control of this insect also.  Trunk sprays of Lorsban or Thiodan are
standard; one application is usually made early in the season (shortly after pheromone traps
indicate moth flight is underway), and a second spray is applied immediately after harvest.  Mating
disruption may offer an alternative for control of this clearwing moth.

<p align="center"><img src="lygus.JPG" width="294" height="200" align="bottom" > 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Lygus bugs can be pests of several fruits and vegetables.  Adults overwinter in most of the region,
and they move to orchards and other fruit crops as they begin to bloom (or when weeds on the
orchard floor begin to bloom).  Along with stink bugs, they feed by inserting their beak into
developing fruits; cells around the wound are killed, and the fruit grows abnormally around the
site of injury.  EXAMINE THE PRINTED MATERIALS PROVIDED AND DESCRIBE THE

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Weed management is key to Lygus bug control in several fruit crops.  Growers are encouraged to
control the weeds that bloom just before the fruit crop, because Lygus bugs often move from
blooming weeds to apples or strawberries.  However, where blooming weeds have already
attracted Lygus infestations, growers are cautioned not to mow orchard aisles or similar drive
rows during bloom or petal fall because doing so triggers Lygus movement to the fruit crop.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>7.  Colorado potato beetle</h4>
The Colorado potato beetle is native to western North America, but it is now a pest of potatoes,
tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant wherever they are grown.  Adults and larvae feed on plant
foliage, but it is the larvae that are most damaging.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p align="center"><img src="cpb.JPG" width="173" height="247" align="bottom" ><img src="cpblarva.JPG" width="364" height="246" align="bottom" > 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Adults overwinter within cells well below the surface of the soil.  They emerge in May, at about
the time early-planted potatoes are emerging.  In June they lay yellow eggs on foliage, and larvae
feed for 10 to 20 days before dropping to the soil to pupate.  A new generation of adults emerges
2 to 3 weeks later; they feed more heavily than overwintered adults did, and they continue to lay
eggs through mid-August.  Larvae of this generation feed and pupate; as adults they may remain
in their pupal cells in the soil to overwinter, or they may emerge and then return to the soil. 
Summer adults may also return to the soil to pass the winter.  (One to two generations develop
each year in the upper Midwest.)

<p>Colorado potato beetle is resistant to MANY insecticides, and cultural control practices are
especially important in its management.  WHAT CULTURAL CONTROL PRACTICES ARE

<p align="center"><img src="dbm.JPG" width="360" height="228" align="bottom" ><img src="dbm2.JPG" width="337" height="227" align="bottom" > 

<p>The diamondback moth is the smallest of the three major Lepidopteran pests of crucifers
(cabbage, broccoli, etc.), but it is the most damaging in areas where insecticide resistance has
rendered it difficult to control.  Adults overwinter in protective vegetation, and migrations from
the south supply additional numbers each season.  Diamondback moth larvae may also be
introduced on transplants shipped in from southern states.  

<p>Eggs laid on foliage produce larvae that feed on leaves and heads of crucifers; egg-to-adult
generation time is 3 to 4 weeks, and 4 to 6 generations may develop each year in the Midwest. 
Diamondback moth populations are often greatest in hot, dry seasons.  

<p>To prevent cosmetic damage and larval contamination of the harvested crop, cabbage, broccoli,
and other crucifers may be treated frequently with insecticides to control diamondback moth,
imported cabbageworm, and/or cabbage looper.  Doing so provides lots of "selection pressure"
for resistance and also removes the natural enemies that might control these pests.  As a result,
diamondback moth resistance to insecticides has resulted in control crises in many parts of the
world.  Key steps in control and resistance management include ...

<ul>
  <li>Scouting and using insecticides only when populations exceed thresholds</li>
  <li>Relying as much as possible on <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> treatments early in the season to allow
natural enemy survival</li>
  <li>Rotating insecticides</li>
  <li>Irrigation to kill moths</li>
  <li>Crop residue destruction</li>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>8.  Striped and spotted cucumber beetles</h4>
Striped and spotted cucumber beetles overwinter as adults and become active in the spring.  The
pathogen that causes bacterial wilt of cucurbits, <em>Erwinia tracheiphila</em>, survives the winter only in
the gut of these cucumber beetles.  As they move into cucumber and muskmelon fields each
spring, they carry the pathogen to young plants and start the disease cycle anew.  Insecticidal
control of cucumber beetles IS a moderately effective approach to limiting losses to bacterial wilt.
(No horticulturally acceptable resistant varieties of cucumbers or muskmelons are available.)

<p align="center"><img src="cornflea.JPG" width="352" height="237" align="bottom" > 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A similar vector-pathogen relationship exists for the corn flea beetle and the bacterium that causes
Stewart's wilt of sweet corn.  (A "vector" is an organism that carries a pathogen from one host to
another.)  The corn flea beetle generally overwinters very successfully in the milder winters of
southern Illinois but not in northern Illinois.  The likely severity of Stewart's wilt can be predicted
in Illinois based on average winter temperatures.  Stewart's wilt resistance is "the norm" in field
corn and available in certain types of sweet corn, but some sweet corn production regions and
market types are not well-supplied with resistant hybrids.  Insecticides can be used to reduce
disease transmission and losses to Stewart's wilt, but insecticides are not as effective as resistant
hybrids.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Identifying aphids to the species level is difficult ... well beyond the scope of this class. 
Remember that aphids often have separate "winter" and "summer" hosts and that much of the time
females give birth to live young without mating.  When colonies of aphids develop on crop plants,
they may be important for their direct impacts on plant growth, yield, and crop quality.  Often,
however, aphids are most important because they transmit plant viruses.  When they do so in a
persistent manner (retaining the virus for an extended period and inoculating plants for the
remainder of their [the aphids'] lives), insecticides can be useful in slowing disease outbreaks. 
This is true for certain viruses in potatoes.  Where virus transmission is NONPERSISTENT (the
virus is lost from the vector after feeding only one or two times on an uninfected plant),
INSECTICIDES ARE USELESS IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT.  Trap crops, stylet oils,
reflective mulches, and row covers represent the only effective ways to reduce disease
transmission.

<h4>12.  Squash bug</h4>
The squash bug is a difficult-to-control pest of summer and winter squash varieties and of

The corn earworm is the most serious pest of sweet corn in Illinois (though European corn borer
and fall armyworm also attack the crop).  It may overwinter as a pupa in light soils in southern
and southwestern Illinois (and along the Illinois River in west-central Illinois), but it also migrates
into the state from the south each season.  Adults lay eggs directly on the silks of corn, and newly
hatched larvae move directly down the silk channel to feed on the tip of the developing ear.  For
insecticides to control this insect, they must be on the silks that the larva contacts as it moves into
the ear.  In most instances, growers use pheromone traps to determine the timing of moth flights
and the need for insecticide applications.  Transgenic Bt sweet corn is of great interest to Illinois
growers.
