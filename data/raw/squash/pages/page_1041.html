    <td>On a recent evening I stopped by the grocery store on my way home from work, with no idea in mind about what we were going to be having for dinner.  I felt like eating healthy, but lean chicken and pork was getting a bit old.</p>

<p>As I passed the fresh fish counter, the filet of sole that was on special caught my eye.  Typically I don't cook a lot of fish.   Greg won't eat it.  I'm not convinced that he wouldn't like it if he'd just give it a "real" try, but he's pretty stubborn about it.  So if I cook fish, it means I cook two meals and not one.</p>

<p>The sole looked like it was worth the effort.</p>

<p>So I picked up some fresh shrimp as well, a couple of sausages for Greg and headed home.</p>

<p>Once there, the fish was incredibly easy to prepare.  I simply sauteed it briefly in a bit of olive oil, seasoned it with salt and pepper, and splashed some freshly squeezed lemon juice and a bit of white wine.  I added the shrimp and a tablespoon or two of the pesto that I made last summer.   A sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese finished it all off.</p>

<p>It was MUCH better than the sausages that Greg had!<br />

<h3 class="title">Pumpkin Cookies with Spiced Icing</h3>

In the past I've avoided pumpkin pies and other baked pumpkin sorts of things.  It was just sort of bland and unappealing to me.</p>

<p>Then 2 years ago I ended up with mounds of butternut squash on my kitchen counters, and I didn't have a clue what to do with it.  I didn't want to roast it and eat it with a meal, because I don't like mixing "sweet" with "real" food, and it's far too sweet for my tastebuds.</p>

<p>Out of desperation I sliced one open, cleaned it of the seeds, and roasted it.  Then I stared at it for a while and it occured to me that what it really looked like (and tasted like) was pumpkin.  So I started to bake pies, muffins, and breads using the roasted squash and became a fan.</p>

<p>Since that time, I've heard rumors that canned pumpkin isn't really pumpkin in many cases.  Rumor has it that most canned pumpkin is really butternut squash.</p>

<p>Still, in my opinion, the difference not only lies in the type of squash, but more importantly in the deep, fresh-roasted flavor of the non-canned alternative.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cuisinecapers.com/images/cookiesheet.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.cuisinecapers.com/images/cookiesheet.html','popup','width=800,height=558,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://www.cuisinecapers.com/images/cookiesheet-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="139" border="0" hspace="20" align="left"/></a>I have a love/hate relationship with baking with pumpkins.  I love the flavors, but I hate the fact that I am the only one in the house who will even consider eating the stuff.  So that means that there's lots of baked goods sitting around that I need to eat before it goes bad, and that isn't very good for someone who is trying to pay attention to caloric intake.</p>

<p>So today I tried to make some low-fat pumpkin cookies.  I formed one batch into scone-type mounds, and the other batch into cookie shaped flatter circles.  Then I promptly defeated the low-fat, lower calorie recipe by adding a spiced icing at the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>These cookies are actually much better as scones or muffins, as it turns out.  They don't get crispy enough for a cookie, but the texture is just about right for a muffin or a softer scone.</p>

<p>I had planned to grill a nice marinated salmon steak for dinner tonight, but a quick trek around the nearest store showed no salmon that I would even consider buying.  So instead I picked up tilapia.</p>

<p>Tilapia is a mild white fish that is ideal for picking up the flavors that you are cooking with.   One of my favorite ways of making tilapia is a way that I just dreamt up because the ingredients sounded good and healthy as well:  <a href="http://www.cuisinecapers.com/archives/000037.html">Tilapia with Bulgar and Chickpeas</a></p>

<p>Tonight I had a lot of tomatoes to use before they went bad, so I thought I'd do a variation on my <a href="http://www.cuisinecapers.com/archives/000039.html">Grilled Chicken with Olive and Avacado Salsa</a>.  </p>

<p>And voila, my Tilapia with Mediterranean Salsa was born.  And it is a keeper!  In interest of healthy eating I served this over mixed greens.  However, it would be awesome over rice, bulgar, or any other sort of grain.  </p>

<p>Turkey mixture:<br />

<p>Combine all yogurt sauce ingredients.  Mix and refrigerate for 24 hours or more.</p>

<p>Combine all turkey mixture ingredients.  Stuff in warmed pitas, with yogurt sauce on top.</p>

<p>And here's the turkey breast when it came off the grill on Sunday.  Mmmmm.  Turkey.<br />

There's more "Grilled Chicken with Avocado Olive Salsa"! </p></a><br /></span><div id="varXYZ39" style="display: none"><p><p>This is something that I just threw together on a lark one night last year.  It's become one of my favorite meals - and it's quick, so it's easy to make on a weeknight!  (And it is almost disgustingly healthy!)</p>

<p>The Chicken Part -<br />
- 2 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts<br />
- 1 tsp garlic powder<br />
- 1 tsp curry powder<br />
- 1 tsp cumin<br />
- salt & pepper</p>

<p>The Avacado & Olive Salsa Part -<br />
- 1 Avacado, peeled and chopped<br />
- 1 cup Kalamata and Greek olives - pitted, halved<br />
- 1 or 2 large Tomatoes - diced<br />
- 1 bunch Scallions - bulbs and greens chopped<br />
- 1 tbsp Garlic -chopped  (more if you like garlic.  We do!)<br />
- 1 tsp Curry powder<br />
- 1 tsp Cumin<br />
- Olive Oil<br />
- 1/2 cup chicken stock</p>

<p><br />
The salad part -<br />
- Mixed baby greens</p>

<p>Prepare all salsa ingredients except for chicken stock and combine in bowl.  Add olive oil to desired moisture and consistency.  Adjust seasonings to taste.  Let stand.  The longer it stands, the better it tastes.</p>

<p>Sprinkle chicken with the seasonings. Grill til done.  Remove and let rest. </p>

<p>Add all the salsa ingredients to a saute pan, along with chicken stock. Heat til just warm. </p>

<p>Slice chicken breast semi-diagonally into thick slices. Place over mixed greens. Pour salsa and stock mixture over chicken. Eat with no guilt.<br />
