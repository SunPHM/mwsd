	<p>TIME OUT! Summer vacation. Time to change the daily routine and try something 
	new -- take a vacation, camp out at a different site, catch up on movies. 
	</p>

	<p>In terms of crafts, it means exploring a new medium or learning what it takes 
to produce something we use that we normally purchase ready-made and take for 
granted. A few years ago, someone gave me a Klutz craft book for kids for a 
Christmas present. Although it explored a medium I had never tried, I put it 
aside. (Too simple! It's written for 10 year olds, I thought )  But one day I 
wanted to do something different and  looked at it seriously. Then I tried 
the clearly illustrated projects and, during the course of two hours, I had a 
wonderful time. What worked for kids surely did work for me. 
</p>

<p>
The Klutz publishing company specializes (but not exclusively) in crafts 
books for children. The company's books are imaginatively conceived, clearly 
written and beautifully illustrated. Although we usually present crafts 
projects for young adults and older, we thought that kids would enjoy trying 
out these projects (as would adults).  Klutz has graciously given us permission 
to adapt text and reproduce images from projects in two recent books: 
<b><em><a href="#flowers">Squashing Flowers, Squeezing Leaves</a></em></b>; and 
<b><em><a href="#body">The Body Book</a></em></b>. </p>

<p>In addition to our review, and 
<a href="#projects">crafts projects</a>   taken from these 
books,  we asked some young crafters (Katherine and Susan Glass) to try out 
some projects in these books. Here's what they say -- </p>

		<p>
Do you want to make a peaches and cream hand mask, a lavender salt soak, or a 
milk and honey face scrub? Try The Body Book, a fun and informative activity 
book, perfect for girls ages 10 to 15.  Equipped with most of the supplies 
needed (facial brush, oils, pumice stone, etc.) and simple instructions, the 
reader can create all-natural lotions, moisturizers, conditioners, gels, and 
many other body care products.  This book provides cheap, effective, and 
exotic alternatives to store-bought items. The reader must be prepared, 
however, to buy easy-to-find foods needed to make the recipes.

Review by Katherine Glass (age 15) and Susan Glass (age 12)</em>
	</p>	

	<p>This is an activity book of creative projects using pressed flowers.  The 
problem with this book is that the activity ideas seem to be geared toward 
seven- to ten-year-olds, but the process of drying and handling the delicate 
flowers and the patience involved would be more appropriate to young teens. 
Another drawback is that most of 
the activities call for extra (though for the most part inexpensive) 
materials. If parents are willing to help their children with the 
flower-pressing part of the projects, these activities will prove an 
excellent substitute for video games. </p>

: A Nature Press &amp; Book by Klutz (editors), 2001<br>
<em>Review by Eco-Artware</em>
</p>

<p>
This is a uniquely packaged book.  The "book" itself looks standard, 
consisting of text and pictures printed on thick, glossy paper. But the back 
cover opens into a three-panel press intended to squash plants.  The book 
also comes with a packet of supplies--sturdy rubber bands to keep the press 
tightly closed and a few materials to use in specific projects. 
</p>

<p>
While the press is convenient,  you don't need the one in the book. You can 
squash flowers on your own in simple homemade presses. It's really easy! 
Place two paper towels or two sheets of newspaper cut in 8-inch squares in a 
telephone book.  Place the flowers or leaves on them, place two more paper 
towels or newspapers over them, and close the book.  For greater pressure, 
pile another telephone book or some weighty hard cover books on top. 
</p>

<p>
Wait two to four weeks for the pressed materials to dry.  Take a peek after 
two weeks because different flowers dry at different rates. Remove the 
pressed plants when they are dry and stiff to touch. But hold them gently 
because dried flowers are paper thin and very delicate. 
</p>

</div>

<a name="projects"></a>
<h2  class="MRed">How to Press Flowers</h2>

 
<div class="sText">
<p>How to arrange your flowers for pressing depends on shape. Klutz suggests: 
Press your flower face down, or sideways. It's easiest to press daisy-like 
flowers face-down. Trim off the stem and flatten the back of the flower 
center so the flower can lie flatter.   Press single petals if you want to. 
After drying you can put them back together to look like the original flower 
or use them by themselves in original designs.  If the flower is thick, cut 
it in half. And if it is really lumpy, pull out some of the center petals. 
</p>

<p>When you've dried several flowers and leaves, use them for crafts projects, 
such as these. 
</p>
</div>


<h3 style="color: #336633">Decorating Containers</h3>
 
<div class="sText">

What You Need: 

<ul>
	<li>A plain box (made out of cardboard, wood, metal, or even paper mach&eacute;) </li>
	<li>Pressed flowers and leaves </li>
	<li>Acrylic paints (optional) </li>
	<li>Craft brush </li>
	<li>Diluted white glue (Squeeze some glue into a small cup or jar. Add the same
		amount of water. Use your brush to mix the two together. ) </li>
</ul>

What You Do:
<p><img src="images/squash_step1.jpg" width="300" height="224" alt="art credit: Darwen and Vally Hennings" border="0"><br>
	1) Start out by painting the box with acrylic paint. You can paint the 
	sides of the box lid in a contrasting color. Let the paint dry before adding 
	your flowers.
	</p>
<p><img src="images/squash_step2.jpg" width="300" height="188" alt="art credit: Darwen and Vally Hennings" border="0"><br>
	2) Arrange pressed flowers and leaves and glue in place. Let dry.
	</p>
<p><img src="images/squash_step3.jpg" width="300" height="172" alt="art credit: Darwen and Vally Hennings" border="0"><br>
	3) Brush an overcoat of diluted white glue over everything. Let the glue 
	dry. You can brush on more layers of diluted glue after the first coat dries 
	to add extra protection--a good idea if your box will be handled a lot. 
	</p>

	<p>After you've finished a box,  try decorating ready-made picture frames and 
	mats, recycling a candy tin or sprucing up your lunch box.</p>

Review  by Eco-Artware
</em>
</p>
<p>
Filled with recipes for simple beauty care products you can make at home, 
this book shows how you can take care of yourself from head to toe 
beautifully with products mostly found in your kitchen.  (Okay, you might 
have to get one or two supplies from the health food or drug store.) For 
example, try one of these hair rinses for a good finishing touch to your hair 
care routine.  I like to transfer homemade rinses into a plastic bottle to
avoid 
the possibility of broken glass in the shower or sink. (Use a funnel to pour 
the rinse into the plastic bottle--an empty shampoo bottle works fine.)  Each 
recipe makes enough for one rinse.
</p>

<b>
Camomile Rinse
</b>
<br>
This rinse brings out the highlights in blond and red hair. 
Use it as a final rinse and it will leave your hair shiny and softly scented.
</p>
<p>
<em>
What You Need
</em>
:
<ul>
<li>
2 cups water
</li>
<li>
2 camomile tea bags
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<em>
What You Do
</em>
<br>
Bring the water to a boil.  Add the tea bags, cover the pot and let the rinse 
cool completely. Remove the tea bags. Pour into a plastic bottle (optional). 
Then pour the rinse over your hair after shampooing and conditioning.  Leave 
it in as a final rinse.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Rosemary Rinse
</b>
<br>
This rinse adds luster to dark hair.
</p>
<p>
<em>
What You Need
</em>
:
<ul>
<li>
1 cup water
</li>
<li>
3 Tbsp dried rosemary or (even better) a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary
</li>
<li>
1 cup cider vinegar
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<em>
What You Do
</em>
<br>
Place the water and rosemary in a small pot and bring to a boil. Remove from 
heat and add the vinegar. Let the rinse sit until it's completely cool. 
Strain the liquid, discarding the rosemary.  Pour into a plastic bottle 
(optional). Pour the rinse over your hair after shampooing and conditioning. 
Be careful not to get it in your eyes. After about 5 minutes rinse your hair 
thoroughly in warm water.

<b>
Lemon Lightening Rinse
</b>
<br>
Lemon rinses your hair clean and lightens it as well.
</p>
<p>
<em>
What You Need
</em>
:
<ul>
<li>
Juice from one lemon
</li>
<li>
2 cups warm water
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<em>
What You Do
</em>
<br>
Combine the water and lemon juice. Pour into a plastic bottle (optional). 
Pour over your hair after shampooing and conditioning as a final rinse. Avoid 
getting this rinse in your eyes. It will sting.
