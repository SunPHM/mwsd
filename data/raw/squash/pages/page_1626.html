However I did manage to con an invite for Christmas Dinner from my mate Alan, and very nice it was.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Two of my sisters have bars in the area and we were invited by both to spend New Years Eve with both of them (gratis), not wishing to offend either of them I decided that we would go to our bar and celebrate with the spanish. 7.30 pm saw me on the way down to my local, with Cynth going to follow me down later (after she had dyed her hair), disaster..... once again all the bars were shut (and on New Years Day as well), a quick fone to Cynth to tell her not to bother washing the dye out and then the trek home. All (1) of the local taxi’s were booked up, so that kyeboshed plan 2 (go to my sisters bar). 10.30 pm saw yours truely dressed to kill, sat on the settee, eating coco pops out of the box, 11.00 pm saw me in bed. Happy New Year to one and all (******).&nbsp; The UK for me next year.</B></P>

They celebrate Tree Kings Day on January 6th, each City, town or village hold a festival were the 3 kings arrive in various ways, some by helicopter, in our village they arrived on the back of a pick-up, in the village were my brother in-law lives they arrived on horseback. This year the brother in-law and my mate were elected to be kings, the other one being a spaniard. After donning their costumes and having their faces painted it was time to mount their trusty steeds... 3 blooming great stallions (25 hands high), they thought they had drawn Shergar and Red Rum. They proceeded to parade through the village followed by their helpers and lots of kids, eventually ending up at the church. The kids parents each buy gifts for their children and are charged 5 euros for the pleasure of having them presented by the 3 kings who sit in front of the alter in the church. Monies raised by this event go into a kitty for this years fiesta’s. </B>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Although I had set the alarm for 4.00am I was awake well before it went off, I hadn’t slept much at all because of the excitement. The arrangement was for my mate Peter to pick me up at 6.00am to begin our pilgrimage to the Mecca of carp &amp; cat fishing at Mequinenza in the province of Aragon. Pete arrived a little late, but that gave me time to build up my nicotine intake for the long journey ahead, with Peter &amp; Paul being non-smokers.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>After getting slightly lost we arrived in Mequinenza, and the first port of call was the tackle shop, were we could buy the halibut pellets that were necessary for us to catch the huge carp &amp; cats that the rivers Ebro and Segre are famous for. After seeing that they were €80 per bag we decided to go for the smaller bags at 20 odd euros and replenish our stocks as and when required (tight sods).</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Whilst we were in the shop I got talking to some other English anglers who told me that they had spent the last four days bivvied up (in a tent) because of torrential rain, and that more was expected for the following two days!!. They told us of three cat fish that had been caught in the last few days, and that they had been over 200 pounds in weight….. Wow.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Next stop was our hotel, where we could dump our luggage and rush to the river…. Problem, it was locked and closed with no signs of life, what the eck, we would go fishing and come back later.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Peter took us to a spot and assured us it was cert for us to catch big carp, the previous week Peter had told me that all that I needed to bring with me was clothing and that he had all the gear I would need for fishing. After giving me a rod, reel, folding seat and a beach fishing tri-pod both he and Paul began setting up loads of gear, with yours truly (Mary Ellen) left twiddling his thumbs, seeing that I was getting a bit irate Peter then suggested that I make up a rig, an offer which I duly declined and went off in a sulk. After five bite less hours we decided that we would go and see if the hotel was open (it now being pitch black), guess what…. Yes, still closed. Visions of having to sleep in the car were going through my mind when Paul spotted a telephone number written below the door bell, after ringing the number the owner arrived and we were shown to our rooms, it was decided  with me being a smoker that I would have a room to myself, so I grabbed the first room that we were shown, only to have Pete moan afterwards that mine had an en-suite and theirs didn’t….. tough, I was still sulking.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>After a couple of shandys yours truly was in bed at 9.35 pm, end of day 1.</B></P>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>I forgot to mention that Pete did catch half a fish???, a carp took his bait, along with another that belonged to some bloke further along the bank, the other bloke netted the fish but Pete claimed a half share in it !!.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>DAY TWO</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>After the early night I was raring to go and get em, I gave the others an early morning call and went for a coffee, twenty minutes later Peter came into the bar and had a coffee, after asking where Paul was I was informed he was still in bed.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>We eventually piled into the car and began day 2 of our Ebro Expedition, we pulled into a lay by on the bank of the river, were Peter told us that we where lucky to find this spot empty and that normally it was full of anglers (starting to have doubts), within 30 minutes five rods pointed out into the Ebro and day 2 had began in earnest. After a couple of bite less hours I offered to make cups of tea for us all, using Pete’s brand new travel kettle. Thirty minutes later saw 2 steaming hot mugs of tea for Paul and I (Pete said he didn’t like tea). Two or three bite less hours later the kettle was on again, and yes, another cup followed after another fishless three hours, It was then that Peter decided that he did like tea after all, and would I make him one as well. 60 fishless and bite less rod hours later I mentioned to Peter that the fact that this great spot was vacant must mean something! No comment from Peter.</B></P>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>7.30 pm, food and a couple of shandy’s, in bed by 9.25 pm (new record).</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>DAY 3</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>After Peter’s success on day 1 we all decided (after waking Paul up) that we should go back to the place were he caught his half of fish, it was still dark when we arrived on the bank. A couple of lights could be seen a bit further along the bank, and dawn revealed that we were in the company of three Germans who had obviously heard about Pete’s half of fish. They had come prepared; they had three rods out and then proceeded to take two more sets of bait 200 yards out into the river with the aid of a motor boat that they had moored up. After baiting up five rods two of them then went off upriver, leaving their mate to look after the five rods.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>We the Brits also had five rods out, and it wasn’t long before four ounce leads were flying out in all directions, because of the lack of fish we still had plenty of bait left (I’m glad we didn’t buy the big bags) and we were determined to spare no expense and so began the barrage of pellets. Shortly afterwards Peters rod was snatched off his rod pod, a monster carp we all thought, a monster it was, <U>a monster cormorant had caught his line</U></B><U>.</U></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>After a couple of unusually quiet hours!!! I decided to put the kettle on and make a brew, it normally takes about 30 minutes for the kettle to boil, but one hour later still no tea. Peter heard me muttering about his crappy kettle and decided to get off his butt and help out, then all hell broke out, all this brewing had flattened the car battery, after launching the nearly boiled kettle into the depths of the Ebro, and wiping away the tears Peter politely informed me that, IF we managed to get the car going again  that tea would no longer be on the menu !!!.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>With my two angling companions being left mortified (Paul at the prospect of no more tea), I (Mary Ellen) took it upon myself to take command of the situation and go for assistance. After walking a considerable distance I was fortunate to meet up with some other English anglers, after explaining our predicament and asking if they had any jump leads, they said have you tried the garage in Mequinenza; Now, as I had just explained that we had a flat battery and couldn’t start the car and they’re asking me if I’ve tried the garage which is about two miles away !!!. Forget it, I thought to myself, no good knocking if theres nobody in and proceeded to make my way back, after walking a short distance guess what happened, yes, the English guys drove past me and went to the village !!. </B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>A couple of hours later the two Germans came back in the boat, and the car they had was an old banger so they would obviously have some jump leads I thought to myself, Seeing how Paul’s love of tea had contributed to our dilemma I suggested that he go and ask them for assistance, whereupon he informed me that he couldn’t speak German. Yours truly, being fluent in spanglish, gibberish and rubbish, took it upon myself to ask these nice gentlemen (who had taken half the bank up) for assistance.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>My skills in mime obviously had an effect, because within a couple of minutes I and my new German mate pulled alongside Pete’s car&nbsp; complete with brand span new jump leads and a tow rope. “Open the bonnet” Pete I said, don’t know where the catch is said Pete !!, after short friendly discussion Pete and I found the bonnet catch, along with my new friend and a Spaniard who decided to join in, we all played find the battery, we looked in the engine compartment, we looked in the boot, we even looked inside the car… no battery in sight, great things these modern cars. My mucker Hans then came up with the suggestion that we tow it, and thanks be to God and the Germans the car spluttered into life again. Time for a cuppa, I thought, only to be told by Pete that the subject of tea making was not up for discussion.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Now that we had got the car going Peter informed me that he and I would take a ride into Mequinenza to top the battery up and get some nosh from the burger van, better than sitting here thought I, so off we went. After purchasing burger &amp; chips and spotting six packs off San Miguel I thought it would be a nice gesture to give the Germans a pack, along with a pack for myself. As we were about to set off back to our pegs the German owner of the tackle shop next door came for his dinner, a discussion on the crap fishing then took place and he informed us that we had fished all the wrong places. Thanks for nothing, thought I.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Any way back to the bankside, my offer of the San Miguel was declined by the Germans, so waste not want not, me and my&nbsp; other new mate, the Spaniard scoffed the lot</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>With the mechanical problems being sorted out and no signs of a bite Peter &amp; Paul decided that it was siesta time again and went back to sleep, I on the other hand started a one man casting tournament, seeing just how far across the mighty Ebro I could chuck a four ounce lead, as the picture below shows I came quite close to awakening Peter several times. After a long practice at casting I even considered taking up sea fishing - can’t be any worse than this carp fishing I thought.</B></P>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Later in the afternoon an English guy came along and rudely awakened Pete, he then went on to tell us about his mate who had a boat on the river at Flix, and, that for a small fee he would be prepared to take us cat fishing in it, a hastily made phone call&nbsp; saw the deal done and dusted. The rods were packed away and an end was called to another exciting days carp fishing, fish nil, bites nil, but what the eck, tomorrow we’re going after giant cat fish.</B></P>

Nigel, our guide met us at the slipway and within five minutes we were anchored up by the outfall of the local power station. I was quite excited at his choice because, 12 months ago I had fished the same spot and within a twenty minute period had not only had my heaviest fish ever, a cat of 35lb, but quickly went on to boat an 85 pounder. Two hours later and no signs of a bite, still it was a bit more exciting than walking up and down the bank watching a motionless rod tip. <U>Then it happened</U>, my float which was attached to a six ounce eel disappeared, ole, ole, ole, I sang to myself and prepared to strike into a monster cat, only to see my float re-appear on the surface, disaster I thought, but it renewed the excitement in the boat for a short while. Peter and Nigel&nbsp; discussed property prices around the Flix area, then went onto talk about their financial affairs, Paul, he just ate and slept, while yours truly worked his nuts off trying to get that one bite that could possibly have resulted in a new cat fish record.</B>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Seven hours later saw the end of yet another fishless day, and the end to this years Ebro Expedition. In all fairness to our guide Nigel he really did try to put us on fish, and he even offered to take us again virtually free of charge.  Funny how a few hours sleep can change things, after vowing never to do it again I am raring to go and give it another bash next year. Should any of you be thinking of trying the Ebro I can’t tell you the good spots, but I can certainly tell you the bad ones!!! . I managed three PB’s (personal bests for early nights) and am now considering joining my local sea fishing club.</B></P>

Bartollo, the owner of my local bar disagrees, he says that it is the wettest, he has sold more booze than ever!! With yours truly, being one of his best customers. It has been a good year for socialising… with the bars being packed with ex-pats and holiday makers seeking the relief of the air conditioning that the bars offer. Also the “DOG PARLOURS” have been doing a roaring trade amongst the brits, all the pooches now sport the same hair cut… SKINHEAD.</B>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>As regards fishing, the weather has kept me in doors, you have to be a bit bonkers to sit for five hours in the mid-day sun to catch less than you can in Winter. The total weight of fish caught in the latest series of eight matches was nearly 4000 lbs, that is less than our Spring Series, shows how the high temps affect the fishing over here. </B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>On a bad note, the influx of eastern Europeans into Spain has seen the fish stocks decimated. I accept that to some people carp are food, but when you see blatant day time netting of fish with the catch going straight into freezer vans it does tend to stick in your craw a bit. I had a fone call recently from a bloke down on the South of the Costa Blanca asking me who to contact about people netting a lake which over looks his house, it appears that two Russians where using an inflatable dinghy to net fish and he had contacted some authority about it, only to be told that they where to busy to do anything about it, I told him to fone the Guardia (police) and tell them about it. It’s a massive problem over here and no body’s bothered about it. On one of the local waters that I fish you can spot the difference between the brits and the eastern europeans by their fishing tackle, we the brits have things like tackle boxes, rods and reels, whereas they have handlines and breeze blocks, seriously, they sit on breeze blocks and hide them in the rushes when they pack up!!!, one of my little pleasures is finding the blocks and destroying them, imagining them searching for them next time they fish illegally, he, he.&nbsp; </B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>I hope that I will be able to write an article about my fishing and new venues that I plan to fish very shortly, they include a trip to the Ebro after big carp (my mate had a 35 pounder recently).</B></P>

I was also sent an email with the results of the quarter final match. If you won your section in the morning and afternoon match your total points was 2, a perfect score.

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>The format for the team match was: meet at draw for 6.30am (45 miles away), after draw has been made go to peg (8.00am), 9.25am START INTENSIVE GROUND BAITING, 9.30am start fishing, match ends 12.30pm. These matches are float only and no lead must touch the bottom, also stewards check the amount of bait that you have (limited) and can also ask you to remove your tackle so that they can check for lead touching the bottom. After the weigh-in has been completed and you have had your weigh card marked up you are then given your peg and section number for the afternoon match...... go to bar till 3.00 pm...... go to peg at 3.00 pm, 4.25 pm START INTENSIVE GROUND BAITING, match starts at 4.30pm and finishes at 7.30pm, The winner being the team with the lowest points total from the two matches.

We did mange to beat some Spanish clubs along the way, in morning and afternoon matches.

                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>I recently received an email telling me about a new trout fishery that had opened near Alicante and having a few hours to spare I decided to go and find the place and find out about the fishing and rules of the fishery.</B></P>

My first impression of it was that it looked like a swimming pool, it had artificial grass around its banks. The owner informed me that it was well stocked with rainbows, and there was certainly plenty of them showing on the day. Jan the owner said that the place closed down from June till September because of the hot weather, and that during that time he used the place as a swimming pool to keep him and his wife cool, it confirmed my first impressions about the place, but I still intend having a go for the trout. And if I get bored I can take a dip in the pool.</B>

The membership has increased to the point where we have had to form a proper committee and are in the process of joining the Spanish Federation of Anglers. Wild carp make up 99% of the catches and boy do they bite and fight hard, so far this year we have had three rods and poles disappear into the water never to be seen again, a second change of clothing is an essential item of kit out here.</B></P>

Locals feed it when it comes into the bar and it’s quite tame, but it has a habit of biting your leg when your not looking and when you are on the black ball in pool it can be a bit off-putting to say the least. It had my mate Del Boy twice the other night when he was playing his game in the annual pool KO, now Del Boy is ex SAS or Mercenary or something, so you can imagine what he said to the boars owner, needless to say the owner left the bar along with the boar.

We had booked into a Hostal for the three nights at a cost of 28 euros per day, for bed, breakfst and a four course evening meal ( thats less than £18 per day, and for 70p you could get a huge lump of bread with meat, cheese , etc, for your lunch whilst fishing. Like I said before, I had over induluged the night before and had not left the bar until 1.30am and had to be up at 5.00am (supporting Greece) to get ready for the four hour journey, so needless to say, I was ready for an early night.</B>

The other two guy’s set up there tackle for a days carp fishing and very soon Mike arrived. after quickly launching his boat we where off, two hundred yards down the river we dropped anchor outside of an hydro electric plant, right underneath a wier. Mike then proceeded to give us a talk on using a multiplier and a toilet ballcock (which was the float), 80 lb braid and 6.0 hooks was the tackle we where to use that day. The idea was to trot the bungs under the wier and let it follow the current around, sounds easy till you realise that there is three of you in the back of the boat, all trying to control your floats. It was very similar to fishing a back eddy on the Dane, except you had a toilet ballcock on the end of your line and you where continually ducking under the other two people’s rods and also having to mend your line. It really was hard going and after 7 hours you felt the pain.</B>

After another four hours without any more runs my 4 lb carp got excited and my bung duly went under - PLOP, straight down, adrenalin pumping, I struck realy hard, only to find I had not put the clutch onto my multiplier, guess what.... I missed it, but it seemed to change my luck and after several more scares my bung went down and I connected with my first cat, a few minutes later and it was in the boat, 35 lb, not much, but it was the biggest fish that I had ever caught, a few foto’s later and a lot of stick from my mate Pete, who said it wasn’t a cat but a kitten and also reminding me that he had caught a 129 lb fish I was into a second cat, this time the rod really bent, Mike fitted me with a butt pad, and I then began the experience of a lifetime, I thought<IMG ID="Picture47" HEIGHT=213 WIDTH=283 SRC="../assets/images/DSCF0011A.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=7 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=0 ALT=""> that my adrenalin days were over, but after seeing my next cat come over the side of the boat I new that there was still some left in me. Mike put my fish into the weigh sling and it recorded 95 lb on the scales, not quite the ton but I had beaten my PB by 60 lb, That unfortunately was the last fish of the day and I was the only one on the boat to catch. Darren was buzzing and asked Miked if there was any availble places for the next day, Mike said that there was one place and Darren took it.</B>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>After arranging with the others to meet for breakfast at 7.00am I awoke at 7.45am, head banging from my celebrations from the night before. I went to Pete and Darrens rooms to find that they where still in bed, heads banging. We eventually arrived on the bankside to find our other two mates fishing. Now up till now my mate Pete had blanked, and this is the guy who in the past had caught fish up to 129 lb (have I mentioned that before ?). Very soon I was into a carp only to feel my hook pull out of it, but I quickly was into another one and managed to land it, a carp of around 6 lb. Shouts from Pete made me look in his direction and he shouted that he had a cat on, a couple of minutes later a cat of around 5 lb hooked up the backside was landed, one to Pete, First in two days !!.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Mike turned up at 11.00 am and because only one person had turned up Darren went cat fishing.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>By 8.00 pm and a good days carp fishing we had to catch what we thought was the last ferry back across the river to Flix, There was no signs of Darren, upon reaching the opposite bank we foned Mike, he said that he would drop Darren off on our bank, 30 minutes later Darren arrived at the car looking like a Cheshire cat, he had caught an 86 lb fish and had lost four more.</B></P>

                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>P.P.S. Cormorants and the damage they do to fish stocks is a topic of concern in the UK, and rightly so, but have you given any thought to the stocking of catfish into UK waters. Catfish where introduced into the Ebro in the early seventies, a german put 10 or 12 fish into the river and in the last thirty years they have spread all the way along the river. When we were fishing for cats the guide said it was becoming impossible to get any small fish for live baits and that he had used a 4-8-0 crucian for bait the day before and had caught a cat straight away on it, and when we fished for carp we had nothing under 6-0-0............. need I say more, Edwardo.</B></P>

                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>After last weeks gale it was a pleasure to arrive on the banks of the Rio Jucar and find the sun streaming down on the river, fish where topping everywhere.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>This weeks match was one that was designated FLOAT ONLY, and with the smell of success still fresh in my nostrils I felt pretty confident. I drew peg number five but on this stretch of the&nbsp; river the draw doesn’t seem to important</B> <B>as most of the pegs are featureless.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>I started the match feeding two lines, one at 11 metres and another at 4 metres. The bottom of this river close in has huge boulders on it and it is virtually impossible to plumb it, one minute your depth is right and the next you are two foot or more to shallow, your plummet sitting on a boulder.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG ID="Picture40" HEIGHT=289 WIDTH=251 SRC="../assets/images/DSCF0005.JPG" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=4 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=0 ALT=""><B>After spending half an hour or so fishing the 11 metre line with no success I switched to the inside line and immediately had a carp. On this river it sometimes pays to feed ground bait and another time they don’t want it, but today they wanted it and it was a bite a chuck, with a small ball of ground bait each chuck I managed to keep them feeding throughout the match. Hardly anybody else was catching only the guy on peg one and he was using a bolognese rod in mid river, everybody else was fishing at around 11 meters and not catching much, then after a couple of hours the guy on the next peg decided to fish close in and caught straight away, then they all decided to fish close in , but by then I had established a good weight and wasn’t to worried.</B>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>As I said before the bottom here is full of huge boulders and during the match you could fish a part of your peg for ages then suddenly you would snag up on a boulder, then you could fish on and not get snagged only to snag again later, this caused me to lose a few hooks and a lot of time, but at the weigh in I managed to put 52-4-0 onto the scales and win the match.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>second place was taken by the guy on the bolognese rod with 41-0-0 and the bloke on the peg next to me took third with 40-9-0.</B></P>

These float only matches are far and few between and are not to popular with most members as they would rather chuck a feeder out and they like the big weights that come from that style of fishing, but I personally enjoy float fishing, it reminds me a bit of the UK and the many enjoyable hours on the local rivers. </B>

                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Friday the 14th May saw the recently formed Alcalali Angling Club travel to Albufera which is up towards Valencia. Albufera is a massive lake with canals and rivers running off it to irrigate the rice fields and is just inland from the sea.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Upon arriving at the venue we where disappointed to find the weather had turned into a howling gale and that the conditions were not going to be ideal.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>This was the first time I had fished Albufera and after plumbing my swim and finding that it was around four foot all the way across I decided to set up a pole and a feeder rod, after feeding two pole lines, one close in and one at 7 metres, I had a few chucks with the feeder rod but the conditions were that bad I decided to concentrate on my pole lines.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>I started fishing my first pole line which was only 3 metres out, just over a raft of rubbish and caught three carp straight away, I lost two more and then the wind blew the raft of rubbish out of my swim and I stopped catching. I then fished my second pole line at seven metres and caught straight away again, I proceeded to catch steadilly throughout the match despite the terrible conditions and eventually came out the winner with 35 lb - 4 oz.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The other weights were: 19-6-0, 14-8-0 which included a carp of over 12 lbs and finally 9-2-0. so I was quite pleased with myself considering that the others had fished the venue before and considering the conditions on the day.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>P.S. The spanish club that I am in, is fielding a team of five in the first of the  Spanish Federation KO matches this Sunday, and guess what - yours truly has been asked to fish for the club. I must be starting to impress them with my outstanding pole fishing skills !!!.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Just like the international matches, you are not allowed to ledger or have any weight on the bottom, we have had a load of rain recently and the river is bombing through so it will be interesting to say the least. I am looking forward to watching how the spanish fish and what tackle and bait they use. Eventually after a series of these KO matches a team will be selected to represent Spain..... Just think what could possibly happen...... Edwardo, fishing for Spain!!!!&nbsp;  </B></P>

                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>After fishing the Rio Jucar for the last six months I was looking forward to fishing the lake at Beniarres, One of the clubs I’m in had fished it on the previous Sunday for the first time this year but I had friends over from Barnton and was unable to fish the match, the winning weight was only 10lb, but this venue gets better and better as more matches are held there.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>The evening before the match I decided that the tactics I would use would be to fish the pole at 4 - 6 metres and put a feeder rod out as well (you can fish two rods with this club). As we where driving to the lake I told my mate Pete what I had decided to do, to which he replied <FONT COLOR="#CC3333">“your wasting your time fishing pole, I haven’t bothered bringing mine”</FONT> On arriving at the lake I was astounded to see that it was back to its normal level, the last time I had fished it was 30 - 40 foot below its normal level and I had also forgotten how magnificent the scenery was.</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=LEFT><IMG ID="Picture39" HEIGHT=148 WIDTH=150 SRC="../assets/images/tn_beniarres4.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=7 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=0 ALT=""><B>At the draw I drew peg 1, they had pegged it out in such a way that pegs 1,2 and 3 where in a small bay and then there was a gap to the rest of the other pegs which where on the main lake. This made it look as though there was two matches going on!!. I caught a small carp on my first cast on the pole as did the bloke on peg 3, he continued to catch fish whilst I watched my float bob about without going under, then the bloke on peg two started to catch, all three of us were on the pole and although we all had chucked a feeder out, none of us bothered with it. The other two were pulling fish out, but they where also losing fish so I wasn’t too bothered, at least fish where on all three pegs.</B>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Fishing&nbsp; with five sections of pole put me in around ten foot of water and eventually I started to catch, two or three fish then nothing, then an other two or three. To me my fish seemed larger and I was bringing them in quicker than the other two anglers, and they where still losing the odd fish, after a while the bites slowed off, I had been using a single grain of corn, as had the other two, I switched to two grains on the hook and the response was immediate, they buried the float!!. </B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>All three of us continued to catch fish until the last couple of hours when the wind direction changed and then my swim went dead, the other two caught an odd fish and the bloke on peg three caught three carp in the last ten minutes. The rumour round the bank was that all the other anglers on the main lake had struggled so I thought I might have come third. Being peg number one I was the first to weigh in and the scales revealed a weight of 17.9 kilos (around 38lb), peg 2 weighed 16.4 kilos and peg three 10.2 kilos. another angler on the main lake had weighed 13.2 kilos, so low and behold, I had won!!</B></P>
                            <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>I was informed after the weigh in that the match had been for the “Beniarres Trophy” so I have won my first trophy of the new season. </B></P>

Most of the top weights were taken on the float/feeder method. The norm on this river is to fish the method feeder on the bottom until the fish start hitting it on the drop, which usually takes a couple of hours but today the fish were starving and started to attack the feeders straight away. Over 600 lbs of fish were taken by 12 anglers. I know that I keep going on about the good weights that are winning matches out here but carping on the costa’s really is great, especially when you consider that it’s winter. Nothing other than sweetcorn and ground bait (lots of it) are all you need to catch. The average weight of the fish on the Jucar is around two pounds but occasionally fish up to 12 pounds are taken. If any of you are coming to Benidorm or the Costa Blanca for a holiday and fancy a go, let me know, my mate Pete does fishing trips with pick ups from your hotel, he also has a selection of accommodation available and he provides licenses and tackle, his website is </B><A HREF="http://www.carp-fishing-spain.co.uk"><B>www.carp-fishing-spain.co.uk</B></A>
