the bioengineering of food plants for human consumption and 2) the burning of 
fossil fuels. The single greatest threat to the environment (the ozone, 
biodiversity) is the burning of fossil fuels. Many communities suffer the 
effects of ozone depletion and related fossil fuel pollution, but must also 
consume foods which have been grown in contaminated soil and other unhealthy 
environmental conditions. <span lang="en-us">The artist's</span> work as a public environmental artist<span lang="en-us">

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Sans Unicode">Renewable energy
technologies have improved greatly in recent years, but without real financial support for
research and public education, they cannot improve as quickly as is necessary to
counteract the overwhelming ill effects of the burning of fossil fuels.&nbsp; Because the
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and particularly the former Soviet countries, are
currently dealing with (in some cases) profoundly degraded natural systems, it is
critically important that people in these countries are presented with the idea that there
is hope, perhaps in the form of renewable energy sources as well as other newly developed
alternatives, for (at the minimum) stabilizing the natural systems which they depend upon
for food, water, and air.<br>
<br>
</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="2">My commitment to
using renewable energy technologies in my work represents an effort to underscore the
necessity for artists to be environmentally responsible. At the same time, S<em>uspicious
Science's</em> cast resin mutant vegetables are an open admission that artwork which <br>
is placed in the public realm requires employing permanent<br>
materials that may not always be environmentally friendly. <br>
<br>
Lithuania is an ideal place to site a new work showcasing renewable solar technology while
also alluding to the frightening consequences of nuclear- dependent energy production.
Like many former Soviet block countries, Lithuania is wrestling with a legacy of
dangerously out-dated nuclear power plants. Because the country has neither the means to
purchase fossil fuels nor the resources to produce them, these plants are needed to
provide 100% of its energy, but its citizenry, having watched the Chernobyl devastation
from a frighteningly close perspective, are very aware of the dangers associated with
&nbsp; nuclear technologies, particularly from those generating facilities which lack the
most up-to-date<br>
safety and containment equipment. </font><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3"> <br>

</font><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="2">The gorgeous but mutant vegetables in the <em>Suspicious Science </em>garden are an
engaging but scary evocation of the possible outcome of nuclear pollution. The
installation's solar-powered illumination softens this effect while suggesting energy
alternatives that could will have long-lasting positive consequences for Lithuania's
people and natural resources.<br>
