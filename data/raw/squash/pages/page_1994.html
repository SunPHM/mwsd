<br><b>NOTE: We <i>will</i> be operating in the 2006 season!</b> As we restructure the farm, we will update you on our progress and invite your input for its evolution.<P>

<div class="head1">About Our C.S.A.</div>

Terra Bella Farm operates a Community Supported Agriculture membership program, or C.S.A. The C.S.A. differs from buying your produce from a grocery or natural food store, or even a farmers&rsquo; market, because it has the potential to create a direct partnership between the farm and the people who regularly eat the food grown on the farm. Members share some of the farmer&rsquo;s risk by purchasing their harvest share before it is planted. With much of the marketing and some of the costs spread between the grower and consumer, we come closer to our long-term objectives of <B>growing more food</B> and <B>bringing more people to experience an organic farm</B>.<p>

We plant and tend more than 50 different vegetable, small fruit, culinary herb, and flower crops each season. Our goal is to share the very best of what&rsquo;s available to you at the peak of freshness. Although weather and other factors may limit our ability to provide a particular favorite on a given week, we work hard to maintain a healthy, balanced soil that consistently provides most of what we ask.<p>


<div class="head1">Join Our C.S.A.</div>

To join our Community Supported Agriculture program, simply purchase a harvest &ldquo;share&rdquo; of our produce before the growing season begins. You will receive your weekly share of organic vegetables, herbs, small fruit, and flowers at our convenient downtown Columbia pick-up location, the <B>Uprise Bakery</B>. (New pick-up locations will be added as our membership grows.) Members also receive a weekly harvest guide with recipes and the opportunity to participate in several on-farm events.<p>

The 2002 USDA organic regulations have made more organic seeds available to us and other growers. As we write this, the short supply and great demand have pushed prices for these seeds quite high. We will continue to support suppliers of organic seeds and hope to have more local sources in the future. Seeds are the obvious example of something every farm needs before harvest and selling begins. We have many start-up costs each season: equipment repairs, maintenance, and purchase, greenhouse supplies, harvest tools, market fees, labor, etc.... A Community Supported Agriculture program, or C.S.A, assists the farm in meeting some of these early season costs.<p>

<div class="head2">Discounts for Early Payment</div>

An important part of laying the groundwork for the C.S.A. season is having the membership fully accounted for before the harvest begins. While we break down the costs into weekly amounts for reference, limited farm staff and resources require us to receive full payment by May 15, 2004. There may be exceptions to this. If you have special circumstances, or just more questions about our C.S.A. program, please contact us at (573) 387-4949 or email <a href="mailto:terrabellafarm@yahoo.com">terrabellafarm@yahoo.com</a>.<p>

<ul>
<li>Full payment received by <B>April 1, 2004</B> qualifies for a 10% discount (7% for online payments).
<li>Full payment by <B>May 1, 2004</B> receives a 5% discount (2% for online payments).

<div class="head1">The Farm and Our Community</div>

Active lives often play a role in compromising well-intentioned food choices. With the Terra Bella C.S.A. membership, you&rsquo;ll enjoy the quality of our organic produce and the service of a convenient pick-up. Your input into how much and what we offer in the harvest share, how we set-up the membership plans, and where we deliver, helps us plan for the coming season. To this end, we&rsquo;re scheduling several U-pick events on the farm this year. This will provide us the opportunity to learn from you, and you&rsquo;ll experience a closer connection with your food. C.S.A. members are invited to schedule a visit to the farm at any time during the growing season.<p>


<div class="head1">Common Questions</div>

<div class="head3">What if I can&rsquo;t pick up my harvest share?</div>

If you know in advance you will miss a scheduled pick-up day, you might enjoy having a friend pick-up your harvest share that week. Anyone you choose can pick-it up. We make many donations to food pantries and area families in need.<p> 

<div class="head3">What if I can&rsquo;t eat everything in a week?</div>

Your input is eagerly awaited regarding the quantity and variety of foods offered. We will include recipe suggestions and other tips to help familiarize you with the specialty crops. <p>
