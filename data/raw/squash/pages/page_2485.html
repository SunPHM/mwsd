In the Longhouse there are fivefireplaces and</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">three ash pitsthat are at the fireplace. There was a storage pit to store food likemeat, corn etc. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The tools of the Huron were theantler harpoon, the netting needle, the clay pipe, a tortoise shapedamulet, a stone arrowhead, a stone spearhead and a claypot.</FONT></P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+4" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U><IMG SRC="ElizabethFN.gif" WIDTH=278 HEIGHT=276 ALIGN=bottom></U></FONT></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The Huron planted corn and manydifferent kinds of beans like kidney beans and lima beans, pumpkin,melons and squash. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>The Huron Clothing</U>:</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">In the summer the Huron men wouldwear only a breechcloth.

The Huron people lived near theGreat Lakes where the land was easy to work without futuristic tools.The land was fertile so the soil was good for growing crops. Thisland had no steep mountains. They had slopes which were easy to climbso that they could watch for their enemies. The Huron built theirvillages near rivers and lakes. Hundreds of small lakes and rivershelped the Huron to travel and trade with their friendly neighbours.Without these good rivers the Huron would have found it moredifficult to survive.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>Vegetation andPlants</U></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">Vegetation and plants were veryimportant to the Huron lifestyle. Corn, or Maize as the Huron calledit, would not grow unless it was warm for 120 days. The Huron wouldtrade their corn, beans and animal skins with other villages bytraveling in their birch bark canoes down the rivers. They grewkidney beans, lima beans, sunflowers for the oil and seeds, pumpkins,melons, squash and tobacco. Blueberries and raspberries were found inthe wild. The cultivated land that was found outside of the villagewas used for farming all these foods. There were  hemlock, pine,maple, elm, ash and birch trees in this land. On these trees theHuron found Canadian plums, Shagbark hickory, Sweet crab apples andthe American chestnut. The Huron relied on the plants and vegetationfound in the Great Lakes for their survival.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>Climate andSeasons</U></FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The Huron had four differentseasons like we do today and their climate was the same as ours also.There were four seasons in the Huron's year: spring when they plantedtheir crops; summer when they watched their crops grow; fall whenthey harvested their crops and winter when they rested and ate theircrops. In winter, the Huron people did not go far from theirlonghouses because it was too cold. If they had to go out to getwood, they would use their snowshoes and not go too far. The Huronadapted to each season.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>Animal Life</U></FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The environment around the GreatLakes was good for many creatures. The Huron caught different typesof fish like trout, sturgeon and the whitefish in Georgian Bay. SomeHuron hunted in the forest for black bears, elk, deer, rabbits andwolves and some other Huron hunted wild birds like wild turkeys,geese, ducks, herons, pigeons and partridges. The Huron used theirhunting skills to catch the animals that lived in the Great Lakesregion.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>The Huron Creation Story</U></FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The old chief would sit at thefire and tell a story. The chief would wait for it to be silent so hecould begin his story. When creation began, there was nothing butwater and the only living creatures were the ones that lived in theocean. Then one day a woman fell from the sky, and</FONT><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">two loons flying on the water saw herfalling and placed themselves under the woman.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">Then a big turtle came up fromunder the water so they put the woman on the turtle's back. Theturtle told the loon to get some earth from the bottom of the ocean,but all of the loons were dead. In one of the loon's mouths, theturtle saw a piece of land. So the turtle took the land out of theloon's mouth and put it on his back and it grew and grew until itbecame land. That is the Huron creation story.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">by: Elisabeth</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">My Legend: </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>How did Corn becameCorn</U></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">Along time ago there was a man andhis three daughters. The man and his three daughters had magicalpowers. The man's name was Ison and the three daughters names wereEneah, Atequen and Ondouen. Ison's daughters were very dear to him,but one day Ison heard his daughters saying that they were gettingmarried and leaving their father to be with their husbands. He didn'twant his daughters to get married, so he put a spell on his daughtersand they became golden sparkly dust which he put in a jar. Theystayed there for ten years, but one day a big wind came in and itmade the jar fall and break into a million pieces. The dust fell downfrom the sky and on the ground. Ison could not do anything Two yearslater corn was growing. The dust that fell and became kernels. Thatis how corn became corn.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>The Huron Food and Hunting</U></FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>Food:</U></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The Huron planted corn and manydifferent kinds of beans like kidney beans and lima beans. Theyplanted sunflower seeds to give them oil for cooking. Pumpkin, melonsand squash were also grown. Tobacco was also grown in small gardens.When the time for harvesting came the women would pick the corn andput it in baskets and then they would take the baskets of corn intothe longhouse to cook them</FONT> <FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">andstore them for the winter. The Huron also ate wild plums, grapes,cherries, berries and sweet crab apples and many wild nuts includingchestnut, black walnuts and hickory nuts. In the spring the Huron gotmaple sap.</FONT></P><CENTER>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="corn.gif" WIDTH=260 HEIGHT=220 BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>Hunting:</U></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">The Huron fished for trout,sturgeon and whitefish in Georgian Bay. The Huron would bring theircanoes five km out from the shore and place their nets in the water.In the forest the Huron found black bears, elk, deer, rabbits andwolves. They would either shoot the animals with arrows or catch themin traps. They would make traps from tree branches and ropes like asnare. The animals would walk into the loop and the tree wouldrelease upwards and the animal would be caught in the snare upsidedown. The Huron caught wild turkeys, geese, ducks, herons, pigeonsand partridge skin a big net which was placed between two trees. Thistrap would catch as many as 200 birds a night. That would enough tofeed a large Huron village. The Huron women would store the food thatthe men would hunt for them.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>Native discoveries</U></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">Natives discovered a lot of thingswe use today like herbal tea, chamomile, tobacco, blueberries,raspberries, plums, shagbark hickory, nuts, crab apples, chestnut,corn, fur, fish, snowshoes, canoes and arrows. The Native people area big piece of our history. I know that a lot of food and tools camefrom the Native people. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF"><U>The EuropeanContact</U></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">Thousands of native people died inepidemics of smallpox and other European diseases. There was a warand only a few Huron people survived the attack. The Europeansintroduced metal tools that we still use today like knives, guns,swords, pots and hatchets.</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><CENTER>&nbsp;<P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#00CCFF">By: Elisabeth</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P></CENTER><P></P></BODY></HTML>
