            When the days grow short and get dark early and blustery winter 
            weather sets in, it's time to tuck in the garden beds, oil and store 
            the tools, and generally take a break from outside chores. Even in 
            my relatively mild climate
            where I can garden 9 months of the year, the fall plantings are 
            settled in to overwinter, bulbs are planted and I can turn my 
            attention to the holidays ahead. As a dedicated kitchen gardener, 
            the season's festivities are the
            perfect time to enjoy some of the vegetables and herbs I've grown 
            and harvested in autumn for satisfying winter meals. My storage 
            crops of
            hard-shelled winter squash, miniature pumpkins, garlic and potatoes 
            make wonderful cold-weather feasts to enjoy with family and friends.<p class ="subtitle" style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 10px">
            Winter Squashes</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 10px">Winter squashes like butternut and buttercup are not only deliciously nutty and sweet,
            but also terrific sources of fiber and the sunshine vitamin A that 
            is often in short supply in winter. They are easy to cook up in a variety of simple 
            and fine-flavored
            dishes both sweet and savory.
            For holiday meals, a casserole of baked squash is a family favorite. 
            Wash a whole
            squash, 7 or 8 inches in diameter, and cut 5 or 6 slits in the top 
            and sides. Put it in a
            375°F oven for an hour (or microwave for about 30-40 minutes) until 
            the flesh is soft
            and tender. Cool and cut open. Remove the seeds and scoop out the 
            flesh. Mash up
            the flesh with a potato masher adding in real maple syrup or honey, 
            a generous
            sprinkling of cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and a dollop of sweet 
            butter. Pack into a pretty
            deep casserole dish, dot with a few more teaspoons of butter and 
            bake in a 350°F
            oven for about 25 minutes or until the squash has thickened and 
            begins to brown on
            the edges.</td>

        <img border="0" src="../seeds/art/vegies115/pumpkin-holiday_5082.jpg" align="left" width="115" height="102">Winter squash also pairs beautifully with the savory flavor of sage. For 
        an Italian-style
        holiday treat, try this sautéed squash dish to complement holiday roast 
        pork, goose, or
        turkey. You'll find the slow cooking process brings out all the 
        sugars of the sweet squash to combine deliciously with aromatic sage. 
        Remove the rind and seeds from butternut or buttercup squash and cut the 
        flesh in 1-inch chunks until you have about 3 cups. Heat 3 tablespoons 
        of oil in a deep skillet and add a large clove of garlic, finely 
        chopped. Toss in the squash chunks and cook very slowly, stirring often, 
        for about 25-30 minutes until the squash is golden and tender. (Add a 
        spoon or two of water during cooking if the squash begins to stick.) 
        Season with salt and pepper to taste and then add in a generous 
        tablespoon of chopped fresh sage or 2 teaspoons of crumbled dry sage. 
        Mix well and serve piping hot. This dish has a rich flavor and heavenly 
        aroma that will
        entice even vegetable shy diners. Little pumpkins are fun to eat for 
        holiday meals after you've enjoyed them for Halloween! Cut off the tops 
        and remove the seeds, then stuff them with a sausage, herb and bread 
        crumb mixture and bake, basting with broth. Other ways I like to use 
        these cute 4-inch pumpkins is to cook them unstuffed until tender and 
        use as individual soup bowls for creamy soups, or fill them with 
        homemade cranberry sauce or little glazed boiled onions to garnish a 
        roast chicken or turkey.</p>
        <p class="subtitle" style="margin-left: 5; margin-right:20px">
        <font size="4">Savory Potatoes</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right:20px">Your autumn harvest of garden grown potatoes can make you a star cook at 
        the
        holidays. Cut them up and combine with whole peeled garlic cloves and a 
        few
        tablespoons of chopped rosemary and toss with good fruity olive oil. 
        Roast them in a
        375°F oven until crusty on the outside and tender inside, then season 
        with salt and
        pepper to taste and sprinkle over a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar just 
        before serving. The rich sweet garlic and fluffy nutty potato flavors are marvelous 
        together. Or use some of your garden's bounty to make delicious mashed potatoes with 
        roasted garlic. It's easy to roast whole garlic heads. Just sprinkle generously with 
        olive oil, wrap loosely in foil and bake them at 375°F for about 30 minutes until the 
        individual cloves
        are soft and tender. Cool the garlic, then cut off the tips of the 
        cloves and squeeze out
        the pulp. Mash the pulp into freshly steamed potatoes along with a 
        little hot milk and
        butter. Add salt and pepper to taste and top with fresh parsley or 
        chives. These rich
        tasting potatoes are silky-smooth and the kind of supreme comfort food 
        everyone
        loves on cold winter nights.<br>
