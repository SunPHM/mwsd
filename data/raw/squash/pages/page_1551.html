Between 1839 and 1841, John Lloyd Stephens, a North American traveler,
diplomat, and keen amateur archeologist and Frederick Catherwood, an English
architect and draughtsman, travelled in and explored a large part of the Maya
region on two occasions.&nbsp; They made their impressions and discoveries known
by publishing two books that have become classics among the literature on
ancient Maya cities: <i>Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and
Yucatan (1841), </i>and<i> Incidents of Travel in Yucatan (1843), </i>with texts
by Stephans and magnificent illustrations by Catherwood. (Quotations below in
italics)</p>

 ...and a hot fire.&nbsp; Tortillas, some tomatoes, a few peppers, some
squash, beans, perhaps some small bit of game or domesticated bird, a bit of
venison; these food resources, together with trade

America. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>The name of Chichen is another instance added to those already given,
  showing the importance attached in that dry country to the possession of
  water. It is compounded of the two Maya words chi, mouth, and chen, well, and
  signifies the mouth of the well. Among the ruins are two great senotes, which,
  beyond doubt, furnished water to the inhabitants of the ancient city. Since
  the establishment of a hacienda and the construction of a well, these had
  fallen into disuse.</i></p>
  <p><i>We returned to the hut well satisfied with our first day at Chichen; and
  here was another circumstance which, though painful in itself, added
  materially o the spirit with which we commenced our labours at this place. The
  danger apprehended from the rainy season was coming to pass, and under the
  anticipation of a failure of the next crop, corn had risen from two reales to
  a dollar the load. At the time of our arrival, the criados, or servants, of
  the hacienda, always improvident, had consumed their small stock, and, with no
  hope from their milpas, with the permission of the master were about moving
  away to regions where the pressure would be less severe. Our arrival, as the
  major domo told us, arrested this movement; instead of our being obliged to
  hunt them up, the poor Indians crowded round the door of our hut, begging
  employment, and scrambling for the reales which Albino distributed among them.</i></p>

  serpents, one of which is represented in Figure 13.</i></p>
  <p><i>I have in all cases adopted the names of buildings which I found
  assigned to them on the spot, where any existed, and where there were none I
  have not attempted to give any. At Chichen all the principal buildings have
  names; this is called an Eglesia, or Church, of the antiguos, which was begun,
  but not finished, and the great open walls present not a bad idea of one of
  their gigantic churches before the roof is put on; but as we have already one
  Eglesia, and there is historical authority which, in my opinion, shows clearly
  the object and uses of this extraordinary structure, I shall call it, as
  occasion requires, the Gymnasium or Tennis-court.</i></p>
  <p><i>In the account of the diversions of Montezuma, given by Hen-era, we have
  the following:</i></p>
  <p><i>&quot;The King took much Delight in seeing Sport at Ball, which the
  Spaniards have since prohibited, because of the Mischief that often hapned at
  it; and was by them called Tlachtli, being like our Tennis. The Ball was made
  of the Gum of a Tree that grows in hot Countries, which, having Holes made in
  it, distils great white Drops, that soon harden, and, being work'd and moulded
  together, turn as black as Pitch.' The Balls made thereof, tho' hard and heavy
  to the Hand, did bound and fly as well as our Foot-balls, there being no need
  to blow them; nor did they use Chaces, but vy'd to drive the adverse Party
  that is to hit the Wall, the others were to make good, or strike it over. They
  struck is with any Part of their Body, as it hapned, or they could most
  conveniently; and sometimes he lost that touched it with any other Part but
  his Hip, which was look'd upon among them as the greatest Dexterity; and to
  this Effect, that the Ball might rebound the better, they fastened a Piece of
  stiff Leather on their Hips. They might strike it every time it rebounded,
  which it would do several Times one after another, in so much that it look'd
  as if it had been alive. They play'd in Parties, so many on a Side, for a Load
  of Mantles, or what the Gamesters could afford, at so many Scores. They also
  play'd for Gold, and Feather-work, and sometimes play'd themselves away, as
  has been said before. The Place where play'd was a ground Room, long, narrow,
  and high, but wider above than below, and higher on the Sides than at the
  Ends, and they kept it very well plaster'd and smooth, both the Walls and the
  Floor. On the side Walls they fix'd certain Stones, like those of a Mill, with
  a Hole quite through the Middle, just as big as the Ball, and he that could
  strike it through there won the Game. The Owner of the Tennis-court, who was
  always a Lord, never play'd without making some Offering and performing
  certain Ceremonies to the Idol of Gaming, which shows how superstitious they
  were, since they had such Regard to their Idols, even in their Diversions.</i></p>
  <p>The great Ballcourt at Chichen dates from the Maya-Toltec period, from
  around 1000 to 1250 A.D. This game was played all over Mesoamerica, and was
  both a sport and a ritual. The stone hoops here are carved with intertwined
  serpents representing Kukutcan-Quetzalcoafl, and on the benches along each
  side of the court are scenes in low relief of players. One player has been
  beheaded, and blood spurts from his neck in the form of serpents.</p>

  <p><i>At the distance of five hundred feet southeast from this rises the
  Castillo, represented in Plate XXXVIII, the first building which we saw, and
  from every point of view the grandest and most conspicuous object that towers
  above the plain. Every Sunday the ruins are resorted to as a promenade by the
  villagers of Piste, and nothing can surpass the picturesque appearance of this
  lofty building while women, dressed in white, with red shawls, are moving on
  the platform, and passing in and out at the doors. The mound measures at the
  base on the north and south sides one hundred and ninety-six feet ten inches,
  and on the east and west sides two hundred and two feet. It does not face the
  cardinal points exactly, though probably so intended; and in all the
  buildings, from some cause not easily accounted for, while one varies ten
  degrees one way, that immediately adjoining varies twelve or thirteen degrees
  in another.</i></p>

  feet wide, and contains ninety steps. On the ground at the foot of the

  lofty range, are two colossal serpents' heads, ten feet in length, with mouths
  wide open and tongues protruding, as represented in Figure 14.</i></p>

  to south, and sixty-four from east to west; and the building measures in the
  same directions forty-three feet and forty-nine. Single doorways face the
  east, south, and west, having massive lintels of sapote wood covered with
  elaborate carvings, and the jambs are ornamented with sculptured figures, one
  of which is represented in Plate XXXIX. The sculpture is much worn, but the
  head-dress, ornamented with a plume of feathers, and portions of the rich
  attire still remain. The face is well preserved, and has a dignified
  appearance. It has, too, earrings, and the nose bored.</i></p>
  <p><i>All the other jambs are decorated with sculpture of the same general
  character, and all open into a corridor six feet wide, extending round three
  sides of the building.</i></p>

  <p><i><font face="Courier New" size="2">In the back wall this corridor is a
  single doorway, having sculptured jambs, over which is a richly-carved sapote
  beam, and giving entrance to an apartment represented in Plate XL, nineteen
  feet eight inches long, twelve feet nine inches wide, and seventeen feet high.
  In this apartment are two square pillars nine feet four inches high and one
  foot ten inches on each side, having sculptured figures on all their sides,
  and supporting massive sapote beams covered with the most elaborate carving of
  curious and intricate designs, but so defaced and timeworn that, in the
  obscurity of the room, lighted only from the door, it was extremely difficult
  to make them out.</font></i></p>
  <font face="Courier New" size="2">
  <p>The Castle, also called the Pyramid of Kukulkan, stands out both because of
  its grandeur and its position. It is one of the buildings that clearly shows
  the Toltec influence in Yucatan, present between 1000 and 1250 A.D.
  approximately. Each tier of the pyramid has sloping walls decorated with
  raised rectangles. There is a flight of steps on each side and, at the bottom
  of the north one, two large heads of plumed serpents. The temple has a main
  entrance separated into three bays by two columns in the shape of serpents.
  The heads are on the ground, the bodies form the shafts, and the tails support
  the wooden lintel over the doorway. There is also a mask of the god of rain.
  The roof is decorated with merlons in the shape of sections of conch shell,
  and on the doorposts are warriors and priests.</p>
  <p>It was later discovered that there is a smaller pyramid inside, with its
  temple intact, that contains a throne in the shape of a jaguar, painted red,
  and a statue of Chac-Mool.</p>

  <p><i>And from this lofty height we saw for the first time groups of small
  columns, which, on examination, proved to be among the most remarkable and
  unintelligible remains we had yet met with. They stood in rows of three, four,
  and five abreast many rows continuing in the same direction, when they changed
  and pursued another. They were very low, many of them only three feet high,
  while the highest were not more than six feet, and consisted of several
  separate pieces, like millstones. Many of them had fallen, and in some places
  they lie prostrate in rows, all in the same direction, as if thrown down
  intentionally. I had a large number of Indians at work clearing them, and
  endeavouring to trace their direction to the end. In some places they extended
  to the bases of large mounds, on which were ruins of buildings and colossal
  fragments of sculpture, while in others they branched off and terminated
  abruptly. I counted three hundred and eighty, and there were many more; but so
  many were broken, and they lay so irregularly, that I gave up counting
  them.&nbsp;</i></p>

  <p><i>They were entirely too low to have supported a roof under which persons

  walk of cement, but there were no remains visible. Plate XLI will give some
  idea of these columns. They enclose an area nearly four hundred feet square;
  and, incomprehensible as they are in their uses and object, add largely to the
  interest and wonder connected with these ruins.</i></p>
  <p>Stephens is describing the Group of the Thousand Columns, located on the
  Maya-Toltec part of the site. The name comes from the large number of columns
  and pillars that surround the plaza, which has not been fully investigated.
  These columns, with capitals, once supported the beams holding up vaults. The
  complex is divided into the North, East, Southeast, West and Northwest
  subgroups.</p>

  or cartouches in plaster, which once contained hieroglyphics. The Indians have
  no superstitious feelings about these ruins, except in regard to this
  building; and in this they say that on Good Friday of every year music is
  heard sounding; but this illusion, brought with us from Santa Cruz del Quiche,
  was here destined to be broken. In this chamber we opened our Daguerreotype
  apparatus, and on Good Friday were at work all day, but heard no music.</i></p>
  <p>This building was named The Church simply because it stands near the
  Nunnery. It has one vaulted room and one entrance. The decoration consists of
  stone mosaics, and on the frieze are three large masks of Chaac with the

  <p><i>Leaving this pile of buildings, and passing on northward from the Monjas,
  at the distance of four hundred feet we reach the edifice represented in Plate
  XXXII, conspicuous among the ruins of Chichen for its picturesque appearance,
  and unlike any other we had seen, except one at Mayapan much ruined. It is
  circular in form, and is known by the name of the Caracol, or winding
  staircase, on account of its interior arrangements. It stands on the upper of
  two terraces. The lower one measures in front from north to south two hundred
  and twenty-three feet, and in depth from east to west one hundred and fifty
  feet, and is still in good preservation. A grand staircase forty-five feet
  wide, and containing twenty steps, rises to the platform of this terrace. On
  each side of this staircase, forming a sort of balustrade, were the entwined
  bodies of two gigantic serpents, three feet wide, portions of which are still
  in place; and among the ruins of the staircase we saw a gigantic head, which
  had terminated at one side the foot of the steps.</i></p>
  <p><i>The platform of the second terrace measures eighty feet in front and
  fifty-five in depth, and is reached by another staircase forty-two feet wide,
  and having sixteen steps. In the centre of the steps, and against the wall of
  the terrace, are the remains of a pedestal six feet high, on which probably
  once stood an idol. On the platform, fifteen feet from the last step, stands
  the building. It is twenty-two feet in diameter, and has four small doorways
  facing the cardinal points. A great portion of the upper part: and one of the
  sides have fallen. Above the cornice the roof sloped so as almost to form an
  apex. The height, including the terraces, is little short of sixty feet, and,
  when entire, even among the great buildings around, this structure must have
  presented a striking appearance. The doorways give entrance to a circular
  corridor five feet wide. The inner wall has also four doorways, smaller than
  the others, and standing at intermediate points of the compass, facing
  northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast. These doors give entrance to a
  second circular corridor, four feet wide; and in the centre is a circular
  mass, apparently of solid stone, seven feet six inches in diameter; but in one
  place, at the height of eight feet from the ground, was a small square opening
  choked up with stones, which I endeavored to clear out; but the stones falling
  into the narrow corridor made it dangerous to continue. The plan of the
  building was new, but, instead of unfolding secrets, it drew closer the
  curtain that already shrouded, with almost impenetrable folds, these
  mysterious structures.</i></p>
  <p>The Caracol or Observatory, . built in the Transitional period, between 900
  and 1000 A.D. approximately, is a cylindrical structure with a spiral
  staircase 'caracol' leading up to the room from which the skies were observed.
  A complex building, it stands on three distinct bases with decorated stairways
  and terraces.</p>

<p><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><i>I have now closed my brief description
of the ruins of Chichen, having presented, with as little detail as possible,
all the principal buildings of this ancient city. Ruined mounds exist, and
detached portions of sculpture strew the ground, exhibiting curious devices,
which often arrested us in wandering among them, but which I shall not attempt
to give. They were the ruins which we had had longest in prospect, of which we
had formed the largest expectations, and these expectations were not
disappointed, but more than realized. And they had additional interest in our
eyes from the fact that the broad light of day beams upon their history. The
first settlement of the Spaniards in the interior was made at this very spot.</i></font></p>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <p><i>I shall close with one general remark. These cities were, of course, not
  all built at one time, but are the remains of different epochs. Chichen,
  though in a better state of preservation than most of the others, has a
  greater appearance of antiquity; some of the buildings are no doubt older than
  others, and long intervals may have elapsed between the times of their
  construction.</i></p>
  <p><i>The Maya manuscript places the first discovery of Chichen within the
  epochs corresponding with the time between A.D. 360 and A.D. 432. From the
  words used, it may be understood that the discovery was then made of an actual
  existing city, but it is a fair construction of these words to suppose that
  nothing more is meant than a discovery of what the words Chi-chen import,
  viz., the mouths of wells, having reference to the two great senotes, the
  discovery of wells being, among all primitive people, and particularly in the
  dry region of Yucatan, an event worthy to be noted in their history.</i></p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"><i>In the
  afternoon we set out for the ruins of Tuloom, a league distant on the coast,
  and with the Castillo on a high cliff in full sight. Our road lay for a mile
  and a half along the shore. At the end of the beach was a high rocky
  promontory, standing out into the sea, and cutting off all progress along the
  shore. This we ascended, and continued along the cliff, which sloped toward
  the sea, in some places forming a perpendicular wall, and on our right rose
  great masses of rock, cutting off entirely the view of the Castillo. In half
  an hour we came unexpectedly upon a low building, apparently an adoratorio, or
  a<a NAME="OCRUncertain002">l</a>tar climbing to the top of which, we again saw
  the Castillo.</i></font></p>

  hut, having come to a rapid conclusion that a frequent repetition of this walk
  would be neither pleasant nor profitable, and that, in order to get through
  our work with the celerity we aimed at, it would be necessary again to take up
  our abode among the ruins.</font></i></p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">[This view...] represents
  the back or sea wall of the Castillo. It rises on the brink of a high, broken,
  precipitous cliff, commanding a magnificent ocean view and a picturesque line
  of coast, being itself visible from a great distance at sea. The wall is
  solid, and has no doorways or entrances of any kind, nor even a platform
  around it. At evening, when the work of the day was ended and our men returned
  to the hut, we sat down on the moulding of the wall, and regretted that the
  doorways of our lofty habitation had not opened upon the sea. Night, however,
  wrought a great change in our feelings. An easterly storm came on, and the
  rain beat heavily against the sea wall. We were obliged to stop up the oblong
  openings, and congratulated ourselves upon the wisdom of the anc<a NAME="OCRUncertain018">i</a>ent
  builders. The darkness, the howling of the winds, the cracking of branches <a NAME="OCRUncertain019">i</a>n

 A much smaller temple which sits in the base of the depression facing the
Castillo.&nbsp; The stucco work away from the ocean (facing the viewer in this
photograph) is in much better shape than that which takes the brunt of the salt
spray, wind and rain that blows in from the ocean.&nbsp; Close inspection will
reveal traces of the original paint which adorned these molded
decorations.&nbsp; Stucco, made by burning limestone, is readily available in
the Yucatan as the entire peninsula is a flat limestone table which barely rises
above sea level.&nbsp; Everywhere there are caves and sinkholes from the
rainwater that percolates down through the stone.&nbsp; Caves figure prominently
in the religion of the Maya.&nbsp; Sacred places, they are home to bats which,
as sacred animals, peer out from every corner, ledge and overhang.</p>

The Doghouses.&nbsp; Probably not &quot;dog houses&quot; , of course,

use&quot;.&nbsp; The truth is that no personality, be they encrusted with a

  that the patron could spare at a time, we did not consider it worth while to
