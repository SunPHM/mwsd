              of polypropylene, Gore-Tex and goose down, keeping the cab cool 
              eliminates the need to undress each time we jump back in from taking 
              pictures. We lowered the tire pressure this morning to 52 psi in 
              front and 55 psi in the rear to soften our ride a bit. </font> </p>

              of Susuman we climbed another pass to 4,130 ft, and as we descended 
              into the next valley, we saw hay fields. A cow crossing sign was

              the road was in very bad condition. At kilometer marker 727 (measured 
              from Magadan), we passed the huge coal mine and truck traffic ceased. 
              The road narrowed to one lane as we climbed steeply to the top of 
              a 4,766 foot pass. Our International turbo diesel engine, rated 
              at 210 hp, is only 20 hp less that the un-turboed Kamazs now behind 
              us, but with their heavier load, we easily outdistanced them on

              big enough to be those of wolf and moose. Pine trees started to 
              appear as we dropped down into a long winding valley. The narrow 
              road alternately hugged a cliff along the Nera River, or snaked 
              down to cross tributaries of the Nera. Generally, most bridges were 
              blocked off and traffic was routed around them and across the frozen 
              riverbed. Why wear out the bridge if it's not needed!?</font><br>

            I had just plugged the truck and camper in when a man approached us 
            and made gestures to come with him. Monika was too tired to be social,

            I ducked inside the low door and my new friend screwed in the single 
            light bulb, revealing a narrow bed, a chair, and a table with a hot-plate. 
            This guy seemed a little weird, but I really couldn't tell if he was 
            drunk or just not playing with a full deck. In any case, he made a 
            pot of tea, and we struggled along in the strange language of two 
            men thinking they understand each other. At length, he insisted that 
            I bring Monika and that we stay in his cabin, but I was able to convince 
            him that our "mashina" (truck) was a "dom" (house) and was "kharasho"

            the generator running, we were able to plug in our 1,500 watt Pelonis 
            110-volt ceramic heater. Set on medium, it was enough to keep the 
            cramped space at about 60&deg;F (16&deg;C). Using our aluminum heat 
            deflector which allowed us to cook on one burner with the top of the

              the bathroom was a process. Monika had to practically undress, which

              been accused of being a fascist and was hauled off to the Siberian

              He spoke of families being torn apart and the atrocities of Stalin's

              to the headquarters of the Ust Nera mining operation, which oversees 
              a dozen mines with about 4000 workers. We went to the dispatcher's 
              office. His name was Sasha, an energetic friendly man. Soon others 
              showed up. We handed out hero cards and American Lock pins which

              was not sure if Monika was a man or a woman. With her short hair, 
              heavy pants, and bulky down coat, it was hard to tell, and even 
              in Siberia, most women wore dresses. Reaching the bathrooms, Sonja 
              hesitated outside the men's, but Monika read the question on her 
              face, and throwing her jacket open, stuck out her chest with a grin. 
              They both laughed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now

              husband, Sasha, (Sasha, the friendly nickname for Alexander, is 
              very common.), seemed a little shy in the beginning. He spoke some 
              German which Monika could understand, and Sonja's English started 
              to get better after our second shot of vodka. They served us a wonderful 
              dinner with all kinds of vegetables. It was the first time since 
              Seattle that we had raw vegetables. Everything was prepared very 
              carefully and meticulously. The apartment they live in is one of 
              three in an old wooden one story block house. Sasha's father had 
              moved here in 1951. Ust Nera was a gulag from 1937 to 1956. </font></p>

              and Sasha didn't have children and they loved to cook, which gave 
              us two things in common. Their kitchen was the best equipped we 
              had seen in Russia, with many handy appliances including a combination 
              convection & microwave oven, a freezer, toaster, blender----even 
              an electric can-opener. The only thing that looked out of place 
              in our eyes was the puny two burner stove, which turned out to be 
              the norm in most of the country.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              spent a wonderful evening with them and discovered much about each 
              other's lives. They were so similar to us, it was just amazing. 
              Both were born in European Russia. After dinner we saw a slide show 
              and took a quick tour of their garden and a huge green house where 
              they grew all their vegetables. They obviously spend a good deal 
              of time preparing the soil, planting, watering, tending, harvesting, 
              pickling, canning, freezing etc., an enormous task necessary to 
              eat well and healthy during the winter months. Sasha fishes and 
              they smoke and salt the fish. In the fall they pick berries and 
              mushrooms.</font><br>
