Burrower bugs are 1/8 to 1/4 inch long insects with
sucking mouthparts.  The adults are black with a thin
gray line around the edge of the body.  
<IMG SRC="../burnym.gif" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=150 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Burrowing bug nymph">
The smaller
nymphs, or immatures, are red and black .  Both
stages can be seen crawling over and under the soil
and surface residue or accumulating in cracks in the
soil surface.  Burrower bugs can be abundant in and
around no-till soybean and corn fields, as well as
gardens and lawns.  The species uses its sucking
mouthparts to feed on sap from the roots of a wide
variety of plants. 
<P>
There is no indication that burrowing bugs cause any
injury to crops but densities of several dozen of these
bright insects per square foot have raised the concern
of farmers, dealers, and commercial applicators. In
some cases, migrating burrowing bugs have covered
the sides of buildings.  There is no need for an
insecticide application.

<P>&nbsp;<H3>BEETLES IN HAY
<BR><I>By Lee Townsend  </I></H3>
<P>

The presence of beetles in hay usually triggers an
alarm over the potential for blister beetle problems. 
This was the case when a large number of live beetles
was found in recently-purchased hay.  In this case,
the elongate, dark brown to black insects were
mealworm beetles.  The wireworm-like larvae of
these insects are commonly sold as fish bait.  The
adults are harmless and non-toxic.  There is no
practical way to get them out of hay and no reason to
make an attempt.  
<P>
Mealworm adults and larvae feed on fines and
broken seeds.  They can build up in large numbers
when mixed hay is stored for long periods of time or
may enter hay from nearby breeding sites in feed
storage areas.  There is no health threat if they area
eaten with the hay.  
<P>
See 
<A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/PAT/recs/crop/pdf/entfa102.pdf">ENTFACT 102</A>
 for information on blister beetles
in alfalfa .  These insects are active from mid-July
through August .

<P>&nbsp;<H3>POTATO LEAFHOPPER SEASON
<BR><I>By Lee Townsend  </I></H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../plhoppr.jpg" WIDTH=395 HEIGHT=199 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="PLH">
In Kentucky, potato leafhopper populations increase
rapidly between mid-June and early July.   The next 2
to 3 weeks will be the time to concentrate on
leafhopper populations.  Generally, they drop to very
low levels and do not recover after the July cutting.
<P>
Because of their small size, sampling fields with a 15"
diameter sweep net is the only way to reliably assess
leafhopper numbers.  After the fact need for treatment
will be apparent if "hopperburn" shows up but by
that time the quality loss has occurred.  More
information is available in

<P><H3>TAKE-ALL DISEASE MORE ACTIVE THAN USUAL                     
<BR><I> By Don Hershman </I></H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../wheat2th.gif" WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=89 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Wheat">
Based upon my observations, as well as the comments
of farmers, consultants and agricultural extension
agents, take-all disease has been more extensive than
usual this spring.
<P>
Take all disease, caused by the soil-borne fungus
Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici, is a root, and
crown rot disease which results in premature plant
death and total grain loss in most cases. When
infection occurs early in the fall, plants may look
unthrifty as early as crop green-up in March and die
prior to head emergence in late April or early May. In
cases where plants are infected during the period late
fall through early spring, plants will look normal
throughout most of the spring, but once the heads
begin to emerge, plants will begin to die. Often a
"white head" symptom is the only initial indication
that plants have a problem. As the season progresses,
however, plants begin to die prematurely. Any grain
formed at all in "white heads" will be extremely
shriveled and will blow out the back of the combine
during harvest. Diseased plants can be easily pulled
out of the ground. Also, diseased plants usually have
a characteristic shiny, black discoloration at and just
above the soil line. This symptom is a key diagnostic
feature for take-all.
<P>
Take-all occurs in groups of plants and is evident as
circular patches of dead plants of varying sizes. 
However, the incidence of the disease may range from
a single plant to an entire field, depending on the
levels of the pathogen in soil and on soil conditions.
All varieties of wheat are susceptible to take-all
disease. 
<P>
The extended period of mild conditions this past fall
and winter is probably the main reason for greater
than normal take-all this spring. Dry summer
conditions in 1999 also allowed large amounts of
wheat and barley residue to remain intact in many
fields. This situation may have provided for more
successful pathogen oversummering, and
subsequently higher levels of the fungus in the fall
when wheat crops were being established. The large
crop of volunteer wheat in many soybean and some
corn fields last summer, due to the drought of 1999,
may have also contributed to take-all problems this
spring. The take-all fungus does not survive well
apart from a host crop and it's residue. And
populations of the fungus drop rapidly once infested
crop residues deteriorate sufficiently. In fact, a single
year away from wheat or other grass crops (e.g.,
barley, rye, etc) coupled with good grassy weed
control, is usually sufficient to manage a moderate to
light take-all problem. Two years may be required in
some situations. Corn is reported to maintain
populations of the take-all pathogen, but it cannot be
a very good host or we have be wiped out with take-
all annually. I say this because most of the wheat
grown in this state is produced after corn and take-all
is not usually a serious problem. Although several
cultural practices do have an effect on take-all
incidence and severity, the bottom line as far as take
all management is concerned is crop rotation and
grassy weed control.
<P>
As a footnote, the take-all fungus is not seed-
transmitted. Thus, any grain harvested from fields
with some take-all will not be responsible for
spreading the causal fungus into new fields.

<P><H3>PREPARING TO STORE WHEAT                         
<BR><I> By Doug Johnson </I></H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../wheat2th.gif" WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=89 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Wheat">                                   
Thorough sanitation is the foundation upon which a
sound stored grain insect management program must
be built.  In many cases, severe infestations in grain
bins develop from small numbers of pests that are
able to exist in grain handling equipment or in and
around the storage facilities. A thorough preharvest
sanitation program can reduce or eliminate these
sources. The consequences of not cleaning up these
infestations may not be seen until later in the storage
cycle after the insect population increases. The
economic effects of poor prebinning sanitation may
include kernel destruction, commodity
contamination, moisture and temperature problems
resulting from the insect's metabolic processes, or
structural damage to the bin due to heat and
moisture buildup.
<P>
Insect harborage sites may be classified as internal
and external with reference to the bin facilities.
Internal harborage sites include grain residues on the
bin floor, accumulations of grain clinging to bin walls,
and the fines and kernels which build up beneath the
bin floor and in the duct work of the drying system.
The obvious, visible accumulations in the bin should
be cleaned thoroughly when the bin is emptied.
Accumulations beneath perforated floors must not be
overlooked. Often, floor construction makes thorough
cleaning difficult and the use of vacuum hoses is
helpful. Treatment of the floor void area with a
fumigant may have to substitute for cleaning in some
situations. Use of long handled brooms and shovels
may be sufficient to clean out the bin area itself. Very
thorough cleaning is necessary to reduce the
likelihood of infestation. Properly dispose of grain
and debris collected in the cleaning process.
 <P>                                                                     
 
External harborage sites include anywhere around the
bin that can contain small numbers of stored grain
insect pests.  Spillage near the auger, grain residues in 
harvesting equipment and structures used to store
animal feed are potential pest sources. Auger pits are
particularly important sources of infestation. These
areas must be watched carefully and kept clean. A
comparatively small amount of spilled grain can
provide enough insects to produce a serious
infestation in stored grain.
<P>
Once the bins and handling equipment are as clean as
possible, you may want to consider spraying the
inside surfaces of the bins with an approved
insecticide.  Although this may help, it will NOT cover
for a poorly cleaned bin.  Additionally, insecticide
protectants are available for coating the grain as it is
put into the bins.  However, because of the time of
year that wheat is harvested these protectants are of
limited use.  The heat inside a bin during the summer
will cause these protectants to break down very
rapidly.  Information on these insecticides may be
found in :<BR>Insecticide Recommendations for Small Grains -

<P>
The best storage strategy is to store clean, sound  grain
of about 12.5% moisture in clean dry bins.

<BR><I>By Ric Bessin </I></H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../codmoth.jpg" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=0 ALIGN="right" ALT="Codling moth">
Apple producers need to maintain codling moth
pheromone trapping as codling moth activity
continues. While it is early for second generation in
some parts of the state, second generation has begun
to emerge in other parts of the state. I recommend
that producers change the pheromone lures in their
traps monthly.  It is convenient to change the lure at
the first of every month. When trap catches exceed
five moths per trap per week, then growers need to
accumulate degree days until the 250 DD total is
reached. At that point an insecticide can be applied
for codling moth control.

<P><H3>SQUASH VINE BORER MOTHS ACTIVE
<BR><I>By Ric Bessin</I></H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../sqvbor.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Squash vine borer">
Squash vine borer moths are active in squash and
producers will need to protect plantings of winter
squash, gourds, and pumpkins.  The damage
symptom is the sudden wilting of long runners or an
entire plant. Infested vines usually die beyond the
point of attack. Sawdust-like frass near the base of the
plant is the best evidence of squash vine borer
activity. Careful examination will uncover
yellow-brown excrement pushed out through holes in
the side of the stem at the point of wilting. If the stem
is split open, one to several borers are usually present.
The caterpillars reach a length of 1 inch and has a
brown head and a cream-colored body. Winter
squash, particularly 'Hubbard', are most susceptible
to damage while 'Butternut' is somewhat resistant.
<P>
The key to squash vine borer management is
controlling the borers before they enter the stem.
Once inside the vine, insecticidal control is ineffective.
Poor timing of sprays is the usual cause of inadequate
control. Monitor plants weekly through August for
initial signs of the borer's frass at entrance holes in the
stems. Very early signs of larval feeding indicate that
other eggs will be hatching soon. Use two to three
insecticide applications, 7 days apart, to control newly
hatching larvae and continue to monitor for additional
activity. Sprays need to penetrate the canopy to cover
the vines to be effective.                                            
<P> 

Home gardeners may have some success with
deworming the vines. At the first signs of the
sawdust-like frass, vines are slit lengthwise near
where the damage is found and the borers removed.
The stems should be immediately covered with earth.
Sanitation is also important. After harvest is complete,
vines should be removed from the garden and
composted to prevent the remaining borers from
completing larval development. Burying a few nodes
along each vine will encourage rooting at these nodes.
This will lessen the impact if squash vine borers girdle
the base of the vine.

<P><H3>EARWIGS
<BR><I>By Lee Townsend</I></H3>
<IMG SRC="../earwig.gif" WIDTH=39 HEIGHT=75 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Earwig">

                                   
Earwigs are distinctive insects that are easy to identify
by the pincer-like tails on the end of their bodies. 
They have an intimidating appearance and can
produce a foul odor but are mostly just an annoyance
to homeowners and gardeners.  Earwigs can pinch
slightly with their forceps but cannot harm people or
animals.  In some cases, they can become accidental
invaders in homes and buildings. 
<P>
Earwigs thrive in narrow crevices in shady, moist
places such as foundation plantings, mulched areas,
compost piles, and accumulations of trash, boards or
wood.  They usually congregate under objects on the
ground or stacked against walls during the day and
are active at night.  Earwigs are attracted to lights and
will enter buildings where they feed on sweet, oily or
greasy foods or houseplants. They can run very fast
but migrate only short distances.  Large numbers of
them can be attracted to lights at night. 
<P>
Earwigs will eat most anything, including plants,
small insects, and decaying organic matter.   They can
seriously damage flowers, vegetables, fruits and other
plants, as they chew small, irregular holes in the
leaves.
<P>
The first step in control involves eliminating as many
outdoor hiding spots and breeding sites as possible. 
Eliminate damp, moist conditions in crawlspaces,
around outdoor faucets, and air-conditioning units. 
Be sure that downspouts carry water away from the
foundation. Use caulking compound, putty and
weather stripping around doors, windows, pipes and
other entry sites, especially at the ground level. Create
a clean, dry border immediately around the
foundation wall.
<P>
Accumulations of earwigs can be killed by direct
application of Insecticidal Soap but there is no
residual activity from this product.  Barrier
applications of insecticides (3' to 10' wide around
foundations) with insecticides such as diazinon,
Dursban (chlorpyrifos), Sevin, or Tempo can be used
to treat infested areas.  Treat during late spring and
summer to control young earwigs.  This will slow the
population buildup.
<P>
Earwigs can be trapped outdoors in cardboard boxes
baited with oatmeal or bran with pencil hole size
entry sites punched in the sides near the bottom.
Place boards, newspapers or other cover in mulch,
shrubbery and similar habitats to collect individuals
the following day.  These can be physically destroyed. 
<P>
Where earwigs are regular household invaders, use
any of the insecticides labeled for indoor application
against cockroaches to reduce their numbers until
outdoor control has been accomplished.

<HR><H3>SLIME MOLDS: RETURN OF THE BLOB
<BR><I> By Paul Vincelli</I></H3>
<P>

Slime molds have been common in the last few weeks
in the lawn and landscape as well as other settings. 
Slime molds are fungal-like organisms that live in
thatch, mulch, and the upper layer of soil.  Their body
(called a "plasmodium") is an "amoeboid" mass of
protoplasm that creeps along unseen most of the time,
much like The Blob of science fiction movies but on a
smaller scale.  The plasmodium feeds on bits of
decaying organic matter and on microorganisms
present in their environment.  Thus, slime molds are
not parasites of plants.  
<P>
When the plasmodium is trigered to sporulate, it
creeps into some position where it is exposed to light
and air movement--such as on the surface of mulch,
on tips of grass leaf blades, or on branches in contact
with the soil.  There, the plasmodium turns itself
entirely into crusty structures of spore-bearing bodies,
many of which can be best appreciated with a hand
lense.  The fruiting structures are commonly cream-
colored, yellow, or gray, but they may be variously
colored, depending on the species of slime mold
present.  The microscopic spores are spread by wind
and rain to new locations, where they can form a new
plasmodium.
<P>
The fruiting structures of slime molds may be easily
removed from plant surfaces.  Rubbing, lightly
sweeping, or spraying with a hose are easy ways to
remove them.  As mentioned above, slime molds are
not parasitic.  No control is necessary for slime molds.

<HR><H3>BAYLETON 50 RECEIVES LABEL FOR GRAY LEAF SPOT 
<BR><I> By Paul Vincelli</I></H3>
<P>

Bayleton 50 (active ingredient triadimefon) recently
received a supplemental label for turfgrass disease
management which includes the addition of gray leaf
spot.  The label indicates that the product is to be used
preventively only, at rates of 0.5 to 1.0 oz/1000 sq ft
on a 14-day schedule.  The label also indicates that
Bayleton 50 should be tank-mixed with a registered
contact fungicide at label rate if using the 0.5 oz rate or
under conditions favoring moderate to heavy disease
pressure.
<P>
In general, the DMI fungicides have provided only
moderate control of gray leaf spot when used by
themselves under high disease pressure.  They are
best used in a tank-mix with another product. 
Chlorothalonil (the active ingredient in Daconil Ultrex
and related compounds) is a common mixing partner. 
The efficacy of Bayleton against gray leaf spot has
been tested numerous times in recent years, although
relatively few tests have conducted with Bayleton 50
applied according to the now-labeled usage. 
<P>
Based on my review of the data available to me at this
time, I would consider the tank-mix of Bayleton 50 at
1 oz plus chlorothalonil to be about equivalent to the
tank-mix of Banner MAXX at 1 fl oz plus
chlorothalonil (at the same rate of chlorothalonil, of
course).  Neither tank-mix would be in the "top tier"
for high disease pressure (see table).  For us in
Kentucky, the period of greatest disease risk is from
early August through at least Labor Day.  However,
either tank-mix is probably a very good choice for use
in mid- to late-July to protect against early disease
activity, and possibly again in September or later, as
disease pressure winds down on established swards. 
<P>
More information on spray programs for gray leaf
spot control can be found in the 
<A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/kpn/kpn_00/pn000501.htm#lawfun">
    1 May 00 issue of Kentucky Pest News.</A>
  Readers located in regions where
perennial ryegrass is used in residential lawns should
be aware that chlorothalonil is no longer labeled for
use in those sites.

<P><H3>SCAB HAS NEARLY DEFOLIATED SUSCEPTIBLE CRABAPPLES
<P><I>By John Hartman </I></H3>
<P>
Scab symptoms.  This common fungal disease is a
serious problem in Kentucky on many flowering
crabapple varieties, causing spotting of the leaves,
premature defoliation, and unsightly corky spots on
the fruit. Spots on the new leaves appear olive-colored
and velvety. Later, the infections appear as olive-green
or brown circular spots, with raised or puckered leaf
tissue underneath. Scab spots may appear on leaves
anywhere on the tree.  Typical fruit lesions are
distinct, almost circular, rough-surfaced, olive-green
spots, which later turn brown to black. When severe
infections take place, the leaves yellow and the tree
may lose almost all its leaves by midsummer. This
year, because of lengthy leaf wetness periods this
spring, defoliation is occurring even earlier than
usual. 
<P>
Scab life cycle.  The apple scab fungus, Venturia
inaequalis, overwinters in old, infected, fallen leaves. 
In spring, the fungus produces spores which land on
crabapple foliage or fruit and infect the plant if the
tissue surface is wet for several hours.  The fungal
infection results in leaf lesions, where more spores are
produced to begin additional cycles of infection
throughout the growing season.  Secondary infection
may also occur from spores produced on scab lesions
found on the twig growth of extremely susceptible
crabapples such as Malus 'Almey,' M. 'Hopa,' and M.
x purpurea 'Eleyi.'
<P>
Control.  Use scab-resistant varieties in new plantings. 
Cultivars such as 'Harvest Gold,' 'Louisa,' 'Mary
Potter,' and 'Prairiefire' are good choices.  Scab
infection on established trees may be prevented by
three to five applications of fungicides at 10 to 14 day
intervals starting as soon as bud growth appears and
continuing until mid June.  Scab is most severe during
wet growing seasons, so fungicide applications can be
adjusted to weather conditions.

<P><H3>DOGWOOD DISEASES ARE APPEARING
<P><I> By John Hartman</I></H3>
<P>

Dogwood anthracnose.   The fungus Discula
destructiva, cause of dogwood anthracnose has been
active in some eastern Kentucky dogwood plantings
this spring.  Specimens with dead shoot tips, dead
leaves hanging from infected twigs, dead twigs, and
dead leaf blotches have been observed in the Plant
Disease Diagnostic Laboratory this week and also on
recent field trips.  Dogwood anthracnose is most likely
to occur in moist, heavily shaded landscapes.
<P>
Powdery mildew.  Powdery mildew symptoms and
signs are beginning to appear on landscape dogwoods
in central Kentucky.  The powdery mildew fungus
(Microsphaera spp. and/or Phyllactinia spp.) is active
all summer and the foliage of infected dogwood trees
will gradually deteriorate.  Humid weather favors
powdery mildew.  Because humidity levels were low
much of last summer due to the drought, less
dogwood powdery mildew was observed last year.  If
valuable specimens are to be protected with
fungicides, applications must begin now.  Use
Immunox, Banner Maxx, Eagle, Cleary's 3336,
Heritage, Cygnus, or Compass for best results.

<P> <H3>PROBLEM TREES AND TREE PROBLEMS - HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS  <BR>
<I>By John Hartman</I></H3>
<P>

Arborists, landscape managers, County Extension
Agents, and others working in the Kentucky
landscape industry can improve their skills in dealing
with problem plants and plant problems in the
landscape.  On Friday June 9, landscape industry
professionals and Cooperative Extension Agents will
have an opportunity to attend one of two workshops
that will address tree problems or problem trees.
<P>
Hazard Tree Workshop in Bowling Green  June 9, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m CDT.<BR>

Why a hazard tree workshop?  Landscape
professionals can sometimes be held liable for failing
to recognize or take action on hazard trees in the
landscape of their clients.  The purpose of this
workshop is to aid professional arborists and
landscape managers in predicting which trees have an
increased risk of falling and causing damage to
property and life.  The workshop, which includes
field exercises covers such topics as diagnostic tools,
tree, target, and site characteristics, disease defects,
hazard ratings, legal ramifications, wood strength
loss, and mitigating hazards.  This hands-on short
course is designed for both beginning and
experienced professionals.
<P>
Additional information/questions.  Contact Dr. Bill
Fountain, U.K. Department of Horticulture by
telephone (859) 257-3320, by fax (859) 257-2859, or by
e-mail 
<A HREF="mailto:wfountain@ca.uky.edu">wfountain@ca.uky.edu</A>
wfountain@ca.uky.edu.  A registration fee
which covers lunch and workshop supplies will be
charged and enrollment is limited, so contact Dr.
Fountain immediately.  The workshop is jointly
sponsored by the Kentucky Cooperative Extension
Service, International Society of Arboriculture, and
Kentucky Arborists Association and will be held at
Basil-Griffin Park in Bowling Green.
<P>
Plant Diagnostic Workshop in Boone County
June 9, 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
<P>
Diagnose disease and insect problems of woody
plants.  This is a chance for landscape professionals
and Extension personnel to brush up on their plant
problem diagnostic skills.  The 32nd Plant Diagnostic
Workshop will involve landscape professionals and
Cooperative Extension Agents from Kentucky, Ohio,
and Indiana.  The workshop begins at the Boone
County Extension Office and will feature sessions on
disease and insect-caused galls of landscape plants
and plant disease and insect updates followed by
field observations at the Boone County Arboretum.  
<P>
Additional information/questions.  There will be a
registration fee of $10 to cover lunch and supplies. 
For more information and directions to the workshop,
contact Mike Klahr, Boone County Extension Agent
for Horticulture by telephone (859) 586-6101, fax (859)
