<p><i><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Day 6<br>
October 14, 2003<br>
Albany, New York</font></i></p>
</b>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I knew better than to set my watch for
anything earlier than 7am, who was I going to fool?&nbsp; Myself?&nbsp; It is
cold and dark up here in the mornings this time of year.&nbsp; Instead, I slept
to 7:30am, then made 2 trips downstairs to load the ST.&nbsp; First trip, bring
the clothes bag and the tent.&nbsp; Next, the sleeping stuff and anything
else I couldn’t take on the first.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I got on the road about 8:30am and took the
interstate through the city to SR 7, which took to me to Troy.&nbsp; Every state
in the east has a city named Troy. Traffic lined the main thoroughfares in the
borough, and I maneuvered around cars and delivery trucks.&nbsp; I was stopped
at a light and noted a car ahead to the left with a tag from somewhere in the
southwest.&nbsp; It was too far away to see the name with my bad eyes, but the
colors told me the region of origin. States from the southwest have colorful
plates with oranges and yellows leaping out at you.&nbsp; I crept a little
closer to bring the name into focus.&nbsp; NEW MEXICO.&nbsp; And I thought I was
a long way from home.&nbsp; I wonder if they were impressed at all the green
landscape around them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><img border="0" src="Old/trick%20ortreat.gif" width="200" height="150" align="left">SR
7 transported me east away from the Albany metro area, and soon I was in
countryside.&nbsp; I passed a house with colorful Halloween decorations in the
front yard.&nbsp; They were those big inflatable things that seem to be popular
up here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The sun was out, but clouds were chasing me
from behind.&nbsp; Weather guessers had predicted by days end the front behind
me will be parked over the northeast, and dropping rain.&nbsp; For now it was
partly cloudy, and cool.&nbsp; I layered the Roadcrafter with a sweatshirt and
made sure all vents were closed.&nbsp; I kept the unlined leather gloves out
though.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The ride this morning was soothing and slow,
and I was in Vermont before I realized it, passing by the Bennington Battle
Monument.&nbsp; Normally, I would stop to check such things out, but not this
time.&nbsp; I had to be in Lebanon, New Hampshire at 2:30pm to rendezvous with
ChrisK.&nbsp; A brother rider and ST jockey.&nbsp; We met last year in the Blue
Ridge.&nbsp; He was going to show me around the White Mountains, and tomorrow we
were riding south together.&nbsp; Both of us were attending an informal
gathering of ST riders in the Blue Ridge starting on the 16th.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Bennington was crackling with activity when I
arrived.&nbsp; Colorful trees were everywhere and the ground was covered in
leaves.&nbsp; Like tireless worker ants, yard men blew, vacuumed, and raked the
lawns of residents.&nbsp; Tidy, fresh painted houses stood along Main Street,
their white picket fences standing more for decoration than purpose.&nbsp; Folks
in sweaters walked the sidewalks, I could pick out the tourists by the cameras
around their necks.&nbsp; Most of the shops had wood signs hanging over the
sidewalk, they were colorful and original.&nbsp; The whole scene looked
something out of Jimmy Stewart movie.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">A Dunkin Donuts appeared and I stopped for a
jelly filled and coke.&nbsp; This place was busy, and old folks sat in the
dining area drinking coffee.&nbsp; I picked a table out and called my
wife.&nbsp; She was at work and sounded put out when I described the scene to
her.&nbsp; She said it was going to be 82 humid degrees in Alabama today.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">An old man was working crosswords next to me,
he looked puzzled, but I offered no help.&nbsp; He was going to have to ask if
he was that stuck.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I joined SR 7A out of Bennington to begin a
truly memorable ride through the Green Mountains.&nbsp; The farms looked more
prosperous than those of NY, and the meadows climbed high up the rolling
hillsides.&nbsp; The sun was behind the clouds now, but it did not dampen the
mood I was in.&nbsp; There was color everywhere- trees the color of mustard and
rust, meadows of gold and green, large white barns and blue lakes.&nbsp; Here
and there I saw roadside stands selling squash and pumpkins.&nbsp; Fall in New
England is a celebration, a big party before the realities of winter set in.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="Old/vthill.gif" width="400" height="300"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The
images of a New England fall last a lifetime.</font></b></i></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The rural areas of Vermont surprised me by the
number of small houses they possessed.&nbsp; Some not more than shacks. I guess
work was hard to find in Vermont.&nbsp; The state has hardly any towns or
industry.&nbsp; The biggest city is Burlington, a city about the size of
Prattville.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Londonberry is situated on SR 100, guarding
the east approach into the Green Mountains.&nbsp; I noticed the mailboxes had
good old fashioned New England names on them.&nbsp; Names like Elijah so and so,
Nathaniel whoever, and Edgar whoyacall.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><img border="0" src="Old/vt100A.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left">The highway had a few curves and I twisted the
ST north.&nbsp; The scenery was better than the leaning, so I kept my speed
down.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Equinox Mountain looks imposing from SR 7A,
and stands at 3,816 feet.&nbsp; It overlooks the town of Manchester, another
village in the middle of peak fall season.&nbsp; I geared the ST down when I
entered the city limits and took in the sites.&nbsp; Tourists everywhere taking
pictures of the tree lined streets.&nbsp; A Civil War monument stood in the
middle of town, and churches with white steeples camped under yellow leafed
trees.&nbsp; All the B and Bs displayed NO VACANCY signs.&nbsp; The tunnel of
fall trees looked fit for a calendar picture.&nbsp; I stopped for pictures, and
strolled the town.&nbsp; A young couple was taking pictures of each other under
a strikingly beautiful red leafed tree.&nbsp; I offered my services for a shot
of them together, and they eagerly thanked me.&nbsp; Everyone was friendly. It
was a nice diversion.</font></p>

<i><b><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Manchester, Vermont</font></b></i></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I took SR 11 to SR 100 and the road became
challenging.&nbsp; I eased along the twisties, but still had to pass several
slooooooooow leaf peepers in white sedans.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I took pictures and traveled slow.&nbsp; I
wanted to be sure I didn't miss anything<img border="0" src="Old/vtroadpic.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right">
while on SR 100.&nbsp; I brought home lots of good memories from this day.&nbsp;
I know in my heart there will be a day I will look back on this ride with joy
and pride, so I was very thankful to be in this place at this time.&nbsp; I said
a prayer of thanks for allowing me to be so lucky.&nbsp; I thought about the
thousands, who would give anything to be doing what I am doing RIGHT
NOW.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">When I came to the Calvin Coolidge historical
site, I turned and made the short ride to the top of a hill to check the place
out.&nbsp; Cars were parked in the lots and streets.&nbsp; I guess a number of
people were desperate for something to do.&nbsp; I mean, you really have to be
bored to take a tour of the house Calvin Coolidge once lived in.&nbsp; &quot;Ok
this is the room he use read in, this is the room he kept his underwear in
etc.&quot;&nbsp; I rode by the house, than up the street. Unimpressed, I went
back to SR 100.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="Old/dashleaf.gif" width="400" height="300"><br>
<font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><b><i>I was off taking pictures, and when I
returned&nbsp; this solitary leaf had<br>
found its way to my dash.&nbsp; The Lord shows his blessings in many ways.<br>
I placed the leaf in the sleeve map pocket under my notes.</i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">SR 100A connects 100 with US 4, a short cut
that saved me a few miles.&nbsp; The road was irregular but scenic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">At US 4 I went east into more New England
grandeur.&nbsp; The highway ferried more traffic than earlier routes and I
bogged down.&nbsp; I got stuck behind a RV with Florida plates.&nbsp; In fact,
I've seen a lot of Florida tags this trip.&nbsp; I don't blame them for wanting
to flee the state this time of year.&nbsp; Can you imagine Florida in the
fall?&nbsp; &quot;Palm trees look to have a good year&quot;, the reports
say.&nbsp; &quot;The bushes in Orlando are nearing peak, and will bloom in Dec.
a few more cool nights of 75 degrees will bring out the green really
well.&quot;&nbsp; The joker in the RV was just like any Florida driver.&nbsp;
Oblivious to anything except what was 5 feet in front of him.&nbsp; It doesn't
matter where you see a Florida driver, he is going to drive the same.&nbsp;
Terribly.&nbsp; They are just as bad in Denver as they are in
Jacksonville.&nbsp; I see them all over the country.&nbsp; Most are retired with
good incomes, and have the time to travel, so punish us to NO end for taking the
handicap places at Wal Mart.&nbsp; This guy creped along at 20 mph locking down
10 vehicles, and he never once thought about giving us a break.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">It took a few minutes to get through
Woodstock.&nbsp; Lots of tourists and scenic bus things.&nbsp; It reminded me
all the more why I stick to backroads.&nbsp; Most US highways are tied to urban
sprawl, and congested, and lately I've been trying to avoid riding them.&nbsp;
US 4 is not a bad route, but this time of year it was crowded.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I glanced down at the STs clock, I should make
the meeting point right on time.&nbsp; US 4 bumps up to I-89 and I went
south.&nbsp; The rallying point is the McDonalds at exit 20, if I remember
correctly.&nbsp; One of the first exits after crossing into New
Hampshire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">As soon as I crossed into Vermont the pace of
life picked up.&nbsp; Things in New Hampshire seem to move along faster than in
Vermont.&nbsp; I dropped down off the interstate, quickly finding the Mcdonalds.&nbsp;
Chris wasn't here yet so I went inside and made a few phone calls, and checked
pictures.&nbsp; I'm starting to get the hang of the Sony cybershot.&nbsp; I
should have went digital a long time ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Ten minutes later the Black Knight (as he is
known on the ST board) came in.&nbsp; He said he was hungry so we picked up a
snack before heading back out.&nbsp; That joker took a double quarter pounder
like a aspirin.&nbsp; When I came back from getting a straw he was already
finishing up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">After that we went down the street to a Exxon
station to fill up.&nbsp; I was short of cash, and but so far all was
good.&nbsp; My wife said she hadn't made it to the credit union yet to switch
some money around, but not forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">With our gas tanks full we shot up north on 91
and went to SR 10 in Hanover, to begin some of the best riding of the
trip.&nbsp; It was nice not to have to worry about routes or signs.&nbsp; I was
able to relax, and just follow the bike in front of me.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The quiet STs didn't even raise a eyebrow when
passed the busy streets of Dartmouth.&nbsp; The campus was bustling, and
students on bicycles were everywhere.&nbsp; New Hampshire was also decked in the
best fall show in years, and many were out enjoying it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><img src="Old/chris112.gif" width="200" height="150" align="left">We
stayed on SR 10 to Orford where we picked up 25A east.&nbsp; The ride was good,
and soon we crossed over to 25 west to Warren, from there we rode SR 118.&nbsp;
The leaves were peaking and 118 was dressed out to the max.&nbsp; A narrow road,
with a intimate feel to it.&nbsp; The kind I like.&nbsp; The surface was bumpy
at first, but soon smoothed out and became twisty.&nbsp; Chris knew the road,
and I had no hope of keeping him in sight with my loaded bike.&nbsp; I told him
to wait for me when he reached a place where you had to make a decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I stopped in a few places and took pictures
and savored the ride as long as I could.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The highway brought us down to Lincoln where
we stopped for a break.&nbsp; Chris bought a Gatorade, and I checked a few
messages.&nbsp; The riding has been really good, but Chris said it was going to
get even better.&nbsp; The decision to spend the day here, and skip Maine is
proving to be a good one.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">From Lincoln it was on to SR 112, the
Kancamagus Highway.&nbsp; Traffic picked up,<img border="0" src="Old/whitemtnpose.gif" width="200" height="150" align="right">
and we swallowed up slow moving vehicles whenever we could.&nbsp; I was in the
White Mountains proper now, some of the highest in the east.&nbsp; The scenery
was beautiful and we stopped a few times for pictures on the scenic
overlooks.&nbsp; The mountains in the distance looked like humpbacked
whales.&nbsp; We saw a lot of bike traffic, mostly cruisers and touring bikes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I found myself leaning a tight horseshoe curve
and heeled the loaded ST way over.&nbsp; Chris was long gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Chris waited for me on a local road he knew,
called Bear Notch.&nbsp; The leaves here were beyond belief, so I stopped for
another picture.&nbsp; The results of which can be seen on the cover page for
this trip.&nbsp; The fact Chris lives in New England has probably dulled his
senses to such things.&nbsp; In his mind they are just leaves, but back from
where I come from, people dream about the road I am on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I followed the route into Bartlett, where I
found Chris on a bench waiting for me.&nbsp; He picked a nice spot.&nbsp; A deep
red tree and white house sat across the street and the photo op looked to good to pass
up.&nbsp; A gas station across the
street was advertising a cheap price for tobacco products.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="Old/bartlett.gif" width="400" height="300"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Chris
pulls up a bench in Bartlett,&nbsp; New Hampshire.</font></b></i><br>
<br>
<font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The afternoon was waning, so we got back on the
saddle and pressed on.&nbsp; We left Bartlett on US 302 for more mountain
riding.&nbsp; I was getting to ride roads most Long Riders miss, I had the
advantage of a local leading me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The White Mountains looked higher than the
their attached signs said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">US 302 took us by Mount Washington, this is
the road I missed in 2001.&nbsp; That year the area was socked by snow with
announced temps on Mt Washington at 14 degrees.&nbsp; I was glad I was able to
come back here and see what I missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The Mount Washington motel was an impressive
looking place.&nbsp; You can find it at the foot of the mountain.&nbsp; I wonder
what it costs to stay there this time of year?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">We cruised on down to where the Old Man in the
Mountain use to be.&nbsp; Not long ago the bluff of this mountain looked like
the face of a old man.&nbsp; I know, saw pictures of it.&nbsp; We pulled to the
overlook and Chris announced, &quot;well that's where old man mountain use to
be.&quot;&nbsp; A couple of years ago the rocks that formed the face just fell
off.&nbsp; All that's left now is a blunt rock.&nbsp; In a way its funny but its
not.&nbsp; New Hampshire plates has the old face on display.&nbsp; It use
to remind me of Abraham Lincoln's profile before it fell off.&nbsp; Now, you
have all these guys running around with old man plates, but in reality he's
gone.&nbsp; I guess drivers in NH can keep them to honor the old man, but I
think they should go back, and just place a picture of that blank wall on the
tag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Chris said 2 workers showed up one morning at
the mountain, called in and said, <img border="0" src="oldmanmtn.gif" width="200" height="150" align="left"> &quot;hey boss the old man is
gone, whatch
wanna us to do?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Whaddya mean he's GONE?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;He
ain't THERE.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Look, quit foolin around and get y'alls butt to work.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">It was growing dark when we left the Old Man
site to hook up with I-93 south.&nbsp; It was a quick trip south.&nbsp; I remember
a 50 mile downhill ride to Concord.&nbsp; A
guy in a Integra was pushing the pace and we were glad to oblige
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I followed Chris to the surface streets of the
city and we pulled to a Comfort Inn to get squared away for the
night.&nbsp; &quot;What's the rate?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;149.00 plus tax&quot;&nbsp;
&quot;WHAT???!!&nbsp; I walked right out and got on the phone.&nbsp; I found a
Red Roof Inn not far from from our location.&nbsp; Chris said he knew where it
was.&nbsp; I followed him to his house to take care of some things and to pick
up his
SUV, his 16 year old son was accompanying us to supper, and wasn't riding
pillion, then we went across town to Longhorn Steakhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The steak was good and we chatted about the next mornings ride
south.&nbsp; We were both aware rain was moving in.&nbsp; We'd wait till morning to
see what things looked like before making a final decision.&nbsp; It could very
well be I will going in a holding pattern in Concord. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">After supper it was a quick ride to the Red
Roof Inn, where I checked into a much more reasonable 49.95 room.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
was just 3 miles from the Longhorn, near the race track. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;I rode 380 miles for the day.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Once again, I was on the second floor, and it
took 2 trips to get my stuff inside.&nbsp; A man saw me coming through in the
Roadcrafter and asked if I'd just flown in.&nbsp; I guess he thought I parked my
F18 right outside and just strolled in.&nbsp; He thought the Roadcrafter
was a flight suit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">A big gas mart was next door so I went over
for some Dew, popcorn, and a Nestle bar.&nbsp; I munched down while I watched
TV, and was saddened when I got the news-the storm was here with rain and
high winds and was not scheduled to clear out till the next afternoon.&nbsp; Not
good. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I told Chris to call me in the morning and we
would decide what to do then.&nbsp; If its bad, nothing either of us can do about
it, but adapt. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I stayed up kind of late, and went to sleep
about 12.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><i>Next: a tough ride south</i></font></p>
