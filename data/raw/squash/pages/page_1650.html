retires from the PSA World tour.</font></u></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="retire4.jpg" width="204" height="264"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Chris<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Walker, three times a World Champion, a former England No.1 and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>England Captain, and still one of the fittest men on the competitive
squash court, is to retire from the international softball circuit as he
approaches his 37<sup>th</sup> birthday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After nearly<a href="retirementpage.htm">Me? Retire?</a> 18 years on the circuit the
left-handed, close-cropped Essex boy says: “I still feel like I can stay with
the younger professionals in individual matches, but with the sheer demand of
training and back to back tournament matches week after week my body is telling
me it’s about time I should think about doing something else!”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He has discovered hardball doubles and
plays the doubles circuit in partnership with Canadian David Kay, and
increasingly he is moving towards coaching and player preparation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“Dave and I reached fourth seeds on
the hardball tour three years back but it’s been a bit fragmented due to by my
activities on the PSA (Professional Squash Association) Tour, so we are hoping
now to start making a real impact on what is an exciting competitive area of the
North American game,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“I am now coaching some of the younger
generation in the U.S. as I look for opportunities to develop that aspect both
in America and here in Britain, where I think I can offer and input my own
experiences for players who want to focus on the international professional
scene. I want to put something back into a game that I love; a game that has
given me so much pleasure.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="retire6.jpg" width="226" height="189">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="retire2.jpg" width="219" height="185"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Walker was in at the very beginning of
what many consider to be the best period of English men’s squash. A good group
of Essex youngsters gathered at Ardleigh Hall, the Essex club owned and run by
his parents in the late 1970’s. Del Harris was another star who emerged from
that group. They and a host of others, including Tony Hands, Mark Allen, Robin
Godden, Lee Drew, David Taylor and Graham Drysdale, came up through Ardleigh
Hall first under the tutelage of Stuart Hands, then with influence from the
likes of Ahmed Safwat and Hiddy Jahan.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">They were a forming element of the great
years of the Ardleigh Hall American Express National Squash League team that
also pulled in the talent of Peter Marshall, Jason Nicolle, Mathew Oxley, Mark
Cairns and John Ransome. It was a young, successful, and almost entirely blonde
line-up that competed against and defeated the more gnarled formations of other
clubs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Not too surprising then that the squad
that won the Men’s World Team Championship for England for the first time, at
Cairo in 1995, was led by Harris and captained by Walker.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">This was Walker’s first fine
competitive period. He went to the US Open Final late in 94, to the Mahindra
Challenge Final in 95, beating Rodney Eyles in an epic semi-final, and won the
Apawamis Open in New York at the start of 96. Eyles got him back in the World
Open that year, winning their semi-final 15-14 in the fifth game. A second World
Team championship came to Walker and England in 97 when he captained his side to
victory in Malaysia clinching the winning rubber in the final against Canada. In
98 Walker added his third World Crown by way of the World Doubles Championship
in Hong Kong with partner Mark Cairns where they overcame one of England’s
greatest rivals, Australia, in the final. Walker was England Captain for over
seven years, has collected more than 70 caps (the third highest count ever
recorded) and helped win 10<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>European
Team Championships for his country. He won the individual European Championship
three times and took Bronze medals in the Commonwealth Games for Doubles in both
Kuala Lumpur and Manchester.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="retire1.jpg" width="257" height="306">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="retire5.jpg" width="212" height="306">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Walker and Tony Hands launched the
British Squash Professionals Association (BSPA) in 1992 and were the first
players to ever put on a World ranking PSA event with a Perspex court in the UK.
The BSPA is now responsible for managing professional squash events across the
whole of the UK, has raised over £50,000 for Leukemia research and Walker is
still on the board of directors today.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Walker always had a desire to be
involved at every level of the game throughout his career and served on the PSA
board for three years as vice president. In the run up to the Manchester
Commonwealth Games he was also involved at National level on the board of the UK
Competitors Association, which represents the competitors across the whole
spectrum of sports under the Lottery Program, and the board of the UK Sports
Institute, chaired by Sir Rodney Walker (no relation) and including Sir Steven
Redgrave, Steve Cram MBE, Frank Dick OBE and Sir Robert May.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">After a six-month trip around the world,
a period that might be seen as semi-retirement, Walker returned to the PSA Tour
with renewed vigour in 2001, finding new resolve and moving his base to the
Squash Courts at Dolphin Square in London, and the discovery there of Yoga
stretching.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">He was the first player to reach the
final of the British Open having played through the qualifying rounds, went on
to defeat<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>defending champion David
Evans, Ong Beng Hee and John White, each over five games, before coming within
one game of winning the final; leading David Palmer 2-0 before eventually going
down in another 5 set match.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">“That would have been a win to retire
on,” he recalls. “But I just didn’t have anything left in the tank for
that last period. It’s definitely one tournament I’ll never forget.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Arguably, his finest competitive
performance, though, was earlier that year when, playing second string for
England against a Scotland side generally expected to win the European Team
Title with a squad including for the first time Peter Nicol, John White and
Martin Heath; he survived a massive battering from White over most of three
games and then fought his way back to a stunning all-court victory over five
games to edge a final place for his team.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span lang="EN-GB">Walker acknowledges, “I have had so
much support through my career that to name everybody would take all week, but I
would like to extend a special thank you to the major influences and they know
who they are. Frank Barrett, Ahmad Safwat, Jonah Barrington MBE, Dave Clarke,
Simon Harris, Neil Harvey and of course Mum, Dad and Neil.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-GB">When asked about the secret of his
longevity on the circuit, Walker added, “The last three years of my career
have definitely been the most precious. One of the biggest single influences on
my state of mind has been simple – it’s just about HERE and NOW. There’s a
certain ex-squash player/living legend in Wales called Adrian Davies who said to
me on many occasions after he retired, ‘Willy, stay in the game as long as you
can boy oh!’ All I can say to that now Wizard, if you are listening is, ‘I
tried!’.<o:p>
