	  we got back from the trip we were really&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;in&nbsp;what
	  we found. &nbsp;The&nbsp;weeds&nbsp;had grown so high that only the corn
	  was&nbsp;clearly visible. &nbsp;Everything else&nbsp;was obscured by weeds.
	  And it was so blazing hot that we could&nbsp;only work outside in the very
	  early hours of the morning. Even&nbsp;then the humidity was so high you were
	  drenched in sweat within the&nbsp;first five minutes. We dug out as much
	  as we could, but the weeds had gotten such a strong head start that we could
	  not keep up with them. The little Chinese earth blender was no match for
	  the strength and determination of good old American weeds. &nbsp;</B>

	  <B>My brother Mark and his family came over on the&nbsp;weekend and helped
	  harvest the silver queen corn. &nbsp;<BR>

	  were still&nbsp;able to harvest a&nbsp;lot of yellow and zucchini squash,
	  potatoes, peas, peppers, rutabagas, eggplant and butternut squash. The carrots,
	  beets, romaine lettuce, okra &nbsp;and onions did not do well at all. We
	  salvaged two nice pumpkins and one very small watermelon (about the size
	  of a canelope and cute as a gnat's ass). </B>
