<h2><center><u>Uptown Boys - Change of Venue</u></center></h2>
<p>The Uptown Boys will now be playing all of their home fixtures at the 
<b>Christie Miller Leisure Centre</b>, which is located on the Bowerhill Industrial 
Estate in Melksham.
There may be a few rearrangements needed as their Thursday home nights clash with a 
Ladies team which also play there.
Their captain (Jason Vickers) will confirm details with opposing captains in due course.
