  How did I end up going to warm and sunny Mozambique for a week ? Hmmm.. lets see, a
  friend/customer of Frogfoot, (David) owns part of an Internet Service Provider in
  Mozambique called TropicalNet. We built a few Linux servers for them and
  FedEx'd the hard drives up to Maputo some time in 2002. Then a few months
  later they needed some help to migrate their network and install the new
  servers. Since Abz has some weird reaction to Malaria medicine I got the
  task of doing Frogfoot's first (on-site) work outside South Africa.
  </p><div><img src="pics/roof.jpg" /></div><p>
  I took about 130 photos on the trip:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-maputo/" target="_top">Maputo</a></li><li><a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-maputo-2/" target="_top">Maputo 2</a></li><li><a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-mozambique/" target="_top">Mozambique</a></li><li><a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-ponta-do-ouro/" target="_top">Ponta Do Ouro</a></li><li><a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-pretoria/" target="_top">Ptown</a></li></ul></div><p>
  The one bonus of the trip was that I could spend some time with friends in
  Pretoria (where I grew up, went to school etc.),
  the other bonus was the <a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-ponta-do-ouro/tn/scuba4.jpg.html" target="_top">SCUBA</a>
  diving in Ponta Do Ouro. So it worked out to
  be about 50/50, business / pleasure. 
  If you are interested in going, I include at the end, a short section on how to get a Visa if you live in
  Cape Town.
  </p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2430254"></a>The Tourist's view of Mozambique</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
   My first impressions of Moz, as I crossed the border at Kommati Poort was
   that the road looked very much like a South African road. People on the
   Moz side of the border only speak Portuguese, but they seem pretty relaxed
   and getting through the border was pretty quick. Turns out the road
   was built by the South Africans to improve trade between the countries.
   Some of the small South African towns close to the border seem to be doing
   very good business providing the Moz people with groceries. More variety
   and better prices.</p><p>
   We left the border just before it started to get dark.
   About 40min from the border you get to Maputo the Capital City with
   about 6 Million people. The skyline looks different than SA cities and it has a very
   third world feel to it, strange traffic rules. They dont seem to have
   the concept of stop streets. There is only one traffic light per
   intersection (not 4). Like most cities there seem to be poorer and
   richer parts, but all the houses have extreme fencing, barb wire and many
   homes have security guards after dark. 
   </p><p>
   The night has a warm tropical humid feel to it.
   I'm told about half the countries budget is made up of money donated by
   EU/US aid. You have to remember that this country ranks pretty high on
   the "World's Poorest 10" list. With this in mind, looking at the cars and
   houses you dont seem to notice and new BMW's but some of the houses look
   really nice. There seems to be two or three nice hotels. One of the
   Mozambicans told me much of the wealth you see is 'fake money',
   perceptions created without any real development and progress, money
   coming from sources like the drug trade and corruption.
   </p><p>     
   I can understand why you dont see many nice sedans on the road, the
   roads are in surprisingly bad shape, the number of <a href="http://blue.frogfoot.net/pics/photos/2003/2003-03-10-maputo-2/tn/pot_holes.jpg.html" target="_top">pot holes</a> are just crazy,
   you dont seem to get roads without pot holes in the city.
   </p><p>     
   You frequently
   see cars with South African Gauteng number plates, almost too frequently.
   I'm told about 25% of the cars in Maputo are from SA and the sentiment
   seemed to be that a big part of those were not legal.

   One South African Rand buys you 3000 Meticals, the Moz Currency. The moment you cross the
   border you are a millionaire. The smallest coin they have is something
   like 1000 Meticals. You have to wonder why they dont just reset the
   currency, chop off the last three zeros.
   </p><p>
   There is one cellular provider called M-Cell in Moz.
   One thing I noticed is that Mozambicans in general have no telephone
   manners. Phones are ringing all the time, very distracting if you want to
   have a conversation or get any work done. People SMS each other while driving.
   On one occasion there were five people in a meeting and three were busy
   on their cell phones.
   </p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2429835"></a>History and the War [1964-1992]</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
   I'm no historian, so i'll give you my version of the story about the War
   in Moz. If you look at the county's flag, the big star and AK47 gives a bit of
   a socialist vibe. You wont be too far off if you guessed the ruling party
   (Frelimo)
   has a bit of a socialist/communist flavour to it. Now as we all know the
   western world has some issues with communism, enough so to fuel a war in a
   third world country for a fair amount of time.
   </p><p>
   There were two wars, the one for decolonisation and one
   civil war. The war against the colonists and Portugal
   stared in September 1964. Frelimo conducted guerrilla style warfare
   against the Portuguese troops. On September 28 1974 the Lusaka Accord was
   signed granting Mozambique independence.
   After independence 90% of the Portuguese colonists left the country,
   taking with them almost 80% of the skilled labour force, sabotaging the
   industrial and commercial infrastructure.
   </p><p>
   Some more dates:
   In 1977, Frelimo adopted a Marxist-Leninist ideology as the liberation
   movement was transformed into a political party.
   During the 1980s, South Africa embraced a campaign of destabilisation policy
   against the governments of Angola and Mozambique. South Africa troop
   specially trained and went on operations with Unita (Angola) and Renamo
   (Mozambique). Both Renamo and Unita depended on critical support from South
   Africa. Remano won U.S. support during President Reagans term in office.
   In 1986  Mozambican President Samora Machel dies in an air crash.   
   July 1989 - Frelimo party congress officially abandons Marxism-Leninism.   
   4 October 1992 - General peace agreement signed to end the civil war.
   </p><p>
   According to the locals there would not even have been a civil war if it
   were not for the US and SA governments funding the opposition party.
   I'm not sure how much of a socialist view the current government has, it
   just strikes me as odd to have communist symbols on flags and visas.
   </p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2458125"></a>The ISP Industry in Mozambique</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
   VSAT (duplex) satellite links and Wifi (Wireless Links) are legal in Moz.
   Well, for all practical reasons. Moz still has a big dumb parastatal
   telecoms dinosaur called TDM who believe they can control the way people
   communicate . Dont you just love to insult big bureaucratic
   monsters, dumb dinosaurs, has a nice ring to it. Like I was saying, Wifi
   is not really legal, its just that the government does not seem to want to
   make the final call on the issue. Roomer has it the EU/US Aid people with the big
   cheque books like the concept of wireless telecoms in Africa, god bless
   them, deregulate the local loop!. So if the state was to make some waves
   they would not only annoy the ~4 wireless ISP's but the hand that feeds them.
   </p><div><img src="pics/dish.jpg" /></div><p>
   The biggest wireless ISP in Maputo is called Intra. I'm told they donated
   lots of money so Maputo could have nice big road signs advertising their
   services and M-Cell services mostly. Now these road signs are signs with
   the names of the roads on them and not just ads. I dont care how much you
   hate the intrusions of advertising you have to concede that knowing the name
   of the road you are in or looking for is cool. Now how does your average
   politician explain to the people that people providing us with road signs
   are bad people ?
   </p><p>
   In general, I think its safe to say that the 'digital divide' is alive
   and well in Mozambique. I'm told the average salary is about $30 and a
   dialup account is about $15 per month.
   </p><p>
   Latency to South Africa ranges between 1.3 and 4.5 sec. Not nice if you
   want to ssh home to read mail. So I ended up working in off-peak times to
   get the latencies below 2sec.
   </p><p>
   Some of the buildings in Maputo seem like they must have been nice
   buildings a long time ago. Buildings are maintained very poorly.
   Part of the trip was to install some WiFi equipment, which included
   installing equipment on one of the taller buildings in Maputo.
   </p><p>
   Using the lift to get to the roof of this building was a very scary
   experience. I think I was sweating like a rapist all the way up. The lift
   seemed to move very slowly and make strange clunky noises as it passed some
   of the floors. I'm told this is one of the good lifts and it gets much
   worse. Apparently its not uncommon for people die or loose limbs as they
   disembark from an elevator ride. Talk about an arm and a leg.   
   </p><p>
   In the tropical heat of Maputo there is no place better than the server
   room. Nice and cool, but not totally free of mosquitos. Never drop your
   guard. So the best working environment is alone in the cold, ambient
   fan buzz, server room with the smell of insect repellent and 2sec latency.
   It's a tough country for network geeks.
   </p><p>
   A day after we arrived there was news of a cyclone on its way to Maputo,
   so I called the mail server box 'cyclone' and the firewall 'hurricane'.
   The cyclone never hit us. In the back of your mind you have to wonder
   what it would be like to experience a tropical cyclone fist hand.
   Could get pretty ugly.
   </p><p>
   Language is a big issue. If you dont speak Portuguese you have a problem.
   Not many people speak English and the quality of English is often
   entertaining if you like dark comedy. Took me 30 minutes to get a piece
   of UTP cable from a switch to a server after explaining this a few times
   to the person doing the cabling. 
   </p><p>
   Portmasters suck. Well I guess they would suck less if you at least had
   the same version of the OS on all three your Portmasters. Migrating their
   Portmasters and Radius setup must have taken up most of the time of our
   evening network migration. We worked right through the night to get the
   network in a logical, manageable state.
   </p><p>
   You have to appreciate how much of a hack job this network was.
   BIND, Sendmail, old Redhat, everything on one big /25 subnet, no logical
   routing or firewalling, no QoS policies, email traffic just sucked up all
   their bandwidth, they run a Microsoft OS on their border router. Shall i
   continue? Be afraid.
   </p><p>
   One positive thing I must add here is that Maputo has a small but working
   Internet Exchange. Not without its politics, but if you've ever been involved
   the politics of INX's you develop a deep respect for people who make them
   work.

   We went diving in Ponta do Ouro over the weekend. A Magic place. Nice warm
   water. Amazing sea life. Cool people, a fair number of South Africans. You
   can even talk Afrikaans to your dive master. Nice restaurants.
   Ponta Do Ouro was great.
   </p><div><img src="pics/beach.jpg" /></div><p>
   We lived in a friend of David's house in Ponta. There is no shortage of
   labour around there, you get out of bed at 6:00, go SCUBA diving at 7:15.
   The local people carry _all_ your gear for you and when you get back
   home, your bed is made and everything is tidy. I felt like a king.
   </p><p>
   Ponta makes you wonder why you did'nt become a dive master and live the relaxed
   endless summer life in a tropical climate.
   </p><p>
   Our first dive was fsckn amazing,
   Nice deep 35m dive, in this purple blue water. At least 15m viz.
   We saw three big hammer head sharks. A few rays. Nice game fish.
   There is so much life on the reefs.
   </p><p>
   The second dive was ok, not so great viz. A shallow reef dive. I saw some
   big scorpion fish.
   </p><p>
   The third dive was the next morning, a deep dive again, lots of reef fish, nice
   Parrot fish and big Rays.
   </p><p>
   The road to Ponta and back is all 4x4 track. Good fun. We stopped half
   way at this small general store to buy some beer.
   </p></div><div><img src="pics/tree.jpg" /></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2458321"></a>Food</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
   The food is great! We went to the fish market one night. Seafood is very cheap.
   Clams, crabs, fish, prawns and wash it down with
   the local beer and lots of Gin and tonic. The Portuguese chicken is also
   very good with a healthy dose of peri-peri souce. People love their
   garlic and chili spices.

  Malaria comes from the Italian words "mala" (bad) and "aria" (air) and is
  caused by the Plasmodium parasite. Quinine is made from the bark of the
  Cinchona tree. Quinine is effective in combating malaria because it is
  able to bind strongly to blood proteins, and form complexes which are
  toxic to the malarial parasite. 
  </p><p>
  Tonic water and garlic is by far the nicest anti-Malaria agents. 
  Tonic water in South Africa has 67mg/l Quinine. Tonic in Moz has 80mg/l
  Quinine. 
  When used in the suppression of malaria, the usual dosage range is 300 to
  600mg of quinine daily. So you need to have about 5 liters of Tonic each
  day.
  In Moz you only get Tonic in cans, no bottles.
  </p><div><img src="pics/goodies.jpg" /></div><p>
  The Malaria tablets gave me this careless feeling, I felt detached and it
  seemed to shorten my attention span. Really weird. Not very nice in
  combination with the heat.

  I felt like something from the movie Aliens when I got back home.
  This constant irritation in the back of your mind with the idea that you
  are host to a parasite and this monster is going to start eating through
  your chest any second. So i'm paranoid. Luckily I did not get Malaria.
  </p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="id2429213"></a>Gin</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
  I think Gin and Tonic saved my life. I'm pretty sure that even if I did
  get Malaria, there was one evening I spent drinking with friends in
  Pretoria that cured me. I almost did'nt survive it, thats how I know the
  Malaria did not.  
  </p><p>
  On the topic of Gin, I started to like Gin. Bombay Sapphire is really nice,
  Tanqueray is also good and Gordons goes down very nicely with tonic and a
  squeeze of lime.
  </p><p>
  The Dry Gin Martini, shaken not stirred. It's said that one is not enough
  but two Martinis are too much. The crisp, clean and very hardcore way to
  enjoy your Gin. I can picture an alcoholic having one these for breakfast.

   Always fun to visit good friends in Ptown. The usual dose more partying
   and drinking than i'm used to. Smiley pitched up at the airport with Gin
   and tonic in his car and we listened to Roger Waters on the way back as he told me about
   the the art of mixing your alcohol and muscle relaxing drugs on
   international flights. Apparently the trick is to take your Voltarens with
   about a quadruple shot of hard liquor after the plane is in the air. If
   you take it before and you have to change planes, you may not be able to walk.
   Naturally not all of this is true. 
   </p><div><img src="pics/geek.jpg" /></div><p>
   We had some geeky fun with Linux, figuring out lm_sensors and i2c,
   tc with IMQ for QoS and I configured FreeRadius with LDAP. I lost a game
   of squash against Mr. Stock Broker cum Squash Pro. 
   </p><p>
   We played Playstation2, had a braai or two. Made a really nice lunch one
   Sunday. The weird thing is that all the men made the meal and all the
   woman watched TV. We made a damn fine roast chicken with veg.

  I arrived back late the Sunday evening. Spent lots of time catching up on
  email. Weird how you can get unfit in two weeks.
  </p><p>
  Not to sound like a boring, non-well-traveled critic, but I realised that I
  miss spinning and running and the food, music and movies I like and I 
  guess I miss my way of doing things, miss my workstation, my screen, my
  chair and I dont think I function well with high latency and little
  bandwidth.
  </p><p>
  One idea I had is for something like an ISP-tour programme. People with
  skills in the ISP business can visit each other, share knowledge, ideas, experience
  etc. Do some site seeing take picture of some really geeky things like
  datecenters and routing equipment. Mingle with the people that run ISPs in
  other counties. I'm sure our ISP could learn allot from other people's
  experiences and I guess our experiences could be of use to other ISPs.
  So if you read this and you own or work for an ISP, lets talk.
