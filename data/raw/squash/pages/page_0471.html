<P>
She came out of the Mesa Verde country with her womb full of her dead husband's
unborn baby. The Ute Chief Douglas had promised many things to Young Eagle.
Death was all he collected.
<P>
Carrying herself proudly, she remembered the warm spring day on the Alkali
country when he made her his wife on a freshly-killed deerskin. She could
still feel his strong body taking advantage of her when he'd overcome her
maiden reluctance to becoming a woman.
<P>
Hot passion overruled not because of Young Eagle's strength, but because
of the heat building within her at the last. She did not know where his body
was. Braves last saw it soaring over the rocks into the canyon feeding into
the Mancos River.
<P>
Soldiers herded her southwestward toward the land of the Mormons in Utah.
She'd gone hesitantly, but she went. There was no other place for her to
go. Had she tried to turn and go back eastward into the LaPlata River country
where she was raised, soldiers would have turned her westward toward the
new Utah reservation.
<P>
She came out of the battle smoky and tired. The soldiers let the women and
children out through the small rock opening leading out of the cliff dwellings
of the Ancients onto the flat plateau on the mesa top. There'd been no time
to clean the grime of a smoking campfire from her dirt-stained hands.
<P>
Aiyeee, she could not bear to think of the death of Soaring Hawk. It was
a nightmare. Three days ago he was looking forward to being sub-chief under
Douglas, now he was dead. Nothing was in her but hatred for the men in blue
with the yellow stripes down their legs. They rode ahead, behind, and on
both sides while the Ute survivors of the battle plodded their way over the
rocky trail.
<P>
She'd witnessed the death of one of the mounted soldier's bravest as he withered
nakedly in a red ant bed west of Alkali. When he tried to unwind his insides
around the cedar sapling he was tied to with deer hide throngs, she spat
in his face.
<P>
Bearing a child was difficult enough with a strong brave present. With no
male to protect her, she knew her time of delivery would be fraught with
much hardship. She was an orphan. Her mother died giving birth to her, and
her father died fighting the White-eyes. Aiyeee, she cried again inside herself
when she thought about what lay ahead of her.
<P>
The soldiers left the captives with no horses. Their only means of travel
was by their own two feet on a trail winding through the Southwestern Colorado
rough country into Utah. They had to hurry because the Cavalry was forcing
them along at a rapid pace.
<P>
She watched a boy of six squashed by ironclad horse hooves when he fell in
the trail. Her desire was not to meet a similar fate.
<P>
A gentle breeze blew when the morning sun rose over the eastern mountains.
As much as the Utes would have liked to stay among the pines and aspens close
to the mountains, soldiers were driving them farther and farther into rough
desert country. The land was not fit for even a Navaho squaw to make her
furrows for planting a little corn and squash.
<P>
Utes had dwelt for generations in the LaPlata Rockies. Once, Squash Blossom
had dared turn and gaze longingly back at the mountain peaks resting peacefully
to the northeast. Slim slivers of smoke still plummeted into an azure blue
sky. Only three days ago her people had attempted to burn out the miners
far up the LaPlata River.
<P>
Squash Blossom was sure there was no use continuing the fight against the
hated whites. Kill one of them and two sprang up like jackrabbits to ravish
the Colorado countryside.
<P>
The expecting young mother had the beauty not found in some of her female
companions. Long dark hair braided, she showed signs of good grooming in
spite of what she'd been through. Her doe skin dress though snagged, still
showed the care she put into making it. She spent most of a winter chewing
the skin to make it soft and pliable.
<P>
For a while the Utes walked with a group of Navahos headed back to their
southern home. Squash Blossom was glad she did not have to dress in the long
Mother Hubbards this strange enemy tribe wore.
<P>
For the first time in remembered history, the Navahos and her people united
with the hated Apache to fight a common enemy, the whites. They were not
only taking Indian land, but were destroying it by letting their sharp-hoofed
animals tear up Mother Earth.
<P>
Trying hard, the young squaw could not think why the Great Spirit let white
men take over the land all the way from mountain tops to the sagebrush land
down into the badlands of Arizona and New Mexico.
<P>
These people who displaced her people were spoilers of mountain streams and
large grassy pastures rich with the purples, reds, yellows and blues of summer.
Summer skies still brought rain to the mountains to the north while the band
of wanderers pushed toward Ute Mountain and westward into the rugged country
of Utah.
<P>
While Squash Blossom walked, her weary mind blotted out where she and Young
Eagle had made their home in the oak brush of the Alkali country. Her
deerskin-covered feet tripped and fell on rocks and sharp desert plants so
foreign to the Mountain Utes of the Colorado Rockies.
<P>
In the course of three days, the braves who survived the war started drifting
in to be with their people.
