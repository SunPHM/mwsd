<h3><a name="Cloning Apple Trees">Cloning Apple Trees</a> <img border="0" src="../../HortImage/graft.gif" align="middle" width="200" height="309"></h3>

<P>	Old apple trees (or pear, peach, etc.) that are special for any reason (superior quality, were
planted by grandparents, etc.) can be propagated for posterity. The first step is to identify branches on
the special tree to use for propagation wood. The ideal branches will be from about 1/4 to ½ inch in
diameter. Good propagation wood can be made of water sprouts that grew from limbs in the tree or
suckers that grew from the trunk. But be sure suckers grew from above the graft at the base of the tree.
This propagation wood is normally taken during February. These can be cut in lengths up to about a
foot long. They can be stored in your refrigerator at about 40 to 45 degrees F. Do not freeze. </P>

<P>	The next step is to decide what you will graft them onto.  Fruit trees are normally grafted (or
budded) onto specially selected rootstocks.  These rootstocks normally reduce tree size.  For example,
a tree that normally would get 25 feet tall will only reach 10 feet if it is grown on a certain rootstock.
Dwarfing rootstocks also allow apples to fruit earlier.  A tree on it's own roots normally takes 5 to 7
years before it will bear.  Semi-dwarf trees bear in 4 to 5 years and dwarf trees bear in 3 to 4 years.
Unfortunately, dwarfing rootstocks are not well-adapted to Kansas.  Semi-dwarf trees are usually a
better choice for us. Note that rootstock reduces tree size, not fruit size.  Therefore, a Golden Delicious
tree that only reaches 8 feet tall due to a dwarfing rootstock will bear the same size fruit as a Golden
Delicious tree that is 25 feet tall.  </P>

<P>	Most nurseries only sell trees that are already grafted.  A company that does sell rootstocks is
Raintree Nursery, Morton, WA, (360) 496-6400, <A HREF="http://www.raintreenursery.com/.">http://www.raintreenursery.com/.</A>  If anyone knows
of other nurseries that sell rootstocks, let me know and I will post them in later newsletters.</P>

<P>	It is also possible you could buy a tree from a local nursery and graft your clone into it. One
disadvantage of this method is that it is possible to prune off the special clone instead of the cultivar
branches by mistake. </P>

<P>	This information does not include the grafting or budding details or the care after. The Missouri
Extension Service has an excellent publication, titled "Grafting," which can be found at
http://muextension.missouri.edu/xplor/agguides/hort/g06971.htm.   (WU)</P>

<img border="0" src="../../HortImage/Cornus%20sericea%20-Redtwig%20Dogwood%202.jpg" align="middle" width="290" height="190"></h3>

<P>	Landscapes tend to be dark and gray this time of year, but careful planning can result in
subsequent winter gardens being more colorful and interesting.  The key is selection of plant material
and use of good design. Choose the vantage point from which the garden will be most commonly
enjoyed. Select planting sites that are easily seen from this area. </P>

<P>	Green is the easiest color to add to a winter landscape with the use of broad-leaved
evergreens, cedars, spruces and pines. Pines and especially spruces are not well adapted to Kansas
conditions and will need to be well cared for.  Be careful if you decide to use blue spruce.  The blue
color will draw the eye and can detract from the rest of the landscape. Normally, a single specimen
plant works best.  Of course, parts of the plants other than foliage can be colorful or interesting. Even
trees with horizontal branching patterns are interesting if there is snow adding white to the bark color. </P>

<P>	Some plants that should be considered for winter landscapes include:</P>

<P>	Redosier Dogwood (Cornus sericea). The young stems of this plant are bright red during the
winter months and become more intensely colored toward spring. Older stems are often pruned out
during the spring to encourage more of the young, more brightly colored twigs. Redosier Dogwood is
tolerant of shade.</P>

<P>	Yellow Twig Dogwood (Cornus sericea 'Flaviramea'). This shrub is much like Redosier
Dogwood except the twigs are bright yellow rather than red.</P>

<P>	Winged Euonymus or Burning Bush (Euonymus alatus). This is the shrub that attracts so much
attention in the fall because of the flaming red coloration of the fall foliage. However, the stems are also
ornamental in the winter due to their winged characteristics which tend to catch and hold snow.</P>

<P>	Lacebark Elm (Ulmus parvifolia). This is the true Chinese elm. A tough durable tree, the
lacebark elm adapts well to poor soils and extremes in pH. The bark is what really sets this tree apart
during the winter due to its mottled combinations of gray, green, orange and brown.</P>

<P align="left">	River Birch (Betula nigra). This is another tree that has very interesting winter bark. The flaky
bark is reddish-brown to peach colored and contrasts nicely with snow. River birch tolerates both wet
and dry sites. (WU)</P>

<h3><a name="All-America Selection Winners - Vegetables and Herbs">All-America Selection Winners - Vegetables and Herbs</a></h3>

<P>	All-America Selections tests and introduces new flowers and vegetables that have done well in
trials across North America. This year there were a total of 12 winners-two vegetables and ten flower
cultivars. We will highlight the vegetable selections in this newsletter.  Descriptions are taken directly
from All-America Selection materials.</P>

<P>	<b>	Summer Squash 'Papaya Pear': <img border="0" src="../../HortImage/AAS%202003%20Squash%20'Papaya%20Pear'.jpg" align="middle" width="300" height="201"></b></P>

<P>	  The first summer squash with a shape similar to a tropical
papaya fruit. The bright yellow squash looks like a light bulb with the widest section near the blossom
end. One of the earliest varieties, 'Papaya Pear' fruit can be harvested in about 40 days from sowing
seed. The semi-bush plant requires less garden space. For plants that yield squash continuously, pick
'Papaya Pear' at a young stage when about 3 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide. Easy to grow in any
garden with full sun.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	<b>	Melon F1 'Angel': <img border="0" src="../../HortImage/AAS%202003%20Muskmelon%20'Angel'.jpg" align="middle" width="300" height="201"></b></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	An early Mediterranean-type melon, 'Angel' has a heavenly flavor. All melon
sugars are scientifically measured as a brix count. 'Angel' measured 16% to 19%, which indicates a
very sweet flavor. The 2- to 3-pound melons have a white interior with a crisp texture. 'Angel' helps the
gardener know when to harvest. The lightly netted melon skin turns creamy yellow when mature; about
60 days from planting young 'Angel' plants into the garden. 'Angel' vines will spread 6 to 7 feet and are
resistant to fusarium wilt races 0 and 2.  (WU)</SPAN></P>
