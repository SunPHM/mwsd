hash associated with a Gym?!? What kind of<IMG SRC="../images/514mm/ma01n.jpg" ALT="#414 - Sir Fart a Lot & On_Yer_Bike staggering to the finish" NOSAVE HEIGHT=409 WIDTH=322 ALIGN=RIGHT>
heresy is this? Is NH4 starting to become a ‘serious hash’? I mean, choosing
<B>Gold’s Gym</B> is bound to be fraught with dangers isn’t it. Visions
of drunk hashers staggering around slinging beer over the grunting athletes
were… Oooo errr missus! As it happens, it turned out to be a fascinating
time as the hashers gathered at the corner of Skopa Street gawping at the
rows and rows of well oiled bodies using the equipment, muscles rippling,
faces contorted with the strain of it all…. And that was just the women!
Mind you they were all in there looking out at the assembled hashers –
probably thinking “That’s it, if that lot are coming in I’m not coming
back no more”.
<BR>The off was delayed slightly longer than usual due not only to the
aforementioned distractions but also the free drinks being plied by a couple
of extremely attractive young ladies (down boy). Eventually the pack was
off, snapping and yapping through the streets of Acropolis. Given that
this was almost completely tarmac, it made ingenious use of the terrain,
making sure most of the major routes in that area were covered. Fairly
soon the short runners, ably led by that star navigator <B>‘Fraid Not</B>
were engaged in a live hare situation – when in doubt, improvise. The long
run proved to be pretty long at that (or so it was reported) anyway, it
took them a while to find their way back.
<BR>So it was that the circle was treated to a rare sight of the hares
taking their downer on their knees for setting an illegal hash. Alledgedly.
Makes the mind boggle. <B>Heid Banger</B> was singled out for strange associations
with a BFBS2 program (see plug&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../images/513gol/ib01n.jpg" ALT="#513 Itchy Balls and his new shoe" NOSAVE HEIGHT=544 WIDTH=262 ALIGN=LEFT>elsewhere
in this rag) which progressed from a downer, through to a disgraced “On
your back” when the sore subject of DeInformer (or lack thereof) came up.
<BR><B>Itchy Balls</B> made a very rare appearance. Clearly too long an
absence as he was discovered to be wearing “NEW SHOES” [Shock Horror],
only escaping the total tea bag experience through the unusual generosity
of the <B>R.A</B>.<IMG SRC="../images/513gol/ar01n.jpg" ALT="#513 Aris Mein Host" NOSAVE HEIGHT=524 WIDTH=399 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<BR>Loads of virgins this week – <B>Linda</B> who was shivering in the
unaccustomed Cypriot chill after Malaya. She will henceforth be known as
<B>Monica</B> – I wonder why? <B>Maria</B>, <B>Johanne</B> now known as
<B>Best</B> <B>Bits</B>, <B>Fotis</B> <B>Economides</B> and <B>Carl Russel</B>
who shall be known as <B>Chubby Chicks</B>.
<BR><B>Maria</B> was too busy trying to avoid the wet spot and so she had
a downer as she was the last one down during the “No Problem” session.
<P><B>‘FraidNot</B> brought the delightful <B>Grace</B> along to the circle
to see what the Hash is all about before she disappears off to Canada for
the winter. Well she got an excellent view as they both got an up-downer.
Any rumours that this had anything to do with a recent squash match between
<B>FN</B> and the <B>R.A.</B> are just that.
<BR><IMG SRC="../images/513gol/sp02n.jpg" ALT="#513 Hares having fun!" NOSAVE BORDER=0 HEIGHT=438 WIDTH=480 ALIGN=LEFT>You
may have heard of the delightful American sport of wildlife spotting known
as “road-kill”. Well the <B>R.A</B>. is starting his own trend by explaining
the distinctive Pssst Pat Pssst Pat sound that the Horny backed <B>Strumfaki</B>
is heard to make as he creeps up behind most of the pack. Actually this
may give the wrong idea as to <B>Strumfaki’s</B> proclivities. What is
meant is that it happens as he&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../images/513gol/sp01n.jpg" ALT="#513 Hares having fun" NOSAVE BORDER=0 HEIGHT=259 WIDTH=330 ALIGN=RIGHT>habitually
overtakes most of the pack.
<BR>At last an award! <B>OO-Sex</B> managed to land the Zimmer frame in
the forlorn hope that it may slow him down a bit.
<BR>So on to the lavish spread laid out in Gold’s Gym. I mean picture the
scene if you will. Looking through the huge plate glass window of the gym
you can see the rows of bicycles and treadmills along the top and the masses
of weird weight machines to the right. In the middle is the reception area
and to the left the cafeteria.
<BR>So we have athletic activities (reeeeaaaally) to the top and the right,
order and discipline to the middle and to the left, a bunch of hashers
slobbering down free beer, eating cholesterol friendly sheftalia and mixed,
smoking, using mobile phones and generally breaking all the rules. It is
a great tribute to the generosity of the chaps at the Gym and <B>Aris</B>
in particular who not only put up with us with good humour but was also
so spectacularly hospitable. Thank you and we’ll be starting the 10 o’clock
housewives session OK?
