<h3 class="title">X country</h3>

<p>Today is ACJC Cross country.</p>

<p>I also went to the US Embassy at Napier road to request for my social security number. Hehe, got excused from lessons from 8:45 till 11:30am. I was given a pink slip signed by my form teacher and it was my passport out of ACJC during school hours. The security guard (yeah we have a real security guard in uniform, unlike somebody who doubles as a bus stop patrol and OM) saw my pink slip and waved me out of ACJ. I took my dad's car to the embassy and dropped right outside it.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/US embassy.jpg"><br />
Looks very grand right? A symbol of the mighty superpower.</p>

<p>The queue was kinda short (for me that is). There are 2 lines that lead into the building, one for "Non citizens" and one for "US citizens". I was the 2nd person to queue and naturally I stood at the lane for "US citizens". I don't know but the others behind me followed me and queued up there. The security guard came out to separate the queue (bet he saw the chinese quing up there). "Hey you, go que at the lane for non citizens." I just flashed my blue little book and remained in line.  [Of course, I was the first to enter hehe]</p>

<p>My handphone and bag was left in the guard house so I can't provide you all with photos. Basically the embassy is very "CIA" looking. There are big metal doors with require a decent amount of strength to open (guess it prevents people from barging into the embassy). Everyone has to be screened by metal detectors.</p>

<p>I made my enquiry about my SSN and they asked why I needed it so urgently. I told them about my FAFSA thingy and they say they will contact me next week after they called up Manila and Baltimore. Sigh....Hope I'll get my number next week.</p>

<p>I came out of the US Embassy and realised something: it was darn close to orchard road. The time was still early and my "Freedom pass" has not expired yet. A little foray into Orchard road I made. So cool and odd. A student walking around orchard road during the morning. THe shops weren't open yet! I took my self-declared recess at KFC at wisma atria and also spent the time looking at the physics notes on "Uncertainties". </p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/orchard rd.jpg"><br />
My photo was a little over-exposed 4got to adjust the brightness.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/borders.jpg"><br />
Went past my favourite bookshop. Still remember the times I spent there looking for SAT books.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/orchard mrt.jpg"><br />
Proof of my visit.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/NEL mrt.jpg"><br />
I took MRT to douby gaught and then to outram park to save some time. Heard that it was faster. Sigh I wish my phone camera works better indoors. but then, all digital cameras suck indoors.</p>

<p>And so it was 11:40 when I reached Bouna Vista and began my walk back to ACJ. It was so nice to be greeted by the great entrance of ACJC. Just in time for Keith Tan's Maths lecture. Today I learnt partial fractions (express a polynomial fraction over another polynomial fraction in terms of separate fractions). First A level topic. I must say although Keith Tan is very strict and straight faced, he is good. I love his "Cover up" method to solve for partial fractions.</p>

<p>12:30 - School ends. Dismissed early so that we can prepare for X country. Something amusing happened today. A communication breakdown occured between 2 fractions in my class. First time. No hard feelings la, its just because of some missing pins. At least the bonds will be strengthened.</p>

<p>We (kevin, louis, edwin, zhe hao, jeanette, steph, yi han, rachel, rebec, van and me) went to KAP to eat. I went home to take my PE kit and rushed to KAP (quite near my house) to grab something light to eat. Then we made our way to the X country site.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/x country.jpg"></p>

<p>I earned 1 point for Oldham house today by finishing the 3.2km before the 30minutes. My shoes were downright muddy. gosh. Song kiu ran with me, we both paced each other and it was good. I saw jonathan halfway slacking. I gave him a small pat and it made him go faster. I knew he could run, my tap was the impetus for his 20 minute completion. hehe! Think about it, I'm going to yan xun's house for our OG BBQ this sunday. gosh I miss my OG. Lathune rules!</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/orange cup.jpg"><br />
Thanks sharen for treating me to a cup of orange juice. Its nice!</p>

<p>Oh and I almost forgot, I walked up to the cafe on the hill at mac ritchie and used kevin's hp to order a can of coke from the coke machine. I smsed and there was no reply. We left swearing! And when the race was about to start, he received the comfirmation sms for his drink. LOL! <img src="pictures/emoticons/lol.gif"></p>

<p>That joker kevin also ran the 4.8 route cause he went into the wrong lane. "Weird ah Why i'm running alone?" No wonder he came in after 30 minutes.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/steph mc.jpg"><br />
Another blunder. Stephanie took the wrong MC from the doctor!</p>

<p>I'm shagged. Tired.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/trash.jpg"><br />
X country is powerful, look what it did to that shoe.</p>

<p>------------------------------<br />
Some old photos which I just got out of my camera.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/smiley.jpg"><br />
We call that the Smiley. It is painted on the road on the other gate. I don't think cars come in by there. <br />
<I>"I've been told that the yellow Smiley becomes very slippery when it rains. Students are to avoid stepping on "Smiley" when it rains." (some laughter comming from us)</p>

<p>"College this is the end of assembly please stand."</I><br />
The smiley represents the spirit of ACJC. The way we do things is just so different from other JCs. It is radical and good, breaking the norms advancing the limits. The Best Is Yet To Be! (Btw the smiley logo is for Fun O Rama too).</p>

<p>I at the bus stop near KAP where I waited for 61 to go home. Another ACsian was also at the bus stop. He smiled and waved at me. I waved back and smiled. We didn't know each other. I identified him as a JC2 in the ACJC Fun O Rama shirt. He identified me as a JC1 in the yellow ACJ PE shirt. It is this kinda of school spirit that I like. People actually say hi to each other outside even though they don't know each other. I don't think the other JCs have this kind of spirit. Am I right? This is not the first time another JC2 or old boy/girl says hi to me outside (when I'm in any AC uni).</p>

<p>-------------------------------------<br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/face plate.jpg"><br />
Jie Yun (Louis' sister haha!) so free, made this artistic smiley.</p>

<p>-------------------------------------<br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/for u day.jpg"><br />
This is a photo from "For You Day" 2004 organised by the 28th Student Council for the students. Free food, milo and buscuits and "yu sheng". It was too crowded I left for air rifle. But I could appreciate the mood. hehe!</p>

<p>-------------------------------------<br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/swim pool.jpg"><br />
End of thursday's swimming lessons. The water was cold cause it was raining. brrr!</p>

<p>-------------------------------------<br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/sell roses.jpg"><br />
I can't remember which class was selling roses for valentine's day. I guess it didn't sell well. Lucky our popiah did sell well. <img src="pictures/emoticons/biggrin.gif"></p>

<p>-------------------------------------<br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/30-01-04/comp class.jpg"><br />
That's where my computing lectures and practicals are held.<br />
I got 2 scores of 10/10 for 2 practical assignments and a 9/10 for another question just because I didn't use 22/7 for the value of pie. I was lazy and I just assigned pie to 3.142. 1 mark deducted, sigh!</p>

<p>-------------------------------------</p>

<p>As usual, pictures galore! My blog is interesting right? hahaha!<br />
Tomorrow is NHSS home comming, hope to see you all there.</p>

<h3 class="title">Rush</h3>

<p>I cannot write much today. Had air rifle at CDANS today. This time my scope has improved quite alot and I don't really move that much. Now I have this problem with pressing the trigger. I can't do it such that the gun does not move when I press it, resulting in missed shots even though I have my sights on the bullseye. Sigh, hope I can figure it out next time. I had a very nice card today, all in the center <img src="pictures/emoticons/smile.gif">. I also used my marching band gloves and it protected my knuckles from injury. Jonathan damn pro leh, 8 out of 10 in the  black circle. Sian! I hope I can make it on the school team. Trials before O's result release.</p>

<p>I received my UPennsylvania financial aid forms today. Had some trouble filling it up since my parents don't pay US tax. Don't know la, god bless me. Please help me out, I'm lost.</p>

<p>I bluejacked somebody on the MRT for the first time. Damn it I got found out. A group of girls in blue uniform (duno wad school looked like ST nick girls) actually found out who (me) bluejacked them. I was the only guy holding a BT phone and with my BT turned on. She was using a 6100 I think, looked so fat. Anyway it was lame I sent stupid messages via BT like "hello you've been bluejacked". Apparently they didn't understand the concept of BJ. Save your message as a business card and sent via BT to another nearby phone (10m radius).  Fun right? My BJ name is messiah.</p>

<p>Btw I've changed the song on my blog. Nice?</p>

<h3 class="title">Popiah Day</h3>

<p>My class sold popiah today, how nice.  Me, yanice and louis (hey it rhymes eh?) were the first to set up the stall in the canteen. It was empty in the morning, everyone was supposed to be at assembly. I was alone in the canteen, listening to the fans swirl and sway. I looked around and I saw bryan standing at a corner. He was on council duty. I closed all the food containers (don't want early birds to come visit) before I went to talk to him. Didn't know ACJ student councils had to be on duty to lead those late commers into school. How nice.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/canteen.jpg"><br />
The school canteen.</p>

<p>I placed the food on the tables and periodically stirred the popiah fillings in the mini cooker. It took quite awhile before louis and yanice came down from class. I went up to put my soup and take the plum sauce down. </p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/louis at work.jpg"><br />
Our form teacher was great man, she gave us a small cardboard contraption to host the sign up. Louis worked on the small sign (Mdm Esther's Popiah. Get em while they're hot!) while I took my recess. </p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/prata.jpg"><br />
Yea that's my recess. Egg and cheese prata. Not bad leh, $2.50 for the 2, fresh made on the spot. Very nice.</p>

<p>I heard Mdm Leow drove somewhere to collect the top grade popiah skin. We waited until recess just started before we actually started to make our popiah! Fortunately stephanie and yan xiu came to help out. As usual, I tended the popiah fillings and tried to sell popiah at the same time.</p>

<p>We almost had a mini kitchen in the canteen.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/popiah stall.jpg"><br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/popiah stall 2.jpg"><br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/popiah stall 3.jpg"></p>

<p>Must thank everyone in 1SB6 for their effort!</p>

<p>We managed to sell<br />
<img src="pictures/photos/t610/27-01-04/popiah.jpg"><br />
about $350 worth of popiah in ONE day!</p>

<p>I just hope we don't have to  pay too much for the cost price of the popiah.</p>

<p><B>Watch out for our valentines day balloon sales!</B></p>

<p>Time for a little photo entry.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/swim view.jpg"><br />
That's what you see from the clubhouse.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/end of SAT 2.jpg"><br />
The end of SAT 2...A test that was above my level. "Nothing perfect is interesting; it is the flaws that fascinate" (write an essay on it in 20minutes go!)<br />
It reminded me of a devotion held in ACJC :"If your girlfriend/boyfriend were perfect in the first place, it would not be love anymore. Love is what makes us disregard the flaws of a person."</p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/squash court.jpg"> <br />
The empty squash court in my condo. I went to play squash with Eugene after the SAT 2. We saw zhao kai , fu yan and XMZ at JP when we finished our Mos burger lunch. I didn't really expect FY and XMZ to be together, but they look like a couple. So yea, stay happy together! (ba ba ba ba...turtles) They went to celebrate Pei wen's birthday on Jan 24th. </p>

<p><img src="pictures/photos/t610/squash.jpg"><br />
And then we saw this NYGH girl (Jessica) playing squash next court. She damn pro lo, got tourney comming soon. Unlike the both of us, she was trained and squash is her CCA! My squashing history started like in sec 3 when I played it for the first time. I think I had about less that 7 games of squash?</p>

I look so pro right? But I was trashed quite badly by Jess. Too bad la, squash isn't my forte. Actually Eugene also kena trashing by her hahah!</p>

Meet  Anna's sister, Si Da, the super highly intellectual who scored 1590/1600 for her SAT 1 and still says she's lousy.</p>

I took this photo of the happy couple but I didn't publish it yet. So I do it now, happy CNY lovebirds.</p>

<h3 class="title">A new morning</h3>

<p>Finally the SAT 2s is over.... Feeling kinda weird now, nothing big to study for. I never never had this feeling for a very long time already (since sec 2 end of year).</p>

<p>I need a good rest, a hiatus from the daily mundane chores of doing homework.  No longer do I need to study in class breaks, no longer do I need to look down under my table and try some last minute cramming, no longer do I need to steal time from lecturers to read my books.</p>

<p>WEEESH!</p>

<p>Added Brian (my dolmar) to friendster, got 2 testimonials from crystal and jeremy. its kinda boring to have everyone talking about my "IT skills" when I don't really have any. Jeremy i was talking about Visual Basic la not C++! I'm learning C++ in computing classes now.  </p>

<p>THe next time you write my testimonial, I'll kick you if you mention anything about IT skills.</p>

<p>For All ACsians,<br />
<I>The Students' Council wishes all ACsians a Happy CNY!<br />
Do join us for a fun-filled time this wed, 1350, at<br />
the void deck! Food & entertainment will be provided!</I></p>

<p>Eugene got his SAT 1 score and question answer service thing in his mailbox today. I went to check my adress at www.collegeboard.com and then.....SHIT! My adress doesn't have my unit number! WTF...I'll never get my score card. DAMNIT. What happened? I keyed in #08-11 and the server truncated it cause they didn't accept any symbols. So stupid....DUMB. I'm gonna phone collegeboard soon. Anyway its not so important, cause they have my scores sent to the universities.</p>

<p>More to come...</p>

<h3 class="title">Tremble</h3>

<p><b>Happy Chinese New Year folks!</B></p>

<p>I didn't go visiting today. Stuck at home trying to study for the SAT 2. I had enough of KAPLAN. ENOUGH! Stop dumping students with useless information! You are supposed to write a test prep book not a chemistry textbook. I can imagine students who despair when they realise they can't cram all the chaff into their small   heads. "Oh my do I really need to know all these stuff?"</p>

<p>I returned to the Princeton Review, my salvation, my hope. The book is so much better, explains the spfd oribitals in just 2 pages and the VESPR theory in 2 pages too. And I can understand it! Its basically all the essentials and everything you need for the tests. I did a real SAT and I think its the same as the princeton's standard. I can only hope the standard for SAT 2 hasn't been raised since 1995 (cause my Real SAT 2 book only shows tests for 1995).</p>

<p>Eugene came to my house (again) to study for SAT 2 with me. We sat by the swimming pool and discussed stuff. We tried a 20minute essay on "First impressions can be misleading". I ended up talking about buying handphones and he ended up talking about his physics lecturer. His style is good, exactly what I would like to see. My style is...too bloggish.  I'm so envious of his writing style. Hai! I hope my essay reader will like my weird style. Just hope that I'm inspired when I see the topic for the first time. Luck is really important cause you can't choose questions for the SAT 2 writing. You must also demonstrate some good writing skills and they rate on a scale of 1-6.</p>

<p>I shall try to make my writing more personal and make it more meaningful.</p>

<p>We went swimming after that. I can't do my freestyle well - need some stroke correction.  Part of my body was alread aching from the air rifle session. </p>

<p>Tomorrow Eugene and my senior Gladys (never meet her b4) will come my house again and study for our SATs.</p>

<h3 class="title">Do you want to buy Fun O Rama tickets?</h3>

<p>I asked the above questions so many times today. Many were indifferent about it, others just flash their own donation programme stuff at my face.</p>

<p>All the ex-nan huarians who returned to NHSS were quite scattered. The teachers were having a meeting, how nice. Made us wait for them.</p>

<p>I spent my valuable time trying to persuade people to buy the ACJC Fun O Rama tickets from me. </p>

<p>"Its the biggest school based fun fair in Singapore! With 100 over food and game stalls for you to explore, why not come down and experience the fun? If you are going out with your friends to orchard rd or anywhere I suggest you come down to ACJC and join the fun. As you can see from the title of our funfair "Fun O Rama XVII" it means it has been running for the 17th time (once every 2 years) and it is an ACJ tradition. It means the funfair will be good, if not we won't continue it. Ask you, what kind of funfair can raise 0.7milion dollars per year if it is not good? SO JUST BUY MY TICKET LA!"</p>

<p>Heh, for those of you who bought the tickets, you'll surely enjoy it!</p>

<p>The honour roll:<br />
Eugene (2 tickets)<br />
Leng Xue Zhen<br />
Melissa Irwan (2 tickets)<br />
Ms Norrita<br />
Mrs Chan<br />
Mrs Siew<br />
Mdm Wong<br />
Jacintha Tan (3/2)</p>

<p>Honourable Mentions:<br />
Mrs Adeline Ong (she'll send me things from SG when I go US to study)<br />
Yin Foong (he is in malaysia now so he can't buy from me yet)<br />
Mr Pandian (He's an ACJ Old Boy, bought one ticket from Song kiu)<br />
Shu Hui  & Yet Feng (For suggesting that 5 people share one ticket)<br />
Jacintha (Guides) for *almost* making Wan Yi & Elaine buy my ticket</p>

<p>Here's the lowdown on the various donation offers at Nan Hua today:</p>

<p><B>JJC</B><br />
Love Fiesta on 14th Feb (Valentines day)<br />
Each small ticket costs 50cents each student has $20 worth to sell. Quite easy to sell since its in small amounts.<br />
Food and games fair.</p>

<p><B>SAJC</B><br />
Donation Drive<br />
Each student must solicit $100 worth of donations.<br />
NO benefits at ALL for donor.</p>

<p><B>ACJC</B><br />
Fun O Rama XVII 21st Feb (Sat) 9:30am - 6pm @ ACJC<br />
Each student is given $200 worth of tickets (20 $10 coupons) to sell<br />
Extreme creative fun games and delicous food stalls + sale of corporate gifts, flowers, supermarket items, cakes, etc etc. Fun O Rama XVI raised $0.7 million in ONE day! This year the target is $0.75 million. Support us!</p>

<p>For the cause,<br />
of ACS forever.</p>

<p>------</p>

<p>I got to see some of the 4/8 boys today, looks like they are all doing fine. Zhao kai bought a new phone, GD 88 on starhub line.  (He's a hubber! Just like me :D )</p>

<p>Both of us suan Eugene's 6610, try to beam our jpg pictures to him and he can't receive. "Eh, why I can beam my pictures and midi to zhao kai, but not you? Oh ya, I 4got you using the stupid nokia phone ah. icic"</p>

<p>The GD88 is quite powerful, but I don't really like the interface. It looks very plain, not like SE T610 where you can change the themes of the interface.</p>

<p>------</p>

<p>Today somebody just repented and walked back onto the path. Good. If you listened things won't be so bad.</p>

<p>------</p>

<p>I have to sign off now, its sooo late. yawn! Sorry no pictures today, (except for one of chrysa and kejun hugging and smilling posing for me which I haven't transfered the pic out of my handphone)</p>

<h3 class="title">Whoop!</h3>

<p>With dreamy eyes, I pressed the refresh button on my application status check for University of Texas at Austin. I didn't expect much, it has been the same since  a long time ago. But it was different, they have opened my FedEx ed package!!! WHOOPPP! Finally, after waiting anxiously for so long they opened it. I thought it went missing, but they've opened it. Yea! At least there's some hope now.</p>

<p>I called them up immediately after I saw the status on the website. My "Foreign High School Transcript" is being sent to the international admissions office for evaluation. I hope they will say "Okay we have everything he needs for an application. We'll accept him once he sends us his O level scores" after they finish looking through it. well, lets pray.</p>

<p>I don't think I can sleept tonight...heh</p>

<h3 class="title">Shooting, Scoring</h3>

<p>Tuesday. Time for single period PE - physical conditioning.</p>

<p>Total distance: 3.2km<br />
Burpees, crunches, weird excercises (I got my front and back all WET cause we were supposed to lie down on the wet track.)</p>

<p>Didn't puke this time..hehe, we got the other teacher instead of gurmit singh. He gives out more humane treatment, at least we get to rest. GS is crazy, thanks to him I puked out my recess.</p>

<p>I almost fell asleep during econs lecture today, was so tired. I'd rather have them give me 10 minutes of sleep and I'll pay attention for the next 70minutes of the lecture. Isn't that better? Instead of having to struggle to stay awake.</p>

<p>I copied my maths tutorial during maths lecture, lucky it wasn't keith tan. Heh, the other lecturer didn't say anything. I don't have time to do my homework and I don't bother. So mundane, so trivial. I'm studying for a higher order, SAT 2 Maths 2C...When that's over...I'll revert back to doing homework (or shall I put it this way: intellectually stimulating homework)</p>

<p>Heard Louis might be going off after CNY to USA (if he gets his I-20 that is). Oh great, one less pal. Wish him luck for his application. If he doesn't go, his opportunity cost will kill him (Econs stuff).</p>

<p>------------------------------Computing Classes<br />
I never regret taking computing, its so fun! I get that feeling of satisfaction whenever I solve the problems. hehe! Today I had enough time for 1 question out of 3. Here it goes</p>

<p>Write a program which prompts the user for a 5 digit number. The program will display the 5 digits in this manner:</p>

<p>7   6   4   3   4</p>

<p>The number the user input was 76434.</p>

<p>I used the more tedious method and I solved the problem with the help of the "Floor" maths function. It is very useful. The newtown guy used the modulous method (which is short). We were the only 2 who completed the task the fastest! hehe! Others were quite clueless. This is just the beginning, more will come. </p>

<p>-----------------------------------<br />
For the first time in my life, I went to a shooting range. We took MRT to Bukit Gombak to CDANS country club and went up the 2nd floor.</p>

<p><img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/cdans.jpg"><br />
Here's the place.</p>

<p>The range is quite cool, professional feeling. Maybe its the predominant white of the room which makes it look pro.<br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/range2.jpg"></p>

<p>And I like the thing which brings the card to the front :<br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/range.jpg"></p>

<p>After some safety courses and general instructions, I drew out my rifle.<br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/rifle.jpg"><br />
Mine is the old one, for right handers. The one which looks newer is for left handers (only 2 lefty guns in CDANS)</p>

<p>I'm supposed to drive these lead pellets in this box<br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/ammo.jpg"></p>

<p>To make holes in this small white card<br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/target.jpg"></p>

<p>in this position<br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/covert ops.jpg"><br />
(Frankly speaking song kiu took the photo when I was just anyhow posing, my pose is a little wrong. My left hand should support it with fingers extened flat or hand as a fist. Anyway, looks cool huh?</p>

<p>I must say shooting is really quite demanding. THe first few times I tried my bullets went all over. The X hair keep moving, I can' t stablise it. Must get accustomed to it. Only later I got to minimise the shaking by holding my breath. My accuracy improved over the 7 cards (5shots per card). I ha few VERY nice cards (4 in black region, 1 in white region) and (3 in black and 2 in white).</p>

<p>The dot at 10m away appears to be really small so everything comes down to skill. Suddenly I appreciated this excerpt from the "Wolfenstein Enemy territory" game manual:</p>

<p><I><B>Covert Operations Level 3: Breath Control</B><br />
Your mastery of the Sniper's art results in a 50% reduction in both recoil jump and weapon sway with Scoped Weapons.</I></p>

<p>On the whole I'm sticking to Air Rifle, very fun, very cool and it trains concentration. I'll benefit from it, can keep fit too.</p>

<p>-----------------------</p>

<p>I the first practice test on Kaplan on SAT 2 Chemistry. I got a very gross score, I didn't want to grade it(means its damn low don't ask). It seems I missed out alot of stuff kaplan asked (not mentioned in Princeton Review or Real SAT 2s). I'm lost, I'm wondering : have I prepared enough? 3 more days left...ARGHHHHHH!</p>

<p>Do I really look that geek/stress in school? Ppl tell me I haven't been smiling much, my smiles are ephemeral. They're wiped off my stupid face whenever I think about my SAT 2.</p>

<p>I HAVE A HIGH ENTROPHY IF THIS CONTINUES I"LL REACT WITH A HIGH POSITIVE CHANGE IN GIBBS FREE ENERGY TO PRODUCE IMMENSE ENTHALPY.</p>

<h3 class="title">Extended entry</h3>

<p>Quite a fair  bit happened recently, I didn't really keep up on my blog.</p>

<p>I met up with Edward, my childhood friend last friday. He came back from University of Texas (the one I want to go) for a short holiday, leaving on the 25th (one day after my SAT 2). Must thank him for guiding me through the application process online, if not I'm just lost in it. </p>

<p>I met him at beauty world that evening and we went to eat. He was doing shopping at queensway for a pair of nike shox and a deuter bag. (Guess things in US are expensive).  Talked quite abit, told him about ACJC and my plans. I was afraid to think of the great things that will happen once I get admitted. I am so nervous these days, a cloud of uncertainty hangs over my life. What if I fall back down? I can only hope.</p>

<p>Hope is at the bottom of pandora's box.</p>

<p>As usual, we always play LAN with some of his friends. Derren (wearing his uncle's "our army" shirt leh) and another guy (4got his name, he was with his girlfriend). They're very different from my generation, more cool.  I think we blasted each other for like 2 hours or so. Half-Life is still fun! And I tied with Derren for top fragger (121 kills). Edward got 50+ only :P The girl played better than him.  Then we moved on to Team Fortress. Again, me top frag again, thanks to my sentry gun! hehehe. Quite satisfying game play there.</p>

<p>Ah...and so I went home that friday night. (more like walk home)</p>

<p><img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/edward.jpg"><br />
Cute taiwanese guy right? That's Edward.</p>

Some junction near my house.</p>

<p>--------------------------------</p>

<p>Saturday</p>

<p>Eugene came to my house, he wanted to borrow my laser printer and scanner do "dirty worK" for his class. Make a class photo list.  In the end he had dinner at my house.  Of course...we talked about the SAT 2s we're gonna take. I exchanged books with him (My Baron for Kaplan writing). He's having a little prob with his writing. (me too). </p>

<p>His class list was done and the print from the laser printer was very sharp! Even though its black and white. I'm impressed.</p>

<p><br />
<img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/t610/clubhouse.jpg"><br />
We sat here to discuss about the SAT 2...My condo's clubhouse.</p>

<h3 class="title">Stress</h3>

<p>I haven't been blogging everyday. Maybe its because of the stress I'm getting. No its not from ACJC. Its from my SAT 2s.</p>

<p>Maths Level II C<br />
I need to memorise the double angle, sum and difference, arithmetic squence, geometric sequence, half angle formula. Its real big! The trigo stuff suck. Its supposed to be in A level maths....well... BO BIAN! I tried to do some subject tests, I'm getting better at it. Eugene did a kaplan test and got 40 right, 8 wrong 2 blank. His score is 720/800. I did the same test, got 40 right, 5 wrong, 5 blank and my score was 750. lol. But then I really suck at maths. Must see my state of mind this saturday.</p>

<p>Chemistry<br />
This subject is the easiest subject among the 3 sciences. Physics is definitely not at O level but almost on par with A levels. (I really pei fu Eugene for being able to manage the subject so well). Biology is crap, must be at A levels. What to do? Stupid people like me take chem lo. But I don't really have much to say about it, must depend on luck to get high scores. If I'm not careful, I'll fall flat. I finished 4 practice sats and the lowest score was 650/800 and the other 3 were around 730. Hard to ace I guess, but i'm trying for a 750+</p>

<p>Writing<br />
The most feared subject out of the ones i'm taking. Its DAMN hard. The sentences are crafted by sly people who will trick about 70% of the people who take the tests. (Maybe here I learn English from Singapore so it sucks because I keep geting things wrong.) But seriously my grammar standard has hopefully improved when I started to prepare for the writing tests. 20minutes write a 350 word compo, 40 minutes to do 50 MCQ questions (which I'm still taking my own sweet time to think carefully). My English "ear" is not so finely tuned yet. Sigh! Need to pray.</p>

<p>(today)<br />
I learnt what was "opportunity cost" in Economics. It was interesting to know. Computing was soso, listened to the teacher talk about "WWW" = "Wild Wild West" and "Wait Wait Wait". He also likes to say "Domain name is a high class word for address". I went to the Library during chemistry lessons later the day with Louis. I browsed around for some chemistry books and SAT 2 material and I found "Kaplan: Chemistry for SAT 2". Dang, I can't borrow books yet! Only after my first 3 months. Only way was to get my senior to borrow the book for me. I smsed Audrey (air rifle) and cheryl (band) but Audrey was not free. Cheryl didn't bring her phone I guess. I called Brian (my Dolmar) and he agreed to help me borrow. Since the books are only lent out for 3 days and the next few days will be CNY, he helped me extend the book loan till monday. And yeah, I got my book. Thank you so much Brian! I really need that practice for chemistry, need to learn more tricks.</p>

<p>I also 4got, Sharen asked me about some band seniors CNY gathering (Sir will be going) this tuesday. I will be shooting tomorrow so I can't go, plus I need to study for my SAT2. Well...give and take.</p>

<p>I'll quickly list down the things i need to do:</p>

<p>Copy Kevin's maths assignment (I can't be bothered to do mundane homework at this crucial point of time. Need the time to study for SAT 2)<br />
Finish the last maths 2C test on Kaplan and return the book to Eugene.<br />
Attempt a writing test with the essay to guage my word length.<br />
Do more chemistry SAT 2 tests on kaplan.<br />
No need to collect hong bao money. I'll be holed up at home.</p>

<p>what a nice way to spend my chinese new year....</p>

<h3 class="title">4/8 2003 memories</h3>

<p>I went through my class' MSN group today. I found these things worth keeping with me. Some might not understand it (localised jokes) if you are not from 4/8. But nevermind, its quite interesting to read.<br />
Here goes:</p>

<p><i><br />
Either they Lead us, or they Follow us or they GET OUT of our way!<br />
 <br />
Accustomed to late recess thanks to Ms Teo.<br />
 <br />
That's why we have to "intercept" other ppl's que or place "advance booking" with our friends.<br />
 <br />
I guess we are the only bunch of people that will form "walls" infront of the stall so that people from behind don't cut in.<br />
 <br />
Cultivate good relations with neighbouring classes from the "Outer Rim (4/6-4/8)"<br />
 <br />
We are not SAP sorry!<br />
 <br />
Go for weekly visits to the other side to eat some Chicken Ass meat or some wei zhes.<br />
 <br />
When entering Cam2, go in groups to avoid "Umbridge".<br />
 <br />
Help some of our friends enter the school gate because their hands are not long enough to disable Mr Lim's door "mechanism".<br />
 <br />
We are the only few classes that start to stand up after the flag raising music has played halfway.<br />
 <br />
Sometimes we are too lazy to copy down things, so we send Bob down to photocopy them.<br />
 <br />
Everybody owns a plot of land in 4/8.<br />
 <br />
Wei Keong always manages to find a solution for Ms teo before she can release us for recess.<br />
 <br />
"5 minutes break, check answers with friends"<br />
 <br />
The weather comes in many shades: sky blue, black, rainbow, white.<br />
 <br />
If you're colourblind, you will know it.<br />

Too bad, 4/7's basketball court was no longer in use, else we can have friendly games and start our own league.<br />
 <br />
How to stay half naked in class after recess with permission?<br />
Ans: Play ball games and sweat like hell before Ms Ong's English period.<br />
 <br />
When signing into MSN during lessons in computer lab, always block the teachers so they won't see us online.<br />
 <br />
Always do duty during the 2nd last period on wednesday. Therefore we are the cleanest class in 2003.<br />

<h3 class="title">Pictures galore!</h3>

<p>I finally managed to get the photos out of my T610. I had to IR it to my dad's laptop and then use a thumb drive to get it to my comp then use WS FTP to upload to xquisite.org server.</p>

<p><img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/acjc/t610/doggie.jpg"><br />
That's my doggie!</p>

<p><img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/acjc/t610/flower.jpg"><br />
I made this flower, cool eh? hehe! I'm learning from Ms Roberta Tan so that I can sell these for fund raising and hopefully for fun o rama.</p>

<p><img src="http://tranquility.xquisite.org/pictures/photos/acjc/t610/teach balloons.jpg"><br />
Here's the other PE teacher teaching my class how to make those balloons. I didn't burst any balloons...YET! haha.  He's also my swimming instructor, a nice guy really.</p>

<h3 class="title">Computing Log</h3>

<p>I'm having computing lecture now, with access to a computer of course. hehe! isn't computing slack? But its kinda fun compared to chemistry, where everything is all conceptual. My other 23 classmates are in LT1 now, having chemistry lecture. My lacturer is talking about networks now.</p>

<p>I had swimming lessons today for PE (40 + 40 minutes) at the sports complex. It was quite fun I guess, got about 4-5 more lessons to go. First period in the morning is swimming. THe PE teachers made 5 ppl at a time jump into the pool and swim from one end to the other and back (first time with breast stroke 2nd time with front crawl or known as free style.) The teachers will observe and split people into their skill levels. Like beginner and intermediate and advanced. </p>

<p>I swam the whole trip using breatstroke (cause I don't know free style I suck at it) And h ey, I was 1st out of the 5 ppl in my batch to swim to one end using breaststroke. And I was 2nd when everyone swam back using free style while I kept to my breaststroke. So... wad can I say? Inmagine my speed if I learn my freestyle corectly. Yeah, ACJ will teach my group free style for the rest of the lessons.</p>

<p>After the swim and bathe, I felt very refreshed. Isn't it so cool? Can't wait for the next swimming lesson. (ahh also got quite an eye feast hehehe)</p>

<p>For fun raising (and maybe Fun O Rama), my class will be selling balloons in the form of dogs, flowers and teddy bears! My teacher chose me to be one of the 3 to learn how to make the balloons for selling. I made a dog and flower today!</p>

<p>Bell has rang, I'd better publish my blog now. If you were wondering why there are some spelling errors and such, its because I'm typing WHILE looking at the lecturer and projector screen,</p>

<p>Hehe</p>

<p>Hey I'm at the Tech Council in ACJC now room  2.14. Sweet! 20 Imacs here, looks so cool. I can swing the LCD screen around and make it "spit" at me (for those of you who still remember the Mac commercial)</p>

<h3 class="title">Today</h3>

<p>PE was damn demanding today. We had to do circuit training in sets of 20 (push ups, jumping jacks, sit ups, crunches, burpees duno how to spell?) and of course running. I guess we ran about 6 rounds around the stadium track (400m) That's it, everyone was sapped of their energy. Only a few people from sports CCA managed to last to the end.</p>

<p>We helped each other out, there was this guy giving tips on how to breathe properly during the cool down rest period. Thanked him for his suggestion. Nice to see our own people helping each other. =)</p>

<p>Oh yes, I threw up and puked out my fish n chips meal I had before PE. Bad choice. But I felt much better. I don't think I was the only one to throw up, louis also threw up (he also ate fish n chips). </p>

<p>Computing lessons were kinda slack and fun. Can learn visual C++ and surf net (secretely though). Too bad I can't use MSN cause the version there is too old and I don't have admin rights to install msn 6. And I get to be released earlier than the chem students in my class.</p>

<p>During GP today my teacher gave us a set of worksheets (1 vocab word list and 1 fill in the blank type). I looked at at and recognised the words immediately. All from the SAT! I know almost 90% of the words featured on the list. hehe~! my classmates were like "huh? what's this word? parsimonious? never hear b4".  Ahh the sweet sense of "i'm one step ahead" kicks in. I filled up the blanks at great speed and didn't refer to the list given. My GP teacher was kinda suprised then I told her about my SATs and my SAT 2 writing problems. Sigh. Luckily she offered to help me out. For a start, she offered to find a book she has at home and lend it to me (for singaporeans to correct their grammar). I won't get it until thursday when I have her lessons. She's a great teacher, also offered to have 1 on 1 tutorials, ask me let her see my problem questions. Cool.</p>

<p>I went for my first band practice at ACJC in lecture theater 4. The instructor Mr Lee is very powerful, he tunes the band using some recording of a perfectly tuned instrument. >,< He also teaches all the theory and stuff (which my instructor left out). What's a syncopation? Pure harmonics? Ye xiang (the guy beside me) is damn pro, his sight reading is like so fast and he won't get tired at all! gee...Don't feel like joining band, kinda waste my time.</p>

<p>yawn...</p>

<p>Oh ya I just did a Real SAT 2 Maths 2C and I got 740/800. Not very impressive though. sigh! I hope I can do that for the real SAT day.</p>

<p><b>"All people are islands, yet we build many bridges"</B></p>

<p>Make new friends! Build more bridges this year. A friend far away from you means you need to build a better bridge (put in more effort) so as to remain contact with him else your bridge breaks down easily. Friends around you require less strong bridges, but building strong bridges with your friends will make you close friends.</p>

<p>Find your soulmates. But please don't trash all other bridges and build a single damn strong one. Its too risky.</p>

<h3 class="title">My mom lost her handphone</h3>

<p>My mom called home this morning and told me somebody stole her handphone while it was left unattended in the market. Gee! somebody actually wanted her phone, so lame. Her motorola handphone can't even be traded in lol.</p>

<p>Actually all these translated into one thing: Can buy a new phone since she has no contract left. Actually its about time she changed her phone, god's way of telling her. </p>

<p>This reminded me of something in 2002. I was having exams then (common test 2) and when I wanted to work on my comp this happened: I switched it on and it beeped and went black again. The 2 HDD and Power LEDs were on at the same time (this wasn't supposed to happen) and the comp went black. Then I smelt something burning and stood up and looked down the back of the comp casing. OMG great balls of fire! It was burning! the power  box was burning. I switched off the mains for the comp and returned, the fire stopped. And of course, my comp couldn't work anymore. It was a 450mhz geforce 2 mx then.  (everyone else was upgrading to 1.8 ghz PCs while I was still at the stone age) After spending a few weeks w/o my PC, my results for the common test boomed like hell! I scored damn alot of As. Then my new comp came (2.0 GHZ!!) and I 've been using that since now. Only recently did my LCD spoil and I bought a new graphic card (MSI geforce FX 5200) cause I thought its my card problem.</p>

<p>What phone should I get? Most prob I choose then I use and I pass my 8250 (very solid leh, still working mai siao siao) to my mom. </p>

<p>If only T630 was selling cheap, I think I can only afford to get the T610</p>

<h3 class="title">Louis' House</h3>

<p>Today was CCA day for many schools (including ACJ and NHSS). I went to school at 8 and hang around deciding on what CCA should I join at JC. Well, wanted to pick up new skills for a more all-rounded personal development so I chose 3 CCAs for trials : </p>

<p>Squash (not say very good at it but i know how to play)<br />
Air Rifle (i think I can practice concentration and clarity of thought)<br />
Band (I want to learn a new instrument if not I will leave band).</p>

<p>At the very most I slack all the way la~ (though that's not very possible)</p>

<p>I also offered to port the Enotice board program I wrote for NHSS for ACJ and spoke to the tech council about it. Maybe their big head will contact me soon. If they want it, well I'll be famous again! hehe!</p>

<p>Went back with kejun and christine(she told me she signed up for duno how many CCAs quite alot!) to NHSS, steph H didn't want to go cause she went yesterday.</p>

<p>NHSS is now kinda big BUT...hehe still smaller than ACJ.</p>

<p>Now the teachers at NHSS are quite happy to see us enjoying ourselves at JC. Well there's one teacher who is apparently a pain in the neck for the other teachers. Seesh...The pillars of Nan Hua. Must fire some incompetent ones if not the school's IT scene will remain forever stagnant.</p>

<p>I saw Alan, Eugene, Chelsia , Eeleen, 4/1 peeps, jasline (she was cooking at the GG booth), jamie, bao ting, wan li (she didn't dye her hair leh) and a whole load of others (okay i'm lazy to list on and on and bore the rest of the poor people who are reading this)</p>

<p>The band room was absolutely small. It can fit a primary school band but its not for a secondary school band. Seesh, I think the designers were just lazy and they ported a primary school design and use it on NHSS. Look the water coolers are so low! I need to bend down (really) and use it, plus its not cold!. Every other CCA room was small, except for dance society (they use the whole multi-purpose hall what!).  I tried to play the major scale on trombone today, hehe I didn't 4get and I still had my round sound there.</p>

<p>ITMC was...cut of and decimated by the other 2 new CCAs who went out to take over some of ITMC's functions. Innovation club took the robotics arm away, Inmagine is a direct competition with ITMC (on the Ecommerce side)</p>

<p>NHSS organising home-comming for all ex students on 31st jan, too bad ah I got X country plus I don't feel like becomming regular to NHSS lol., devote more time to ACJC.</p>

<p>I passed some of my TYS and useful books to my mei mei jacintha (you better study hor!).</p>

<p>I saw some ACJC J2s at the boys brigade booth at NHSS, (its a new CCA so they need some people from outside to start it) and I also saw wong yihan, jamie's RV friend representing NCC girls.</p>

<p>The 3 ACJC guys were very friendly, they called me and I went over to talk to them. (I was wearin the ACJ forever T shirt) so they spotted me easily. Had a nice chit chat haha.  I'm the kind of guy who will talk to seniors when I see them.</p>

<p>After my visit I went to Louis' house. Behind the paragon! That's like prime land dude, it must have cost a fortune.  Cairnhill Plaza, whoa. Though the building is quite old, the interior is damn big. Plus the renovation and decoration makes it look quite grand. (I'm guessing he bought it 2nd hand). Saw pictures of his family at paris and effiel tower, (he was 15 then) looks cool. Someday I shall visit france, seems fun.</p>

<p>Lousis you're power man, buy so many original CDs...gee If I were you I'd just download them or lend or copy lol. He has an acoustic guitar (it rocks) and a piano (and I could name the FFX songs he was playing heh!). </p>

<p>His compac comp is new! Must be, all the drives were like kinda empty. Installed winamp 5 and WS FTP for him, (eh dude winamp 5 is cool can listen to online radio and watch online TV too!)</p>

<p>He also has a Net MD...(louis has everything la, by the time I saw it) except I didn't see an Xbox but I saw his PS2 and large TV. Drool....</p>

<p>Okay shall stop talking about his stuff, stephanie H, jithra made french toast (sweet!) and it tasted good. We can sell it!</p>

<p>I figured out how to use louis' blender and we tried to make orea milkshake. Didn't turn out so well, it was watery, not so solid. I think need to add less ice and more ice cream and milk. (I"ll go net find out more about how to make milkshakes when i'm free)</p>

<p>Oh 4got, his house was so large that we could do our ACJ mass dance in it! Jie yun was so enthu about it. She told me that she was Louis' sister from indonesia when I asked her how to get to his house from paragon. Duh!! To think that I actually fell for it. Anyway she can sing really well.</p>

<p>yawn...</p>

<p>rock on 1SB6!</p>

<p>Btw, the class group website is at <a href="http://groups.msn.com/ACJSB604">Here</a> Please join if you haven't.</p>

<h3 class="title">Lesson Proper</h3>

<p>Day 1 of lessons. Not bad, the class is starting to liven up, hope it will continue!</p>

<p>"Either you perish together as fools or live together"</p>

<p>(something like that)</p>

<p>Today I got a taste of how JC life is like, a small slice maybe. Lessons at LTs, tutorials in class (no practicals yet). There's so much freedom here, much better than secondarys schools. But freedom translates into "do it yourself" sometimes.</p>

<p>I also went back to my old school's new campus to check it out. Teachers were happy to see me and kejun. It was very fun, keep on crapping about how JC is better than NHSS.</p>

<p>"Nan hua has 2 elevators"</p>

<p>""But then ACJ has 3!""</p>

<p>"Nan Hua has a multi-purpose hall"</p>

<p>""ACJ has 3 halls. 1 is the auditorium, 1 badminton hall, 1 multipurpose hall""</p>

<p>""We can use handphones whenever we want discreetly""</p>

<p>""ACJ has a cafe which serves japanese food"</p>

<p>""ACJ has 2 pool tables""</p>

<p>""ACJ has 3 swimming pools (1 large, 1 medium, 1 children pool)""</p>

<p>list goes on and on...</p>

<p>Most importantly, I have a good class and OG!! =D</p>

<p>I'll go back to school again on saturday after I sign up for CCA at ACJ. Gonna meet all the teachers again.</p>

<p>Now at page 100 of 181 of my Math 2C book. Hope I can absorb it.</p>

<p>Don't have much time to write long entries, so sorry. Everything is in point form.</p>

<p>Haven't got time to add everyone in class to the class MSN groups and to my contact list. Must remember who is who when I get to school tomorrow.</p>

<p>Oh ya, our GP teacher is quite funny! Our chinese teacher rocks..!wee!</p>

<p>Gotta sleep...</p>

<p>More to come..</p>

<h3 class="title">Orientation Ends</h3>

<p>The 4th day of orientation is over. Lessons will begin tomorrow. </p>

<p>Means that I'll be leaving Lathune (OG la) and join 1SB6 (my class, SB = combination 6 = class number). My class...seems okay, same as steph (4/4 dance) and rachel (4/2 dance). Never really got to know them well in NHSS, this might be a good chance to do so. Got quite a number of chio bu in my class, hehe!</p>

<p>My form teach is Mrs Roberta Tan (on paper is Mdm Ng LK). She teaches PE and a pastoral care subject (non examinable) which means she'll just drop by once or twice a week not very often. Brian told me she is kinda strict (yeah can tell) but in the "niao" way (which means she's quite persistant). I have a good impression of her for now I hope it will continue.</p>

<p>Vanessa was freaked out and decided to drop econs just because the teacher left a note for us to bring a copy of the Straits Times on Friday for lesson. Gee! If she drops econs she will transfer out of my class, means no Lathunains in my class so sad.</p>

<p>My OG went to holland V for dinner and came back to ACJ at 6pm for rehearsal of our dance item (dancing to holly valance's Kiss Kiss yucks!#@!) But we managed to pull it off (with Ian and serphina being the lead duet dancers, boy they were great!)</p>

<p>As usual, we played "Fear Factor" with food, making the loser eat some mixed up food that looks gross. So sorry for the ice cream at gelato's. Nice ice cream was turned into a "concoction" of exotic tastes.</p>

<p>We bought Brian and Samantha a present and card each, thanking them for being the great OGLs (dolmars). They're the best!</p>

<p>I don't have much time to pen down all my thoughts for the day so I'll just be brief from here on (its 12:20pm now, quite late you see).</p>

<p>I took a photo of keith pouring water from the bucket onto the 3 immobilised lucky chaps (seraphina, jonathan and rachel). Picture of the day! Can see the splashes of water droplets in mid air!</p>

<p>I'll post pictures onto my blog after jan 24th and make a section about my life at ACJC. I can tell you its great so far! ACJ really gels up everyone (be it the AC family or not). You can tell, during the orientation games the people were so enthu and "on", everyone danced well for the mass dance at night, everyone formed a giant train and paraded together on the bball courts at campfire time.</p>

<p>I like the way ACJ ended the orientation at the end of the day by offering a prayer to god. Although I'm not a christian, I think its cool cause it helps me to reflect on what I've done in the day.</p>

<p>Oh yar, I've agreed to meet members of my OG at least once a month. Cool eh? =D</p>

<p>Didn't know hui jie reads my blog, hmm interesting. Can my loyal readers leave some notes? haha! Thanks man!</p>

<p>Good night! (not a good idea to "pon" school tml)</p>

<p>*sorry la jonathan spelt your name wrongly. I'll do a detailed write up on lathune after my SAT 2s...damn killer exams. Hope I do well for those*</p>

<h3 class="title">Day 3</h3>

<p>It is now Day 3 of my orientation at ACJC. It rocks! It rocks! Simply kick ass! whoo. ACJC is so fun and creative. Learnt 3 dances so far, not bad very cool. The 1st dance is the hardest to learn (don't know why). THe 2nd sounds very retro which is good. The 3rd sounds like something from Machi (Ian's comment).</p>

<p>Ah oh yea we got to play with water guns. Squirting water at friends is kinda addictive. Nicholas and me always go for "refill" trips.</p>

<p>THere is one game today which deserves some mention : playing the human knot with people pouring toothpaste on you! There is also another one which involves flour which made all our faces white. </p>

<p>Had dinner with my conduit today, cool. Quite fun, Johnathan and friends started to play "open number" and the loser had to eat part of the leftover food. Gross!</p>

<p>Took 77 home from holland V, quite fast.</p>

<p>Reached home, yawned, bathe and picked up the SAT 2 chem for reading. I'm left with the final 2 chapters of chemistry, which I hope I can finish tomorrow before the campfire. Gee... Damn stressed now. I hope someone can help me with my SAT 2 writing. Need to drastically improve my score! Argh! It sucks now.</p>

<p>As for SAT 2 Math 2C, I'm waiting for that graphical calculator to arrive, I shall start on it after I finish chemistry and develop it in parallel with writing.</p>

<p>Please pray and hope that I will succeed.</p>

<h3 class="title">ACJC house system</h3>

<p>The orientation for year 2004 is truly heavily <I>Dune</I> inspired. (Ok I know so much about the book cause I've read almost all of its prequels except a recently published one and some of the sequels too. Read 6 Dune books for a book review)</p>

<p>First thing, the story about the planet becomming a desert is somewhat a hook. In Dune, the planet Arrakis (refered to Dune by the Fremen in habitants) is a desert without water. Water is scarce and is obtained only at the polar regions of the planet. </p>

<p>Malathis, the prophet in the ACJC orientation story, could be refered to as Imperial Meteologist Pardot Keynes. Both of them wanted to change the world but they were shunned. Keynes wanted to restore Dune and terraform it to become green again. Malathis wanted peace for the world. Keynes got the help of the fremen in Dune. When he died the Fremen continued the terraforming projects. Malathis has the support of house Jazul, who also believe in the return of Sha'guni (the parallel of Dune's Messiah)</p>

<p>Talking about the messiah in Dune, he was supposed to be paul atreides (means he is from house atreides). However, Paul was also a fremen. He learnt their ways too. He brought peace to the world at the end of Dune with his gift of foresight. </p>

<p>Looking back at the ACJC orientation, House Alleria is actually House Atreides. Why? Like the atreides, they have water, honour and technology. Their insignia is also the eagle (except alleria is the blue eagle). House Cornos, well quite obvious they represent house harkkonnen (the most ruthless of all the great houses, and also because they have a Baron) What about house jazul? The fremen of course, since they live in sand dunes.</p>

<p>Something the ACJC orientation planner didn't copy from Dune: the giant sandworms that roam Dune.</p>

<p>Not bad...At least it shows that they appreciate great works of science fiction and literature.</p>

<p>Oh ya and for all you guys out there ACJC got alot of chio bu! (at least much higher proportion than NHSS, but I wasn't so interested).</p>

<h3 class="title">ACJC Orientation</h3>

<p>My first day at ACJC as a student. Whoop, its the best school experience I've ever had.</p>

<p>I was late for school today (well almost, sort of. I didn't know school started at 7:30, I thought it was supposed to be 8am.)</p>

<p>The day began with the principal's address, some stuff she said really made sense.  I think ACJC is more lax on the discipline side than NHSS, but they still care about small things.</p>

<p>I'm gonna need new shoes I guess, mine is black not white. >,<</p>

<p>Btw, here is what is wrong about ACJC:<br />
ACJC allows sport shoes (yes but they have colour restrictions --> white)<br />
ACJC allows dyed hair (no no, I don't think so)<br />
ACJC allows short skirts (eh, must not be more than 2cm from knee cap)<br />
ACJC doesn't care if you don't turn up for lessons (nah they give demerit points)<br />
ACJC is a place for rich kids and snobs (haven't seen any yet..sorry!)</p>

<p>The people there are fun, enthu about the stuff and all things. Very apparent through the games we played. </p>

<p>Crazy games like dipping your head in a bucket to collect water to make water bombs were insane. But everyone played along.</p>

<p>There was one where we had to make the longest line of our possessions and stuff. We took off our shoes and shoe laces, socks and etc to line it up into a straight line on the road, then we lay down on the asphalt. We made a 44 m line of our stuff, beat the other team by 0.1m. WEE! Lucky I wasn't 10cm shorter. The other team had to do a forfeit, made them sing Britney's "hit me baby one more time" <img scr="http://www.spug.net/forums/images/smilies/lol.gif"></p>

<p>We also had to play a game where 2 people have to carry a balloon back to back to the other end of the line. Although we lost the game, we didn't feel so bad because we tried, the best team won.</p>

<p>My orientation group, lathune, (yea cool name huh?) is part of clan alleria. Lathune won many games today. All results of teamwork and smart insights by me. :D</p>

<p>There was one game where we had to get all of our 19 members to the other end of the line on the ACJC race track. Only 10 hands and feet were allowed on the ground at anyone time. I think it was the most challenging, requiring us to think for awhile before we found a solution. All the guys had to piggy back the girls over and walk with only one foot on the ground (so that only 10 are on the ground at any time). There was one girl who had no guy to piggy back, so she had to hop on 1 foot to meet the requirements. The other team did a wheel barrow, they were slower than us by alot. We won!</p>

<p>Seriously people have to change their attitude about ACJC, its not a snob school. (Maybe cause I haven't seen any yet). The people from the ACS(I) family were pretty easy to talk to, very friendly too. I hit it off with them while filling up the subject forms. (I chose to study maths C, physics, econs & computing).</p>

<p>Overall ACJC J1 is made up of people from many different schools. Got MGS (yea, seems like they know the ACS(I) guys already) It isn't so hard to assimilate and blend into the ACJ environment. Just need to open my mouth a little and make more friends!</p>

<p>Cool I just love it, nv enter wrong JC. My style. They kinda creative and (guai lan) like to do new things. For instance their OG (orientation group) is not called OG but "conduits". Their House is not house but a Clan.  Actually they have proper house names, but they don't use them for now. </p>

<p>THe orientation has a theme, one which is very different from all other JCs. I find it heavily <I>Dune</I> inspired and copies somethings from LOTR.  The "Dormar" (actually a fancy name for OG leader, too fancy until I'm not sure how to spell it.) sounds like something from Dune. Along with the baron and the story about scarce water and the 3 houses. Cornos is like harkonnen, alleria is like the atreides (or fremen, since we got water!, our base is at ACJC sports complex swim pool). Jazul might be the fremen, since they are the desert dwellers (according to the ACJC story). The domars i've spoken to really agree that its dune inspired.</p>

<p>Oh ya, forgot to mention that I spent alot of time learning the dance steps with everyone else. Lucky we had the Dormars to guide us through. Dancing for the first time, mmm fresh!</p>

<p>One of my dormar, samantha, looks like anna's sister. simply look alike, v sporty, lean and tall with big eyes n same face! gotta bring the 2 together n meet give them a shock lol.</p>

<p>I bought an ACJC PE shirt and pants for $20....quite expensive but no choice, i'm gonna need them sooner or later. Might as well buy now. I don't know how to put the ACJC badge on my NH uniform, anyone got any idea? The stupid NH crest is embroided onto the uniform.</p>

<p>Some ACS(I) guys are really interesting, being "deprived" of girls for 4 years, they are real funny. They say I come from mix school got some advantage, maybe will need my help in due time lol. Another way to forge friendships.</p>

<p>Ah, let me talk about ACJC facilities, I think the main  building is at least 7 stories high with elevator.  The sports complex is huge, the badminton hall is fully air con during exams. They have this "SUper gym", really a super gym, about 6 times bigger than the gym in my condo. Its like filled with machines. Got a number of students working out there, looks like ACJC produces fit scholars. Cool. There is also a Jap restaurant at the sports complex, quite expensive though. But nice place to eat (esp the sofa thing). </p>

<p>Overall the place looks new and kinda like a company run school.</p>

<p>Ah, this is just day1, more to come!</p>

<h3 class="title">What I see is not what I thought</h3>

<p>I've come to realise something. A visionary has foresight and hindsight. He can see the future and understand the PAST. The future is based on the past. One who can see simply predicts the future based on the past by extrapolation.</p>

<p>I saw it comming, I couldn't stop it. <br />
If I had been called by you, it would have been me.<br />
But then I believe I will stop before it is too late.<br />
I should have walked behind.</p>

<p>Sorry friend, you have chosen the path yourself. Save yourself first.</p>

<p>I hope I can <I>"wake up from a dream and forget about it</I></p>

<p><B>History will repeat itself, it is like a upgoing spiral.</B></p>
