I have now spend a long period in Munich - not traveled seriously for some time. It makes life so much more relaxed and I could create a daily routine and even build on a "life after work". Sounds exciting or? I have enjoyed it very much. The feeling of having food in the fridge that won't attack when you open it. Wahnsinn! (Crazy). <BR><P>
I made my balcony into an extra "room" in  the warm and beautiful summer Munich had this year. My favorite hours were after work coming home eat and read on my balcony on my new teak tree furniture and sipping a glass of red wine. <IMG SRC="maisinger1.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Stefan and Harry enjoying a little beer at the Maisinger beergarten - on the bank of another lake" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">The sunset entertaining me with the most beautiful scenery. I have bought roses and tomatoes. The roses bloomed all summer and showed themselves from their best sides. Harry gave me the big one - and I have enjoyed every single day all summer. Great plant - great idea! My tomatoes - in the contrary - 4 plants and only 6 tiny tomatoes! Idiot plants! What else? Of course a lot of days in the sun at the lakes.<IMG SRC="packing_wortsee.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Peter, Stefan, Harry - packing up after a day in the sun - shadow caught up on us:)" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">  Here it is Wôrtsee which is one of the more regular targets during a sunny weekend.After a day at the Wörtsee we often went to a small beergarten in a tiny village Etterschlag to have spareribs, chicken etc.... a very cosy place. Or other beergartens - like here at Maisinger. <BR><P><BR><P><BR><P>


<IMG SRC="PICNIC2.JPG"  ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="200" ALT="Looks really cosy doesn't it?" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">October 6th - just so you know that it is really good weather for this time of year - we went for a picnic by the river - Isar - in Munich. We found a place that was very suitable we thought. The only problems was to get the place where it was suitable we had to take off shoes and socks and wade through the water and walk through stones that was really hurting your naked feet. But we managed. And we were enjoying the great food made by Adnan. Harry and I left a little early though. There was a football game on tv. Please ignore the naked people behind the picnic party. This is the nude area of Munich. <BR><P>


<IMG SRC="peter_adnan_squash.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" ALT="Peter and Adnan in a severe game of squash - photo quality - who cares!" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"> I have been climbing (indoor) without leaving anything significantly in my pants - out of fear. I can recommend this - scare the shit (almost) out of youself sometimes. It has proved to take the business (or busyness) out of my head. Thinking no further than the next grip and the importance of it. The first time I went there I got up in 30 meters height. I have now been up twice in 30 meters height. I feel brave. Especially since I learned that another friend (Adnan) had three attempts before he made it all the way up. Nasty rumors says the route got easier - I don't believe it though. A bit of squash as well with Peter and Adnan. Most of the time Adnan and I was discussing the rules. Peter showed to be a talent - his first time playing sqaush and only hit the wall with his body hard once.

Everybody was crawling on the floor collecting pearls - and now three people putting them back on the string." ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">I was again invited to participate in both Lu's and Konrad's birthdays. I show gratefully up everytime. It is great fun and I enjoy the time with them. This is Harry's parents and also Petra and another Harry show up and we usually laugh all evening. And the food is good too. <BR><P>

<IMG SRC="harry_wasser.jpg"  ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="180" ALT="The water was only 17 and I did jump in! Only once though. Harry likes this temperature..." ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">The weather has been fantastic. October 31st the temperature was 26°. I had lunch outside and felt very overdressed in my coat. The summer and autumn has been really great. I've been outside all I could to make the most of the weather. November 1st the winter came - dropped from 26 degrees to 8. My coat made finally good sense. Now it is time to start the gas oven and cuddle up in warm sweaters and socks. <IMG SRC="lene_office1.jpg"  ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="150" ALT="At the office - please note the red thingy at my keyboard - that's a stress-ball. Also note the quote behind on the whiteboard... döner macht schöner..." ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">A shame my oven doesn't work! Idiot oven.  Photo nostalgia - here I was. Working position at ADVA. In fact I almost managed to cut down on the hours - close to my goal 50 hours. (well, now I cut down for real :)) Also since I have joined a badminton club finally. Playing on a team and already injuried my shoulder so I have to take a small break. I felt the injury at badminton but it wasn't that bad. It was not until I threw an ADVA stress-ball at a colleague I got the injury that means a pause in using my arm for any stuff like that. I don't know what was worse... not playing badminton or not being able to throw the balls back...Fact is - my shoulder is ok again and I don't have to throw the balls. And I releaize I have to learn badminton German. I fall back to yell my Danish during a game of badminton and no one understand a thing.   <BR><p>
