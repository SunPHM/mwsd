      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Summer Squash is about more than zucchini,
      although we do grow a couple of fine zucchini varieties (also
      known as courgettes in France, marrows in England, or cocozelle
      in Italy). The word &quot;zucchini&quot; is derived from the
      Italian word meaning sweet.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">The squash family is divided into four
      species but all the summer squashes are grouped into the same
      one, Cucurbita pepo, the group that also includes pumpkins, and
      some winter squashes, like the ever-popular &quot;Acorn&quot;
      and &quot;Delicata&quot;, and pumpkins. Flavor-wise, summer squashes
      have little in common with the winter varieties.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">In addition to the standard green zucchini,
      look for the &quot;Gold Rush&quot; (an all-yellow zucchini),
      &quot;Ronde de Nice&quot; (a French heirloom that's round, like
      a ball), pale green Lebanese, and &quot;Costata Romanesco&quot;
      (the striped Italian ribbed zucchini). There are also many others
      that aren't commercially grown.<BR>
      Also try the old-fashioned, full-flavored &quot;Yellow Crookneck&quot;,
      and the firmer, crisper pattypan, or scallop family that includes
      bright yellow &quot;Sunburst&quot;, pale green &quot;Peter Pan&quot;,
      and dark green &quot;Starship&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffcc66" SIZE="+1">How to Choose:<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">The stem end of a squash will
      tell you how fresh it is. Ideally, there should be a little juice
      coming out of the stem, indicating that it was recently harvested.
      Steer away from limp or very scratched squashes. The skins should
      be tight, shiny, and brightly colored and will scratch easily
      with a fingernail if fresh.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffcc66" SIZE="+1">How to Keep:</FONT></B><FONT
       COLOR="#ffffcc"><BR>
      Keep squashes in a plastic bag in the warmest part of the refrigerator.
      If buying baby squashes with blossoms attached, refrigerate them
      in a plastic bag but leave it open so they can get air.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffcc66" SIZE="+1">How to Eat:</FONT></B><FONT
       COLOR="#ffffcc"><BR>
      Non-organic squashes should be rinsed and dried with a towel
      before using. Otherwise, rub any dust off with a damp towel.
      Don't wash the squashes in a lot of water because they will absorb
      it and become mushy.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Trim the stem and flower end with a
      knife before proceeding with your recipe. The simplest way to
      cook summer squash is to cut them into evenly sized pieces, then
      steam just until tender&shy;a few minutes. If the squashes are
      quite small, you can leave them whole.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">I like to saut&eacute; them in fairly
      hot olive oil until the sugars caramelize and brown. Try eating
      little zucchinis like this with eggs for breakfast.<BR>
      Stuff squash blossoms with mozzarella and herbs and fry them,
      or slice and saut&eacute; in olive oil and toss with pasta and
      fried zucchini.</FONT></P>
