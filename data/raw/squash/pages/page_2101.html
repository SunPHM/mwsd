skill, participation; we aim to combine all three in our sport at
Edgeborough. Enjoyment is the key, from beginner to star. All
boys and girls have a full sporting programme which revolves
mostly round the team games - rugby, netball, soccer, hockey in
the winter, and cricket, rounders and athletics in the summer -
but a number of other sports are available.</font></p>

riding and sailing take place off the site, but having our own
Sports Hall, floodlit astro courts, Swimming Pool and Golf
Course enables us to provide a number of other activities which
include basketball, gymnastics and tennis. Those who compete must
learn, to do so wholeheartedly with generosity of spirit; it is
with that in mind that we regularly invite top class
internationals to come to the School to give all the children a
taste of what really constitutes a true sportsman.</font></font></p>
