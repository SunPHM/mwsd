<a name="preamble"><b>PART ONE: PREAMBLE</b></a><br>
<br>
1. This Specification defines recommended standards for Singles &amp;Doubles
Squash courts for the International Game of Squash; referred to in North
America as "Softball" Squash. It has been drawn up on behalf of the World
Squash Federation (WSF) (previously theInternational Squash Rackets Federation
(ISRF)) as the sole International Federation for Squash recognised by the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).<br>
<br>
2. The AIMS of the Specification are:<br>
<br>
2.1 to ensure comparability of recommended standards for courts from one
country to another<br>
<br>
2.2 to guide manufacturers, builders and designers as to suitable standards
of squash court construction and design.<br>
<br>
3. The Specification is in four parts as follows:<br>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Part One Preamble<br>
    </b>
  <li>
    <b>Part Two General Configuration of the Court<br>
    </b>
  <li>
    <b>Part Three Performance Specification<br>
    </b>
  <li>
    <b>Part Four WSF Accreditation Scheme<br>
    </b>
</ol>
<p>
4. The Performance Specification defines the basic characteristics ofsquash
courts without reference to materials or methods ofconstruction. <br>
<br>
5. Courts built according to this Specification will be suitable forall types
of play. With effect from 1 November 1983, the following events may only
be played on courts which meet the Specification in all respects:<br>
<br>
5.1 International matches between representative teams from different countries
unless agreed in advance by both captains or National Associations<br>
5.2 Individual or World Team Championships Semi-Finals and Finals <br>
5.3 Such matches, events or championships as may be decided from time to
time by the WSF.<br>
<br>
6. The WSF reserves the right to amend the Performance Specification at any
time if it is in its view desirable that this should be done.<br>
<br>
7. This Specification applies only to courts the construction of which is
commenced after 1 November 1983.<br>
<br>
8. The assistance of numerous manufacturers and National Associations in
commenting on drafts and supplying information is acknowledged with grateful
thanks, as is the work carried out by Kit Campbell, former Chairman of the
WSF Technical Committee, in preparing the original specification. The drawing
in Part Two is by Chris Herridge. <br>

Wall. <br>
7. The general configuration of a Squash Court, its dimensions and its markings
are illustrated on Diagram Number 1.<br>
<br>
<b>Construction</b>
<p>
A Squash Court may be constructed from a number of materials providing they
have suitable ball rebound characteristics and are safe for play; however,
the WSF publishes a Squash Court Specification which contains recommended
standards. The standards must be met for competitive play as required by
the appropriate National Governing Body of Squash.<br>
<br>
<p>
Description and Dimensions of a Doubles Court
<p>
(Appendix 6.1 - Rules of the International Game)* <br>
<p>
The Description, Dimensions &amp; Notes and Construction shall be the same
as for the International Singles Court except for: <br>
<br>
Width of court between playing surfaces 7620 mm<br>
<br>
* The above Appendices to the Rules of the International Game contain
descriptions which do not come into effect until 1 May 1997. However, there
is no change to the dimensions specified in Appendices 6 and 6.1 to the Rules
effective 1 May 1997.<br>

<p>
<a name="walls"><b>COURT WALLS<br>
</b></a><br>
<b>Construction of Court Walls<br>
</b><br>
30. Each wall of the court shall be of the same construction over the whole
of the playing area except as allowed under paragraph 6, above.<br>
<p>
<b>Strength of Court Walls<br>
</b><br>
31. The walls of the court and all components of them shall be capable of
withstanding all the stresses which may be placed upon them in normal play
and shall not suffer any breakage nor any permanent or temporary damage as
a result of:<br>
<br>
31.1 The impact of balls or rackets:<br>
31.2 The impact of players defined as equivalent to that of a human body
with a mass of 100kg and a coefficient of absorption of 47% (ie 47% of the
impact energy is absorbed by the body and 53% transmitted to the wall),
travelling at the moment of impact at a speed of 4.5 metres per second and
striking the wall at right angles to it over an area of not more than 0.25
square metres at a height to the centre of the impact area of 1.47 metres
(plus or minus 50 mm) over the whole of its length.<br>
<p>
<b>Deflection of Court Walls<br>
</b><br>
32 The walls of the court shall not deflect under the impact of the ball
in normal play to such an extent or in such a manner than the rebound of
the ball is affected.<br>
<br>
33. The walls may deflect under the impact of players if it is necessary
for their structural integrity that they should do so; however, they should
not deflect to such an extent or in such a manner so as to affect the safety
of the players or spectators alike.<br>
<br>
34. Any wall which deflects as above shall return to its original static
position within one second of the initial impact and shall not suffer any
breakage nor any permanent or temporary damage as a result of the
deflection.<br>
<p>
<b>Wall Finishes<br>
</b><br>
35. All playing walls of the court shall have a hard smooth finish.
<br>
<br>
36. Any front or side walls, or any transparent panel in the playing surface
of the front or side walls, shall be treated and/or lit in such a manner
as to make it non-reflecting when viewed from inside the court.<br>
<p>
<b>Colour of Court Walls<br>
</b><br>
37. The front and side walls of the court shall be of the same colour and
reflectance. If the back wall is a solid wall, it shall be the same colour
and reflectance as the front and side walls. <br>
<p>
<b>Reflectance of Walls<br>
</b><br>
38. The average reflectance of the front and side walls shall not be less
than 60% at any point when in a clean condition.<br>
<br>
39. The reflectance of the front and side walls shall not vary at any point
by more than plus or minus 5% of the average reflectance. <br>
<p>
<b>Ball Rebound from the Court Walls<br>
</b><br>
40. The ball shall rebound truly on striking all parts of the playing walls.
The ball rebound shall be consistent over the whole area of each wall.<br>
<p>
<b>Joints in Playing Surfaces<br>
</b><br>
41. Any open joint in the finish of a wall of panel construction
shall:<br>
<br>
41.1 not deflect the rebound of the ball in any way<br>
41.2 not be wider than 2 mm in the plane of the wall surface<br>
41.3 be constructed in such a manner as to ensure that adjacent areas of
the finish cannot move relative to one another at right angles to the plane
of the wall following the impact of the ball, a racket or a player, except
in the case of doors in transparent walls as allowed by paragraph 50 of this
Specification.<br>
<p>
<b>Flank Wall Panels<br>
</b><br>
42. The plane of the side walls of the court shall be extended behind a
transparent back wall for a distance of not less than 900 mm and to a height
of not less than 2130 mm above finished floor level inside the court by means
of fixed or movable panels of the same colour and texture as the side wall
of the court. <br>
<br>
<b>Wall to Wall Junctions<br>
</b><br>
43. There shall be no protrusions of any kind into the court at the junction
of one wall with another.<br>
<br>
<b>Wall to Floor Junctions<br>
</b><br>
44. There shall be no protrusion of any kind into the court at the junction
of any wall of the court with the floor. An expansion joint may be provided
at the junction of any wall of the court with the floor, but this shall not

The World Squash Federation (WSF) is the governing body for the game of Squash
throughout the world and is therefore responsible for the rules of Squash
and for setting standards for courts and equipment. In order to continue
the process of ensuring that courts are built to appropriate standards, it
has introduced a scheme whereby materials and components may be tested against
the standards set by the Federation.<br>
<br>
Manufacturers of court materials and components may apply for such Accreditation
and gain the accolade for their product "WSF Approved and Certified". Details
