      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <b><font color="#0000CC">HOW DO YOU 
        SPELL TOUGH? MCREE</font></b> She did it again today did Rebecca Macree. 
        Not happy with knocking out third seed Tania Bailey in yesterday's first 
        round, Macree continued her way to a semi-final berth by outthinking and 
        outlasting Vanessa Atkinson, <img src="../photos/britishopen/macree2a_sm.jpg" width="179" height="347" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">seeded 
        eight. It wasn't that the Dutch number one played badly, just that Macree 
        is playing the best squash of her life. And not the English hacker game 
        either; she was using the entire court and hitting the ball at all heights 
        and angles and Atkinson didn't have the answer to her attack. It was a 
        pretty good 45 minute tussle. - easily the best match of the day - and 
        there were rallies that were as good as any of seen this year. Macree 
        won 3/1 and when I asked her why she was playing so well she opened up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <font color="#0000CC"><b>HOW'S THAT 
        FOR A HANDICAP OR TWO?</b></font> <br>
        To start with she is profoundly deaf and can understand you through a 
        combination lip reading and a hearing aid, so when she plays she has to 
        read the her opponent's body language and signs to know when a silly let 
        is being requested. She also has to be eagle eyed to watch the referee's 
        lips and hands to see if that silly let is being allowed. If that isn't 
        enough to handle, for the last two years her mother has been suffering 
        from leukaemia. They were close; in her early squash career mother would 
        sit behind the court knitting (The French Revolution comes to mind) and 
        translate the referee's decisions to her. So it is understandable that 
        her mother's illness took precedence over her squash career. "She nearly 
        died twice and that made me think about my own life and what I wanted 
        to do with it. My mother has had a bone marrow transplant and is a lot 
        better now so I have been able to train properly," she told me as sweat 
        still poured from her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><font color="#0000CC"><b> STRONGER, 
        FASTER, CLEVERER<br>
        </b></font> "When I lost 10-9 in the fifth to Tania Bailey in Egypt I 
        was really angry. But I thought if Tania can beat all the players she's 
        been beating I can too. So I started training really hard. I'm much stronger 
        now, I do a lot of weights, a lot on the cycle, explosive speed work and 
        I have changed the way I hit the ball to give it more cut. I'm also thinking 
        more," she added. She also agreed that being picked for England on Sue 
        Wright's <img src="../photos/britishopen2000/owens1.jpg" width="128" height="322" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">withdrawal 
        gave her confidence a boost. Her present ranking is now 15 but is hoping 
        to go beyond her best ever ranking of eleven. In tomorrow's semi-final 
        she will be playing the new world champion Carol Owens and that will be 
        a very good yardstick on just good she is.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> <font color="#0000CC"><b>SLOW BUT 
        SURE, FAST AND LETHAL<br>
        </b></font>Owens got through to the semi-final with a fight, a fight that 
        she was always going to win because of her consistency. Fiona Geaves is 
        an experienced player and between the two of them played the sort of all-court 
        squash that was once a rarity but is now becoming mandatory for any player 
        wanting to play with the big boys or girls. One thing is apparent in Owens' 
        game is that when she is playing at a measured pace and placing the ball, 
        she is in command. When she starts thumping the ball, it's anybody's game. 
        Not that she's bad at fastball - she hit some wicked straight nicks on 
        her forehand with the sort of pace that most men would not be ashamed 
        of.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> She won the first game 9-1 in under 
        eight minutes, but found herself under the cosh in the second when Geaves 
        levelled at 3-3 and from then on the English player was never headed. 
        Owens had lost her control and Geaves was giving nothing away. Although 
        <img src="../photos/britishopen/geaves_sm.jpg" width="139" height="296" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
        Owens levelled at 7-7 Geaves kept up the pressure to take the game 9-7 
        in 13 minutes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><font color="#0000CC"><b>A GOOD READ</b></font> 
        Owens rushed to a 5-0 lead in the third and Geaves fought back to 6-4 
        but Owens was reading her opponent's game well while Geaves was over-anticipating 
        and getting wrong-footed. At 7-4 the referee quite rightly refused Owens 
        a let and after some serious arguing from Owens changed his decision. 
        Geaves asked him if he were allowed to do that and he said yes. (Discuss 
        and write 2,000 words on why he was right and wrong).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> The decision put Geaves off and she 
        left the court referring to spherical objects after losing 4-9. It still 
        affected her game in the fourth allowing Owens another 5-0 lead and she 
        never recovered as Owens, still favouring the fastball game, won 9-4 after 
        an entertaining 42 fight. </font></p>
