Here are my gourds. Please enjoy, but don't fondle.

Some weird fruit type of thing.
"/></div>

<p>
I am not really sure about the official name for such things. They might be gourds, or they could be squash, 
or maybe something in between, such as squourds.
</p>
<div class = "image_center"><img src = "_images/

"/></div>

<p>
You can't eat them. You can't use them to start a fire. You might be able to carry water in one, at a pinch. In the main,
however, people prefer to just keep them in their houses and look at them and think - 'well, that sure looks weird'.
</p>
<p>
Just in case they are gourds, allow me to point you to what must be THE most popular page on the entire Internet: 
<a href = "http://www.americangourdsociety.org/">The American Gourd Society</a>. I thought that at least an American gourd 
might have something interesting about it. I figured they'd be sleeker, bigger,
faster and more expensive than other world gourds. I even hoped that they might incorporate a digital camera or something.
</p>
<p>
But they don't. They are exactly the same as all the other gourds, except they're in America.

<h2>The Fellowship of the Ring Tones</h2>

<p>
With today's modern technology, such as electric jelly for example, it is hardly surprising that we
should be able to provide a plethora of new ring tones for the modern mobile-phonalist:
</p>
<p>
1. Make your mobile sound exactly like your house phone.
</p>
<p>
No matter where you are, you can feel right at home by making your mobile sound exactly like your house phone. Of course, if you
happen to be at home, there might be a small amount of confusion involved, but if you are out in a water park or a smart restaurant,
memories of the hall carpet can be recalled in an instant. Adding to the fun is the sense of bewildered
confusion that you can watch momentarily passing across the faces of the other patrons. Works for any phone, including red ones.
</p>
<p>
2. Make it sound like someone else's phone is ringing. 
</p>
<p>
Using a special sound chamber, and a receiving device, this phone picks up the ring tone of someone else's phone, and then
makes it sound like that phone is ringing, not yours. When you see someone take out their phone, answer it and then look
puzzled and angry, you can answer your phone, while pointing at them and laughing. Fun for all the family. Works for any
phone, including red ones.
</p>
<p>
3. The ultrasonic whistle.
</p>
<p>
No one can hear your phone ring. But every dog in a five mile radius will come running! Fun for all the family.
Not recommended for use by vets.
</p>
<p>
4. A loud, panic stricken voice shouting 'Fire! fire! Get out now!'.
</p>
<p>
Have all your phone conversations in
private, no matter where you are. Fun for all the family. Not recommended for use by firemen or people caring for the elderly.
</p>
<p>
5. A huge wail of existential despair.
</p>
<p>
Use your mobile as a handy device to remind yourself that the enormity of the existential predicament bears down on you
for your every waking second, like a massive wet blanket weighed down with ballast of time. Angst for all the family. 
Not recommended for logical positivists. Actually, just not recommended.
</p>
<p>
6. A single loud gunshot, followed by a thud.
</p>
<p>
Has the same general effect as number 4. Not advisable for use by the Jamaican mafia. 
</p>
<p>
7. A single loud gunshot, followed by a thud, followed by a voice shouting 'Hey, someone just shot Phil Collins'. 
</p>
<p>
Breaks the ice at parties. Not advisable for use by Phil Collins or members of his immediate family.

<h2>Noah's Bubbling Upheaval. Day 15.</h2>

<p>
Today, the capybaras tried to start a mutiny because their Pacman machine broke down.
Typically, there was no warranty for salt water damage. I tried to explain that to them, but your average capybara
doesn't understand much about insurance. They only have a brain the size of a lemon, you see, and a lot of that
is taken up with information on how to breath. So there's only a bit left over for eating, moving, Pacman and
fomenting revolution, and no room for insurance.
</p>
<p>
Given this, it was clear that their attempted coup would fail. It hardly got started really. Ham caught one of them making
a flag, with 'Kik all Hoovers' written on it in marker. He asked them if they meant to write 'Kill all humans' and they 
stupidly said 'yes', which is clearly grounds for treason. 
</p>
<p>
But what if they had succeeded? They might have had a fighting chance if the larger apes had played ball. Then the world
would have been ruled by the chimpanzees, or their descendants. Imagine that.
</p>
<p>
I decided to call up god on the special emergency channel. He wasn't pleased about it, since he was watching the snooker, but he listened
to what I had to say. His answer was typical of god: summary executions, and lots of them. 'Scare the living crap out of them
Noah', he said, 'Its the only way. You've got to be cruel to be kind. I mean, look at me. I just wiped out all of humanity except
you. And I still might wipe you out if you phone me when the snooker is on again.'
</p>
<p>
Well, it is all very well for god to order summary executions, but what were we supposed to execute? The only extra animals we
have on board are for food. So, for example, if we use the 629 remaining gazelles, then there'll be nothing for the lions to eat. If we
use the one billion seven hundred and ninety four flies, then the spiders will starve. Working down the food chain, we realized that the only spare animals 
we had are the plankton. 
</p>
<p>
Still, needs must. I ordered the boys to collect up all the plankton, and blindfold some of it, and put them on tiny little
plates. Then we went around all the animals and held up the plate and shot the plankton in front of them. It didn't have
much of an effect, though. Most of the animals hadn't a clue what we were up to, and those that did just laughed. The blue 
whales wanted to know why we were shooting their lunch. It scared the capybaras witless though, so I suppose that was something.
</p>
<p>
It was all a bit exciting, really, after two weeks of doing nothing but looking at water.

<h2>The Self-fulfilling Prophecy</h2>

<p>
This was written to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so naturally great things
are expected of it.
</p>
<p>
Some men in sunglasses have brought it to a secret underground location, by means of an unassuming car.
In the secret underground location, three scientists are examining it to see what may be discovered. 
</p>
<p>
'Nothing', according to the first scientist, who is annoyed at having to waste his lunch break reading about himself discovering
nothing in a post otherwise devoid of anything else to say.
</p>
<p>
'No, keep reading', says the second scientist...
</p>
<div class = "quote">
For you will notice that at this point, I mention how it is that this post could
not be anything but interesting if it so happens that we three very important scientists are called upon to examine it in a
secret underground location, as we are doing right now. It says so right here.
</div>
<p>
'You are indeed correct', says the first scientist... 
</p>
<div class = "quote">
But your argument is actually circular. The only reason we are here reading
this now is because it was written to become a self-fulfilling prophecy in the first place. That has created the expectation
that there should be something interesting for us to read here. But you can't use that expectation alone to assume that there
actually is anything interesting here, and I reckon that there isn't. Does anyone want a donut?
</div>
<p>
The second scientist is quite convinced by this, and even ready to go home, but now the third scientist is drawing the attention of
the other two to this paragraph. 'Look', he is saying... 
</p>
<div class = "quote">
Since this was written to become a self-fulfilling prophecy,
and that in itself has created the expectation that something interesting should be found here, and that's got us to come
to this secret location and read it, then indeed it can be said that in fact this is indeed a self-fulfilling prophecy. Perhaps 
the most perfect example of its kind. And we're the one's who've discovered it. I think that's very important. Our research grants
are safe. Donuts all round, I believe.
</div>
<p>
The other two scientists are beside themselves with joy. Dancing around the room in fact. I can tell you this, because, well,
I am actually the third scientist, and I wrote this myself.

<h2>Toby's new bicycle.</h2>

<p>
Little Toby lived in municipal flat block north, sector 3. Despite this, he loved mountain bikes. 
</p>
<p>
For months, he saved his pennies, until eventually he could buy a Sobo AX:200. 
When he got it home, however, his mother was less than pleased. She insisted that the bike
could not stay in the house. So Toby decided to hang it from the balcony instead.
</p>
<p>
The next day it rained and rained, and his bike was ruined.
</p>
<p>
Because of the rain, someone in the block on the other side of the street decided to
stay in and look out of the window. That's how he saw Toby's bike hanging from
the balcony.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, this guy was the owner of one of the most prestigious art galleries in the
whole city. He decided that the hanging bike represented the futility of freedom in a world filled with
rain. So he went around to Toby's flat and offered him a job as chief artist.
</p>
<p>
Toby turned up next day, at nine am, with his brush in his hand.
Or he would have done if he had been able to use his bike. In actual fact, he was over
an hour late. So he was sacked.

<h2>Noah's Lingering Leak. Day 14.</h2>

<p>
You know how it is with dogs. 
Once one of them starts barking, they all have to join in. It's like they've got this huge barking
network set up. Then they go quiet for about five seconds. Then one of them panics, because its quiet,
and they don't know what to do. So they start barking, and all the other's begin again. I wish they'd work
out that the whole exercise is idiotic and shut up for once. Then we might get some sleep.
</p>
<p>
Once the dogs get going, that sets off all the cats, which gets the birds going, which sets the earthworms off.
One earthworm, on its own, doesn't make a whole lot of noise, I'll grant you. But 15 million of them, all screaming at once,
 is kind of irritating. I never knew that fish had so much to shout about either. The ducks too, tend to be on the loud side. 
The wife once tried taping their beaks together, but they just starting humming, which was worse in the end.
</p>
<p>
At least the <a href = "http://www.rebsig.com/capybara/capy10.jpg">capybaras</a> are relatively quiet. Too quiet, in fact. The other night, I was stumbling about with my hands
over my ears, as usual, when I spotted a capybara lighting up a cigar. Now, I've made it clear to all the animals that
smoking is not allowed aboard the last remaining complete wooden structure on earth, so this behavior, from a capybabra no less,
was puzzling, until I discovered that a bunch of them were playing poker.
</p>
<p>
The stakes were high, and one of them was playing with marked cards. When the others found out, someone pulled a gun, and the 
shouting started. Things would have got nasty, if I hadn't stepped on the table. They were really mad at me for that, but I had
to do something. God hates poker. In the end, I remembered that Shem had brought a <a href = "http://www.miniclip.com/pacman.htm">Pacman</a> game, so I gave them that instead. Turns
out that capybaras love Pacman, which is great.

<h2>How To Make A Scandal</h2>

<p>
Some people believe in emotionless mediation. The best way to resolve a dispute is considered to be through
a reasoned dialog that incorporates all points of view. The resolution is brought about
when all parties agree to a proposal that involves some sacrifice and some gain for everyone involved.
After a tedious discussion, that can sometimes take years, everyone shakes hands and then they sign a piece of paper.
</p>
<p>
In Romania, there is a different approach to the whole problem of disputes, which saves a lot of time.
All you have to do is simply, 'make a scandal'. This basically means, at some point in the negotiation,
just blowing up and shouting as many insults as you can in the most dramatic way possible.
This results in a rapid catharsis for everyone involved. The problem may still remain, but it doesn't seem
nearly so bad as having a load of people shouting insults, so an accommodation is very quickly reached, in order
that everyone can go home and get some peace.
</p>
<p>
The only problem with this is that 'making a scandal' is quite tiring and sometimes no one can really
be bothered to step up to the plate and and shout the first insult. 
So, I propose to set up a new company, 'Scandals - R - Us'.
We will supply professional scandal makers, ready to jump into any dispute, and insist that all the parties involved 
are stupid and inadequate for various random reasons.
</p>
<p>
I am banking that the EU commission will be our next client. Next time there is a dispute about the running
of a petroleum refining company in the Constanza area, they can give us a call, and we'll send someone down
there to tell everyone that petroleum refining isn't a job for real men, and that all their sisters make terrible
rhubarb crumble. An accommodation will be reached shortly afterwards, with only superficial bruising.

<h2>Noah's Liquid Lunch. Day 13.</h2>

<p>
We remembered to bring the Xerox machine, but Shem forgot the toner cartridges. I could have killed him.
Now we can only copy things in an emergency.
</p>
<p>
I told the wife, and she said 'Copy what, exactly?' which is a good question in its way. So I invited everyone
on deck and asked them if anyone had suggestions for what we could photocopy.
</p>
<p>
Ham said we should copy instructions on how to stop going mad, and everyone laughed. Then the wife said 'ducks',
because if we lost a duck, then we could give the photocopy to God and he would be able to make a new one, and 
everyone laughed again. Of course, that set Japeth off, wanting to photocopy the elephants, 
but we told him that an elephant would
break the photocopier so he decided to draw a plan of one instead, using crayon.
</p>
<p>
I said that I would draw up an inventory of all the animals and make a copy of that for God to look over when we landed.
If I leave out the snub-nosed fungles, he'll never no the difference. We'll all get paid and everyone will be happy.
</p>
<p>
I downed a bottle of Vodka, just to get started. But after I wrote 'Number 1. The aardvark.' I got tired and fell asleep.
When I woke up, I found that there were hundreds of pages, all neatly typed with the sentence: 'All work and no play makes Noah a dull boy'.
Next to them was a single page with a drawing of an elephant on it, in crayon. I decided to lock myself in my cabin for the rest of the day.

<h2>Leonard Nimoy Tries to Buy a Book.</h2>

<p>
Stardate: Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
Since the birth of our baby son, things have been hectic around the house. 
Bottles and nappies everywhere. My wife finally announced:
</p>
<div class = "quote">
'We need to do this right. Our child deserves to be brought up with expert care.
So I think we should buy a book - or rather, you should buy a book...'.
</div>
<div class = "quote">
'Oh yes ... and what book would that be ... exactly?'.
</div>
<div class = "quote">
'Dr. Spock's book of child care. Look, I know it might be awkward for you, 
but I have all of these clothes to iron and the new cradle is being delivered this morning, 
so I would really appreciate it if you would head down to the bookshop and buy it.
You could always wear your disguise...'
</div>
<div class = "quote">
'No... no... no... that's alright, dearest..'
</div>
<p>
I said, calmly, 
</p>
<div class = "quote">
'I can manage a simple trip to the bookship these days.
The old times are behind me now. No more madness. 
I hear they even offer to warp the books up for free these days. 
I should have no trouble.'
</div>
<p>
I took the Volkswagen Beetle. It was a pleasant enough day and the streets were relatively free of traffic.
When I got to the bookship, I found a parking space and inserted my car. 
The walk to the shop was reasonably short, an acceptable corollary of my parking the car
not so far away from it.
</p>
<p>
Once inside the shop, a routine scan told me that there were a large number of
life forms inside with me, all shuffling about, watching, wondering: 'Is it him, is it really him?'. 
All hiding behind the shelves, pretending to read. That's what they always do, you know,
they pretend to read.
</p>
<p>
So you can understand now why I ran as fast as possible from the door to the 'Psychology, Self-Help, Sexuality and General Accounting' 
section. I scanned the shelves, but there were books every where, and my vision was blurry. Someone grabbed my arm, but I pushed them away.
Then I saw it, between 'Indo-Chinese Monetary Policy' by Milton Freedman, 
'Am I Mad? Find out in 20 Questions' by Dr. Ruth Westheimer:
'Dr. Spock's book of everyday baby care'. It had a big delirious baby on the front, with a glowing question mark over its head.
I grabbed it, slipped it under my coat and made a dash for the cash desk.
</p>
<p>
There I was confronted by an old lady and a young lady. They were both looking at me funny.
I knew that they could see. They could tell. So I decided to just go for it. I slapped the book down with a bang and said:
</p>
<div class = "quote">
'This is Dr. Spock's Book of Child Care. I'm Spock too. 
Ironic, isn't it? Well, lets just get this over as fast as possible and let me get out of 
here. So, please, just warp it up for me 
and I shall depart from this bookship in peace. Live long, and prosper.'
</div>
<p>
I think it was at this point that the older woman fell off her chair. 
Though that might have happened after the young woman set off all the alarms. 
I wish she hadn't done that. They sounded just like the alarms on the Enterprise, 
and so of course, force of habit, I shouted:
</p>
<div class = "quote"> 
'Shields up, warp factor nine' 
</div>
<p>
..and threw myself down on the floor in front of the cash desk. 
That's where security found me. They looked down at me, and shook their heads sadly. I waited until they threw me into the logical street and then drove home.
</p>
<p> 
My wife had made a nice shepherd's pie. It was nice and soft anyway. 
So when she hurled it at me there was only superficial bruising. 
I scraped the remainder from the carpet and placed it in a box, which I took to the garden. I ate it there, and then I slept in the box.
