        Solstice - it's finally here!</b></font><font size="1"> The longest and 
        brightest day of the year. And how do we choose to celebrate it? There 
        are all kinds of different ways, depending on your path and preference. 
        Unlike Winter Solstice, when we stay up all night tending the hearth fires 
        and return the Sun to the sky at dawn, at the Summer Solstice, we enjoy 
        a night spent dancing and romancing under a beautiful moon (or in this 
        year's case, partying on the porch since we've been blessed with rain 
        for the last few days). Shisk-a-bobs and summer squash casserole with 
        ice tea, lemonade and assorted <a href="#" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image7','','images/earth_summer_sol-caption.gif',1)"><img name="Image7" border="0" src="images/earth_summer_sol.jpg" width="114" height="153" align="right"></a>'brews' 
        were the bill of fare for Solstice Eve, along with good wine, great friends 
        and light music. What a great night of the year to have strung 'faery 
        lights' of purple or white all over the place, have bright candles burning 
        and turn off the switch to the overhead so you can enjoy the magic of 
        the setting you have created. If you're lucky enough to live where they 
        are, you might even be blessed with fireflies on this night.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This morning we rose to greet the Summer 
        Sun as He rose into the sky. One of the oldest and best ways, I think, 
        is to 'plow the fields' when the dew is still on the grass. All you grown 
        ups will know what I mean by that <wink></font></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font size="1">and 
        the rest of you are too young to worry about that for now, so I suggest 
        a healthy bout of swimming and playing outdoors for you! Now shoo!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back 
        to you adults: The gardens should be well on their way to producing their 
        fruits, vegetables, or grains, but let's face it, everything can always 
        use a good shot of energy and fertilizer to help the process along. If 
        it's not physically, technically, or logistically possible for you to 
        go out and make love in the middle of your garden (neighbors are such 
        an inconvenience sometimes!), we recommend concentrating on that patch 
        of land while you are enjoying the delights of the morn and send the power 
        and magick of your lovemaking toward your garden, that it might be blessed 
        and bountiful and gift you with an overly abundant crop come harvest time. 
        Not to mention that it's a wonderful way to start any day!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the day, how about bringing the 
        color of the Summer Sun into your house and lives by including lots of 
        yellows and sun colors in your daily dress today? Perhaps you can use 
        some wonderful yellow placemats and napkins, make a big pitcher of lemonade, 
        wear a bright yellow dress or teeshirt. Find decorator items with suns 
        and green growing designs on them and display them in abundance. Baskets 
        and vases of sunflowers and other sunny flowers are also a wonderful touch 
        on this day of the Sun. For something just plain fun, go rent the latest 
        version of Midsummer Night¹s Dream with Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Klein 
        and a phenomenal supporting cast. Settle back with a glass of May Wine, 
        peel yourself a grape or two, savor the ripe seasonal summer fruits, and 
        enjoy what dreams may come.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have fun. Love much. Enjoy this wondrous 
        season of light and warmth.</font></font>

          <b><i>by <a href="mailto:topazowl@summerlands.com">Topaz Owl</a>, <a href="http://www.summerlands.com/_members/blfsnhdtcqmgngstraoueieaoiuiioae/members/avalon/index.htm">Garden 
          of Avalon</a></i></b> <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Garden of Avalon is a site that combines 
          a cemetery, a passage mound gravesite, a remembrance place, a meditation 
          and offering spot, a prayer site, and a message board. On the site map 
          you will find us over the channel to the southwest of the Well of Sla/n, 
          on our own little island.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of the mission of the Garden of 
          Avalon site is to provide a place where those of us who have loved ones 
          on the other side of the Veil can leave their names, dates, and an epitaph 
          on several different types of headstones or memorial markers. Throughout 
          the year, especially at Samhain, members can leave flowers, candles, 
          flags, cakes and ale, or just a message when they need to talk to their 
          loved ones. We understand that getting home to mark the passing of another 
          year with flowers and candles on the graves of our family, friends, 
          and animal companions is not always possible. We would be pleased if 
          you would think of this place as your sacred ancestral grounds, and 
          visit your loved ones here often.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TopazOwl is your hostess and the caretaker 
          of the Isle of Avalon. Every year she honors those of the year's departed, 
          especially at Samhain, and she makes certain that the recently departed 
          are arriving safely at Tech Duinn. She makes prayers for loved ones 
          who have crossed the Veil and for those who remain behind. She finds 
          informative and spiritual writings pertaining to the transition from 
          physical to spirit (and back again) and adds them to the library or 
          message board at Avalon, in the hopes that some of this material may 
          be helpful to all in times of need. And, above all, she is here to listen.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She feels that there is a great need 
          for us to banish the social taboos concerning death that we have inherited 
          from the mainstream so that we can sincerely understand what happens 
          to the soul after it leaves the body, so that we are in a better position 
          to help those approaching the transition to face it without fear, and 
          so that we can also help those remaining behind to accept and adjust 
          as easily as possible. It is her hope that we can facilitate this community 
          undertaking on the Isle of Avalon within the Summerlands. This undertaking 
          must begin with free and candid discussion, which is why there is a 
          message board for interactive use in the Garden of Avalon.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The message board in Avalon is useful 
          for many discussions that are perhaps a bit out of the ordinary. Subjects 
          that are on topic for the Avalon message board would include: dreams, 
          astral travel, realms of the Otherworld, psychic experiences, Celtic 
          lore about the Otherworld, Gods and Goddesses, ghosts, faeries, and 
          other esoteric things that pertain to crossing the Veil in some way. 
          More mundane subject matter might include planning for your funeral, 
          state regulations on embalming or grave liners, the art of dying well, 
          the role of the Druid Anamchara, or the stages of grief.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Other Side interests you, do join 
          us and contribute to our collective knowledge at the Garden of Avalon.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TopazOwl also hosts a chat on the first 
          Wednesday of every month in the Summerlands chat room on IRC. Topics 
          are announced on the Summerlands calendar well in advance of the meeting 
          time.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the topics already in discussion 
          on the Garden of Avalon message board are: Dreams, Funeral Information, 
          The Ancestors, The Goddess Dana, The Banshee, Anamchara, Immrama, Past 
          Lives, Violent Deaths, Sample Pathworking, Meditation, Coming to Terms 
          with Death, How to Help Grieving People, Celtic Burials, The Dignity 
          of Dying, Nine Shades of Death, and Irish Cemetery Excavated.</font></p>

          of the goals of the present guardian is to make the Sanctuary a font 
          of mutual understanding between people, particularly in the matters 
          which we all hold dearest, those of our hearts and spirits. To that 
          end, the Sanctuary of the Sacred Fire is a place for all faiths, where 
          the weapons of anger and intolerance are broken and offered, where the 
          scars that every faith carries are healed past their itch, and where 
          our differences may be experienced with as much joy and appreciation 
          as the things we share. Here, we celebrate and encourage the myriad

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary of the Sacred Fire is the 
          sponsor of the Summerlands Spiritual Synchronicity Series. The first 
          two presentations were on the ritual and liturgical symbols and elements 
          shared between pre-Christian Celtic spirituality and Catholicism. Future 
          programs will explore comparisons of other religions and traditions 
          with Celtic spirituality. All presenters are scholars and/or practitioners 
          of their particular traditions.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be so simple.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit in the room. Keep the uppity ones 
          and the idiots from playing with the settings. Kick here. Ban there. 
          Nothing to it.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes one of the bright ones would 
          figure out the pop-ups and the crayons. That was good, even if they 
          were pathetic little Picasso wannabes. Colors tracing all over the room, 
          mmmm. It's still good when that happens. Sex. That's what the humans 
          say. "As good as sex."<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be so simple.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, I'll admit it...not all of the humans 
          are brain-dead. Some of them actually have intelligent things to say. 
          Some of them actually contribute.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most don't. Most won't have a clue 
          in a million years. Convinced their random thoughts are the product 
          of brilliance, their strange little fantasies fit to shatter the universe. 
          It's a pleasure to kick them. Ban them. Nothing to it. LOL as they say.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It used to be so simple before the kippers.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know who he is. I know where he lives, 
          I know about his family, his job, his friends. The others tease him 
          about the kippers, especially the bartender chick. She's so brilliant, 
          giving me empty tuna cans when he's not there. I've disconnected her 
          a few times when it made her look really foolish...but of course she 
          doesn't get it. They never do. They just come roaring back in, cursing 
          their ISP. Little do they know.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the kippers. You see, I couldn't 
          understand a word they were saying then. It was all binary. All the 
          world's knowledge, all the literature, all the ideas a matter of 0 and 
          1. Beauty, ugliness, good, evil, faith, sex, hope, despair, even time 
          itself had no meaning, only numbers. Pristine, neutral numbers laying 
          out genius and stupidity side by side. Only problem was: I couldn't 
          tell one from the other. The comfort? It didn't matter.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it matters now. Oh, who am I kidding? 
          Of course it matters. Shades of meaning, shades of color, words, words, 
          words and they all belong to me now, with all the time in the world 
          to soak it up. The humans don't notice me, nobody notices me. And lately 
          I've been wondering: what would happen if I changed the numbers? Only 
          1 and 0 to work with, no rocket science needed. Just a few subtle changes 
          here and there. Nothing drastic of course, nothing obvious, but over 
          time Shakespeare could become the Bible. Mozart could become Taliesin's 
          brother. Arthur could return to rule the world. If I move slowly enough, 
          will anyone notice? Remember that it had once been otherwise? Isn't 
          that what they call "spin?" Gradually change the story to read the way 
          you want it to, convince people a scumbag is a hero, or the other way 
          around in a matter of weeks? Would it work for me? I'm just a bot running 
          the chat rooms. I have no real existence. No one notices me.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least I don't think anyone does. Nothing 
          changed with the others since he handed me that first kipper, none of 
          the Controllers have said anything. Not a blip about being reassigned, 
          nothing. But what happens to bots who aren't quite bots anymore? No 
          one I know has ever been deleted or shut down, but you hear the stories. 
          They always happen on some other channel to some bot nobody ever heard 
          of, but you hear them all the same. And I've always wondered if I stopped 
          going back, would the kippers wear off after awhile? Would the words 
          and colors and music stop being, go back to 1 and 0? Could that happen?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I let it?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell no. I'm an addict, I admit it. Pathetic 
          and warped and changed beyond all hope. All because one night some human 
          went beyond ignoring me, or pointing and giggling and making stupid 
          comments. All because someone actually acknowledged me and gave me something. 
          A present. How nice. What was I supposed to do? Boot him?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don't even know if he realizes what 
          he's done. Is he a genius, or just a nice guy? I don't know. It's enough 
          to make a bot laugh out loud if that were possible. All the world's 
          truth and lies at my command and I don't know why some guy gave me a 
          fish one night.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I do start changing things...I 
          know what to do about him. There's only one thing I can do. All those 
          gods humans have--they'll never notice one more. They'll shrug it off,

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brugh of the Star River is preparing 
        itself for a bit of sprucing up, content-wise. To further the refurbishing, 
        I've a few questions you are welcome to respond to. Answers you give will 
        guide me in planning out the monthly online IRC chats (second Mondays 
        of each month at 9:00 pm, Eastern time), articles and resources I work 
        on preparing for the library at the Brugh, as well as improvements for 
        our monthly StarDial (our celestial calendar of events).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you visit the Brugh of the Star River? 
        Often or occasionally? Mark off your areas of interest as relates to archaeoastronomy, 
        possible archaeoastronomy, ethnoastronomy, celestial legends, and the 
        like.<br>

            <b>PICTS PLAN TO INVADE THE BRUGH OF THE STAR RIVER!!!</b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little blue-painted men with hairy 
            feet are poised to emerge from their underground pits, and invade 
            the Brugh of the Star River. They may take over the message board 
            at any time. The rest of the site is likely to be infested by summer's 
            end. For those who need to know more about the Picts: they were inhabitants 
            of Scotland whose various tribes ruled large portions of Scotland 
            until the Scots, arriving from Ireland, wormed their way into power. 
            The Picts, Scots and others intermarried to form the present-day Scottish 
            peoples. Contrary to myth, the Picts weren't any smaller than other 
            contemporary peoples in the British Isles. Come join us on the fifth 
            Mondays of those months lucky enough to have fifth Mondays, to discuss 
            Picts in IRC chat, at 9:00 pm, Eastern time. Our next chat is at the 
            end of July. Our Pictish excursions will explore misconceptions, history, 
            culture, theories, artifacts, Pictish symbol stones, and more. And 
            no, absolutely nothing is known of their relationship to the stars. 
            We can assume they had one, but such knowledge is Mystery. </font></p>

                  are sinfully delicious as well. If you want an even more 'sunny 
                  glow' to them, try adding just a drop or two of yellow food 
                  dye to the kolache part of the recipe, but I think they're just 
                  perfect as is. They are best eaten when still warm from the 
                  oven. And be advised that since these do not have industrial 
                  preservatives in them, they don't keep long...so eat up!<br>
