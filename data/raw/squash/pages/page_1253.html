leisure activity in America. Over 34 million people grow
vegetables each year. Gardening on the high plains presents some
unique problems for the home gardener. For this reason, the
Vegetable Demonstration Garden was established to allow students
and members of the community to observe how various crops perform
in this environment. Each crop is labeled for easy
identification.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><img src="../images/veggies/melon2.jpg" align="left" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="200" height="152"></font><font size="4">Cool season crops such as
lettuce, carrots, and broccoli may be direct seeded in the early
spring. Warm season crops such as squash, peppers, and tomatoes
may be direct seeded after the danger of frost has past, usually
April 15 in the Lubbock area. For an early start, many crops such
as cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, and tomatoes may be started
indoors and then transplanted into the garden in late April.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A good garden site should be free of shade and
have a loose soil which drains properly. The addition of organic
materials and fertilizers is also helpful. Mulches are popular as
they retain soil moisture and inhibit weed growth. <img src="../images/veggies/kohlrabi.jpg" align="top" border="1" hspace="5" vspace="2" width="150" height="116"></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Vegetable gardens can range from standard rows
to elaborate bed designs, each of these may have containers or
trellises with in them. No matter what style is chosen, it is
important that the garden be in full sun and the vegetables be
place so they do not shade one another.</font></p>
