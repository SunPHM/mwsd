A well-organized vegetable show can be a valuable educational experience both for exhibitors and for the general public.<p>

The competition for awards motivates exhibitors to sharpen their horticultural skills.  Since the object is to bring vegetables to their prime quality at show time, successful showmanship requires that exhibitors apply knowledge of culture and postharvest handling.  Exhibitors learn the standards of high quality vegetables from the judges' critical evaluations of their exhibits.<p>

At a vegetable show, the general public is able to see vegetables of the highest quality and freshness.  This encourages them to buy only high quality vegetables.  Also, the diversity of vegetables on display motivates people to buy or grow vegetables they haven't eaten before.  Increased utilization of vegetables benefits our nutritional level as well as the Texas vegetable industry.<P>

<a name="organization"><font size=+1><b>Show Organization</b></font><p>

A vegetable show can be presented by itself or as part of a fair.  Start to recruit a show committee of interested persons well ahead of the anticipated show date.  The number of people needed will depend on the number of exhibits and activities you expect to have.  A chairman, secretary, treasurer and several directors to raise funds and make arrangements comprise an adequate sized committee for a show.  Add people as the work load increases.  It is wise to involve vo-ag teachers, commercial growers, shippers, home gardeners, and Extension specialists.  Try to include both urban and rural people in the planning to make it truly a community effort.<p>

The show committee is responsible for:  writing the rules and regulations;  establishing entry classes;  raising funds to operate the show;  preparing a premium book;  coordinating and setting up the contest;  selecting the show location;  conducting a promotion and advertising program;  procuring show judges and briefing the judges.  In addition to advance planning, the show committee handles all the details of operation on the day of the show.  This includes setting up tables, coordinating workers, recording entries, helping judges, recording placings and presenting awards.<p>

<a name="activities"><font size=+1><b>Show Activities</b></font><p>

Many types of activities can be included in a vegetable show.  In addition to the usual competition between entries of individual vegetables there are:  mass displays by individuals or clubs;  and booths of educational exhibits about vegetable culture, marketing, use and preservation. Impressive displays can be made by assembling large quantities of different types of vegetables in a setting with a cornucopia, or by creating a massive design on a large, inclined platform.<p>

A vegetable judging contest will train young people to become critical judges of quality and to recognize grade defects and causes of defects in vegetables.  The National Junior Horticulture Association of America sponsors a national convention every year where state delegates compete in judging and method demonstration contests.  Information on this program can be obtained from your Extension vegetable specialists or from Dr. J. Lee Taylor, Chairman of the National Junior Horticulture Foundation, Department of Horticulture, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, 48823.<p>

Consider having a vegetable king and/or queen contest.  Vegetable industry leaders may enthusiastically support this type of activity because it promotes the use of vegetables to the public.  Competition can be based on outstanding performance in show competition, garden projects or other activities.  The All Valley Winter Vegetable Show has a queen contest which draws considerable public attention to the show.<p>

<a name="quality"><font size=+1><b>Quality Specifications for Vegetables</b></font><p>

Many carefully cultured vegetables fail to win top honors because of improper handling and trimming in preparation for the show.  Exhibitors can assure themselves a far better chance of receiving high awards for their entries by carefully reading and following the size and quality requirements for each kind of vegetable they intend to enter in the show.

The different kinds or species of vegetables are denoted by names such as carrot, cabbage or tomato.  Within each kind of vegetable there are many distinct varieties.  For example,  several tomato varieties are Spring Giant, Chico III and Presto.  These tomato varieties differ in fruit size, shape, flavor, plant type, days to maturity, disease resistance and climatic requirement.  Therefore, it is very important for the exhibitor, the judges and the people who come to see the show know the different kinds and varieties of vegetables on display.  The kind and variety of vegetable should be written on each entry card.<p>

Certain characteristics are common to all blue ribbon winners.  The entry must be what it claims to be;  that is, it must be "true to type."  All specimens in an entry must be uniform in size, shape, color and maturity.  All specimens must be trimmed alike.  Champion vegetables are always at prime eating quality --never too old or too young, never too tough or too soft, never scratched or bruised.  Freedom from insect and disease damage is important, as is freedom from drought and nutrient deficiency injury.<p>

Show vegetables must be scrupulously clean without having a scrubbed appearance.  Leafy vegetables (lettuce, cabbage and spinach) should be briefly soaked and gently sprayed with water, then stored in a cool, damp place for the short period until show time. Fruiting 

<img align=right src="show.jpeg" hspace=5 vspace=5>

vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and beans) should be rubbed lightly with a soft cloth as they are rinsed under a gentle stream of water, then carefully dried and stored in a dry, cool place until show time.  Root crops should be soaked for several minutes immediately after harvest, and then rubbed gently with a soft cloth under running water to remove soil.  Never scrub or brush vegetables intended for a show.<p>

Vegetables are best displayed on large, white, paper plates with exhibitor's card clearly showing the kind and variety of the vegetable, in addition to the show class.  The exhibitor's name and number can be on the same side of the card, but must be on the half that is folded away from the judge's view.  The judge and public must not see the name or number of the exhibitor until after the judging is completed.  This is a strict requirement of proper vegetable showmanship.<p>

The vegetable show is an exciting educational activity for rural and urban people of all ages who are interested in gardening.  The show heightens their interest and fosters greater rapport between producers and consumers of vegetables.  New interest is generated by an intensive publicity effort prior to the show.<p>
