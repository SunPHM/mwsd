<img src="markpatrick2.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Hoosier Millionaire:  </b>On Saturday night's show, Scott Louden of Jeffersonville, In. defeated Sue Meredith of Indianapolis $19,000-$15,000 at the end of the main game playoff.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;By winning, Louden was offered a guaranteed $200,000 instead of the $100,000 that had been guaranteed since <b>HM</b>  returned to its classic format earlier this year.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Louden took the $200,000 and finished with $219,000. In last weekend's show, Patricia Sells of Martinsville, Ind. won $164,000, finding the $150,000 space in the Millionaire Round and stopping there.<br><br> 

<center><b>FRIDAY, NOV. 8</b></center><br>

<img src="coll11-7-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Millionaire:  </b>Jim Coll ended as one of the show's top two winners of the week, when he struck gold with the Hal March Jackpot of $64,000.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He went to a 50/50 to determine the egg-laying mammal also known as the spiny anteater is an echidna to win his $64K.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;At $125,000, he waved off a question asking what the Asian dumpling won ton means in Chinese (cloud, swallow).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Returning player Paula Rice went for $32,000 but, out of Lifelines, opted to take her $16,000.  Her $32K question: the word "chortle," a combination of the words "chuckie" and "snort," was coined by what writer?  Correct answer: Lewis Carroll.<br>
<img src="williams11-7-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;Scott Williams missed on the $4,000 question when he thought the geometry term where one line starts at one point and continues in one direction was tangent, but the correct answer is ray.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Williams sank back to $1,000.<br><br>

<img src="bartbarrett11-8-02a.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Pyramid:  </b>Dr. Bart Barrett, a family physician, was down to his final two seconds in the Winners' Circle when he blurted out, "Things You Fight For!"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Barrett erupted as he became the third $25,000 winner in a week and sixth qualifier for the $100,000 Tournament of Champions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The game has now had 35 successful trips up the pyramid in only eight weeks on the air.  Barrett won his first $10,000 with actress Elise Neal and added the extra $15,000 with Scott Lowell.<br><br>

<img src="matthewtemple11-8-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Jeopardy!:  </b>Two-time champion Brad Bean and Matthew Temple were in a dead heat going into Final Jeopardy!, separated by $2,400.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The category:  State Capitals.  Answer:  in the continental U.S., this city is the southernmost state capital. Correct response:  what is Austin, Texas?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone questioned:  what is Baton Rouge?  So, everything was left to the wagering.  Beam fell from $11,200 to $2,400.  Temple risked $8,801 but held on to win the title with $4,799.  Beam's three-day total:  $27,200.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beginning Monday, the college tournament from Ohio State University.  In two weeks, the game returns to L.A. with a new set.<br><br>

<img src="richardwilliams11-8-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Win Ben Stein's Money:  </b>If only Richard Williams could have known his Tom Wolfe novels, he would have joined the elite of Steinbusters.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Richard ended up tying Ben 6-6.  He knew the Allies invaded on Sicily in July 1943.  He also knew American lawyer William Barkley Masterson was better known as Bat Masterson.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Rich had ten full seconds on his last question to name the Tom Wolfe novel featuring a bond trader named Sherman McCoy.  He just could not pull up "Bonfires of the Vanities."  Still, he took home $2,350 for his deadlock.<br><br>

<img src="chad11-8-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Weakest Link:  </b>In the opener, contestant Chad scored the only point in the playoff round to defeat his opponent Jim.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim missed a chance to force sudden death when he did not know the TV series <b>Promised Land</b> was a spinoff of <b>Touched by an Angel</b>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;However, in the nightcap, the big payoffs continue.  Champion Mark edged opponent Kelly 3-2 to win $32,250.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Mark sewed up his purse when he knew the sport created as a hybrid of handball and squash is racquetball.<br><br>

<img src="ryanchris11-8-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Friend or Foe?:  </b>Somehow, you had the idea this was going to end in a doublecross.  Ryan and Chris had overcome a few stumbles and still managed to put together $4,000 into their final Trust Box.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan just had the look of someone who was going to lose whatever halo he had.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He went "foe" and took the entire $4,000 when Chris went "friend."  In the two preliminary games, all four players chose to go "foe," saving the producers a tidy sum in the budget.<br><br>
<img src="stefsewell11-8-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Russian Roulette:  </b>Stef Sewell did the right thing to pass to Steve Decastro on the last answer because whether he got it right or wrong, game time expired and he was forced to drop and forfeit his $250 to Stef.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;That gave her a total of $2,250 and a chance to win more in the bonus round. Stef had five correct, until she chose a wrong answer when she said Michelin has a restauarant guide and not Firestone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Her night's work was still not unprofitable.  Stef dropped out winning $3,750.<br><br> 

&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ALSO FRIDAY:  </b>On <b>Family Feud</b>, the Wilsons became the show's new champions by  beating the Kim family.  However, they hit three goose eggs in Fast Money, only managing 111 points and a total of $555.  This has been a good budget week for the producers....In Seattle, Cloretta Jones missed A BRIDGE in the bonus puzzle and had to settle for $7,700 on <b>Wheel of Fortune</b>.  She missed out on an extra $25,000.<br><br>

<center><b>THURSDAY, NOV. 7</b></center><br>

<img src="h2players.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>H²:  </b>Erin Lander win her third straight victory and another shutout to Juan Tomentez.  Of course, Juan is guaranteed $500 but Erin swept to $4,000 and the Secret Square.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the 30-second round, Erin only scored three correct answers about the celebrities, giving her a 1-in-6 chance at opening the safe containing the cash.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She found the key and opened the safe with $25,000 inside.  Her husband flew onto the set and did a money angel on the floor.  Her three-day total is now $74,597.<br><br>  

<img src="darronsmith11-7-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Russian Roulette:  </b>Darron Smith made it to the bonus round, winning $1,650.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Darron appeared to be on a roll when he knew a concierge helps with theatre tickets and dinner reservations; Colgate University is in Hamilton, NY; and "Into the Woods" is a Stephen Sondheim musical.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;However, he missed the question asking him what kind of machine takes x-rays (flouroscope), so he dropped with five correct answers for a total of $3,150.<br><br>

<img src="deliacaracappa11-7-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Millionaire:  </b>Delia Caracappa opened the day in the hotseat and went to the phone at $16,000.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;She called friend Kathy to ask which author wrote the trilogy of spy thrillers which features agent Jason Bourne as the hero.  Kathy was certain of Robert Ludlum as the answer and she was correct.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;After nailing her $32,000 question, she went to the 50/50 at $64,000 but thought the Yankee player who wore the now-retired number 3 was Lou Gehrig.   Number 3 was the Bambino, Babe Ruth.  Gehrig was number 4.  So, Delia left with $32K.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Paula Rice returns Friday for a shot at $32,000, out of Lifelines.  At $16,000, she asked the audience for help to identify an "ollie" as a maneuver commonly performed in the sport of skateboarding.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;She had used up two other Lifelines at $1,000 on a question asking what the "C" in CGI means.  After going to the phone and the 50/50, she correctly settled on computer.<br><br>

<img src="bradbean11-7-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Jeopardy!:  </b>Andy Morris led defending champion Brad Bean, as he had much of the way during Thursday's game, but could not hold on with a Final Jeopardy! answer on the category of Historic Books.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The answer:  published in 1611, the Pilgrims in 1620 refused to bring it to America; they brought the Geneva version.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bean questioned:  what is the King James Version of the Bible?  That sent Bean from $10,400 to a leading $14,400.  Morris, however, went for the Gutenberg Bible and fell from $14,200 to $7,500, returning the title to Bean with a two-day total of $25,200.<br><br>

<img src="audrey11-7-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Weakest Link:  </b>Despite no money being banked in the third and fourth rounds, Audrey defeated challenger Erik 2-0 to win $26,500.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Audrey sewed up the game on her last question, which involved the American Cancer Society.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the day's opener in double-run markets, champion Mario knocked off opponent Donna in sudden death to win $6,750.  Mario's winner came when he knew Tom and Jerry were the cat and mouse team created by Joe Hanna and William Barbera.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Donna missed a chance to stay in the game when she did not know Dartmouth is the only college in New Hampshire in the Ivy League without the word University in its name.<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ALSO THURSDAY:  </b>Jeremy Humrick earned $13,000 in the main game on <b>Wheel of Fortune</b> but could not add another $25,000 when he ran out of time on ROUGHING IT in the bonus round....<b>Pyramid</b> saw Stephanie Woods make the 34th successful trip to the top for $10,000....On <b>Friend or Foe?</b>, smiling contestants Michelle and Natasha both went "friend" and split $5,500 from the final Trust Box....Susannah Moore won a spa/living room Showcase valued at $18,054 on <b>The Price Is Right</b>....On <b>Beat the Clock</b>, Gary and Jean Pollack took home $6,559 in winnings, including $2,350 in cash and a trip to Hawaii....After posting 128 points in the first half of Fast Money, sister Sandra hit two goose eggs on <b>Family Feud</b> and the family ended winning only $740.  However, their two-day total stands at $20,740.<br><br>

<center><b>WEDNESDAY, NOV. 6</b></center><br>

<img src="lovell11-6-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Weakest Link:  </b>At long last, more players are getting the hang of building the pot in the syndicated game.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the nightcap, Lovell (who said he came to L.A. with $20 in his pocket) was happy Angela opted to go second, as he left with an added $33,500 won in sudden death.  Of course, the entire team ousted Christina, who was responsible for banking them $26,000.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lovell knew the equestrian game played in "The Great Gatsby" with mallets was polo to win the jackpot.  Angela missed on the question, in food:   what name for a cakepan was a trademark of the Norder Ware Company?  Correct answer was Bunt.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the opener, Maureen beat Vernon in sudden death to win $9,000. Vernon blew the game when he did not know "On the Isle" and "At this Theater" are regular features in "Playbill."  Maureen knew a ship called "The Bounty" went to Packadine Island in 1790 to win.<br><br> 
<img src="jameskeenan11-6-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Wheel of Fortune (Seattle):  </b>The big money just keeps on rolling.  Wednesday night, the Pacific Northwest trip produced a winner in a big guy, James Keenan Jr.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He solved the final round puzzle to score the victory and went to the bonus round after winning $17,500.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The letter "I" was the only one added in the Thing bonus puzzle but it was helpful enough for him to identify SKI JUMP.  James wins Charlie O's 25-THOUUUUUUUUUUSAND DOLLARS for a final total of $42,500.<br><br> 

<img src="bradbean11-6-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Jeopardy!:  </b>Brad Bean (sadly, not TVgameshows.net correspondent Brad Beam) had the lead but defending champion Sandra Alboum was breathing down his neck going into Final Jeopardy!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The category:  Authors.  Answer:  in September 1941, this author christened the warship Atlanta, also known as "The Mighty A."  Correct response:  who was Margaret Mitchell?<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;However, neither Sandra nor Brad had the correct response but Bean's wager was more conservative and he wrested the title with $10,800.  Alboum leaves with $33,200.<br><br>
<img src="charo.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>H²:  </b>Despite not getting a lot of help from Charo, Erin Landers won $2,000 to defeat Franco Finn and earned seven correct celebrity answers in the bonus game.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;This time, she found the hot key and started the new Mercedes C-Coupe to win it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Her two-day total is now $41,150 and she returns Thursday to try for another $25,000 cash.  Next week's Center Square will be Alec Baldwin.<br><br> 

<img src="golder11-5-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Millionaire:  </b>A Wednesday of two $16,000 winners saw Scott Golder use up his Lifelines on the $8,000 question.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He had to call his father to ask the first and middle names of "Hawkeye" Pierce on <b>M*A*S*H</b> (Benjamin Franklin).<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;After winning his $16K, he waved off the $32,000 question:  the children's novel "Anne of Green Gables" is set on what North American island?  Correct answer: P.E.I.<br>
<img src="dangarin11-6-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next up, UPS supervior Dan Garin, who has driven The Big Brown Truck, earned his $16,000 on a question about jazz great Billie Holliday.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He called friend Bruce for help in answering gardenias as the type of flowers Holliday was noted for wearing in her hair.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Garin backed out on the $32,000 question:  lemurs can be found in the wild in which country?  Correct answer:  Madagascar.<br><br>
<img src="karn10-30-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Family Feud:  </b>The Wolf family could only manage two victories as their opponents, the Kims, swept the final board in the game to make them the new champs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Kim family also managed to conquer over 200 points in Fast Money, to end up with the $20,000 grand jackpot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Wolf clan could never go over the top in the bonus round and left with $1,650.<br><br>

<img src="hollisdougherty11-6-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Russian Roulette:  </b>Hollis Dougherty scored her last question correct to secure her win as time expired, givng her a total of $2,900.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In 60-Second Roulette, she knew one most likely finds double indemnity in an insurance policy.  However, she said Hoosiers are from Illinois, rather than Indiana, which sent her flying downward.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her five correct answers in the bonus round gave her another $1,500 for a final total of $4,400.<br><br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ALSO WEDNESDAY:  </b>Kat Websler fell to victim to some illegal clues and ended with $1,800 in two trips to the Winners' Circle on <b>Pyramid</b>....On Wednesday's <b>Price Is Right</b>, Marian Melton won herself a snowmobile and a bedroom in her Showcase as well as $1,000 on the wheel.  Her final total came to $18,919....On <b>Friend or Foe?</b>, John (a judge) and Stephanie both went "foe" and cost themselves the entire $6,500 they had won in the regular game.<br><br>

<center><b>TUESDAY, NOV. 5</b></center><br>

<img src="squaresset02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>H²:  </b>John Papapavlos's luck ended so suddenly, as he missed an opportunity for a tie game by missing a question on the creater of Harry Potter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;That gave the victory to Erin Lander, who won the first two games and hung on to earn $3,500 and a chance to win a Mercedes Benz C-Coupe worth $30,650.  In the bonus
round, Erin nailed five celebrities correct, giving her a 1 in 4 chance at picking the
correct key to start the car.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;However, she did not find the hot key.  She did win $5,000 for a total of $8,500.  Papapavlos's winnings of $111,443 could still put him in the Tournament of Champions.<br><br>

<img src="geogray4.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Weakest Link:  </b>After a record smashing $53,000 Monday, a new group came within $2,050 of the new standard Tuesday.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A total of $25,000 was banked in the first two rounds. Champion Grace defeated Bob 3-2 to win $50,500.  She sewed up the jackpot when she knew LeAnn Rimes was the country singer who recorded seven albums before the age of 20.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the opener, Gerard beat out Derrick 2-1 to win the cash pot of $5,000. Gerard won the cash by knowing corn is the ingredient that requires the majority grain to make bourbon.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Contestant Lauren said she wish she had voted off Gerard when she had the chance.  A panic bank kept the team from $25,000 in the first round.<br><br>

<img src="jerrygreen11-5-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Millionaire:  </b>Jerry Green, who is a postman, scaled the first two tiers and ended up with the Hal March Jackpot of $64,000.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;His $64,000 question was:  motorized three-wheeled taxis called "tuk-tuks"
are popular with tourists in which of these capital cities?  His answer of Bangkok earned him the money.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;At $125,000, he passed on answering which author's novels were published anonymously under the credit "by a lady."  Correct answer:  Jane Austen.<br>
<img src="golder11-5-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;Scott Golder from Harvard University hit the hotseat next.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;On the $300 question, Scott had to ask the audience to settle on Cuba as the country from which Cohiba cigars come.<br>
He returns Wednesday to go for a $2,000 question with his 50/50 and a phone Lifeline remaining.<br><br>

<img src="wheel2.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Wheel of Fortune (Seattle):  </b>Tell all your Seattle SuperSonic fans.  Leah Fatheringham will be at an upcoming SuperSonics game with 19 of her friends in a luxury box suite and meeting with the team mascot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Leah won also a gift tag and cash totaling $19,750 to advance to the bonus round.  With the call of the A & B, Leah solved the On the Map location as BOLIVIA.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Charlie O. awarded her another 25-THOUUUUUUUSAND DOLLARS for a grand total of $44,750.<br><br>

<img src="sandraalboum11-5-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Jeopardy!:  </b>Defending champion Sandra Alboum, who led by twice as much money as John Savage and Laura Johnson, had no pressure to risk a very small amount of money, to secure another win.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;No one had the correct Final Jeopardy! response on Famous Phrases:  phrase associated with very dissimilar events of April 19, 1775 and October 3, 1951.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Correct response:  what is The Shot Heard Around the World?  Alboum won with $11,800 to give her a two-day total of $31,200.<br><br> 

<img src="barker30.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>The Price Is Right:  </b>Kenneth Green may have been the victim of what one analyst calls "el cheapo," as he missed out on a car by not calling "05" in the Money Game.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;However, he rebounded in the Showcase to win a Ford Mustang and a dining room group when his opponent Jason overbid on a trip and sailboat extravaganza.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Kenneth's prizes totaled $38,376.<br><br>

<img src="ethan11-5-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Win Ben Stein's Money:  </b>A little knowledge of state captials helped information technology project manager Evan Ewachiw win.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He correctly identified St. Paul as one of the two state capitals situated on the Mississippi River; The other was Baton Rouge.  Evan defeated U.S. Army Col. George Topic $650-$400.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the finale, Ben came seconds close to losing the whole $5,000 but 
barely answered the final question, "What Cincinnati baseball legend played in a record 3,562 games?" before time expired.  The correct answer (given by both):  Pete Rose.  The Best of Ten ended in a 5-5 tie, Ben keeping $3,350, Evan with $1,650.<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Family Feud:  </b>The Wolf family outlasted the Matoyas to win the main game but could only manage 176 points and $880 in Fast Money.  The Wolfs' two-day total is $1,650.<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Friend or Foe?:  </b>The final two players, Camille and Patti, had a trust box of $6,500.  How did they decide how the money should be shared?  Patti went "Friend" and
so did Camille (by her church's wishes), as each played fair and won $3,250.<br><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Russian Roulette:  </b>Jeff Zuber was fortunate to know a cashmere sweater comes from goat hair to give him the win and a chance to go to the bonus round, winning $2,350.  He earned nine correct answers in the 60-Second Roulette to push his earnings to $5,050 but fell through the drop zone when he failed to answer the Dow Jones also runs The Wall Street Journal.<br><br>

<center><b>MONDAY, NOV. 4</b></center><br>

<img src="H2.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Hollywood Squares:  </b>Zorba the champion does it again. John Papapavlos continued his winning streak, conquering level three in the bonus round, the trip around the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The three day champion's luck started in the regular game where he missed a win in game 2, only to have his challenger Nicole Allen, miss her winning question.  Papapavlos recovered to win the game and the match. $3,000-$500.<br>
&nbsp; &Nbsp;In the bonus round, Papapavlos won 6 of 8 squares,  giving him a 1 in 3 chance of picking the correct key that would open the steamer trunk, winning him a trip around the world.  He picked the key on the right and opened the trunk.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In honor of his winning streak, Greek music was played and the publicist and Greek dancer showed off some his moves in a victory dance.  Papapavlos's winnings, including a $17,000
Secret Square, stand at $109,943.<br><br>

<img src="sajaklaugh.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Wheel of Fortune:  </b>The show moves to Seattle for the first of a November sweeps series of on location tapings.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;On the first one from the Pacific Northwest, Ashley Carswell won $15,210 in cash and prizes to advance to the bonus round.  Her choice of the letter K was the only one added in the puzzle.  However, she had the right hint.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The living things which were HUSKIES.  Ashley won a new Mercedes Z230 worth
$28,400, giving her a final total of $43,610.<br><br>

<img src="alexsans.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Jeopardy!:  </b>Defending champion George Hicks was in third place as Eric Huff had a commanding lead with $15,600 going into Final Jeopardy!   However, Eric responded to the language of Arabic and not French in the finale.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The category:  Official Languages.  Answer:  it is an official language of about 30 countries, second only to English.  Correct response:  what is French?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Runner-up Sandra Alboum did come up with the correct question and risked everything to win with $19,400.  George leaves with $22,998.<br><br>

<img src="karn9-24-02.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Family Feud:  </b>The Wolf family became the new champs, beating out the defending champion Silvestres.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Fast Money round, the first set of answers had the Wolfs playing heavy catchup and the finished with 154 points, so they had to settle for $770.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;No one is feeling sad for the Silvestres.  They take home a tidy sum of $40,815 to divide.<br><br>

<img src="edgarsmith11-4-02.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Millionaire:  </b>Edgar Smith opted to keep his $8,000 on Monday's edition.<br>

<img src="benstein.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Win Ben Stein's Money:  </b>With only one question about red algae, telemarketer/comedian Andy Belford emerged victorious, winning $650-$350 over improv comedian Zach Hanner.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;However, Ben soundly defeated Andy in the final round 7-2.  Both knew the Chgamorro were the native peoples of Guan, as did they know spheres are three-dimensional objects.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The trio of questions both Ben and challenger missed:  a 1924 car radio invented by William Lear led to the establishment of Motorola; "mare" is the proper term for a female zebra; and the hero of Tom Wolfe's `Electric Kool-Aid Test,` who died on November 10, 2001, was Ken Kesey.<br><br>

<img src="kennedy2.jpg" align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Friend or Foe?:  </b>Sometimes, even with Kennedy's best efforts, the players remain hardheaded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The hard-working efforts of Linda and David were wasted at the end of the show,
as they had a trust fund of $9,000 up for grabs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Neither of them won or shared the pot, because both players went "Foe" and squandered everything.<br><br>

<img src="roulettelogo.jpg" align=left>&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Russian Roulette:  </b>Steve Richmond made it to the bonus round and looked as if he might have become the third six-figure winner in GSN originals history.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;After winning a total of $2,450 in the main game, Richmond nailed all 10 questions correctly in the 60-Second Roulette round.  However, in using up 53 seconds, he had only a one-in -six chance of avoiding a drop zone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Steve played it safe and took the $10,000.  He left with $12,450.<br><br><br><br>
