  'Northern Bush' Pumpkin</u><br>
  We really feel that if you're going to grow a vegetable, eating quality should 
  be at the top of the list! So, after much searching, we are very proud to offer 
  - at last - a really <u>early</u> pumpkin with good rich flavour <u>and</u> 
  heavy dense flesh, as well as being good for making 'Jack-O-Lanterns'. 
<p>Very early, this one - specifically bred for home gardeners at northern lattitudes 
  - will surprise you; last year it ripened many football-sized fruit before our 
  early courgettes had even finished flowering (!), and they ripen to a good orange 
  colour. 
<p> The deep orange flesh is good both for pies and roasting too, or cubed in 
  pasta sauces, and Ben even makes a very fine pumpkin curry with it! 
<p><i><img alt="plant picture" border=1 height=83 width=110 align=left src="images/house%20nbush.jpg"></i>We 
  ought to warn you though, we think that this should be renamed 'Northern Rampant 
  Vine'. Actually, it is reasonably compact considering it is a pumpkin-type, 
  but you do need to give it a fair bit of room as it sends out runners once the 
  first fruit have set. 
<p><i>A remarkably early pumpkin. Excellent flavour, rich &amp; filling flesh.</i>

  Early Golden Hubbard</u> <b>WEB SPECIAL</b><br>
  A while ago we had the Mini Golden Hubbard from the Fisher family high up in 
  the mountains of Montana. It was great - the earliest squash we'd found - but 
  that variety was just a tad too small for our liking. 
<p>So we simply bred a larger version and are pleased to release seed for the 
  first time this year. So here you have it - a decent sized hubbard, with beautiful 
  yellow skin, guaranteed to set fruit before your courgettes do. 
<p> The hard skin helps it keep for a long time after harvest, and turns golden 
  orange after midsummer. Still good for those with smaller plots as the vines 
  are not too rampant.

  Waltham Butternut</u><br>
  We now have a new strain of this, earlier than what we had last year. This is 
  an improved version of the common Butternut squash. It has very little seed 
  cavity, thicker & straighter necks, fruits earlier, and produces more flesh 
  per fruit. 
<p>It was bred by the Massachusetts Ag. Extension Service in the 1960's by crossing 
  'New Hampshire Butternut' with a wild African squash. 
<p>The orange flesh stays firm when cooked, and it stores very well too. This 
  years' seed is a new strain from the squash collection of Seed Savers Exchange.

  pumpkin pie. 
<p>But in fact any dry-fleshed, dense squash works well. You can also make very 
  nice pumpkin tartlets using a muffin tray! Here are some Kate and Josie made 
  using 'Calabaza Pequena Asar' - you might find a few seeds of that one in the 
  mixed squash packets, if you're lucky!

Burgess Vine Buttercup</u><br>
Considered by many to be one of the best eating squashes ever, this vine produces 
heavy, 9 inch, round, dark-green squash with a lighter green 'button' underneath.

<p>We like it because it keeps well but is easy to peel. All buttercups have dense 
  rich flesh but the Burgess strain is even sweeter than normal. </p>
<p> This is a good choice for those with smaller plots as the vines are not too 
  huge, but still make lots of squash just the right size for two people. </p>

  Galeuse d'Eysines</u><br>
  An unusual and beautiful French squash variety. Quick to germinate and produces 
  vigorous plants that set smooth yellow fruit. 
<p> At the start they look nothing special, but the unique thing is that they 
  ripen to a vivid pink colour, and then in storage they grow an amazing warty 
  surface to the skin. Quite a soft textured flesh, so makes nice soup, or as 
  a basis for a rich pasta sauce.

  Musquee de Provence </u><br>
  This is not a small vine - it rambles all over the place, with fruit up to 10 
  lbs. The striking fruit are deeply ribbed and slowly ripen to a pale orange 
  - it's an European heirloom with very dense sweet flesh. 
<p>The deep ribs divide theaquash up into neat sections that can be sliced off 
  on at a time, and the skin is very thin - so easily peeled! 
<p>Although it was traditionally used in pies and pastries we actually prefer 
  to use it savoury - roasted or fried, as the flesh keeps a good texture when 
  cooked.

  Blue Banana</u> <br>
  Attractive 14" fruit rather like a pale blue zeppelin. This is an American heirloom 
  (originally from Guatemala), and although the vine is quite large, it grows 
  rapidly and produces lots of fruit early in the season for us. 
<p>The grey-blue fruit have a waxy skin that keeps it fresh for ages, but is very 
  thin and easily peeled. This is the best of the three 'banana squash' varieties 
  still in existence. (The other two are 'Jumbo Pink' and 'Rainbow'.) 
<p>It is one of the easiest of all the winter squash to cook - just slice rings 
  off and then you can easily pare off the skin. And it is very nice in a risotto, 
  see the picture.

<p><u></u><u> Guinea</u> <b>WEB SPECIAL</b><br>
  This is a huge squash. Imagine a butternut squash on steroids and you'll get 
  the idea. It is however remarkably productive for such a large-fruited squash! 
<p>As well as a winter squash, the immature fruit - just a couple of days after 
  flowering - are great fried with garlic and olive oil (isn't everything?) with 
  a good nutty flavour . In fact you can do this with most squash, but this one 
  has a particularly nice flavour and buttery texture. 
<p>Save you own seed of this if you like it - we may not offer it again! Although 
  it makes female flowers and sets <u>fruit</u> early, it only makes <u>male</u> 
  flowers late in the season, so large-scale seed production is a pain!

<p>The squash themselves are easily peeled and keep well, with nice yellow-orange 
  flesh. 
<p>A peculiarity of this variety is that although the seed is perfectly pure, 
  it occasionally makes orange or grey fruit as well as green. We and others have 
  tried breeding this out of it over the years - but its not a simple matter: 
  this variety just seems to be like that. All the squash however taste great!

<p> If handled correctly, they will keep for a long time. For biggest and densest 
  fruit, leave the squash as long as possible on the vine, <br>
  even after the leaves start to die down, unless there is danger of frost. 
<p>Harvest by cutting the vine either side of the stem, not cutting the stem itself. 
  Bring inside and store in the warm for 10 days for them to cure. Ideally this 
  is 80¡F / 25¡C, but we just keep ours in the kitchen where is is reasonably 
  warm. 
<p>Curing like this makes lets the skin dry out and lets minor damage heal. It 
  really makes them <u>much</u> longer-keeping and they can then be stored at 
  a cool temperature (optimum 55¡F / 12¡C) Ð we use a spare (unheated) bedroom
