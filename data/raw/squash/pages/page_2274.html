<FONT FACE="AGaramond" SIZE="4">Late summer. Cicadas. Ground Hogs. Thunderstorms. Horse Flies. Of course, we don't produce any of these (at least not intetionally), but CSA shares now contain onions, summer squash, and potatoes. With the help of our greenhouse, there are only a few of our crops that are specifically late-summer fare. Many of our crops are relatively quick growers so that they're well into production by July not to mention August. So far, it has been a good growing season with enough moisture when we have needed it. The groundhogs and especially the deer have been pesky. We're about to start a small experiment looking at the effects of our cover-cropping and compost applications on garden soil quality. More on that later. (To see more about what's in our garden, <A HREF="almanac garden.htm">check out our virtual garden patch</A>.)<BR><BR>

We have two main garden fields - the Main Field (named after Main Street) and the Doctor's Field (due to its proximity to Hawthorne Valley Clinic). The latter is meant to be our deer-free zone. It is surrounding by a double ring of electric wire that is baited with a rotating assortment of baits meant to attract deer so that they touch the wire fence and learn to associate it with an unpleasant zap. In this field, lettuce and other savory items are planted. The basically unprotected Main Field contains most of our brassicas - kale, chard, broccoli, and the like, along with squashes and tomatoes. These are vegetables that are not quite so appealing to deer. Remay, a white cloth that we put over many of our crops (seen aside the tractor in the photo above), does protect them somewhat from unwanted consumption by vertebrates and insects; it also helps to create a good (warm and moist) microclimate for plant growth.<BR><BR>
As the top photo and our name indicates, we are in a valley. Farms are often in valleys because mositure and nutrients tend to run downhill meaning that valley bottom soils are often better for agriculture. We have just finished conducting soil samples of many of our farm areas and hope to soon have a better picture of our on-farm variation in soil quality.
