            leaves, wash thoroughly, and spin dry. Peel, core, and slice
            the apple. Toast the nuts in the oven for about 5 minutes. Take

            We Grow </FONT></B><HR><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Acorn</FONT>
<BR>
            </B>The common supermarket variety with very dark green ridged
            skin and a nutty flavor-not sweet. Best baked (with nutmeg and
            brown-sugar) or stuffed. Serves 2&shy;4. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Ambercup</FONT> <BR>
            </B>This red-skinned buttercup squash has a rich, sweet flavor
            and dry, flaky flesh. Has a very high sugar content. These will
            make 4&shy;8 servings. <I>C. maxima<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Chicago Warted Hubbard<BR>
            </FONT></B>This is the original Hubbard-large (usually 30 pounds),
            dark green, and very warty. At some point the smooth-skinned
            hubbard came along and became more economical to grow, but the
            standard of squash flavor still starts here. <I>C. maxima<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Delicata</FONT> <BR>
            </B>A small, long squash with cream skin and green ridges. Also
            known as the &quot;Sweet Potato&quot; or &quot;Peanut&quot; squash.
            The flesh is fine and sweet and will make 2 servings, but once
            you taste it, you'll want one all for yourself. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Festival<BR>
            </FONT></B>An tastier version of a pretty squash called &quot;Carnival&quot;.
            We can't honestly decide if we like this one better than &quot;Delicata&quot;,
            but we first grew it in 1999 and it was a winner. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Gill's Golden Pippin<BR>
            </FONT></B>An Acorn with golden-orange skin and an elongated
            shape. This is an old Northwest heirloom, but treat it like an
            Acorn. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Heart of Gold<BR>
            </FONT></B>Somewhere between the Acorn and Delicata lies the
            qualities of this squash. Light and sweet, deeper than Acorn
            and almost as rich as Delicata, this squash is a winner. Makes
            two servings. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Orange Hokkaido<BR>
            </FONT></B>Also known as &quot;Red Kuri&quot; or &quot;Baby Red
            Hubbard&quot;, this is a Japanese variety highly regarded in
            the macrobiotic diet. It's best treated like a Hubbard and will
            make 3&shy;5 servings. <I>C. maxima<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Spaghetti<BR>
            </FONT></B>Unlike any other squash, in that its cooked flesh
            is stringy and can be pulled out in strands like orange spaghetti.
            Shaped like a small watermelon with yellow-orange skin. Dress
            it with a mild-flavored pasta sauce, or olive oil and parmesan
            cheese. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Sugarloaf<BR>
            </FONT></B>This is basically a drier-textured version of Delicata,
            with darker tan skin and a squat shape, and a higher sugar content.
            Like Delicata, these will make 2 servings, but don't be surprised
            if you eat the whole thing by yourself. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Sweet Dumpling<BR>
            </FONT></B>Similar to &quot;Delicata&quot;, but in a teacup shape
            that makes it perfect for stuffing for 1 person. Look for the
            white skin with green stripes. <I>C. pepo<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Sweet Mama<BR>
            </FONT></B>Essentially a dark grey-green skinned buttercup type
            squash, without a <BR>
            button. It's rich, sweet flavor is best when the squash is steamed
            or baked. These will make 4&shy;8 servings. <I>C. maxima<BR>
            </I><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">Sweet Meat<BR>
            </FONT></B>This Northwest heirloom variety with slate-grey skin
            has the potential to grow quite large-10 pounds or more! These
            will make 8 or more delicious, nutty, sweet servings, and it
            stores very well. <I>C. maxima</I></CENTER></P>

      Squash</FONT></CENTER></H6>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Up until about five years ago, when
      I first started visiting farmer's markets, I hated winter squash.
      I knew it either as a frozen orange brick, or as a chunk of nameless,
      flavorless yellow stuff, wrapped in plastic, from the produce
      section, and <BR>
      it always made me gag. I just couldn't swallow it.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Everything changed the day I cooked
      a &quot;Delicata&quot;. Now we delight in all kinds of squash,
      knowing that they all have different cooking needs and flavors.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">While all squash are in the gourd, or
      Cucurbita family, there are four primary groups <BR>
      of winter squash, each with their own characteristics. When in
      doubt examine the squash's stem, and don't worry if anyone looks
      at you funny.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">C. maxima </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">contains
      the largest squashes, like the Hubbards, Bananas, and Great Pumpkins,
      some over 800 pounds. Their stems are round and have a corky
      texture. <BR>
      </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">C. moschata</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">
      includes the Butternut and Cheese Pumpkin, and typically have
      a smooth tan skin and a hard, ridged stem that flares where it
      meets the fruit. These are capable of the longest storage and
      will sweeten over time. <BR>
      </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">C. pepo </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">includes
      most of the summer squashes, as well as the Acorn, Delicata,
      Sugar Pumpkins, and traditional field pumpkins we carve into
      Jack-o-Lanterns. <BR>
      </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">C. agyrosperma</FONT></B><FONT
       COLOR="#ffffcc"> includes several varieties that need a very
      long, hot growing season. They prefer southern climates and are
      difficult to identify by their stems alone. We can't grow them
      here.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffcc66" SIZE="+1">How to Choose:<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">Generally, look for a rich-colored
      skin for the variety&shy;the skin may be any combination of white,
      grey, orange, or black. Also, most dark-colored squashes will
      have an deep orange blotch when ripe. This blotch is the spot
      where the squash rested on the ground as it ripened. The <I>C.
      maxima</I> varieties (those with a corky stem) should have a
      shriveled, dry corky stem, not a thick, green stem full of water.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">If you plan on keeping the squash longer
      than 3 or 4 weeks, check it carefully for dings and scratches,
      as these damaged areas will mold quickly, and the rest of the
      squash will follow.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffcc66" SIZE="+1">How to Keep:<BR>
      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">All winter squashes are built
      for storage and can last for <BR>
      several months if kept in a cool (50&shy;60&deg;), dark, dry
      location.</FONT></P>

      </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">The </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#660000">maxima</FONT></B><FONT
       COLOR="#ffffcc"> varieties tend to be dry-textured, and will
      taste best if cut into chunks and steamed or baked. Try putting
      the chunks in a baking pan-skin side down-with an inch of water
      in the pan. Add a pat of butter to the non-skin side and a little
      salt, and bake at 350&deg; for 45&shy;60 minutes. Once cooked,
      try them mashed with potatoes or other root vegetables.<BR>
