        one word it would be <i>polish</i>. The level of detail and Star Wars realism in this game
        is staggering. You will be totally immersed in what looks, sounds, and feels like a galaxy
        far, far away. Lucasarts and Raven Software obviously put a lot of painstaking effort into
        helping gamers actually feel like they are legitimate Jedi Knights. With the myriad of
        Star Wars games already out you might wonder how this one could be so different. Oh young
        Padawan, you have so much to learn&#133;Step into Jedi Knight II&#146;s office.<p><img src="77-01.jpg" alt="77-01.jpg (5396 bytes)" align="left" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">The story picks up
        after the events of Dark Forces II. Our hero Kyle Katarn defeated the dark Jedi, Jerec and
        kept the power of the Valley of the Jedi from falling into evil hands. Distressed by his
        brush with the Dark Side, Kyle decided to leave his Jedi ways and return to doing
        reconnaissance missions for the New Republic. On a routine mission to a planet Kejim,
        though, Katarn and his partner come face to face with the menace of the Dark Side.
        What&#146;s a rusty Jedi to do?</p>
        <p><img src="86-01.jpg" alt="86-01.jpg (5580 bytes)" align="right" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Your first
        missions are pretty straightforward. Players can expect a healthy dose of puzzles and
        platform jumping -- one area where Jedi Knight II&#146;s polish runs a little thin. Amidst
        the nice visuals you&#146;ll be doing a bit of running back and forth to unlock doors. If
        gamers can bear with this title for a couple of hours then they will really be satisfied.
        The real game begins once you start to tap into your growing mastery of the force. </p>
        <p><img src="81-01.jpg" alt="81-01.jpg (5885 bytes)" align="left" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Eventually
        you will come into contact with Luke Skywalker, who helps you get your skills up to snuff.
        This is another area where Jedi Knight II shines: cameos. You will see several familiar
        faces from Master Skywalker to Lando Calrissian, whose voice acting is done by Billy Dee
        Williams himself. You won&#146;t just sit around and chew the fat with these guys either.
        Your allies will take a bite out of the Imperials right beside you, and this game makes
        sure you have the equipment to do it too.</p>
        <p><img src="84-01.jpg" alt="84-01.jpg (5968 bytes)" align="right" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Jedi Outcast
        lets players render justice with 13 different weapons including a few different
        explosives. You&#146;ll recognize several like the blaster rifle and Wookie bowcaster. All
        the weapons have secondary uses as well. Once you lay hands on your lightsaber, though,
        you&#146;ll be hard pressed to holster it. Lightsaber combat is one area where Jedi
        Outcast really delivers the goods.</p>
        <p><img src="85-01.jpg" alt="85-01.jpg (6157 bytes)" align="left" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Earlier it
        was said that Jedi Outcast lets you feel like a legitimate Jedi. The depth involved with
        learning and mastering the use of a lightsaber is phenomenal. You can swing your saber
        horizontally, vertically, and diagonally for starters. Your attacks will vary depending on
        where your enemy is in relation to you. This alone allows for some strategizing during
        your fights, especially against others wielding lightsabers. </p>
        <p><img src="73-01.jpg" alt="73-01.jpg (6361 bytes)" align="right" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">On top of
        that there are three different fighting stances you can use to vanquish your foes. You
        start out with a medium stance, which is basically your all-purpose mix of speed and
        power. Beyond that you can learn a power stance, which is very slow, but can knock the
        lightsaber right out of a combatants hands. Also you can learn the quick stance, which as
        the name implies depends on weaker, but much quicker strokes. Each stance contains its own
        special moves as well. Never before has swinging a lightsaber been more rewarding. What
        would a Jedi be, though, without the force as his ally?</p>
        <p><img src="87-01.jpg" alt="87-01.jpg (6621 bytes)" align="left" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Of course
        even an expert of saber combat requires the living force to be a real Jedi, and Jedi
        Outcast doesn&#146;t disappoint in this area as well. Many of the force powers like
        lightning are back from Dark Forces II. Once you train with Luke you will learn more force
        powers during your progress through the game. </p>
        <p><img src="72-01.jpg" alt="72-01.jpg (7086 bytes)" align="right" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Every force
        power and skill, including lightsaber combat and defense, exists in three stages. The
        skill begins at level one and as you progress you will build your skills to their pinnacle
        (level three). A level one lighting blast will shoot straight to strike one foe, but a
        level three blast will arc onto multiple enemies that are within range. By the time you
        are done you&#146;ll be yanking guns out of stormtroopers&#146; hands or even throwing
        them over cliffs with the smallest gesture. Jedi Outcast is definitely a growing process,
        but rewards gamers with a distinct feeling of accomplishment. Believe me, you&#146;ll get
        that warm fuzzy feeling the second you choke the life out of an enemy from across a room.</p>
        <p><img src="82-01.jpg" alt="82-01.jpg (7104 bytes)" align="left" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Jedi Outcast
        also offers a solid multiplayer option over the net. You can join servers that are already
        up and running or start your own. Starting your own server gives you control over things
        like the map, player limits, and whether force powers are involved. You can participate in
        anything from an old fashion death match to lightsaber-only duels. Jedi Outcast puts an
        interesting spin on the &quot;capture the case&quot; match. Instead, players will have to
        capture a Ysalamiri. This little lizard will squash all of the force powers of whoever is
        carrying it as well as make them immune to the force, making for some interesting matches.
        </p>
        <p><img src="83-01.jpg" alt="83-01.jpg (7143 bytes)" align="right" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">By all
        accounts Jedi Outcast is a great game, but it does have some flaws that may tax
        gamers&#146; patience. As mentioned before, the first couple levels of Jedi Outcast leave
        something to be desired. You&#146;ll grow tired of running to this room to open that room
        over and over and over. Jedi Outcast has a generous helping of puzzles, which may hamper
        the action here and there. Later on this problem is much less apparent because of your
        contact with the force. </p>
        <p><img src="76-01.jpg" alt="76-01.jpg (7658 bytes)" align="left" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Controls in
        Jedi Outcast are a little slippery, though. All in all the control is quite functional.
        You can customize your keyboard and mouse settings to help offset the somewhat awkward
        default settings. You&#146;ll want to torch your keyboard the most during the game&#146;s
        jumping sequences, though. There are several very tough jumps you will encounter during
        Jedi Outcast. These jumps seem worthy challenges at first, but after all the dying due to
        the jump button not kicking in the second you need it, or making the jump only to
        &quot;slip&quot; off, you&#146;ll be crying for mommy.</p>
        <p><img src="80-01.jpg" alt="80-01.jpg (7783 bytes)" align="right" hspace="3" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="120">Jedi Knight
        II: Jedi Outcast is by all accounts a beautiful and immersing experience. The level of
        painstaking detail present in all of the aspects of this game is impressive. You can
        really tell that Lucasarts and Raven Software cared a lot about making you feel at home
        within this game. While Jedi Outcast is not a revolutionary title, it is definitely a
        solid blueprint of what to do right. It is a great mixture of concepts we know and love,
        executed in one solid title. This is definitely a must-buy for Star Wars fans and even
        those who aren&#146;t fans should check it out. </p>
