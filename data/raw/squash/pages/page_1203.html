activity; planting beds are prepared as soon as the soil can be worked in the spring; Late
spring planting of seeds and seedlings; Summer harvests in the cool mornings to retain the
sugars; Processing the harvest for winter enjoyment; Fall sowing of winter rye grass to
hold in the rich, dark soil throughout the rains of winter;&nbsp; spent crops plowed under
in late summer to prepare for the fall planting of cole crops, like broccoli, cabbage,
Brussels sprouts, Yum!&nbsp; and the annual garlic planting resulting in
flavorful garlic bulbs.&nbsp;

sleeps cozily until Spring arrives and begins to warm the soil. &nbsp; At that time, all
our winter plans (remember those seed catalogues spread all around us before a roaring
fire?) takes form.&nbsp; Catalogues are not only full of photographs of plant selections, but
suggestions on planting companions, and even recipes for the resulting crops!&nbsp;
Wouldn't you love a striped beet? Or a Golden Beet? It wouldn't bleed onto your salads!
How about a white eggplant? Or a striped tomato? Little ones, and large, juicy
ones.&nbsp; The tomato varieties are exciting and wonderful to try. We just love the little, yellow, pear tomatoes.&nbsp;
Producing all season long, they are very versatile.&nbsp; These look great sliced in
half and sprinkled in a green salad along with red tomatoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#008080"> We always get carried away with
the pepper selections! We want hot, some mild, some small, some stuffing size!&nbsp;
If you have never tried Yukon Gold potatoes, please do. This golden-fleshed potato almost
needs no butter!&nbsp; And the little, red, new potatoes, succulent!&nbsp; Other
varieties are purple potatoes, large baking potatoes, and little, yellow
potatoes.&nbsp; You would be amazed at how easy potatoes are to grow!! 
<img SRC="images/AG00629_.GIF" align="left" width="127" height="128"></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">New and improved plant varieties make vegetable gardening irresistible, with
harvest time the beckoning prize, the ultimate reward.&nbsp; The whole process is
immensely satisfying. Look at all the madcap gardeners with those big smiles!
You also get a great tan while working the soil in the summer sun!&nbsp; Early in
spring nurseries are visited seeds are purchased to be started by March at the
latest in the greenhouse. You can even start seeds on window sills.&nbsp; Later
in the spring, I purchase vegetable seedlings that I have not started from
seed.&nbsp; They hold great promise and most of the hard work has already been
done! Be careful here, as you are looking at quite a lot of work getting them into the
ground! Each year I want our vegetable garden to be bigger, but then, I don't do the
majority of the planting or the weekly watering! </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Excitement mounts as the time draws near to plant our vegetable
garden!&nbsp; My pen often runs furiously over my garden journal at this time, jotting
down notes, making a wish list for next season after spending time in seed catalogs, and
creating rough sketches for this year's desired plotting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year I planted
some vegetables with my flowers and shrubs.&nbsp; I really liked that and some of the
vegetables were close enough to the front door for me to run out and pick even
as I was cooking; tomatoes, potatoes, okra,
onions, and garlic. Dried onion greens retain a smoky flavor that is so delicious, I
think I will expand on this concept this year.&nbsp; They are so easy to
prepare, just pop them into the micro while damp from their washing, and after
three minutes, let them air cool.&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp; I had lots of herbs to choose from,
oregano, thyme, lemon balm, chamomile, rosemary, and sage.&nbsp; They were dried and put
up for use during the winter, although they kept growing all winter!&nbsp; Raising your
own vegetables is so exciting. To plant, then nurture, and harvest the foods we
eat; to be
self-sufficient, and know exactly what is in the foods we eat. The flavor can't be
beat!&nbsp; &nbsp; And the myriad of choices we have! Astounding!</font></p>

garden is conceived but as the rows are formed, and the beds prepared, it is mercifully
downsized.&nbsp; The catalogue pictures look so great, don't they? The plants are full and
lush and their fruit tempts us.&nbsp; We may even give that giant pumpkin another try! And
this year we vow not to plant more than <u>three</u> tomato plants!&nbsp; And certainly
not more than two pepper bushes! And heavens, the squash!! Do not plant the
whole seed package!&nbsp; Yikes!!</p>

by Mr. Tim in
great amounts twice a year, spring and late fall. &nbsp; This is home-made
compost and rich with rabbit, chicken or horse manure.&nbsp; Deep trenches surround the garden
to keep the gophers at bay while a seven-foot wire fence deters deer, raccoons and the
livestock. &nbsp;Hills are created for beans, cucumbers, squashes and melons.&nbsp; Deep
little trenches are made for planting potatoes, covered as they grow with the replaced
soil until they are deep in dark, snug, little beds. Neat rows mark places for beets,
onions, peppers, radishes, carrots and eggplant. Some rows point east, some south,
following a design I followed faithfully from 'Martha Stewart'.&nbsp; Don't forget the flowers for a
true 'Martha' vegetable garden! </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">T</font><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#008080">he garden is laid
out with precision, care taken to rotate the crops each year. Not planting in the same
area twice keeps the nutrients from being depleted as each crop takes a certain type from
the soil. Some years sections of the garden are allowed to go 'fallow', not
planted at all.&nbsp; Nutrients are replaced in the soil during this time.&nbsp;
Fall-planted garlic outlines one of the beds, taking a full nine months until
harvest. The very best, intense flavor of home-grown garlic makes great pesto (ever try a
tablespoon mixed in with your scrambled eggs? Wonderful!).&nbsp; I make pesto with either
cilantro or basil. Each has a special flavor, both are delicious. Harvesting the garlic
cloves, I pack them in olive oil or just hang strings of braided garlic to cure. These can
be used right off the garland as needed when I cook. Mostly I just mound some in
a bowl, easy access.&nbsp; Fresh garlic sautéed until crisp,
then mixed with vegetables, potatoes, rice, or pasta--the flavor is dynamic! I love to
share this cooking tip with family and friends. </p>

<p>Tim designs great supports to train the climbing vegetables such as cucumbers, winter
squash, cherry tomatoes, Armenian cucumbers, and gourds.&nbsp; He experiments each year
with the ones I fancy after watching the gardening shows. One year it is string creations,
another year, lattice, then another year, twigs and branches.&nbsp; This is a great
space-saving technique also, visually raising the eye higher and creating interest.&nbsp;
Watering is neater and the plants seem to love the new heights.&nbsp;Then those ugly
tomato hornworms are easy to spot! And our chickens love to eat them!</font><img

<p>I can envision the great harvest of delicious vegetables throughout summer, eating warm, juicy tomatoes
right in the field, popping baby carrots and little radishes. The corn grows tall and
sways in the breeze, its dry tassels signaling ripeness, golden kernels bursting with
goodness. The sun is hot on our backs, and the sweet exhaustion at the end of a good
gardening day is wonderful.&nbsp; We both work full-time so our weekends are
full! </p>

<p>Then, it is spinach time, broccoli time and lettuce time again! In Spring, it is
Asparagus, sweet peas! Fresh from the garden with melted butter, or mayo! In my whole
life, I never thought I would get so excited about vegetables! From the garden to the
table! Fresh! Pure! Abundant! Ah, it's so sweet, this good life!</font></p>

insects, and spiders feast on crawly and flying things caught in their webs.&nbsp; The

battle between my man and the gopher continues, whole plants sucked into the earth,
disappearing in a heartbeat. Melons are a favorite of the gophers, as are tubers and
tulips. He dug this deep trench all the way around the garden of raised beds. This worked
for a time until the gophers found a way to cross that ravine, probably by digging deeper!
And then one day, my green beans were gone! Yep, no roots! Gopher attack!!&nbsp; I have
actually seen a plant shaking, teetering, then whoosh! gone in a heartbeat.&nbsp; That is
too scary!&nbsp; </font></p>

Aphids can just be sprayed off with blasts from the hose, or squished off with rubber-gloved
fingers.&nbsp; And of course, the deer help to prune our plants set out in unprotected
locations!&nbsp; Their reward is the sweet, succulent new growths!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">This indeed was the greatest harvest yet!&nbsp; Tim started
flats of tomato seedlings in the cottage, facing the eastern sun.&nbsp; He was
diligent in his organization not only of the seed packets but the labeling and
upkeep of these tender plants.&nbsp; That resulted in a great quantity of baby
tomato plants ready to be transplanted in spring.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had enough to
sell to a local nursery (we got our nursery stock license!) and more than enough
left over to plant in our garden.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Before the great day arrived, he amended the already great
garden soil with huge amounts of compost and chicken manure, rotatilling
everything in well.&nbsp; Then he went about the exacting work of creating the
rows, and beds, developing the hills which would hold cucumber plants, squash
and melon plants and setting up the 'poles' for the climbing vegetables.&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Once that was done, we picked a clear, sunny weekend for
planting.&nbsp; The ground had to be warm enough to sit on, so the plants would
get a good start on developing their roots for the fruiting process.&nbsp; I had
not really considered how many plants we had!&nbsp; We wanted Early Girl, Better
Boy, Champion, Brandywine, Yellow Pear, Ball Striped, Sweet 100's, Zebra's,
Roma's and currant cherry tomatoes.&nbsp; There were others also, so we went
ahead and planted them all!&nbsp; Tim erected poles in sets of threes, tied
together at the tops, to support the
Great Lakes beans we grew and at the ends of the rows I planted marigolds,
bright orange flowers.&nbsp; These single plants grew into beautiful, bushy
plants which always seemed to hold an abundance of blooms.&nbsp; They enticed
the bad bugs to eat of their petals, sacrificing themselves for the good of the
harvest.<img border="5" src="images/pic_seedlingsmoretwo.jpg" align="right" width="320" height="200"></p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Then we planted the cucumbers, melons, peppers (again, lots of
varieties!), squash, artichokes, bell peppers, corn, and eggplants.&nbsp;
Everything grew abundantly and we harvested tons of vegetables!&nbsp; We dried
some, froze some, canned some, and gave lots away!&nbsp;&nbsp;This past season,
1999, was a bumper crop harvest season.&nbsp; Visit the <a href="harvest.htm"> Harvest site</a> for
