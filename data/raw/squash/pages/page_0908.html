That goes for work, food, as well as exercise. As I told you a week ago, I am away from home. But at least I am able to post to the website. That's definitely an improvement over last year when those attempts failed. Largely because, at that time, I did not have my own domain. Owning <B>annebarone.com</B> solves a number of problems.

<P><B>LEAN PANTRY</B>

<P>One rule I am having to bend, if not actually break, is that for a lean pantry. In North Texas where I currently live, there are a number of staples of my Anne Barone diet that are unavailable or very expensive or available only in an inferior quality. So while I am back here on the Texas Riviera, I am stocking up on such items as really good dried apricots, dried figs, roasted soynuts, sunflower seeds, blackstrap molasses (great source of magnesium and potassium, not to mention iron) soy, rye, and spelt flours, organic flaxseed, a good supply of King Arthur Flour that I think makes such wonderful bread, and a pound of yeast (lasts a long time and only $2.27) . These dry items are easier to transport back.

<P>I will be taking smaller quantities of such items as free range eggs, natural chicken (that raised outdoors and raised without injections of antibiotics and hormones) fish, organic vegetables and fruits of varieties I can't find in north Texas -- and of course  Mexican pastries (much better than what I have been able to find in North Texas.) 

<P>Not excessive amounts of these foods, but enough for a couple of months of the dry items and a couple of weeks of the fresh.

<P>For years I kept pinned to the bulletin board over my desk, a little sign that said: <B>YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO MAKE YOUR OWN RULES</B>.

<P>In order to eat well and stay slim, not only do you have to trust yourself to make rules that work for you, but you have to recognize those situations in which bending or breaking those rules is in your own self-interest.

<P><B>NO AFTERNOON TEA THIS WEEK</B>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="tea.gif" WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="42" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="2"> There has been no time for coding an <B>Afternoon Tea With Anne</B> this week. But I have been enjoying some new varieties of tea and reading a book I want to tell you about soon.

<P>In lieu of a book that I recommend, you might want to brew yourself a nice cup of tea, settle down at the computer and check out on the <B>Amazon.com</B> online bookstore two books which a <B>Chic & Slim Woman</B> recently recommended. She wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Goose in Toulouse and other culinary adventures in France</B>," by Mort
Rosenblum..DELICIOUS. All about food and France. 

<P><B>French Impressions: the Adventures of an American Family</B> by John S.
Littell. American family who spends a year in the South of France,
1950...with small children. Written by the son who was 4 at the time, with
the aid of the notes his mother kept of the adventure. I haven't read it
yet, just bought it yesterday, but it looks great! </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I have not read either, but particularly the Rosenblum book looks excellent. Both are highly ranked on <B>Amazon.com</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#990033" FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica, arial"><B>19 OCT 00</B></FONT> | 	<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">I have been out food shopping again today. Autumn brings its own delights in the produce department. Don't miss them.

<P><B>WINTER SQUASH</B>



<P>Of course, I love summer squash. Zucchini is a must for the French Ratatouille I love so well. But when the leaves begin to turn and the chilly air takes on the scent of woodsmoke, that is when I begin to find the "winter" varieties of squash in the produce department. For years it was just acorn and butternut squash. And not much else. Now every autumn, I find new varieties of winter squash. As you know from reading Encore, Uncle Phil's Squash recipe is one I never miss preparing. 

<P><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="ksquash.jpg" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="106" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" BORDER="0" ALT="Winter Squash">But though I prepare old favorites such as <B>Uncle Phil's butternut squash</B>, I try every year to try at least one new variety. Last year it was the <B>kosaba</B> shown here. This year it was a variety called <B>Sweet Dumpling Squash</B>. Yellow and green skin with deep orange "meat' inside. 

<P>I baked Sweet Dumpling Squash as one would acorn squash, just cut in half, seeded and placed in a baking dish in the oven. (I cooked it while some French bread baked.) It was the sweetest squash I have ever eaten. But the real surprise was trying the second half the next day straight from the refrigerator. Chilled, it tasted like not-too-sweet pumpkin pie. Baked with cinnamon and a bit of cloves and ginger, I think it would make a nice substitute for pumpkin pie for someone trying to cut back on refined sugar. Delicious, in any case.

<P>Another fall delight I found in the market today was organic <B>Garnet yams</B>. These yams are smaller and pointier on the ends than our more common American yams (called sweet potatoes in some regions.) I had eaten the Garnet yams last year, a gift from a friend who raised them. While I fixed a <B>Pear and Endive salad</B>, I stuck one of these Garnet yams in the microwave (skin pierced with a fork, three minutes for a small one.) Made a nice, quickly prepared lunch. 

<P>Until the next <B>BONJOUR!</B> update <B><I>Soyez Chic Restez Svelte</I></B><BR>Be Chic Stay Slim.  <B>&agrave; la prochaine -- Anne</B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#990033" FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica, arial"><B>18 OCT 00</B></FONT> | 	<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">Once again I am back on the South Texas Gulf Coast. Last year at this time I was enjoying the glories of an Appalachian Autumn. So the serene and elegant mornings here on the 'Texas Riviera' are some compensation. Blue bay water smooth as glass, cloud-decorated skies, stately water birds feeding, and waxy pink oleanders nodding in their nests of green leaves make up for missing beautiful fall foliage this year. 

<P><B>RIVIERA SHOPPING</B>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Right SRC="teapi.jpg" WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="275" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10" BORDER="1" ALT="Tea on the deck">
Breakfasts on the deck are as lovely as I remember. The image on the right is one I used with an <B>AFTERNOON TEA WITH ANNE</B> that featured Diane Johnson's Paris-set novel <B>Le Divorce</B>. My view now is basically the same. Actually, it's better. A couple of houses have been built in that open space, and they hide that dark fence whose line and color I always found jarred the eye. 

<P>In the past few days I have spent time with the food shopping list I brought with me. My months in Wichita Falls have given me a new appreciation for those of you who live in locales where the foods that help you live chic & slim are unavailable or quite expensive.

<P>I must say that when I went out on the Internet to find items such as soy, rye, and buckwheat flours, textured vegetables protein, dried fruit I found that the basic prices were much more than I was accustomed to paying at stores in Corpus Christi, plus shipping charges added substantially to the cost.

<P>Unfortunately, in the US, when the food product choices are limited, it seems that what is available is always the starchy, fatty, full of chemicals and preservatives items. You may have to be creative working out a menu that works within your budget if you live in an area where food product choices are largely processed. But I have lived in a variety of regions of the world, and whenever I moved, it always seemed to require a bit of reworking of recipes and weekly menus. In <FONT COLOR="#CC0000"><B>Chic & Slim Encore</B></FONT>, I tried to give you a variety of recipes collected from a variety of regions of the world. It really is possible to eat chic & slim no matter where you live.

<P><B>BOUILLOIRE AUTOMATIQUE</B>

<P>I remember my delight the first time I checked into a hotel in England and found an electric teakettle in my room. Not all electric teakettles are created equal, I have discovered over the years. Some of the 'hot pots' sold in the US are not acceptable for brewing  black teas because they do not bring water to a full boil. Though they do nicely for green teas which only require hot water.

<P>My friend who owns the Padre Island house where I am staying has a new <B><I>bouilloire automatique</I></B>, electric teakettle I like very much. It is the <B><I>Vitesse</I></B> (speed) model from the French company <B>T-FAL</B>. Speedy it really is, and the design is excellent. And I like the automatic cutoff when the water reaches boiling. And your fingers activate cutoff when you lift the kettle from its base: another nice feature. 

<P>For all their preference for traditional cookware, when the French do create an electric appliance, they do an excellent job. The <B>Cuisinart</B> and this <B>Vitesse</B> kettle are two examples of this excellence.

<P><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#990033" FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica, arial"><B>17 OCT 00</B></FONT> | 	<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">I hope you are finding some good recipes on Anne Cerva's French Food website that was featured on Sunday's <B>AFTERNOON TEA WITH ANNE</B>. 

<P><B>PERHAPS WE WILL CHAT</B>
<P><B>Anne Cerva, about.com's French Food guide</B>, has suggested the possibility that I do a "live chat" on her website at some time. When she first emailed me on the subject, I was deep into the work on <B>ENCORE</B> and I asked that the chat wait until the book was finished. I am not sure if, and when, this will come about. But I will announce any such chat on the <B>Chic & Slim website</B>, in case you would enjoy visiting this question and answer session.

<P>For those of you who regularly visit the <B>Chic & Slim website</B>, however, it would probably be much information that you already know. But then again, who knows what kind of questions might come up?
