  <h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Copper Canyon and Baja - February/March 
    2003 </font></h2>
</div>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>Tracks to Adventure</i></b> 
  is our caravan group into Mexico on a twenty-seven day tour. After about twenty 
  years of talking about putting our RV on a train ride through the Copper Canyon, 
  we are actually going in style. All twenty two coaches (Our RV is the only TREK.) 
  have gathered at the <b><font color="#0000FF">Mission RV <img src="a-Mission%20RV.jpg" width="209" height="146" align="left">Park</font></b> 
  in El Paso, Texas, just a hop-skip-and-jump over to the Mexican border. Our 
  group leaders are wagon master, Doyle and his wife, Joan, and a tail gunner, 
  Skip and his wife, Helen. They smooth the way at the border, guide us to each 
  stop, and supervise the loading of the coaches on the train. On the 11th of 
  February, we are up bright and early to get to the border crossing. At 6:30 
  a.m., we had our briefing with the wagon master going over the road logs for 
  the first leg of the journey to customs. As we crossed over the border, the 
  poverty line was distinct. Little ticky-tacky cardboard shacks lined the road 
  on the left while dirt fields with scattered trash lined the road on the right. 
  The shacks were about 8x8 or 10x10 made with cardboard, plywood, or tar paper. 
  Undoubtedly, there are no sanitary facilities. When you think of the problem, 
  these people are so close and yet so far. We did notice that some kids were 
  crossing over the bridge into the USA carrying what appeared to be school books. 
  Fortunately, the border town is not representative of everywhere in Mexico and 
  we were soon in beautiful, but desolate and hilly countryside. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first 22 miles of our route 
  was through the town of Juarez where the Green Angels run traffic interference 
  for the caravan. The Green Angels are a volunteer group that assists motorists 
  throughout Mexico. They blocked traffic at intersections and traffic circles 
  and got our 22 coaches through in a tight group. They are a great professional 
  help! We actually went around the southeast side of Juarez, which is more accommodating 
  to RVs. The scenery, as we drive in this part of Mexico, is arid with ridges 
  of mountains and miles and miles of sand dunes. Some of the mountains remind 
  us of the Remarkables near Queensland, New Zealand, with their jagged saw-tooth 
  tops. Close to the city of Juarez the smog or pollution hung in the valley around 
  the mountains. The first 25 miles of roadway was bumpy with &quot;topes&quot; 
  scattered every so often. Topes are speed bumps over which you must go very 
  slowly for they can be small or large, but they will shake up the coach. We 
  arrive at customs and all the drivers must go in and get the hologram. Each 
  vehicle brought into Mexico must have a hologram attached to the windshield. 
  When we arrive on the Baja, the hologram will be surrendered to authorities 
  and we must keep the receipt for a long time to ensure that our credit card 
  is never charged for the value of our RV. Mexico only allows one vehicle per 
  person and we must leave with that same vehicle. The <i><b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i> 
  personnel had taken all the paperwork down to the customs officials on Monday 
  allowing the officials to review copies of our passports, vehicle registrations 
  and titles, visas, and other required documents. This saved us oodles of time 
  as we were only at customs about one hour. So, by 10 a.m. we were rolling south 
  toward Chihuahua. Today is our longest and most trying day for we need to clear 
  Mexican customs and drive 240 miles. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For all of the <b><font color="#0000FF">southward 
  drive to Chihuahua</font></b>, <img src="b-mts.jpg" width="241" height="94" align="left">we 
  have a four lane, rather good divided highway. We stopped for lunch just before 
  paying our first toll ($15). The toll booths are the only place so far where 
  we have noted armed guards. From here on south, we drive across desert like 
  land, but there are ranches, <img src="c-Fresno%20Rv.jpg" width="189" height="140" align="right">cattle 
  feed lots, walnut orchards, and the land is clean. El Paso is at an elevation 
  above sea level of about 3,400 feet, but during this first day we are sometimes 
  at 5,060 feet climbing steadily toward Chihuahua. Well groomed orchardsare along 
  the road. We drive into Chihuahua amidst lots of road construction. There is 
  even a Wal-Mart here in town, but our caravan drove right by without stopping! 
  Pastel cement houses dot the hillsides. By 3:30 p.m., we arrived at the <b><font color="#0000FF">Del 
  Fresno RV Park</font></b>, once a KOA, on the south side of Chihuahua. We have 
  full hook ups at this clean, small campground with pull through slips, a small 
  tree, picnic table, and grill at each site. A Pemex gas station, one of the 
  national gas stations of Mexico, is at the front of the park. All of the gasoline 
  powered vehicles were filled up at $2.12/gal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The evening featured dinner at La 
  Clientas, a restaurant in downtown <img src="d-dance.jpg" width="111" height="155" align="left">Chihuahua 
  followed by folk dancing. Dinner started with a margaritas and tomato based 
  soup with avocado, taco pieces, and spices. The cocktails were followed with 
  a salad and a dinner sampler plate with steak, chicken in a tangy brown sauce, 
  cheese quesadilla, and an enchilada. The eight <b><font color="#0000FF">local 
  folk dancers</font></b>illustrated the various dances of the central Mexican 
  states with the moderation provided by a local college professor. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have finally, but only partially, 
  reached warm weather, at least for the day. Our shorts are on! Chihuahua is 
  a clean town with swept streets and sidewalks, parks with benches and walks, 
  and a few interesting sights. The area has been under a ten year drought and 
  running water is rationed to four hours/day - from 4-6 in the morning and 4-6 
  in the evening. Chihuahua's economic products are cattle, silver mining along 
  with gold, copper, zinc, &amp; lead, foreign companies such as Ford and Motorola, 
  and finally farming. The state of Chihuahua is 153 square miles, the largest 
  state of Mexico, and has five million people. The country of Mexico has a population 
  of over 100 million. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="e-P%20Villa.jpg" width="196" height="130" align="right">On 
  a <i>Tracks </i>furnished bus we visited the <b><font color="#0000FF">home of 
  Pancho Villa</font></b>, who is now revered as a leader of the revolution in 
  the 1909-15 time-period. While growing up, Pancho's youngest sister was raped 
  by the baron of the ranch where the family lived, so Pancho shot the baron and 
  headed for the hills. The house was built in 1914 and a tunnel connects this 
  house with one three blocks away providing an escape route when needed. The 
  house has a center courtyard with an orange tree. The rooms off the courtyard 
  display artifacts of the revolution and Pancho's life. Pancho was ambushed and 
  killed in his car in 1923. His chief wife, Esposa Dona Luz Corral, lived in 
  the house until she died on July 6, 1981. Since then, the house has been remodeled 
  several times, however all the furniture is original. The walls are covered 
  with white tiles half way then murals are painted on the remaining wall depicting 
  musical instruments, cherubs, and the like. During the revolution, Pancho's 
  tactics were to hit and run or a surprise attack. However, he lost a big battle 
  and subsequently fell back to regroup. He needed money for arms and decided 
  to rob a train coming from the United States. The train was guarded, but twelve 
  US citizens were killed in the raid. President Wilson supported the Mexican 
  dictator and ordered troops led by General Pershing to attack Pancho across 
  the border in Mexico. WW I interfered with capturing Pancho when US troops were 
  pulled back out of Mexico to fight in Europe. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="f-Gameros.jpg" width="198" height="136" align="left">The 
  <b><font color="#0000FF">Quinta Gameros Museum</font></b> is a beautiful house 
  built in the early 1900's by Mr. Gameros who made his fortune by mining silver 
  and marrying the daughter of the land baron that Pancho shot for raping his 
  sister. Gameros didn't live in the house long because the revolution started 
  and he feared for his family's lives and left Mexico. The house is built in 
  the Art Noveau style with large mahogany doors, inlaid wood floors, interior 
  open space with mahogany railings around the second floor, magnificent mahogany 
  staircase leading up to a landing with a complete wall of Tiffany windows. Another 
  set of Tiffany windows were in the foyer by the dining room. These 2x10 windows 
  depicted cherry blossoms and a Jeffersonian like monument. The dining room had 
  a gorgeous carved set of mahogany table and chairs. All the ceilings were decorated 
  and/or carved. The furniture is not original and the house is now a museum. 
  We did not care for much of the modern art displayed in several of the rooms. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Chihuahua State Capitol building 
  is a very ornate building covering a city block and facing a large park. Parks 
  here are not green grass parks, but places to sit and walk. The interior court 
  space is three stories high with the first story decorated using Doric columns, 
  the second using Ionic columns and the third using Corinthian columns. On the 
  first floor walls are murals depicting the history of the State of Chihuahua 
  from the arrival of the white man in 1535 until the revolution. There had been 
  86 Indian tribes in this area, but due to killings and disease they are now 
  reduced to only four tribes. No tribes live in the city of Chihuahua as they 
  were forced out of the area into the mountains and canyons many years ago. The 
  Mexican flag has a green<img src="g-ice%20cream.jpg" width="197" height="122" align="right"> 
  stripe representing hope, white stripe for peace, and the red stripe for the 
  blood of the Mexicans wining their independence after 300 years of Spanish rule. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Metropolitan Cathedral is in 
  the center of town and was built using tax money acquired for each silver ingot 
  mined in the area. The main entrance is ornately carved stone now protected 
  by wire mesh from the pigeons. In the square outside the cathedral were crafts 
  people and<b><font color="#0000FF"> ice cream vendors!</font></b> Nice treat!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The vista driving on to Cuauhtemoc 
  (Quee-tec) is a vast plateau surrounded by hills and mountains. As we approached 
  the city, we saw the huge apple orchards, rich soil, and irrigation system. 
  Around the mature apple trees are rolled up netting for prevention against hail 
  just prior to harvesting. This valley is very prosperous. Lots of farming equipment 
  - state of the art. We stay at the Loewen RV Park run by the Mennonites. The 
  Mennonites came from Canada in the 1920's and settled in this valley. They farm 
  and manufacture trailers and other a wide variety of local products. The campground 
  has good water and fair power. Funny about the electrical hookups... each site 
  is connected to the other site by a wire that runs across the ground - so we 
  are in series. The street lights around the sites have a wire running out the 
  bottom and over to the electric outlet at the site and plugged in with a regular 
  electric cord plug! </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Mennonites sell cheese, pies, 
  cinnamon buns, bread, vanilla, and quilts. Dinner at the campground building 
  was yummy starting with soup of grated veggies, slices of corn on the cob; salad 
  of avocado, tomatoes, cucumbers; pork and wonderful mashed potatoes and gravy; 
  dessert was a chocolate cupcake with whipped cream. The owner gave us a short 
  talk on how the Mennonites live in the area and introduced his family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The following morning, we drove 
  35 miles over to the staging area where the RVs are <img src="h-loading.jpg" width="210" height="128" align="left">loaded 
  onto the flatbed railcars. There are three sections of flatbed railcars awaiting 
  us, two with seven flatcars and one with eight to accommodate the 22 coaches. 
  The first RV is driven by the owner onto the first flatbed and then must carefully 
  drive across six or seven more flatbeds using the two steel bridges that the 
  train men place between each of the flatbeds. The bridges are about five feet 
  in length with a three foot flat area on the top. The bridges are about 18 inches 
  wide, enough to hold the tandem wheels of the RVs. The drivers drive up the 
  one side, <img src="i-loading2.jpg" width="200" height="129" align="right">across 
  the top and down the other side. The drivers have to be very careful going down 
  the one foot slope so the ramps don't snap up to hit the undercarriage of the 
  RV. There are two people directing the driver. One is guiding him/her across 
  the length of the flatbed and making sure the wheels are lined up with the bridges 
  and the edge of the flatbed. Doyle, our wagon master, was at each bridge telling 
  the drivers to apply power to get up the slope and to slow down getting off 
  each bridge. Everybody did great! No problems getting the 22 coaches boarded 
  in 2 &frac12; hours. We were on the second string of flatbeds and John had to 
  drive across six flatbeds. When we detrain five days later, he will only drive 
  across one flatbed. As soon as we are situated on the flatbed, the train crew 
  put the chocks by the front and back wheels and nailed a piece of wood down 
  to keep them from moving. Chains are also used to tie the front and rear of 
  each coach down to the flatbed. Everything is checked and double checked. We 
  were cautioned not to raise the RVs with their hydraulic jacks. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">During the afternoon, many of us 
  walk into the town to see what was there. La Junta is essentially a nothing 
  town with a pharmacy, some little restaurants, but mostly industry type shops. 
  We did see an Internet caf&eacute; and decided to check our email for $1.50/hour. 
  <img src="j-rvs.jpg" width="217" height="157" align="right">We boarded our tour 
  bus at 4 pm to head out of town to a restaurant/home that was in the middle 
  of an apple orchard - actually it was in the middle of no where! Dinner was 
  delicious and the tableware was beautiful. Dinner started with margaritas, followed 
  by cheeses, hot peppers, tomatoes, and bread; delicious apple soup; tender beef, 
  rice, creamed cauliflower and broccoli; and apple custard for dessert. We also 
  toured the lovely home attached to the restaurant. This afternoon, after our 
  walk into town, was our first day of rain. The rain continued into the night. 
  Coming back from dinner in the dark, we had to negotiate the six flatbeds back 
  to our RV by walking across the wet and slightly slippery train couplers. We 
  spent the rest of the night at the train loading dock. The overnight temperature 
  dipped to 43 degrees. Up in the mountains, the rain must have been heavy because 
  the streams were flowing the next day and there was a lot of water on the ground. 
  We, however, woke to a beautiful blue sky day and the train engines were starting 
  to arrange our train at 6:45 a.m. They had a problem with a track switch delaying 
  the operation for about 45 minutes. Finally, all of our train was put together 
  and the local train crew started to setup the next set of flatbeds for tomorrow's 
  caravan (Copper Canyon Adventure Tours) which arrived at the loading dock at 
  8:30 a.m. <b><font color="#0000FF">We finally got going at 9:45.</font></b> 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="k-caves.jpg" width="199" height="161" align="left">The 
  scenery on the first day of our train ride consisted of apple orchards, farmland, 
  and Ponderosa pine territory as we steadily climbed westward into the Sierra 
  Madre Mountains. La Junta, where the loading dock is located, is at 6,800 feet 
  and we parked our first night in Creel at 7,500 feet. On our first day we trained 
  for 113 km and had all types of weather - saw snow covered mountains, lots of 
  blue sky, and even hail for a few minutes! The weather was too chilly to sit 
  outside, so we were inside the &quot;room with a view&quot;. As we passed through 
  the countryside, we saw small primitive villages and larger towns such as San 
  Juanito, which even has a movie theater! Everywhere along the track, the kids 
  and even some adults would come running out to wave to us. <img src="l-tarahumara.jpg" width="204" height="173" align="right">Cultural 
  differences between our mobile homes and their homes were often dramatic. Our 
  first of three crossing of the continental divide was at 7,900 feet near Trevino. 
  We crossed several of the 36 bridges that we will cross on this trip and went 
  through two of the 87 tunnels. As we exited from the second longest tunnel, 
  we arrived at Creel and parked for the night on a siding. The local tour &quot;school&quot; 
  bus picked us up for a tour of the <b><font color="#0000FF">Tarahumara Indian 
  caves</font></b> where these Indians live and maintain their culture back in 
  the beautiful rock strewn canyons. For those of you who have read the &quot;Clan 
  of the Cave Bear&quot; series of books, we saw today how accurately Jean Auel 
  <img src="p-kids.jpg" width="136" height="190" align="left">portrayed the Europeans 
  of 10,000 BC. <b><font color="#0000FF">Many of the Indian women weave baskets, 
  do bead work, pottery, and make serapes to sell to the tourists.</font></b> 
  These Indians are very, very poor and depend on donations to maintain their 
  culture. However, they try to grow the crops they need to feed themselves despite 
  the ten year drought. Our tour bus took us to the Best Western Hotel in Creel 
  where we had margaritas followed by a great Mexican sampler platter for dinner. 
  During dinner, folk dances were performed by local students studying to be dancers. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">WOW!! Is this ever the neatest ride!!! 
  Our TREK really has a room with a view for sure! Just think about the type of 
  motor homes or trailers that are on the piggyback train. Motor homes have the 
  whole front 270 degrees for viewing as we train along. The 5th wheel trailers 
  have the bedroom in the front and the living room in the back. The owners have 
  to sit in their pickups to have a frontal view. Some 5th wheelers have big windows 
  and others with small windows, so they can see where they have been if they 
  stay in their 5th wheelers. The pickup owners with a mounted camper have no 
  big frontal windows and must also sit in their pickup in order to enjoy the 
  view. The temperature today was much too cold to sit outside on our &quot;deck&quot;. 
  We did stand outside for an hour later in the day. This morning the thermometer 
  reported 33 degrees!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We pulled out of Creel by backing 
  up into the tunnel from our siding and getting onto the main track. We left 
  town at 7:45 a.m. to start our climb to the highest point of 8,150 ft just before 
  the 583 km marker. We rode through pine country as we climbed through cuts in 
  the rock as the rail line circles up the mountains. Meanwhile, the paved road 
  to Divisadero snakes through the mountains. The sun is brightly shining through 
  the trees and burning off the mist. The engineering on this railway was quite 
  a challenge. Albert Owen conceived the railway that would be the shortest link 
  to the Orient, that is from Kansas City through Mexico to Los Mochis by rail 
  and then to the Orient by ship. In 1907, the railroad was constructed to Creel. 
  Then construction took another seven years (1914) for the railhead to reach 
  Divisadero. At the 591 km marker approaching El Lazo, the railroad <i><b>Tracks 
  to Adventure</b></i> circles around and crosses under itself thus coming downhill 
  around a mountain peak. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="m-J&C.jpg" width="195" height="154" align="left">This 
  was our shortest day of travel at 57.7 km. We left at 7:45a.m. and were in Divisadero 
  by 10:15 going through 12 tunnels. <img src="n-canyon.jpg" width="241" height="140" align="right">However, 
  another piggyback RV caravan was on the rails ahead. They were pulling out at 
  noon, but they repositioned our train and theirs and we pulled into the station. 
  Divisadero means &quot;outlook&quot; and that is exactly what is here. In fact, 
  the view rivals or exceeds the view of the Grand Canyon at the visitor's center. 
  There are<b><font color="#0000FF">awesome views of the Copper Canyon from this 
  point</font></b>. We were here for 24 hours and had a two hour bus tour of the 
  area taking us out to several vantage points to see the canyon. Eduardo, our 
  <i><b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i> guide in Chihuahua and Creel returned to Divisadero 
  by train to also guide us here. We all jumped on an old school bus and traveled 
  out to several overlooks into the canyon. The Tarahumara Indians also live in 
  this area of the canyon. Many of the women were making and selling their baskets. 
  Their children accompany them and when they are old enough they also try to 
  sell things to the tourists. After our tour, Eduardo then returned to his home 
  back in Chihuahua via a seven hour bus ride so he would be in time to meet the 
  next <i><b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i> caravan.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="o-JTrek.jpg" width="171" height="172" align="left">What 
  spectacular views here at Divisadero! The canyons are deep and most of the hillsides 
  are covered in vegetation. There are small rivers down in the canyons. There 
  are 4,800 square miles to the canyon which actually consists of five main canyons 
  (Copper, Urique, Sinforosa, Batopilas, &amp; Guaynopa). Urique is the deepest 
  at 6,136 feet, and all of these are deeper than the Grand Canyon (4,674 feet). 
  The distance connecting all five canyons would be about 900 miles. There is 
  no paved road beyond Divisadero towards the Pacific. The canyon is a result 
  of volcanic activity, eruption and cooling and later river carving. The three 
  rivers that are in the canyon will join into one and finally exit under the 
  Rio Fuerte Bridge. The Rio Fuerte is the reason for the great farmlands in the 
  delta.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We spent our second night at Divisadero 
  with an optional dinner at the hotel just footsteps from the train. Most of 
  us decided to cook in our coaches because the restaurant didn't open until 7 
  p.m. During this trip through Mexico, we are in a water conservation mode. We 
  use the minimum amount of water, use paper plates so we don't have to wash as 
  many dishes, and shower less frequently or use the campground showers. During 
  the five nights on the train there are no fill ups on gas, electricity, propane, 
  water, or whatever. Your generator recharges the batteries so you must be frugal 
  using the furnace when the nights get down into the 30's. Because of the altitude, 
  several people had propane flow problems in that they had no propane to cook 
  with or their propane generator wouldn't start. Our generator is a gas generator 
  and we had no altitude problems starting it. There is also no garbage removal 
  from our train. The next morning we were up and went down to the hotel to take 
  advantage of the two very nice rooms that were open to the Trackers for showers. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The hotel in Divisadero sits right 
  on the edge of the canyon and the location takes advantage of the spectacular 
  view with huge windows in the bar/lounge and dining room. Our breakfast buffet 
  at the hotel consisted of eggs, pancakes, refried beans, muffins, <img src="q-day4.jpg" width="241" height="132" align="right">cereal, 
  tortillas in sauce and cheese - with breathe taking views! After breakfast, 
  the Tarahumara Indians demonstrated three dances, a ball game where they kick 
  a wooden ball with their bare feet, and a women's game of throwing rings with 
  a stick up and down a course. We pulled out of Divisadero at noon with clear 
  skies and headed southwest to Bahuichivo which only took 3 &frac12; hours. We 
  crossed five bridges and went through tunnel 32 before we ended for the afternoon. 
  Warmth finally arrived as we dropped in elevation down to 5,444 feet. As the 
  train generally traveled and never exceeded about 28 km (12 miles) per hour, 
  <b><font color="#0000FF">we were able to sit in our lawn chairs on our front 
  deck and drink in the wonderful scenery</font></b> - deep cuts, rocky mountain 
  tops, tunnels, and bridges. We now see some cactus growing around the lower 
  parts of the hillsides. The weather is lovely. Our 3rd overnight &quot;campground&quot; 
  is just a siding on the side of a hillside where we could look down and see 
  boys playing soccer. We gathered around and had a social with everybody bringing 
  an hors de oeuvre. Let us say that our motor homes are 100% better equipped 
  than most of the shacks that we saw along the railroad right-of-way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Off to an early start on day four, 
  the last full day of the piggyback train ride. We woke up to a temperature of 
  37 degrees, but blue sky. <img src="r-bridge.jpg" width="141" height="198" align="right">We 
  have 252 km to travel today to Los Mochis and the Gulf of California. The ride 
  will take us eight to ten hours, thus this is the longest &quot;training&quot; 
  day. We started at 5,100 feet and were at sea level by late afternoon. We also 
  had the most tunnels to go through - 55 of them. In tunnel #40, we even did 
  a U-turn in the pitch dark! In the first 90 minutes of our trip today, we went 
  through 14 tunnels. There is electricity to most of the homes in this area along 
  the entire train ride. Many of the electric poles are made with old railroad 
  rails. Around the 735 km marker, the train accidentally separated between flatbed 
  four and five. The brake line blew. The airbrakes worked just as they should 
  and we all safely stopped. Remember, we are only on a 2% grade at maximum. The 
  forward part of the train then backed up and recoupled. Because of the lost 
  time, the entire train had to wait on a siding about 30 minutes until a passenger 
  train from Los Mochis passed us before we could continue. At the 755 km marker, 
  we went through tunnel #86 which is the longest tunnel on the line at 5,966 
  feet. Boy, was it ever dark!! By the 800 km marker, we were at 795 feet above 
  sea level. At 779.5 km (around noon) we crossed over the <b><font color="#0000FF">Rio 
  Fuerte River</font></b> which is the river that empties the entire Copper Canyon. 
  The bridge over the river is the longest, but not the highest on the rail line. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="s-rio%20fuerte.jpg" width="205" height="142" align="left">Shortly 
  after crossing the <b><font color="#0000FF">Rio Fuerte River</font></b>, we 
  left the canyon area and proceed across flat, but gently sloping land for another 
  six hours to arrive at our end point of Los Mochis. This area is a breadbasket 
  with corn, bean and tomatoes growing using irrigation ditches with water from 
  the Rio Fuerte River. Finally, the temperature is HOT!! After a month on the 
  road, we finally reached some warm weather. Now, we need an awning over our 
  moving train deck to protect us from the sun! We will probably complain about 
  the heat. All of the last day on the train, we sat out on the deck watching 
  the scenery and waving to people as we passed through the villages. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we approached Los Mochis, the 
  railroad tracks were lined with shacks, cattle, corn fields, bean fields, and 
  trash. Yup, trash&#133;the worse thing invented by civilization is the non-destructible 
  plastic as in bags, bottles, and containers. The garbage dump may have been 
  elsewhere, but most of the trash of &quot;civilization&quot; was strewn along 
  the railroad tracks. How very sad. Why is it that kids flock to the passing 
  railroad cars to wave? As we were coming into Los Mochis, sitting in our lawn 
  chairs in front of our TREK, we were waving on the left and right. Neither Caesar 
  nor Patton ever got a bigger welcome! Our arms were tired waving to all the 
  people. Kids and adults were out waving and yelling their greetings to us as 
  if we were conquering heroes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="t-driving%20off.jpg" width="199" height="153" align="right">We 
  arrived at Los Mochis at 5:30 pm and found only two unloading ramps. So the 
  caravan was split into two with eight cars on one ramp and the remaining fourteen 
  on the second ramp. Fortunately, we are #2 off the second ramp. Hopefully, they 
  will unload the first eight railcars off the first ramp and move the empty railcars 
  out of the way and split the railcars on our siding into two so that the last 
  seven RVs only have to drive over six flatcars to detrain. We observe that the 
  security guards came around the caravan to protect us for the night. As we looked 
  around the train yard, we have box cars parked on the left of us and shacks 
  on the right. Actually, when you looked closer at the shacks, they were converted 
  boxcars without wheels! I watched one lady do her wash in a tub with a washboard. 
  They did have a hose with running water as the only water available to them. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The drive off the flatcars was a 
  little less sophisticated than La Junta. At Los Mochis, there was a metal plate 
  at the last ramp to the unloading platform. However, four wooden railroad ties, 
  two for each set of wheels, with slopes cut at each end were the bridges between 
  the flatcars. Scrap pieces of wood evened out the height of each &quot;bridge&quot;. 
  Since there were only two off-loading ramps and only one team to help the RV 
  off, the detraining went slower than loading. The train crew finally split the 
  train into three parts so the maximum number of sets of bridges a driver had 
  to drive over, if they were the last RV, was seven. Everybody detrained (off-loaded) 
  successfully, with only a single &quot;almost calamity&quot;, and we are off 
  for the Colinas Resort Hotel Trailer Park that is only five miles away through 
  heavy across town traffic. Why do we detrain and deplane, but don't decar, deRV 
  or deferry?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We had the rest of the day to recover 
  and clean the inside of the RV before moving south along the coast of the Gulf 
  of California. Our lunch was a social with everyone bringing hors de oeuvre 
  to a lovely thatched hut next to the campground. That evening, <i><b>Tracks 
  to Adventure</b></i> treated us to an Imperial Shrimp dinner at the hotel above 
  the campground on the hill. YUM! During dinner, we were serenaded by an eight 
  man Mariachi Band - fine music and songs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="u-mazatlan.jpg" width="252" height="113" align="left">The 
  next morning, Wednesday 19 February, we caravanned on to <b><font color="#0000FF">Mazatlan</font></b>, 
  252 miles down the coastline in 5 &frac12; hours. The route south took us through 
  a veritable vegetable breadbasket where we saw fields and fields of corn, tomatoes, 
  squash, onions, and beans. <img src="ad-campground.jpg" width="209" height="154" align="right">We 
  pulled into the <b><font color="#0000FF">Playa Escondida RV Park</font></b> 
  located about four miles north of downtown Mazatlan. There are only two RV parks 
  that can handle caravans and this is a rather large park. We all are parked 
  in the back part of the park where we do have full hookups and the electricity 
  is reliable. We do have a swimming pool which is clean, but we have use of the 
  pool and facilities at the Sea Garden Resort just down the street. Many people 
  are filling their tanks with the Mexican water and adding Clorox. We still opt 
  not to fill our fresh water tanks with Mexican water. Instead, we use the showers 
  that are in the campground - not the best, but they did have hot water this 
  morning. We flush the TREK toilet with local water using gallon milk containers. 
  For our first night in Mazatlan, we all had a wonderful dinner (Mexican, fish, 
  or chicken) at the Hotel Playa right on the beach at the end of the &quot;Gold 
  Coast&quot; where all the hotels are located. When we returned to our TREK, 
  there was a USA Today waiting on our doorstep. We discovered that the east coast 
  had the &quot;snow of the century&quot;!! The Washington area got 30 inches 
  and Maryland was declared a disaster and anyone out on the roads were automatically 
  fined $1,000. How glad we are that we are here in sunny and warm Mazatlan!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="v-market.jpg" width="178" height="145" align="left">The 
  next morning by <i>Tracks </i>bus, we toured Mazatlan viewing the city from 
  the high vantage points, the 1938 cathedral, and checked out the <b><font color="#0000FF">old 
  market</font></b> in the center of town where they sell meats, fish, veggies 
  and all kinds of other things. <i> <b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i> has a contract 
  with the Hotel Playa located at the southern end of the Gold Coast. We had three 
  wonderful meals at the Hotel Playa, a dinner, a breakfast buffet and the Fiesta 
  Mexican featuring a Mexican buffet and a show. They also have a deal with the 
  Sea Garden resort just down the street whereby we can use their beach, get towels, 
  and use their pool. Lovely place! Mazatlan, of course, is a tourist town and 
  many Americans winter here in the RV parks, hotels, rentals, and timeshares. 
  A couple, who works with <i>Tracks</i>, are half timers down here in the park 
  and provide coordination for activities, tours, laundry, and other vendors selling 
  things in the park. We got our RV washed and waxed for $36, bought four pounds 
  of jumbo shrimp for $40, and two pounds of lobster for $12! A lady comes into 
  the park to cut hair or do nails for the women and a gentleman cuts the men's 
  hair. We found out that when the summer monsoons hit this area there is a lot 
  of destruction at the park. They invite these selected vendors to come in and 
  clean up and then they can sell to the Trackers and get paid for cleaning up 
  the park.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today, we scootered downtown and 
  stopped at an Internet caf&eacute; to do email ($2/45 minutes), then rode down 
  the ocean front road to outlook hill, road around the ferry boat terminal and 
  back into town. We stopped at the aquarium where they had a sea lion show and 
  a bird show along with the tanks of fish native to the Pacific. The wind has 
  picked up and there are white caps on the ocean and the temperature has fallen. 
  Supposedly, San Diego is getting a storm and we are getting the tail of the 
  winds. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="w-eggs.jpg" width="157" height="176" align="left">There 
  are a number of tours to take here in Mazatlan - Jungle Cruise, Stone Island, 
  Tequila Factory, and a village tour. We opted to do the Jungle Cruise which 
  cruises along the fishing fleet and into the mangrove lanes of Stone Island. 
  After an hour of slow cruising in a 30 passenger boat, we arrived at Stone Island 
  and checked out their wildlife - chickens, healthy male pig, and crocodiles. 
  We then hopped on a trailer pulled by a tractor and were taken to the beach. 
  A <font color="#0000FF">turtle nest</font> was found and the guide dug up the 
  nest and transferred the eggs to a safe place. Many of us enjoyed the lovely 
  beach where you could walk for miles. John and several other people went body 
  surfing. The water was lovely. Lunch was either a quesadilla or red mullet fish. 
  We had the delicious fish smoked on mangrove wood. On the way back, we fed the 
  pelicans and frigate birds that congregated around our boat. When we returned 
  to the RV Park, the deep sea fishing group had returned and we saw their picture 
  of the huge marlin Pat caught and had to release. They also caught tuna which 
  was cleaned for them. Pat &amp; Florence were so kind to share their fresh tuna 
  and beer with all of us, so we had an instantaneous party!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="x-ferry.jpg" width="238" height="179" align="right">Do 
  you know how sardines are packed in a can? Head to tail. Well, that is the way 
  our <b><font color="#0000FF">RVs were packed into the ferry from Mazatlan to 
  La Paz.</font></b> What a challenge! We really are finding out what the word 
  ADVENTURE means in <i><b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i>! We drove through Mazatlan 
  to the ferry dock at 1:30 pm and had to wait at the ferry for the processing. 
  While waiting, we were surprised when Peter and Mary Ann showed up. They were 
  driving by and saw our TREK in the caravan. We met these guys at the Trek Fun 
  Club Rally in Vermont last September. They are spending the winter here in Mexico 
  and six weeks in Mazatlan. So, we had the Mexican contingent of the NE Trek 
  Fun Club get together right there in the ferry parking lot! At 4 pm, we started 
  loading the RVs and trucks onto the ferry. All of the RVs were lifted by internal 
  elevator up onto the top deck and snuggled as close at we could get to each 
  other. We had just enough room to skinny out our doors and down beside the coaches 
  over to the stairwell. By 8 pm, we were all loaded with lots of trucks on the 
  bottom level and the 22 coaches on the top level plus several trucks and a car. 
  Surprise--we got dinner coupons! Oh what a treat&#133;refried beans (couldn't 
  find the beans, it was mostly juice), cold pork roast with hot gravy, and rice. 
  We kibitzed with each other for another hour or two and then we all turned in. 
  The seas were calm so the 15 hour ferry ride was not rough and we were able 
  to sleep through the night being gently rocked to sleep. We awoke to another 
  beautiful day and breakfast on the ferry - eggs with ham and onions, cool refried 
  beans, and bread. We understand the cost of the ferry is quite expensive. A 
  car is $400, so an RV is probably above $1,000. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There was a slower ferry with another 
  caravan of RVs that left four hours before us, and we arrived and docked before 
  they did. De-ferrying was easier than loading. Those that drove on front wards 
  had to back off including the 5th wheels. In several cases, an expert from the 
  ferry crew drove off some of the 5th wheels. With our TREK, we just did a U-turn 
  on the ferry deck and drove onto the elevator. After getting lowered to the 
  main deck, we drove off front wards with no problem. Customs, agriculture and 
  military inspection greeted us as we de-ferried. We surrendered our hologram 
  that we acquired for the RV as we entered Mexico 14 days before. Any citrus 
  or avocados were taken by the agriculture inspectors. About six military men 
  came aboard the RV, looked around, didn't really open anything, but appeared 
  to be more curious about the inside of the TREK, but of course they were checking 
  for unusual things that would contain drugs. Drug dogs were present, but didn't 
  do anything around the RVs. Actually, before we loaded on the ferry, we saw 
  the drug dogs searching cars that were bound for the Baja. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Surprisingly, the Baja is mountainous! 
  As we were steaming along on the ferry, we could see mountain range beyond mountain 
  range. We drove southwest along the Pacific coast for 120 miles to Cabo San 
  Lucas, the tip of the Baja. Beautiful scenery of both mountains and the Pacific 
  Ocean spread before us as we traveled along the way. We were later than usual 
  and arrived at the campground, Vista Bonita (old name was El Arco) at dusk. 
  Everyone got parked, ate dinner aboard their RVs and bedded down. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="y-cabo.jpg" width="284" height="130" align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Cabo 
  San Lucas</font></b> is a sprawling city with the hotels either along the harbor 
  area or perched on the hillsides. The shopping part of the town is nestled at 
  the bottom of the hills. Streets of souvenir shops and restaurants beckon the 
  tourist. We got to town via a <i><b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i> bus. <img src="z-boat.jpg" width="214" height="151" align="right">Our 
  <i>Tracks </i>breakfast, the first morning, was at the Finisterra Hotel right 
  on the tip of the Baja above the harbor. Beautiful views from the dining room 
  as we gaze westward out at the Pacific Ocean. We had a delicious buffet after 
  which we went down to the harbor to take a glass bottom boat ride. The ride 
  took us out of the harbor, around the rocks that divide the Pacific from the 
  Sea of Cortez. There were no fish to see via the glass bottom boat, but certainly 
  the <b><font color="#0000FF">scenery above the water was spectacular</font></b>. 
  We then were taken by <i>Tracks </i>bus around the southern tip of the Baja 
  where we saw more luxurious hotels, timeshares, villas, beaches, and even several 
  RV parks along the beach. We stopped in San Jose De Los Cabos, a neat little 
  town with lots of small shops and quality goods, located on the southeast side 
  of the tip of the Baja. John bought a pair of boots. We also found a Baskin 
  Robbins ice cream store and an Internet caf&eacute;! In the late afternoon, 
  John scootered down to Cabo San Lucas, but could not find access to the beach. 
  Beaches are difficult to get to because the hotels or private land block the 
  access.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our campground is about five kilometers 
  from the center of town and there is bus service for fifty pesos or five cents! 
  The next morning, a group of us went into town by bus and wandered around. We 
  stopped at the Shrimp Factory for a delicious shrimp lunch which actually became 
  our main meal of the day. Days are warm, but the evenings are cool as the breeze 
  blows across the Pacific. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After three nights at Cabo San Lucas, 
  we returned to La Paz via Highway 1 skirting the eastern part of the peninsula. 
  The highway turns inland through a valley between the mountains. We drink in 
  the dramatic scenery of the mountains on both the left and right. 6,000 feet 
  plus is the elevation of some of the mountains. We travel through the plateau 
  that winds around dry river beds and we climb up the mountain passes to an elevation 
  of over 2,000 feet. This is arid countryside, but when they do get hurricanes 
  or monsoons, the rain fills the rivers and turns these dry beds into torrents 
  of water. Essentially, we made a counterclockwise loop around the southern Baja. 
  Our next campground, Casa Blanca in La Paz, is quite nice with trees planted 
  next to every site. The bathrooms and showers are the best yet! A <i>Tracks 
  </i>furnished bus picked us up for a tour of La Paz first stopping at a weaving 
  store where they make blankets, table cloths, linens, shirts, and throw rugs. 
  La Paz is an industrial town and there is really nothing to see there except 
  the water front main road which is all closed for Fiesta this week. All kinds 
  of booths lined the street with food, trinkets, boardwalk type games, and entertainment 
  stages. The Fiesta starts at 9 pm and ends at 3 a.m. each night for a week. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Leaving La Paz the next morning, 
  we had a long day traveling the 200 miles through the mountains to Puerto Escondido. 
  We climbed to a 1,100 foot plateau of cactus stretching as far as you can see. 
  We traveled westward toward the Pacific then eastward to the Sea of Cortez. 
  The highway is a two lane road with nine foot lanes and six inch shoulders! 
  Lanes in the US seem to be at least ten feet wide. Sometimes the shoulders drop 
  off as we twist and turn our way through the mountains. The scenery is very 
  awesome! We are driving along the bottom of the mountains as if we were down 
  in the Grand Canyon. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We had an 18-wheeler trailing us 
  on the mountain highway then he starts to pass us taking advantage of the small 
  sections of straight road. He passed about 15 of us giving us all a hair-raising 
  adventure. Then he pulls over to the side of the road! We all saw him taking 
  a cigarette break and possible he had another person who needed a potty break. 
  The driver of the 18-wheeler then gets back on the road and proceeds to pass 
  us all again!! Around Ciudad Constitucion, irrigation allows farming of corn, 
  hay, and cattle, but otherwise the landscape is filled with cactus. By early 
  afternoon, we arrived at the Tripui RV Park nestled below the mountain peaks. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We took off at 8 a.m. on Saturday 
  for the 75 mile drive to a beach where we dry camp, dug for clams, and put our 
  boat in the water. We drove through more dramatic scenery as we skirted some 
  bays along the Sea of Cortez. Mountains loom in the distance and on the west 
  as we zig- zagged our way across the arid plateau. Mexico has a military checkpoint 
  setup about 20 miles out from Loreto where they check our wagon master, Doyle, 
  and let the rest of us through. Just 100 yards down the road is a sandbagged 
  bunker with a single soldier and his M-16. In case anyone tries to blow through 
  the checkpoint, he can pull a rope that drags a metal teeth studded barrier 
  across the road. All military checkpoints have the same barrier system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="aa-drycamp.jpg" width="231" height="134" align="left">Man, 
  is this part of the Baja awesome! As we drive around the boulders and cacti, 
  up and down, in and around, here and there is a sandy cove, there is one or 
  more RVs camped on the shore. We stopped at one of these sandy coves, <b><font color="#0000FF">Playa 
  Buenaventura Restaurant and RV Park</font></b>. Since <i><b>Tracks to Adventure</b></i> 
  has prepaid reservations, we get to park right smack on the bay front and displace 
  another tour group, Adventure Caravans to parking behind us! We also had reservations 
  at the small restaurant for dinner and the other caravan couldn't use it for 
  there was no room for them. This was a day of fun and relaxation. We put our 
  porta-bote together and launched into the water to the amazement of our fellow 
  Trackers. We puttered around the shore edges up and down the coast. The water 
  is soooo clear and comfortable for swimming. A bunch of the group waded in waist 
  deep and searched for clams with their toes. We had three buckets of clams in 
  no time. Two buckets were steamed and we cleaned one bucket of clams for clam 
  chowder. Carolyn made the chowder using Ivar's recipe that she found at Christmas. 
  Unfortunately, we could have used three times more clams, but everyone who wanted 
  some had a cup of soup. What a lovely spot to view the scenery!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dinner was at the little beach restaurant/bar 
  where we had salad and a very good spaghetti dinner. By 9 pm, we were tired 
  and ready for bed. It is unbelievable how much sleep we are getting - between 
  8 and 10 hours each night. Play hard, sleep long! We took off on day 24 for 
  a long drive back through the mountains to the Pacific coast and Guerrero Negro. 
  We hugged the shoreline and, at the 63 mile on our log, we stopped at Santa 
  Rosalia. The French mined copper throughout this area and the settlement knew 
  about an iron church designed and constructed by Gustave Eiffel which was in 
  storage in France. The town requested the building be sent to Santa Rosalia 
  and the structure became their main church. The cast iron panels were put together 
  to form a rectangular building with a domed ceiling inside. We parked the RVs 
  along the sea wall and walked about &frac12; mile into the town to see the church. 
  Leaving Santa Rosalia, we started our climb into the mountains on the narrow 
  roads. Our highest climb was to 1,737 feet and then we arrived on a vast plateau 
  surrounded by mountains. Purple, yellow and white wild flowers cling to the 
  edges of the road. The roads continue to be very narrow with essentially no 
  shoulders. Thus, when a large 18-wheeler or a bus comes at you, there are only 
  inches to spare between vehicles with a combined closing velocity of about 100 
  mph. There are also only inches between your tires and the edge of the precipice 
  on the right side. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two of our coaches had blowouts 
  today! We think that as they rode close to or fell off the right edge of the 
  road the tires were cut by the rough edge. One had two really wrecked tires 
  and rims on the 5th wheel on the passenger side and the other had a blowout 
  on the truck rear tire. Fortunately, when you travel in a caravan, there is 
  always help. Tom stopped and had a spare tire and rim and Darwin's spare needed 
  air from Pat's compressor and Darwin was back in business. Thank goodness no 
  other damage was done. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="ab-whale.jpg" width="222" height="174" align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">Today 
  was a whale of a day</font></b>! Today was whale watching in Scammon's Lagoon. 
  This World Heritage site is a large protected body of water off the Pacific 
  Ocean. Guerrero Negro is the little town that supports the whale watching and 
  a major salt industry. The Salt Works was founded in 1953 by an American who 
  eventually sold it Mitsubishi who now has 49% holdings with the Mexican government 
  having 51%. Over 20-25,000 tons of salt are processed per day and 99% of the 
  salt is exported via barges which take it from the protected lagoon area to 
  an off shore island where it is put on ships for transporting. Throughout this 
  protected area are over 300 pairs of breeding osprey either nesting on the ground 
  or on towers. This is very unusual to have osprey's nest on the ground. Of course, 
  there are no predators. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Over 1,800 Grey whales come to the 
  lagoon every winter not to feed here in the lagoon, but just to play, mate, 
  and calf. Of course, here in the lagoon, there are no predators such as the 
  Orca or killer whales. Scammon's Lagoon has a high density of salt which helps 
  the calves float and be pushed to the surface for their first breath after they 
  are born. The grey whales come to the lagoon around the middle of December and 
  leave around the middle of April. The adult whales weigh about 80-88,000 pounds 
  and the calf about a thousand pounds. The calf is 12-15 feet long at birth. 
  The gestation period is 11-13 months and science is still not sure of their 
  longevity. The calves swim beside the mom and nurse for nine months after which 
  they are on their own. The whale milk is about 75% fat. The grey whales have 
  baleen instead of teeth that they use to feed likea vacuum cleaner on the bottom 
  of the sea. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For our whale excursion, we left 
  the campground at 8 a.m. in the morning on an overcast day. <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="ac-whaleboat.jpg" width="229" height="106" align="right"></font><font color="#0000FF">Eight 
  to ten people are in each boat, built like old wooden lifeboats.</font></b> 
  We are dressed warmly. For the first 15 minutes we are speeding out to the lagoon 
  and the air is cold. When we get out to the lagoon area, we can see spouts from 
  the whales all around! The boat guide tries to get close to a pod of whales 
  so we can watch them cavort. The water is so clear that you can see the whale 
  as it comes to the boat and even underneath us. Since the whales aren't feeding, 
  they are not diving so you don't have much opportunity to see the tail flukes. 
  However, we see many, many of them playfully breach the water. Several of the 
  whales came up mouth first out of the water. We are so busy looking and pointing 
  and saying &quot;1 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock&quot;. Marvelous gentle animals 
  of the ocean! We saw the moms and calves playing together. They roll over and 
  over and you see their pectoral fins. We spent three hours bobbing around on 
  the lagoon feasting our eyes on the whales. Not many pictures were taken because 
  we wanted to see the whales and not see them via a small aperture. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Heading north for 144 miles today, 
  we drove through really desolate territory. We only have 450 miles to go until 
  the USA border. The only thing to see is the road, no buildings, no towns, no 
  gas stations, nothing! The first gas station we stopped at is just outside of 
  Guerrero Negro and only two pumps are working out of ten (we had already filled 
  up in Guerrero Negro). But, there was no gas anyway. The next gas station didn't 
  have any diesel and was a very small Pemex. We really need to have enough gas 
  for today and tomorrow for the distance between known gas stations is 196 miles. 
  We can't count on gas stations, for they can be here today and gone tomorrow. 
  Our TREK has about a 450 mile range so we do not have a problem. We drove 144 
  miles north from Guerrero Negro to a campground, Catavina RV Park just past 
  the Hotel La Pinta. We drove along a plateau with a different type of cacti 
  (boojum), very spiky with spikes or little limbs growing out the sides and a 
  yellow flower on top. Boojum is native and unique to the Baja. We passed huge 
  mounds of big boulders as we go through a very boulder strewn area. This is 
  the Central Baja Desert National Park. El Pedregoso, one of these mountains 
  of boulders is a landmark for the Baja 1,000 mile off-road race. RV number 9 
  hit a culvert next to the road and bent the two spindles on the back right wheels 
  of his 5th wheel. He was the one with the two flats yesterday. This should slow 
  him down to less than 40 mph, but, apparently, Darwin intends to keep up with 
  the caravan. Tonight is pot luck with Mexican hotdogs! </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Our campground, Catavina RV Park, 
  is in the middle of the National Park and was built by the government. Unfortunately, 
  the place has been allowed to deteriorate such that there are absolutely no 
  hookups (electric, water or sewer). We walked around the area and looked at 
  all the cacti, which unfortunately is amid all the rubbish. Ten of us piled 
  into Maurice's pickup camper to drive 1 &frac12; miles over to where there are 
  petroglyphs. We walked back in amongst the boulders and climbed to the top of 
  the hill and ducked under the overhanging rocks to a small cavern where the 
  ceiling has been painted with pre Spanish petroglyphs. The wind picked up and 
  the temperature dropped to 50 degrees by nightfall. Are we in Alaska or the 
  Baja?? During the night, we had a heavy downpour giving these cacti their annual 
  drink of water so they will be in bloom in a week or so. This was the first 
  rain on our parade since leaving El Paso.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Off on our 24th day north to Colonia 
  Vicente Guerrero amidst more desolate arid countryside with flat top hills surrounding 
  the plateau. We got back up to 1,565 feet. The scenery today is more cactus, 
  but certainly greener after the rain. We wound through the plateau and then 
  climbed up to about 1,700 feet and downhill into a farming area rich with produce 
  - tomatoes, cabbage, and lots of fields with rows and rows of plastic tents. 
  We have no idea what they are growing. The rain created lots of mud puddles. 
  The Posada Don Diego RV Park is back a dirt road about &frac12; mile - the road 
  is very rutted with lots of mud. This is the last of the white-knuckle driving 
  roads. The roads have been narrow nine foot wide lanes with rough edges that 
  will tear up a tire if you happen to drop off the edge. In addition, there are 
  no shoulders with two to 500 feet drops. The 440 miles of awful road extends 
  from Bahia Concepcion through Santa Rosalia, Guerrero Negro, El Rosario to the 
  outskirts of Colonia Vicente Guerrero. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="ae-baja%20season.jpg" width="210" height="160" align="left">The 
  following day, as we drive further north to Ensenada, the roads are better. 
  The shoulders are still narrow, but there isn't the steep fall off and there 
  are lots of places to pull over. The plateau is a great bread basket with strawberries, 
  vineyards, tomatoes, and other crops grown. We past through another military 
  checkpoint. Several of our coaches were searched - under the beds, looking for 
  false panels, and other possible hiding places. <img src="af-Jbar.jpg" width="187" height="171" align="right">We 
  were not stopped. When the military see 22 coaches blocking the road, they try 
  to deal with the convoy in an expeditious way and move us on. Our last two nights 
  are in the <b><font color="#0000FF">Baja Season's RV Resort right on the beach</font></b>. 
  This is a large campground with some seasonal USA people here. The beach is 
  wide, but the water is cold! They have a large pool - too cold for swimming 
  - and a hot tub that is not heated! Mornings are a great time for a stroll on 
  the beach. We toured Ensenada stopping at the <b><font color="#0000FF">Playa 
  Hotel </font></b>which was build in 1928 and managed for a time by Jack Dempsey. 
  People could come to the hotel and also gamble for it was the local casino. 
  Now the grounds and buildings are owned by the city and used for public events 
  and wedding receptions. <img src="ag-ensalada.jpg" width="185" height="156" align="left">Ensenada's 
  economic base is in tuna fishing, tourism, and farming. We walked through the 
  fish market admiring the displays of the shrimp, octopus, <b><font color="#0000FF">&quot;ensalada 
  du mare&quot; </font></b>(salad of the sea), and all types of fish. We bought 
  fresh absolutely delicious tuna and some shrimp, and smoked marlin. Our guide 
  told us to try the fish tacos. Hmm, sounds yucky, but they are delicious! Flour 
  tortilla, battered and fried white fish, mayonnaise, pickled onions, chopped 
  tomatoes/onions/cilantro, and if you wish chili salsa. Street vendors, shop 
  merchants, and restaurant people were all out soliciting our business - stop 
  and buy! The name of the city, Ensenada, means &quot;land between the mountains&quot; 
  for the mountains around the bay protect Ensenada from storms. The derivation 
  of Baja California comes from the time when Mexico sold the USA the land of 
  California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The peninsula of Baja California was retained 
  by Mexico because the US politicians said the Baja was useless. The word &quot;baja&quot; 
  means &quot;lower&quot;, so the land is Lower California. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The last and most important day 
  of the tour, getting back safely to the good ol' USA! We were on the road by 
  8 a.m. heading the last 45 miles north. We didn't cross at Tijuana, but instead 
  at Otay Mesa (east Tijuana) where customs are setup to inspect buses and motor 
  homes. We pulled about four RVs into the customs lot at the same time. A group 
  of the customs people came to each RV asking for passports, looking in the refrigerator 
  for citrus fruits, then the anxious &quot;goal oriented&quot; German Sheppard 
  came into each and every coach with his nose actively working to detect either 
  guns or drugs. We were through the border in 30 minutes and ended our tour with 
  a farewell by CB radio to our wagon master as we headed up Interstate 5. We 
  ended this portion of our journey at Fiddler's Cove, the Navy's Amphibious Base 
  FamCamp on Coronado. Our TREK is on a beach front site right on San Diego Bay! 
  Two miles north is the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge in full view of our &quot;Room 
  with the View&quot;!! We have a month to get back home.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This trip is our first experience 
  of caravanning. Some regimentation is required. Each RV has a number assigned 
  alphabetically. For this trip, John was number 18 and Carolyn 18 &frac12;. Each 
  morning at an hour before our scheduled briefing, the tail gunner checks every 
  tire by thumping them with a golf club; this of course is our alarm clock! After 
  showering, eating breakfast and decoupling our land lines from shore power, 
  we all gather at the wagon master's coach for a briefing of the day's drive. 
  The briefing starts out by a roll call by number. After the briefing, to correct 
  any errors in the printed log, we jump back in our coaches, zero our trip odometer 
  and the tail gunner directs each one to exit our respective camp site and follow 
  the wagon master in RV # 1. The tail gunner (#2) is always last. The road log 
  gives us the daily mile post number for each major turn, landmark, and Pemex 
  gas station. We used channel 14 on the CB to keep in touch with each other (#18 
  to #1 or 18 &frac12; to 16 &frac12;) and to be warned of &quot;topes&quot; (speed 
  bumps), vehicles on the side of the road, or other cautionary items like overtaking 
  18 wheelers on the narrow roads. As we drove into the next campground, the wagon 
  master parks us and we are all set for the night. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Campgrounds in Mexico are very basic. 
  Water, sewer, and electric are all you get some of the time. Few have picnic 
  tables, and rarely is there a tree. The ground is either sand or chipped rock 
  and, for the most part, the sites are back in slots and not pull through. The 
  bathrooms are again basic&#133;you always must wear thongs or beach shoes to 
  the shower. The only place to set your soap, shampoo, and razor is on the floor 
  of the shower. You are lucky if there is a hook or a chair to rest your dry 
  towel. The water is hot, but the shower head is old, old, old, with the water 
  squirting in various directions except down on you! For about $100, we could 
  upgrade the showers at each campground to adequate just by providing new shower 
  heads! In one shower stall, the electric light switch was hanging out of the 
  socket. All it would take is someone with a screwdriver to put it back in the 
  wall and then put a switch plate over it. But, &quot;the someone&quot; doesn't 
  do anything! The best campground we had was in La Paz - a dichotomy for the 
  town was a nothing - medium size shade trees by every site and tiled showers. 
  Electricity varies all over the map. John checks our shore power with a meter 
  before plugging in the TREK. The voltage ranges from 90-140. Thank goodness, 
  we put in the power management system last winter, for the system protects the 
  TREK from high (greater than 135) and low (less than 100) volts. At several 
  campgrounds we never plugged in to their &quot;power&quot;. Many times our electric 
  system switched off during the night when the voltage went bad. We didn't know 
  what a great investment the power management system would be! In Mexico, you 
  just have to go with the flow! When we entered Mexico, we set the refrigerator 
  switch on propane and left it on for the duration. We usually have the microwave 
  unplugged, but have used it a couple times when the power was OK. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">DirecTV satellite reception for 
  a normal US system was lost south of the town of Cuauhtemoc at Latitude N 28 
  deg 31.5 minutes. We regained TV lock at Salina on the Baja at Latitude 32 deg 
  4 minutes. DirecTV is using a smaller footprint to broadcast the signal so that 
  only the territory inside the US borders receives the signal. Spill over occurs 
  as you go north and south for a short distance. However, we saw RV's with special 
  larger antenna receiving DirecTV signals throughout our trip in Mexico.<br>

</table>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Go with a reputable caravan, 
    border to border, because the guides expedite the border crossings, military 
    checkpoints, agricultural checkpoints, and provide safety.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you opt to put Mexican water 
    in your RV, that is not purified water, you must add Clorox. Remember that 
    you are then showering and washing your hair with bleach.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Take a spare tire and rim if 
    you are going to the Baja for the likelihood of damaging your tires on the 
    very rough edges of the road (where there are no shoulders) is quite high.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Take an extra rear view mirror 
    and duck tape, especially for the driver's side, for the likelihood of being 
    side-swiped by an 18-wheeler on the narrow roads is high.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Credit cards are only useful 
    in quality stores and restaurants; otherwise pesos only especially for the 
    government monopolized gas stations. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot; Check shore power for 
    voltage, frequency, phase and proper grounding prior to plugging your RV into 
    shore power. If possible, install a monitor system prior to leaving home.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Set your refrigerator for propane 
    use &quot;only&quot; for the entire time you are in Mexico because the power 
    fluctuations could burn out a circuit board. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Minimize the use of your microwave, 
    for again the power fluctuations could damage it. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The narrow roads and white knuckle-driving 
    portion of the Baja is from Bahia Concepcion in the south through Santa Rosalia, 
    Guerrero Negro, El Rosario ending at Colonia Vicente Guerrero in the north 
    for a total of 440 miles. Gas stations are few and far between, the roads 
    are desolate except for the 18-wheelers coming at you. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Do not tow a car if going on 
    the Copper canyon tour for you will have no room to sit on the &quot;deck&quot;.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Do not put your RV jacks down 
    on the railroad or on the ferry. </font></li>
