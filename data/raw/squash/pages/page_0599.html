<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="4">(<a href="i-artichoke.html">Artichoke</a>)&nbsp; 
All commercially grown artichokes in the United States come from California, 
particularly the central coast where cool summers and mild winters provide an 
ideal growing area.&nbsp; The globe artichoke, a member of the composite family 
of flowers, is closely related to the thistle.&nbsp; If left to flower, the 
plants produce violet blossoms measuring seven inches across.&nbsp; The part we 
eat is from the immature flower bud.&nbsp; The edible portion of the &quot;globe&quot; is 
composed of the fleshy bases of the flower bracts (look like leaves) and the 
receptacle to which the bracts are attached, commonly referred to as the 
&quot;heart.&quot;&nbsp; Artichokes can be purchased all year long, but the best quality 
are available from March through May.&nbsp; Select artichokes that are dark 
green, heavy for their size and blemish-free.&nbsp; The globe should be compact 
and not beginning to open.&nbsp; Artichokes can be washed, placed in a plastic 
bag, and stored in the refrigerator for several days until used.&nbsp; To

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font size="4">(<a href="i-asparagus.html">Asparagus</a>)&nbsp; 
The parts of the asparagus that we eat are the sprouts.&nbsp; Once the asparagus 
sprouts begin to branch out, the stems become very woody, and actually will grow 
into a plant that looks like a little tree with small flowers and red berries.&nbsp; 
Select asparagus that is firm, bright green, and still tender (not soft) at the 
bottom and not dried out.&nbsp; The thickness of the stem will vary from 1/4 - 
3/4 inch in diameter at the base.&nbsp; The thicker ones have a tendency to get 
somewhat woody at the base, but the flavor is the same.&nbsp; It will store in 
the refrigerator for a few days, but we usually try to eat it no more than two 
days after purchase.&nbsp; When ready to use, before removing the market's&nbsp; 
rubber bands from the bunch, we cut off about 1/2 inch from the bottoms.&nbsp;

When we first saw white asparagus in the market, it attracted our attention.&nbsp; 
The first thing we did was compare the package nutrition information with that 
of regular green asparagus, and found that the white asparagus was less 
nutritious.&nbsp; It was promoted as &quot;gourmet white asparagus&quot;, but after 
tasting it, we thought it would have better been promoted as &quot;novelty white 
asparagus&quot;.&nbsp; It has an earthy taste with very little of the traditional 
asparagus taste.&nbsp; It is probably best cooked and served in combination with 
green asparagus. See our <a href="asparagus-cooking.html">asparagus recipe directory</a> 
for helpful suggestions. We could not find complete nutritional information for 
white asparagus.</font></span></p>

Cardoon is a perennial celery-like looking vegetable that is closely related to 
globe artichoke, and is a member of the thistle family. It is prized by people 
from the Mediterranean countries for its unique flavor, which we think is 
similar to the taste of artichoke.&nbsp; We have found that cardoon is usually 
only available in the markets around Christmas time.&nbsp; Many people discard 
the tougher outer ribs, but we have found that they have excellent flavor, too, 
if you don't mind throwing away the stringy remains, as one does with artichoke 
bracts (leaves).&nbsp; All the ribs in this bunch are edible, as are the smaller 
leaves. The new growth center stalks have a frilly top which is too tough to eat 
and should be removed with the larger outer leaves.&nbsp; The inner tender 
stalks can be eaten raw.&nbsp; Cardoon is best prepared by boiling in soups and 
steaming.&nbsp; We have also stir-fried cardoon in water.&nbsp; See the

Carrots are one of the staples in our diet.&nbsp; We use them raw as snack food, 
in salads, with dips, in veggie drinks and even in some fruit smoothies.&nbsp; 
Carrots are great in roasted veggies and in many other recipes.&nbsp; Select 
carrots that are firm and free of mold or signs of rotting.&nbsp; Since most 
carrots are sold in printed bags, it is important to look closely to make sure 
the carrots are in good condition.&nbsp; Store carrots in the vegetable bin of 
your refrigerator.&nbsp; See the nutritional charts for <a href="#raw">raw</a> 
and <a href="#cooked">cooked</a> carrots, and note the significant differences.&nbsp; 
This is one of the vegetables in which cooking can increase some of the 
nutritional attributes, and lower others.&nbsp; Our conclusion is that carrots 
should be eaten both raw and cooked.</font></span></p>

Collard greens are &quot;tough&quot;, so they are usually cooked, either by steaming or by

anytime, such as in a vegetable smoothie, where we only use a partial bag.&nbsp;

Garlic has its origin in Europe, but is now grown throughout the world, as the 
demand for its pungently flavored bulb has grown as an additive to cooking 
delights.&nbsp; Garlic is a member of the lily family, as are onions.&nbsp; 
Studies have shown that consuming about 10 cloves of garlic (or the oil from the 
same amount of garlic) a day reduces blood cholesterol LDL (the bad type) and 
increases the HDL (the good type).&nbsp; Our belief is that with a healthful 
vegan (no animal products) diet, much less garlic would produce the same 
results.&nbsp; See the nutritional chart by clicking on the photo or link.</font></span></p>

Sweet</a>)&nbsp; Sweet potatoes have either a dry light yellow or moist deep 
yellow or orange flesh.&nbsp; The darker colored sweet potatoes are sometimes 
called yams, which is a misnomer, as true yams are grown only in the tropics.&nbsp; 
We enjoy sweet potatoes baked, in roasted vegetable dishes, and in curries.&nbsp; 
Select potatoes that are firm and free of mold spots.&nbsp; A 100 gram (3-1/2

The most economical way to buy white potatoes is bagged; however, some of the 
potatoes are usually damaged.&nbsp; Carefully inspect as many of the potatoes in 
the bag as you can to make sure that there is no rot or mold, as it will quickly 
spread to the rest of the potatoes.&nbsp; When the bag is opened, remove any 
damaged or bruised potatoes and use them first.&nbsp; If buying loose potatoes, 
select the most perfect ones.&nbsp; Baked potatoes are great with many meals or 
they can be cut up on a greens and veggies salad, or used in numerous recipes.&nbsp;

Yukon gold potatoes were developed at the University of Guelph in Canada by

Most of the potatoes grown outside of North America are of the yellow flesh

blemishes and wounds.&nbsp; Some people claim that Yukon gold potatoes are more 
flavorful than white potatoes, but we haven't noticed any more difference than 
would be found in potatoes grown in different locations and soil conditions; 
however, since the Yukon gold potato contains anthoxanthins, bio-flavenoids that

Spinach is a soft-leafed vegetable with a pleasant, slightly bitter taste.&nbsp; 
Select spinach that is crisp and has a bright green color.&nbsp; Once spinach 
begins to wilt, it spoils rapidly.&nbsp; Since spinach is usually grown in sandy 
soil, it is important to clean it thoroughly.&nbsp; We suggest placing the 
spinach in a sink about half full of cold water and agitating the spinach to 
loosen as much of the sand as possible.&nbsp; Then thoroughly rinse each leaf 
under running water.&nbsp; Raw spinach is also sold pre-washed in bags, but we 
suggest that it be rinsed again before use.&nbsp; Raw spinach is a wonderful 
addition to a salad, and can be steamed, or cooked in a number of recipes
