<P>&quot;This time of year guests will be indulged with game like wild turkey,
guinea fowl, or even rabbit on the menu. Unlike standard Thanksgiving fare,
Lawson's cuisine is inspired. He masterfully preserves a sense of American
tradition, yet manages to</TD>

elevate country foods to haute cuisine. Be prepared for such openers as
an earthy, sweet butternut squash bisque, enhanced with apple cider cr&eacute;me
fra&icirc;che, subtly offset with the flavor of sage croutons; a crisp spinach
salad topped with succulent oyster fritters; or the especially delicious
house-smoked quail nicely accented with roasted vegetables. Oysters, found
on New England shores were used in Early American cooking, but are taken
by the chef to new heights, as are entr&eacute;es of roasted wild turkey
with pecan and sage stuffing, Atlantic salmon with wild mushroom polenta,
and venison medallions with braised red cabbage. Lawson points out that
the turkey comes from a third-generation wild game farm in Massachusetts,
while the quail is raised right there in the Hudson Valley.</P>

<P>Even the ubiquitous pumpkin has been transformed, with a ritual dessert
like pumpkin pie flavored sweetly with maple or perfected with a zesty gingered
apple compote. And the crustily topped pumpkin cr&eacute;me brul&eacute;e
is a luscious holiday treat. Chocolate lovers only have to scan the menu
to be assured their craving will be satisfied -- the chocolate roulade with
hazelnut cream or mocha profiteroles with warm chocolate sauce are out of
this world.</P>

<P>David has ensured that the inn's reputation for fine vintages is being
continued under his domain. Guests also can trust the house offerings of
Chardonnay ( a fragrant, smooth and light McGuigan Brothers from Australia),
or champagne ( a delicious New Mexican Gruet, ideal for celebrating the
season's abundance). The Selby Syrah and Hanzell Pinot Noir are good pairings
with winter's heartier provisions. The wine cellar also sports bars on its
windows, a reminder that the inn had been occupied by less fortunate guests,
when it was a county jail. Other incarnations included its years as a stage
coach stop and the residence of a Revolutionary War veteran.</TD>
