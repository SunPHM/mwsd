<p>Some thirty years ago, an international student from eastern Europe
remarked to me that what she found most intriguing upon her first trip
to the supermarket in the United States was the sight of bins upon bins
of fresh fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; There are times when I enter our
local markets that I feel equally intrigued, at times near paralyzed, by
the choices in the fresh food sections today.&nbsp; Grapefruit from Florida,
apples from Australia, blueberries, grapes, peaches, and nectarines from
Chile, fresh pineapple from Hawaii, bananas from Central America,&nbsp;
kiwi fruit, mangoes &#8211; and that&#8217;s just some of the fruit available.
<p>And vegetables?&nbsp; There are sealed bags of scrubbed baby carrots,
lettuces of all types, celery, cilantro, and parsley, cucumbers and jalapeno
peppers, hot house tomatoes, kale, and turnip greens, broccoli and cauliflower
cut up into crowns, bean sprouts, snow peas, green beans, eggplant.
<p>Do I need potatoes, and what type shall I try this week &#8211; Yukon Gold?&nbsp;
New&nbsp; red?&nbsp; Idaho Russet?&nbsp; How about cabbage for Saturday
night?&nbsp; Should it be winter squash or sweet potatoes or yams on Sunday?&nbsp;
They&#8217;re all there, I just have to make up my mind.&nbsp; It&#8217;s enough to
wish myself back into the 1890s.
<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s consider the cook at the turn of the century.&nbsp; Winter
fare in the fresh vegetable line would not pose too much of a problem because
she&#8217;s restricted to what can be stored underground, and it was mostly potatoes.&nbsp;
Well, she&#8217;s out of potatoes, but no problem!&nbsp; She has a&nbsp; pit
at the foot of last year&#8217;s garden, full of her own crop.&nbsp; It would
be a cone-shaped spot perhaps five to six feet in diameter, covered with
straw and soil and with a vent in the top.&nbsp; The vent would have had
to be kept free to guard against mold. A wary lookout for rodents would
also be prudent, since they could decimate the entire pile in short order.
<p>Lloyd R. Jorgensen explains in his memoirs, Growing up in Lewiston,
the process our pioneer woman&#8217;s husband or sons would go through to get
a basket of potatoes from this structure&#8211; aside, I would think,&nbsp; from
getting out to it through anywhere from a foot to three feet of snow.&nbsp;
First they would&nbsp; clear away the soil from the pile, then dig through
the straw to get at the potatoes, select enough potatoes to last for a
good while &#8211; because they wouldn&#8217;t want to go through this process too
often &#8211;&nbsp; then carefully replace the straw, cover the straw with the
displaced soil, being careful to keep the vent in place, and plow back
through the snow to the kitchen.
<p>Long time Lewiston resident, Dave Roberts, who was also a boy in the
1920s, remembers that an&nbsp;&nbsp; ax had to be used occasionally to
get through the frozen ground.&nbsp; &#8220;But you&#8217;d wait until the sun came
out, and most of the time you could break out a chunk of frozen dirt with
just the shovel.&nbsp; When you got to the straw,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;you&#8217;d be all
set.&#8221;&nbsp; Dave&#8217;s family dispensed with the vent, and he didn&#8217;t remember
any real problems with mold.

<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=-1></font></font></b>&nbsp;Lloyd
Jorgensen writes that carrots and red beets were sometimes pitted along
with the potatoes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Cabbages were pitted with straw and dirt,&#8221;
he adds, &#8220;leaving the roots sticking up so they could be pulled out of
the pit.&#8221;&nbsp; Dave Roberts says that pitted cabbages came out of the
trench just as crisp as when they were picked.&nbsp; I imagine in midwinter,
with the temperature registering around thirty below, that it would take
a bit of shoveling to pull out a couple of&nbsp; cabbages from the frozen
earth.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, it had to be a change from potatoes.
<p>&#8220;Apples were pitted by some people around here,&#8221; Dave says.&nbsp; &#8220;And
they kept pretty well, too, although once they came out of the pit, they&#8217;d
get soft pretty fast.&#8221;
<p>When our family first moved into this place in southwest Lewiston, there
was a root cellar located east of the house, under the Boxelder tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ethy was twelve or thirteen at the time, Jonathan was around eight, Melanie
was around ten.&nbsp;&nbsp; Melanie tells me that Ethy and Jonathan often
poked around inside it &#8211; it was fairly small, and empty of everything except
some derelict potatoes and a lot of leaves.&nbsp; They couldn&#8217;t entice
her, she tells me now, to set foot on the cobwebby steps since she feared
the area down there would be infested with spiders.&nbsp; And it probably
was.&nbsp; I imagine this would be a routine problem &#8211; the spiders, that
is &#8211; with any root cellar, even those with cement floors and walls.

<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=-1>The Bergeson root
Cellar, right before being leveled for a lawn, and right after the sheep
once again breached the pasture fence</font></font></b></center>

<p>I&#8217;d been taking photographs of the sheep during one of their many escapes
from the fenced-in pasture, and so hadn&#8217;t been concerned with documenting
the root cellar (above), much to my chagrin when starting this piece; so
the photos had only tantalizing pieces of the root cellar in the background.&nbsp;
But Melanie was able to consolidate two of them to show the entire cellar.&nbsp;
You can see now the slightly inclined door into the cellar, the mound above,
and the vent on the top.&nbsp; This and other root cellars like it were
some of the more primitive types, but were extremely important structures
at the turn of the century.&nbsp; The Bergeson&#8217;s cellar, situated on the
edge of the hill, would also keep fairly dry.
<p>Built partly underground, root cellar walls were usually of wood, or
at times of simply the earth itself.&nbsp; The walls&nbsp; extended to
a point just above the surface of the ground.&nbsp; The roof in the colder
areas would be covered with straw and soil, and a vent built into the top,
right next to the center ridge pole.&nbsp; Unless this structure were built
into the side of a hill, steps would be needed to get down inside.&nbsp;
Dave remembered having to crawl down into the root cellar in Malad, which
would have been in the early 1900s.
<p>Lloyd Jorgensen writes that their Lewiston root cellar held bottled
vegetables and fruits put up during the summer and fall before.&nbsp; Winter
squash was sometimes stored in the barn under a pile of straw.&nbsp; &#8220;Those
old Hubbard squash were so hard,&#8221; Lloyd writes, &#8220;that they had to be broken
with an ax, but they were surely good when they were baked.&#8221;

<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size=-1>End view of an
outdoor storage cellar, showing the frame of posts covered with planks
and with soil. Additional protection might have been given by placing manure,
straw, or corn fodder on top of the soil</font></font></b></center>

<p>Root cellars could also hold rows of cabbages, and keep carrots and
beets fairly well if the humidity were high enough to guard against the
vegetables&#8217; drying out.&nbsp; The floors of these structures were often
of earth, though the Jorgensen family&#8217;s cellar had a cement floor.&nbsp;
The entrance of this cellar&nbsp; stood at ground level, however, with
the addition of a gable over the door.&nbsp; There were four or five steps
down into the cellar itself.
<p>There might be barrels in root cellars filled with salt brine to store
bacon and hams.&nbsp; In the more swampy areas of Lewiston, food stored
in these cellars was kept up off the floor in order to keep it safe from
spring melt water which would invariably creep over the floor in some areas.
<p>Lewiston&#8217;s Renee Karren remembers her own root cellar when living on
1600 South where her son, Greg, lives now with his family.&nbsp; It, too,
had a cement floor, and though it wasn&#8217;t dug deeply into the ground, every
February the cellar would be sloshing with water.&nbsp; It was the source
of perennial spring exasperation with ground water. &#8220;We&#8217;d no sooner pump
it out,&#8221; she reports, &#8220;than it would be back in again,&#8221;&nbsp; The answer?&nbsp;
&#8220;We stored everything two feet off the floor!&#8221; &#8211; two feet being the high
water mark of the February thaw.
<p>The Cadillac of root cellars in Lewiston was built above ground, with
thick masonry&nbsp; walls.&nbsp; Dave Roberts remembers seeing as a young
man the root cellar attached to Delecta Karren&#8217;s house on 1421 South Main,
now owned by the Troy Karren family.&nbsp; This cellar can be accessed
from inside the house, is made of cement, is still used for storage, and
unlike the Karren root cellar less than a mile away, remains dry during
our soggy Lewiston springs.
<p>Masonry root cellars are still being used elsewhere in the valley.&nbsp;
Niels Bergeson built a root cellar under the oldest part of our house here,
and although it was from the beginning underground, a true cellar, the
fact it was built on the edge of the hill seems to have eliminated the
ground water problem.&nbsp; The walls are of huge rocks, plastered in between.&nbsp;
It&#8217;s an indispensable storage area for us; I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;d do without
it.&nbsp; However, the freezer&#8217;s down there, and much of our food storage
ends up in the freezer, as is true with most families today.
<p>Memories of storage pits and root cellars, then, join the other memories
of life 75 to 100 years ago.&nbsp; Nostalgic and fascinating for us to
read about as they all are, they find us not too eager to go back to experiencing
them as a way of life.&nbsp; Things like the one- or two-room schoolhouse
with the privies outside, for instance, the frigid sleigh and wagon rides
to church and work, the endless spinning and weaving in order to make a
shirt, and the home-made herbal remedies for truly life threatening diseases,
these are the things that serve as reminders of the toughness and ingenuity
bred into the women and men who settled and made their homes in the American
West.

<br><font size=-1>The book written by Lloyd Jorgensen and mentioned in
this piece, <i>Growing up in Lewiston, 1921 to 1939</i>, I&#8217;ve found to
be an engaging collection of Lewiston memories that should be an eye-opener
to the younger citizens of Lewiston as well as a source of nostalgia for
the long-time residents.&nbsp; His clear description of the root cellar
of his youth was the inspiration for this piece on storage, but the whole
book is great fun to read.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Georgia Jorgensen, Lloyd&#8217;s wife, has agreed to having
copies made of this book to place in the Lewiston Library and in USU&#8217;s
Special Collections, and we&#8217;ll follow up on this task right away.</font>
<br>
<hr>
<br><font size=-1>Many thanks to Venda King, Lloyd Jorgesen&#8217;s sister, for
the photographs of Lloyd.&nbsp; Thanks also to Dave Roberts and Renee Karren
for their root cellar memories and, as always, to the helpful people at
Special Collections at USU.&nbsp; Above all, grateful thanks to Melanie
Shaw for sizing and preparing the sketches and photographs for this piece.&nbsp;
