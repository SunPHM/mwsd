					<p><img src="images/mcalpine.jpg" width="200" height="335" border="0" align="right"><img src="images/dropt.gif" width="38" height="55" border="0" align="left">oday, I received a precious gift. I had the opportunity to accompany Mogens Nielsen to a privately owned shrub-carr fen in Jackson County, MI to photograph Mitchell's Satyr, <i>Neonympha mitchellii mitchellii</i> French.  We also hoped to encounter the Swamp Metalmark, <i>Calephelis mutica</i> McAlpine and Powesheik Skipperling, <i>Oarisma powesheik</i> (Parker). This was a quintessential Michigan butterfly experience and my first opportunity to observe <i>mitchellii</i> in the field. Mitchell's Satyr is a federally endangered butterfly with a very limited distribution. Its type locality is in southern Michigan, at Waklee Fen. The Swamp Metalmark was originally described by W.S. McAlpine; a classic Michigan lepidopterist who penned one of the earliest Michigan butterfly species checklists (McAlpine 1918) and the first, thorough article on the distribution and life history of Mitchell's Satyr (McAlpine et al. 1960).</p>
<p>We were in the fen from just before 10 until 11:20 am, and then again from 12:30 to 1:30 pm. It was very hot. High temperatures were 93 to 95F with heat indices from 95 to 100F. The degree day totals through midnight on 7/1 were 1550 DD 42F and 984 DD 50F. The soils in southern Michigan are currently very dry. Small tamaracks, buckthorn and poison sumac were widely scattered throughout the fen. Shrubby Cinquefoil was just starting to bloom as was Black-eyed Susan. A few closed, white, Boneset flower heads were visible. Swamp thistle was not yet in bloom, nor were flower heads readily apparent. The blackened tops of some thistle stems betrayed the presence of boring within, most likely <i>Papiapema</i> larvae.  </p>
					<p>We weren't 25 ft into the fen when we saw our first <i>N. mitchellii</i> of the day. It was flying weakly through the vegetation, just as Mo had described on the drive here. As we moved out into open carr we saw more satyrids. Mitchell's Satyr was the smallest and by far the most numerous of the four satryids flying here today. The other species were <i>Satyroides eurydice</i>, <i>Megisto cymela</i> and <i>Cerocyonis pegala nephele</i>. Our favorite satyr was everywhere. They were flying very, very low among 2 ft tall grasses and sedges, or barely above them. We found <i>mitchellii</i> in both drier open carr and wetter areas dominated by cattails and 4 to 5 ft tall rushes. As we walked through the fen, their density ranged from 1 to 6 butterflies per 10 sq. m., with an average of about 2 per 10 sq. m. Using my GPS tracks and MapTech's Terrain Navigator software, I later determined that we covered an area of 4.5 acres. It was fully occupied by <i>mitchellii</i>. Therefore, I estimate the colony size just in the area we surveyed is in excess of 4,000 butterflies.  We only examined a small portion of fen visible to us.  Other areas were blocked by treacherous terrain and water courses.  Later, aerial photographs revealed additional pockets of open fen in this complex that had not been visible to us.</p>
					<p><img src="images/mitchellii_02jul02.jpg" width="320" height="455" border="0" align="left">We talked to the property owner at length about the fen and his efforts to conserve his portion of it. His primary concern is removing tamarack and the invasive buckthorn to keep the carr from closing in. Eight work days with The Nature Conservancy are scheduled for this year. Interestingly, he has learned from local residents that up until the 1940s this entire fen complex was burned annually by farmers. Then, during the summer they would run cattle in the wetland. Just last year, the west end of this wetland complex was purchased by a cattle rancher. That property contains another open fen. Aerial photographs suggest that fen is larger than the one we were in today, and <i>N. mitchelli</i> has been observed there in the past.</p>
					<p>On our morning foray we saw a number of skippers including: <i>Ancyloxpha numitor</i>, <i>Polites mystic</i>, <i>Atrytone logan</i> and <i>Poanes massasoit</i>.  We did not encounter <i>O. powesheik</i>.  I saw <i>A. logon</i>, the Delaware skipper, nectaring at a grass pink flower, <i>Calopogon pulchellus</i>.</p>
					<p>As we followed <i>N. mitchellii</i> individuals around the fen trying to photograph them, both Mo and I commented that they didn't sit long. They spent almost all of their time flying within 2 ft of the ground, primarily among the dappled shade of the vegetation. Trying to photograph them was very frustrating. Around 10:50 am I started observing them resting on the vegetation more. By 11 am <i>mitchellii</i> had all but disappeared. They had switched to resting on the vegetation almost all of the time. Before we left the fen we looked around us. Now the apparent density was, at best, only 1 to 2 individuals per 100 sq. m., an order of magnitude lower than our earlier observations. What a difference an hour can make!</p>
					<p>We took a break and left the fen for water and shade. While resting on a shady deck in the property owner's front yard, we observed <i>Satyrium edwarsdii</i> nectaring on butterfly bush (var. Black Knight). Among the skippers in the front yard, Mo noted <i>Pompeius verna</i> and <i>Euphyes dion</i>. Later, I captured a squash vine borer, <i>Melittia cucurbitae</i>, nectaring on lavender.<img src="images/squash_vine_borer.jpg" width="300" height="215" border="0" align="right"></p>
					<p>Soon after we entered the fen for our second time, I encountered a male <i>C. mutica</i>. This was our first and only sighting of the Swamp Metalmark on this day. We also noticed several Baltimores, <i>Euphydryas phaeton</i>. We had seen 1 or 2 in the morning that were quite worn; however, these were immaculate. They must have eclosed just this morning. We photographed Pearl Crescents, <i>Phyciodes tharos</i>, nectaring on Black-eyed Susan. Both sexes were flying. I observed a male <i>P. tharos</i> tippling on open water from its perch on a bit of sphagnum.  In the afternoon, <i>N. mitchellii</i> were sitting in the shade amongst the vegetation. As we slowly walked through the fen, they would flush around us and fly a bit before settling back in the shade. During the day, we also saw a couple of monarchs and one large, orange <i>Speyeria</i>, probably <i>S. cybele</i>.</p>
					<p>The owners indicated that they had seen adult Regal moths, <i>Citherona regalis</i>, come to lights and their neighbor had found larvae. This species has only been recorded from three counties in Michigan -- Jackson County is not among them. So little time -- so many bugs.</p>
					<p><b class="h2tight">Postscript</b><br>
						Following our excursion I reread Badger's (1958) descriptive account of his search for <i>N. mitchellii</i> at Waklee Fen and other localities in Michigan and northern Indiana.  After many attempts and several encounters with Mitchell's Satyr over a two year period, Badger finally found himself in the midst of abundant <i>mitchellii</i> at Waklee Fen on July 7, 1956.  He estimated the density of this elusive satyr at the time around one butterfly per 50 sq. ft.  This translated to a colony population in excess of 5,000 butterflies.  I couldn't help but smile as I read Badger's account.  Almost fity years after his encounter at Waklee, Mogens and I just had an almost identical experience in another fen.  Even our density estimates were similar.  The primary difference between the two encounters is that while Badger found both males and females in abundance, almost all of the <i>mitchellii</i> today had been males. The site we visited won't even be at peak flight until females emerge in a few days.</p>
					<p>Mogens also lent me McAlpine et al. 1960 to read.  In it I learned that Hubbell and Pliske's field work on Mitchell's Satyr was done at the Sharon Hollow fen.  The exact location of this Michigan locality has since been lost and the present status of <i>N. mitchellii</i> at the site is unknown.  However, Hubbell and Pliske's description of the site in this work should provide the clues needed to rediscover this classic locality.  Such crumbs are the impetus for future excursions.</p>
					<p>As I sit here editing this entry, I realized that I'm scratching my right forearm.  Score one for poison sumac.</p>
