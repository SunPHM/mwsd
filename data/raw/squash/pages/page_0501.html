<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The squash bug, <I>Anasa tristis</I>, is common
throughout the United States. The squash bug will attack all members of the
cucurbit family but are most common on pumpkins and squash. Feeding, via
piercing/sucking mouthparts, occurs primarily on the plant foliage. However,
late in the season, squash bugs may also feed on fruit. The associated damage
symptoms include wilting of leaves and ultimately results in leaves that appear
black or dried out. </FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial">The squash bug can be misidentified as a stinkbug. Both
insects look similar and emit a distinct odor when crushed; however, the
stinkbug is not a pest of cucurbits and is more commonly associated with
tomatoes or various legumes such as soybeans and peas.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Squash bug adults (see image, left) are 5/8 in. long and
1/3 as wide. They are usually gray to black with the edges of the abdomen
having orange and brown stripes. Nymphs are 3/16 to 1/2 in. in length. Young
nymphs have a red head and legs with a green abdomen, however as the nymphs age
the red color will turn to black. Late instar nymphs will be greenish-gray in
color with black appendages (see below, left). </FONT></P>

Eggs are laid under the leaves from spring to midsummer and will take 1-2 weeks
to hatch. The eggs will become darker as they get close to hatching. </FONT>

shelter during the early fall under plant debris, around buildings, under
rocks, etc; nymphs will die off as temperatures begin to drop. The
overwintering adults will emerge in spring and will fly into fields when the
plants begin to grow. Mating begins in early spring, and the females lay eggs
until midsummer. After eggs hatch, there are five instars taking a total of 4-6
weeks to develop into adults. Nymphs commonly form groups at the base of the
plant or under the leaves but are also seen on vines or unripe fruit. They will
disperse quickly when disturbed. There is usually a decrease of adults for a
period in late summer because of a lag between the death of overwintering
adults and the development of new adults from the existing nymphs. There is
typically one generation per year in the midwestern U.S. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Squash bugs feed on cucurbits (vine crops) and prefer
squash and pumpkin. Both adults and nymphs cause damage by sucking nutrients
from leaves and disrupting the flow of water and nutrients, which can cause
wilting. Initially, before wilting, yellow specks will develop on the foliage
that eventually turn brown. Under heavy feeding pressure, small plants can be
killed; larger plants can have many affected leaves and vines. Subsequent
wilting can look similar to bacterial wilt; however, bacterial wilt is a
disease spread by striped cucumber beetles and is much more detrimental. Once
the squash bug population is reduced, wilted plants should recover. By
contrast, plants infected with bacterial wilt will continue to decline and will
eventually die. Therefore, it is important to determine which wilt is
occurring, and the correct identification of the insect pests present in the
field is an essential first step. Squash bugs will also feed directly on the
fruit, and it has become an increasing problem in recent years. Below is an
example of squash bug feeding on fruit, near harvest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The adult squash bug is difficult to kill, so early
detection of nymphs is important. The smaller the insect, the easier it is to
control. Threshold is reached when the average number of egg masses (meaning
groups of eggs) is greater then one egg mass per plant. Control measures should
be taken when the threshold is reached or when wilting occurs and the damage is
attributed to squash bug and not other pests or environmental conditions.
Seedlings, new transplants, and flowering plants are the most critical growth
stages to monitor, as these are the stages when the most damage can
occur.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">When plants look wilted, check under the leaves for
squash bugs and eggs. If the threshold is exceeded, the following insecticides
can be used: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The most recent edition of the Midwest Vegetable
Production Guide (see below) should be reviewed for updates in insecticide
recommendations. It is most effective to spray just as the eggs are hatching as
the small nymphs are more easily controlled. During bloom, sprays should be
made early in the morning or later in the evening to reduce the effect of
insecticides on honeybees or other pollinators. Preventative measures can be
taken to reduce the squash bug population by removing debris located in and
around the field. Destroying or removing debris should be done throughout the
season and is especially important during the fall to limit overwintering sites
for the adults. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">NOTE: To ensure proper use of insecticides, also refer to
the most recent edition of the Midwest Vegetable Production Guide (BU-7094-S;
cited below) and/or the product label.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Home Gardener</I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If only a few plants are affected, it is most effective
to hand pick and destroy squash bugs and eggs. Another option is to place
boards or shingles on the ground next to the plants. At night the squash bugs
will aggregate under the boards and can then be destroyed each morning. Using
resistant varieties such as Butternut, Royal Acorn, or Sweet Cheese and
maintaining a healthy plant through proper fertilization and watering are also
important to limiting squash bug damage. It is also necessary to remove debris
in and around the garden area that could possibly be used as shelter by the
bugs. As stated above, by removing debris from the area, overwintering sites
for the adults are reduced. Sevin is one of the few insecticides available to
home gardeners. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><I>Organic Control</I>: There are few if any effective
organic control options for squash bug. However, natural enemies of the squash
bug include Tachinid fly, <I>Trishopoda pennipe</I>s and Sceleonids,
<I>Eumicrosoma spp.</I> These biological control options may prove useful.
Sabadilla may provide some control and is organic certified. </FONT></P>
