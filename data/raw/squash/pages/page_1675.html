      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>NICOL TOUGHS IT OUT.<br>
        </b> Finally, I've seen a five game match between these two incredible 
        squash players. Indeed this is only about the third time they have gone 
        the full distance together. And if there were any justice in the world, 
        Peter Nicol would have won in three. He was getting the worst of the decisions 
        anyway but <font color="#0099FF"><font color="#006666"><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b><img src="photos/finals/NicolPowerT07.jpg" width="300" height="236" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"></b></font></font></font>leading 
        13-10 in the third the appeals ref gave Jonathon Power a let when the 
        referee had said No Let. Had the referee's decision not been overruled 
        Nicol would have been at match point. But….. well let's start at the beginning. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>PETER THE PERFECT </b><br>
        The place was packed to capacity - surely the overall attendance for the 
        week must have doubled over last year - and both players were giving nothing 
        away in their facial expression or body language.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> From the start their behaviour was impeccable 
        and Power was still John The Silent. There was little to choose between 
        the two in the first half of the game except one salient statistic: Power 
        made four errors while Nicol was error free. Gradually Nicol pulled away 
        to lead 9-5 and established an edge of superiority. They both know each 
        other's games and Nicol knows where and when Power is about to go for 
        a winner. Time and again he pulled a point out of the fire to continue 
        the rally. That edge and his error-free play gave Nicol the first game 
        15-9 in 16 minutes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <b>NO SIGNPOSTS </b><br>
        It would have been foolish to bet on the outcome at this point; there<img src="photos/wednesday/PowerTQ06.jpg" width="217" height="264" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
        were no cracks appearing and the two players continued to demonstrate 
        how well they knew each other's game. It was, as you would guess, squash 
        of a very high order using ever inch of the court including the height. 
        The gasps of delight from the spectators when a rally that seemed finished 
        was resurrected by an impossible get were many.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> Leading five three Nicol hit a forehand 
        smash into the tin…..his first unforced error and it came after 28 minutes 
        of squash. That's how you become a champion. Power hit a streak and got 
        9-7 with the help of highly contentious over-rules from the appeals referee. 
        Nicol showed a rare sign of frustration at the last one and shook his 
        head in disbelief. But he didn't allow it to affect his play and hit a 
        superb backhand drop to even the game at 11-11 all. Power was denied a 
        let and then said to the referee…."I'm appealing everything else." All 
        denied.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> At 11-12, Nicol got three strokes and Power 
        hit a serve into the tin to put Nicol two games up. This was now looking 
        like another 3/0 match. But things were going to happen.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <b>HIT SHOULDER - NOSE BLEEDS.</b><br>
        Power started cooking in the third and his nonchalant forehand flicks 
        were putting the ball into the nick to give him a comfortable 8-3 lead. 
        A couple of winners, a couple of errors from Power and as stroke and it 
        was 8-all. Then came the nose bleed. Whaaaat? Power left the court claiming 
        nose bleed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> "Wanna see the blood?" he asked a skeptical 
        referee. "Yes," came the curt reply. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Power wiped his nose with his hand and held 
        it up. Three minutes to stem the blood, announced the ref. Neil Harvey, 
        Nicol's coach,stood up and eyed everybody suspiciously. He has seen too 
        many antics to believe anything. Marty Clarke, the American squash champion 
        and a qualified doctor, was soon at Power's side. Why? Marty specialises 
        in knee injuries! Mike Way, Power's coach said Power had hit his shoulder- 
        or did he mean Power's nose had hit Nicol's shoulder. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>NICOL KEEPS COOL </b><br>
        Power returned before the three minutes were up and the game <img src="photos/finals/NicolPowerBT05.jpg" width="277" height="278" align="right">continued. 
        Nicol, unperturbed by the medical shenanigans took control to lead 12-10. 
        He hit a dream-like backhand drop from the back of the court and he was 
        two points from victory. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">And that was when the appeals referee decided 
        to have a mid-life crisis, hallucinations and vision problems. It was 
        an unforgivable over-rule from which Nicol could not recover. Mind you, 
        Power did hits some sizzlers: a dying cross court, another forehand cross-court, 
        and two backhand drops to put him at game point 14-13. A loose shot from 
        Nicol and another Power cross court saw Nicol not even try. The game was 
        almost 20minutes long and too much had happened to allow Nicol to keep 
        his concentration. And now Power was back in with a chance. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>FROM SIZZLE TO FIZZLE</b><br>
        The fourth game was point for point, but somehow the excitement had gone; 
        the crowd were quiet and the drama had dried up…..perhaps it had all been 
        too much. Power was now relaxed and started hitting his outrageous shots 
        and suddenly he led 12-10. Nicol came back with a cut cross court and 
        a stroke to even it up but Power hit an inch perfect drop shot, then got 
        a stroke to get to game ball. The game ended as Nicol did a full length 
        dive and failed to hit the ball. 15-13 to Power and we were into a fifth 
        game. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>ONE TOO MANY</b><br>
        Nicol said after the match that Power had had too easy a ride in the previous 
        rounds and couldn't take the pressure. He certainly faded just a bit and 
        that was enough for Nicol to use his greater fitness. Some tired errors 
        from Power when Nicol led 9-7 and the final result was inevitable. Power's 
        last hurrah was another perfect backhand drop to give him his eleventh 
        point of the game… but symbolically the next point ended with him slamming 
        a forehand into the tin to give Nicol the game 15-11 and the 110 minute 
        match. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">"I don't think I played that well and I 
        wasn't happy with my shots," said Nicol. He admitted that he should have 
        tied it up in the third but said Jonathon started playing well. "I won 
        because I was fitter. It was a good win for me and I will go to Antwerp 
        next week in a very positive frame of mind." </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>SARAH TOO STRONG</b> <br>
        Vanessa Atkinson played some fine, tough squash against Sarah Fitz-Gerald 
        in the final of this four-woman tournament and even led the super Aussie 
        7-1 in the third game, but was simply unable to keep up the effort and 
        Fitz-Gerald overtook her to win the the game 15-10 - the same score with 
        which she had won the first two games.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> "I got tired. Sarah keeps you chasing at 
        the back and I had to rely on winners and finally they weren't working. 
        I was happy with the way I played, but she is too tough," Atkinson, the 
        leading Dutch player told Squashtalk. Sarah, in accepting the winner's 
        trophy complimented John Nimick on the venue and tournament and hinted 
        that she would love to come back next year with another 15 'girls' for 
        a 16 player draw. <br>
