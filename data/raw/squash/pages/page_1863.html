<font size="+1">
<p>jasma apologizes for the first part of the notes.. windows locked up and she 
had to reboot.. so she lost all the notes at the beginning of the discussions.. 
when returning she did ask sis arianna if she'd hit the back button on her 
browser and go back and retrieve the notes.. ari did and got as many of them 
as she could.. and jaz truly appreciates that.. arianna.. thank you bunches.</p><br>
<p>the homework assignment was on fruits and vegetables.. tonight we covered 
vegetables.. starting with kort.. this is the description that jaz had down</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ Kort<br>
A large brownish-skinned, sphere shaped vegetable with a thick skin, usually six 
inches in width. It has a yellowish interior that is fibrous and heavily seeded.</p>
<p>then mistress galah mentioned something about it reminding her of urthen 
spaghetti squash, minus the brown skin.. and arianna didn't know what spaghetti 
squash was.. and quite honestly until jaz worked in a grocery store.. she didn't 
know either..</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ picture of a spaghetti squash<br>
<img src="http://www3.50megs.com/jasmatk/sp-squas.jpg"></p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ ok, still looking for katch...but what about some others, 
gor has some of the same vegies by the same name as urth...can you 
tell galah what these might be?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ this is what it says.. but it don't really say much..<br>
Katch<br>
A foliated leaf vegetable<br>
At the oasis will be grown a hybrid; brownish Sa-Tarna, adapted to the 
heat of the desert; most Sa-Tarna is yellow; and beans, berries, onions, 
tuber suls, various sorts of melons, a foliated leaf vegetable, called
Katch, and various root vegetables, such as turnips, carrots, radishes, 
of the sphere and cylinder varieties, and korts, a large, brownish-skinned, 
thick-skinned, sphere-shaped vegetable, usually some six inches in
width, the interior of which is yellowish, fibrous and heavily seeded.<br>
Tribesmen of Gor, page 37</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ **laughin herself silly as she sees jasma's picture** 
hehehehehehheeee heheheheheee yes sis, looks like korts to this one.</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ onions, peppers, mushrooms</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz is looking on another reference page too..</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ thanks jaz and you're right it don't really say much 
at all!</p>
<p>mooncry{GS}t~~~ a girl has always heard kort is a rinded fruit.. 
she didn't know it was a vegi. Is there a quote?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ peas, carrots</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ Kort<br>
A large, brownish-skinned, thick-rinded, sphere-shaped vegetable -
usually 6" in width. The interior is yellowish and fibrous, and heavily
seeded. pg. 37 of Tribesmen of Gor (book 10) ;rinded fruit of the Tahari;
served sliced with melted cheese and nutmeg</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ well, Master pictures katch as being a cooked vegie...
and jaz, that is a great quote, it mentions many of the ones galah 
just called for...</p>
<p>mooncry{GS}t~~~ ~cheerfully looks over the quote and grabs up a 
peace of rence paper, scrawling in her terrible handwriting this 
new information for future referance~</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ not really a vegie, but since it don't fit 
anything else, will study it too, how about tur-pah?<br>
guess katch might be used as a garnish tooo though? what ya think 
sisters?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ the other page says this:<br>
katch: (noun) foliated leaf vegetable similar to Urthen lettuce.</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ Tur-Pah<br>
A tree parasite whose red, ovate, leaves are edible.<br>
First she boiled and simmered a kettle of Sullage, a common Gorean soup
consisting of three standard ingredients and, as it is said, whatever 
else may be found, saving only the rocks of the field. The principal
ingredients of Sullage are the golden Sul, the starchy, golden-brown, 
vine-borne fruit of the golden-leaved Sul plant; the curled, red, ovate 
leaves of the Tur-pah, a tree parasite, cultivated in host orchids of 
Tur trees; and the salty, blue secondary roots of the Kes Shrub, a small, 
deeply rooted plant which grows best in sandy soil.<br>
Priest-Kings of Gor, page 45</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ aye, mistress galah, since it seems to be more of an urthen 
lettuce.. yet.. still a leafy.. jaz would think then perhaps like green 
leaf or romaine.. used alot as a garnish..</p>
<p>mooncry{GS}t~~~ oh dear *blushes* a girl has never heard of how to serve 
katch before! quick lesson how?? *bites her lower lip then stops..trying 
to stop that habbit*</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ what about turian olives, fruit or veggie?</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ would say a vegei, olives can be stuffed...???</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ yes jaz, but where did the other site come up with 
the conclusion about it being like urthen lettuce?</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ Katch : foliated leaf vegetable similar to lettuce. 
"Tribesmen of Gor" p. 37</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ also mushrooms, radishes, turnips..<br>
jaz would think turian olives would be a veggie</p>
<p>sis arianna found a page with a list of foods on it.. jaz will try 
and email the owner of the website to see if she can add the url to the 
slave discussion pages.. and she hopes it goes better than the last time 
that she tried to email one.. ~ss~ <font size="+2" color="red">UPDATE</font> 
jaz emailed the site owner and was given permission to place the link.. 
it's been placed a few posts down.. ~smiling brightly~</p>
<p>mooncry{GS}t~~~ ok, so we don't serve katch here?</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ the books speak of stuffed mushrooms but not stuffed 
olives...what would one stuff a turian olive with? what was mushrooms 
stuffed with?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ but then there are red olives as well and they are listed 
under the fruit section of jaz's reference page.. hehehehehe<br>
Red olives<br>
Grown in Tyros, presumably the same as earth olives.<br>
Clitus, too, had brought two bottles of Ka-la-na wine, a string of eels, 
cheese of the Verr, and a sack of red olives from the groves of Tyros.
Raiders of Gor, page 114</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ stuff mushrooms with sorp????</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ we serve katch sis mooncry, for its a gorean vegie, 
that is why we gotta sort out what it is...heheheheheeee told you this 
was an open slave discussion, for all to learn...</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ this is on the reference page that jaz has.<br>
Mushrooms<br>
No description given other than it was prepared as a stuffed mushroom.<br>
"Have a stuffed mushroom."<br>
Mercenaries of Gor, page 81</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ maybe they use katch to make a salad.. ????</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ that is not what the book says the mushrooms are 
stuffed with lara...says they are stuffed with tarsk<br>
this ones reference says page 83 of Mercenaries of Gor, concerning stuffed
mushrooms</p>
<p>mooncry{GS~FG}~~~ yes sis but HOW is it served? on what? with what? 
does a girl run into the servery, get a plate, grab a leafy piece of 
katch from the basket in the coolery, tear it to peaces in her tiny 
fingertips then toss it gently on the plate and scamper back to 
Master with a cheerful knowledge of a job well done?</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ ok , sisters, spill it, how do y'all find this stuff, 
lara just uses her brain and notes, she don't have any pages that 
tell her about the books//~pouts~ she is sooooo deprived</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ ok, what is the equiv. to tomotoes, if there is 
something there, we can make katch into a salad and serve with meats.</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ well, let's just use katch as a garnish beneath 
the slice of kort or a side garnish with other vegies should One ask
for a plate of vegies...radish, raw carrot etc could be served on a 
leaf of katch? works for this one...heheheheheee</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ ~knowing jaz is going to be late in posting this.. 
this is from page 83 Mercenaries of Gor..<br>
"What are they stuffed with?" I asked Hurtha.<br>
"Sausage," he said.<br>
"Tarsk?" I asked.<br>
"Of course," he said.</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ now we should discuss suls alil, for that is 
the most common....how should or could it be served?</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ lara, ari will whisper a reference page to you as 
she cant post it hre cuz she's not using her icon.</p>
<p>pet{Kli}~~~ *smiles lightly.. listening to the food banter*</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ sliced or fried and with maybe some bosk meat 
peas, beans and carrots</p>
<p>pet{Kli}~~~ the food topic outta pet's league</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ fried, mashed, baked..<br>
does it have to be different than how we'd cook them RT?</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ thanks ari, lara got it saved</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ well, the references that this one has says 
suls is often sliced and fried, or used in sullage...any other 
references from any of yous?<br>
ari, could this page be c&p into the discussion or is it to big?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ sul<br>
starchy, golden-brown, vine-borne fruit; principal ingredient in sullage<br>
sul<br>
a tuberous vegetable similar to the potato; often served sliced and fried</p>
<p>mooncry{GS}t~~~ this one feels it is best to be served the same as rt, 
the fimiliarity of how it works, how it is served, what it looks like, 
how it feels.. helps a girl to visualize what she is serving in vt.... 
at least in her opinion</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ it's a little big, can C&P a bit at a time if you 
wish....it's got heaps of stuff<br>
3 word pages mistress galah</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz would place the addy in the slave discussion notes.. 
but she'd have to email the site owner and get permission to do so first. 
(this is in the same reference as to what jaz posted earlier.)  <font size="+2" color="red">
UPDATE: </font> jaz emailed the site owner and they said it was ok to place 
the link on the page.. so.. click <a href="http://www.li.net/~swtangel/slave16.htm">
<font size="+2">HERE</font></a></p> 
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ and it's only veggies ari, or lots of different stuff?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ from the dictionary page at Tyros<br>
sul: (noun) a tuberous vegetable similar to the potato; often served sliced 
and fried. Golden brown. starchy tuberous root of the Sul plant (Not unlike 
the potatoes of Urth). One way of serving it is to break it open and fill 
it with melted Bosk cheese.<br> 
sul: (noun) starchy, golden-brown, vine-borne fruit; principal ingredient

<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ would like a description from each of you, what 
you think it looks like outside of our home of GS...turn your heads 
left and right and tell us what you see there also.</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ more description than that sis ari...picture in 
your mind each lil detail</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ hmmmm, lara looks she sees a lil cobble stone road 
like, with lil stands selling things along the docks...lots of cargo 
goin on and off ships, and cute Masters...</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ thats good sis lara, now look further...</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ *sapphire eyes look though the bars on the slave pen, 
staring at the gleaming green waters, surrounded on the landward side 
by the vast Vosk Delta Marshes. the smell of the raging thassa enveloping 
her, the salt ari washing over her skin. ships dock at the port, warfies 
fill the streets. there is a hive of activity going on outside. she 
turns back to face the others*<br>
this is way ari sees</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ there are lil stores on one side of the road, and large 
ships on the docks and out in the waters...she sees lots of P/people 
moving about, gettin task done quickly..she sees the huge sky...</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ good ari....does any know what section of the 
Thassa sea we are in?</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ it's night in Port Kar right now sis lara, what 
do you see in that big sky?</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ from ari's records we are located on the shores 
of the Tamber gulf, at the coastal edge of Thassa, in the northwest 
portion of the estuary of the Vosk</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ there are three moons...the night sky looks quiet to her.</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ very very good ari....yes, we are in the Tamber 
Gulf of the Thassa Sea...and yes, right where the Vosk River flows 
into the Sea</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ ~looking out the doors.. seeing the cobblestoned 
streets.. the canals.. dark eyes searching further down.. past 
the buildings.. the arsenal, the main piazza.. looking down the 
other way.. a longboat running along the canal.. many closing shops.. 
the skies coloring darkening.. a shiver runs through her.. slave steps 
back inside the room~</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ yes...there are three moons and they have names galah 
thinks...does anyone know their names? this one just can't remember</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ yes jaz, very good....mustn't forget the canals, 
Port Kar has many a canal....this is important for us all to have a 
mental picture where we are</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ lara has no clue to the names<br>
lara knows a few Masters in the tavern fly on tarns, are there many in 
this area that fly free?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz believes that only one of the moons were mentioned 
as being named.. and right now it's slipping through her brain.. but 
she's trying to remember</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ there could be the odd tarn flying over, think it 
wouldn't be very common though, they come from a different area sis 
and they don't like water anyway, won't go flying over water normally</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ "I looked up and saw the three moons of Gor, the large 
moon and the two small ones, one of the latter called the Prison Moon, 
for no reason I understood."<br>
-- Assassin of Gor, pg. 170</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ thanks mistress, she didn't think they were from these parts, 
aren't they more toward the moutains?</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ yes lara, they are more from the mountainous areas....</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ ok...we all know what we see outside our door....now here's 
an inside puzzle.....the description of our home describes the Captains chairs, 
the rest seem to be furs spread around tables....what does one do when told 
to sit upon the arm of His chair?</p>
<p>pet{Kli}~~~ *listening to galah..*</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ ooooohhhh pet, not done yet...we have miles to go...heheheheheheee 
heheheheheheheeee ooooooohhh, and the He she speaks of, is not a Captain.</p>
<p>pet{Kli}~~~ well shoot.. *laughs* blew that question..</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ point of this exercise is....what if we are told to do something 
that just don't fit with the picture in our mind?</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ hmmmm.. hard one sis.. jaz has never been asked to sit on the arm 
of a chair of Any..</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ what does one do when the Master describes something about how 
He holds you, or caresses you that just don't fit with what you are doing? 
heheheheheheee heheheheee</p>
<p>kalia{TL}y~~~ if kalia may say, mistress galah...just go with the flow...</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ well, it does happen jaz, happened to galah only about a hand 
or two ago....but that is only one example, galah is sure there has been times 
with all of you that it just don't gel in your mind...that it's just something 
that wouldn't or couldn't happen on gor</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz would post something like<br> 
~moving to the Master's side.. touching the furs..~</p>
<p>kalia{TL}y~~~ kalia means, change positions, do whatever you have to do to fit 
to Him...~hoping that made sense~</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ can ari suggest you take a look at Port Kar's homepage, and 
go to the tavern, there is a beautiful picture that our very own ja'dain drew 
that shows how a tavern would look *smiling*</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz's Master did that the other night to her.. when she entered 
she took off her silks before kneeling before Him.. then He pulled her on His 
lap and He reached under her silks.. she pm'd Him and mentioned she didn't 
have silks on.. ~chuckling~</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ yes kalia, exactly....galah sat on the arm of the chair 
as told then shortly after accidently slide into His lap heheheheheheheeeee...
jaz, galah was already beside Him on the furs, but then told to climb onto 
the arm of the chair</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ the description of the tavern in Gorean Shores is located at:<br> 
<a href="http://www4.50megs.com/goreanshores/tavern.gif">Tavern Description</a>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ ari has never been on the dias</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ makes it very difficult does it not jaz? what does one do 
if a Master takes the drink before you are finished serving? galah KNOWS that 
happens heaps.</p>
<p>kalia{TL}y~~~ change posts...that's what kalia had to do...~giggles~ kalia 
has had that happen to her....~snickers~...so she learned to wait for a 
response before making another post...</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ jaz, this is all galah got when trying to go to that link<br> 
I am sorry, but we don't allow hotlinking to files on our server from other servers. 
50Megs.com is to be used as a website service and not a place to store files on.<br> 
Thanks,<br>
50Megs.com</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ ari had it happen once, she continued on as normal and the Master 
in question said opps... I was too fast and laughed</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ give jaz two shakes and she will get the picture mistress galah</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ lara has gotten whispers before of the Master asking her how she is 
sitting on His lap so He doesn't sound silly...giggles.</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ if galah feels it's a new Master, One without experience, she 
ends her posting where she kneels before Him with a comment about drawing a 
breath before continuing with her serve, that sometimes helps.</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ yes it makes it very difficult mistress galah..<br> 
and she always does the finishing post of the serve anyway.. and waits.. 
if They don't respond to seeing They missed the last part of the serve.. 
jaz will just go ahead and take payment like nothing happened.. even though 
inside she don't like it..<br>
here's the picture of the tavern.<br>
<center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jo_iceangel/tavern.gif"><img src="http://www3.50megs.com/jasmatk/tavern1.gif" width="248" height="150"></a></center></p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ ok, the point being...the Master is always right...if 
it don't paint a picture in our mind, then we must overcome and work around 
it best we can....it's not for us to tell a Master He is doing something wrong 
ever....if He was to ask in whispers for help, then by all means help...but 
always in a respectful way and never tell Him He is wrong.</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ sis arianna.. the picture that ja`dain drew for Master 
Ruilan and those that call the City of Port Kar home is a wonderful picture.. 
yet.. this is the one that's on the GS homepage for Gorean Shores..</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ aaaaawwwwwwwwww thanks jaz....now would be a good time 
to discuss inside our home since we already discussed outside our home...
any questions about the map?<br>
sis jaz, will you be able to post that map in the slave discussion tooo? 
it might be of great help to many, painting a picture in ones mind is 
sooo important </p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ ari didn't realize we had a pic jaz, the only one she 
ever saw was ja's pic.</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz has had Master's apologize to her for taking the food 
or beverage too soon in a PM..<br>
she never is disrespectful to Any that she is aware of.<br>
yes, mistress galah.. jaz can post the picture in the notes as well.. she 
doesn't believe that Master Xern would mind.. and she won't even use His 
bandwidth.. she already uploaded it to her geocities homepage.. so she 
will use her own bandwidth</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ that map was drawn by Master Rollo, based on the 
written description by Master Xern....for any that enjoy drawing, we 
could sure use a more detailed picture of our servery tooo? any volunteers? 
heheheheheheeee heheheheeee</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ you're welcome mistress galah..<br> 
see that the last row of tables there on the left?.. the middle one.. that's 
the one Master Tyrik sits at.. He likes it the best.. LOL..<br>
tis ok, sis ari.. ~w~</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ ari cant even draw stick figures *laffin hard*</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ not lara, she cant draw worth squat...</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ jaz's artistic abilities are left to her poetry.. but her son 
can draw good.. for a 8 year old.. LOL</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ there's no lamp on that table sis, your Master like the dark? 
heheheheheheheee hehehehee</p>
<p>kalia{TL}y~~~ ~shaking her head no..~ kalia cannot draw either...</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ if someone writes a description lara has a friend that can drawl great</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ sis jaz, you got the legend that goes with that map? heheheheheeeee 
heheheheeee give galah an inch and she wants a mile</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ The rear section of the right half of the room is dedicated to the 
servery. A chest-high wooden counter, almost a bar, separates the servery from the 
rest of the room. On the rear wall of tavern, at the other end of the stone hearth, 
is the cooking pit, large enough for large hunks of bosk and tarsk meat to roast 
above the flames. A heavy iron vessel, containing paga, rests on the pit near the 
flames. There is a small cooking hearth as well, used for the baking of breads and 
melting of cheeses. The right rear wall of the servery has shelves and cupboard, 
and a small door which leads to the cool room, where certain food stuffs and drinks 
are stored, principally kalana. Near the servery is also a woven rence mat, 
where musicians might play or entertainers perform.</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ well this is ari's idea of the servery...<br> 
to the left is the serving counter, and its hig enough to show a bit of 
leg and a well rounded ass when you have to climb up. on the lower shelf 
is spices etc..<br> 
there is a long wooden in the centre around the table is the cool room 
to the right of the table is the fire pit area. that is how ari sees it</p>
<p>galah{GS~FG}~~~ this one must leave sisters....please work on any 
further discussion about the inners of our home.... carry on sisters!!!!!</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ any other things to discuss about the inside of Gorean Shores?</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ *looking to the waterclock* time is almost up, do we have 
anything else that needs covering?</p>
<p>lara{K}~~~ paga tavern?</p>
<p>arianna{SZ}~~~ ari has no clue what the sign says.</p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ this is the sign that hangs on the door<br>
<center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jo_iceangel/gslogo.jpg"><img src="http://www3.50megs.com/jasmatk/gslogo1.jpg" width="252" height="100"></a></center></p>
<p>jasma{Tk}~~~ ~looking at the ahn.. whispering softly~<br> 
jaz thinks time is about up for this week..<br>
~standing on mistress galah's soap box.. ~<br>
she would like to thank everyone for coming and showing their support to GS.. 
and taking part in the conversations.. please if you all think of something 
during the week to discuss.. try and remember it so perhaps we can get to 
that next week.. and continue to think about what the inside of the 
tavern and the servery looks like..</p>
<p>and slave discussions came to a conclusion at 21:00:02 pooltime</p>
<p>the pictures to the tavern and to the sign that hangs on the door can 
be enlarged if one clicks on them.. </p></font></center></i><br></br>
