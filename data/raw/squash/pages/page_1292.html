  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Silverleaf of squash and irregular ripening of tomato caused substantial economic losses to South Florida vegetable growers in the 1987-88 crop year. Losses were especially severe during the spring 1988 season. Irregular ripening had not occurred previously, whereas silverleaf has appeared sporadically in South Florida squash plantings for several years.</font></p>

  <p class="rgtxt"><b><font face="Arial">Description:</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Silverleaf symptoms appear first at the leaf veins, as opposed to interveinal silvering that is genetically controlled, and is common in many zucchini cultivars. Symptoms develop in the interveinal area so that the entire upper leaf surface is distinctively silver (Figure 1). Symptoms do not occur on the leaf underside.</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Silverleaf symptoms have been observed on very young plants with only three true leaves, on plants in later vegetative stages, and on plants during fruit production. All or some leaves on a plant may be affected. In severe cases, plants are stunted and fruit production is restricted. The disorder may appear on plants scattered through a field, on plants on one side of a field, or on all of the plants in a field.</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Some observations suggest that symptoms disappear occasionally, and plants resume normal growth. However, silvering is permanent in any given leaf in which it occurs, but it is developmentally reversible. Normal plants can develop new silvered growth and plants having silver leaves can develop new green growth.</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Fruit symptoms are not noticeable in cases of mild leaf silvering, however, when leaf silvering is severe, fruit color is lighter than normal. Yellow summer squash is very pale-colored, zucchini squash is light-green to yellowish-green, acorn squash is mottled green to yellow, and golden acorn squash is white (Figures 2 and 3). Yield reductions and poor fruit quality are usually associated with leaf silvering.</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Silverleaf symptoms have been noted on all types of squash (Table 1) but have not been observed in muskmelon, cucumber, or watermelon.</font></p>
  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">History</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Silverleaf of squash was first observed in Israel in 1963. It was defined as a distinct disorder differing from the genetically controlled leaf silvering that is common in zucchini-type summer squash (1). Further Israeli studies established a relationship between stress, especially drought conditions, and the occurrence of silverleaf (2).</font></p>

  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">Observations</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">The cause of squash silverleaf in Florida is not known. It does not appear likely that drought stress causes silverleaf here, as reported in Israel. However, stress induced by other factors may be related to the disorder. Extremely high populations of the sweetpotato whitefly are frequently noted in association with severe silverleaf. However, in recent studies where sweetpotato whiteflies were caged with squash plants, silverleaf occurred when as few as three adults per leaf were present. Therefore, it is thought that this insect may cause a physiological imbalance that leads to silverleaf symptoms by (a) direct feeding, (b) introduction of a toxin of some sort, or (c) by vectoring a heretofore unknown disease. No other biotic or environmental factor
  has been consistently related to the occurrence of silverleaf.</font></p>
  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">Current Research</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Research is currently being conducted at the University of Florida at Gainesville and at several Research and Education Centers to determine the cause of silverleaf and to develop appropriate control measures. Growers should advise their county extension agents of suspected cases of silverleaf for accurate identification and collection of crop histories.</font></p>
  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">Recommendations</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Because of the association between the sweetpotato whitefly and the occurrence of silverleaf, growers are urged to follow the appropriate cultural management guidelines discussed under tomato irregular ripening and to control the whitefly with labeled insecticides. Asana, Safer Insecticidal Soap, Thiodan, and Vydate are effective against the sweetpotato whitefly and are approved for use on squash. Always follow label directions for use of pesticides.</font></p>
  <p class="head"><b><font face="Arial">Tomato Irregular Ripening</font></b></p>
  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">Description:</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Color development during ripening is frequently lacking in one or more areas of individual fruit affected by irregular ripening. Color develops along locule septa and intermediate areas remain green or yellow (Figure 4). Overall, this pattern of ripening produces a star-burst appearance (Figure 5). With sufficient time, sometimes two to four weeks, nearly normal external color develops on most fruit. When cut, however, internal flesh is white or yellow (Figure 6). Since green fruit appears normal, the first indication of irregular ripening occurs when the fruit is removed from ripening rooms. After ethylene treatment, there is a vivid checkerboard appearance in the carton caused by some of the fruit that has colored normally and other fruit in which
  the color development is incomplete (Figure 7). Plant vigor and foliage appear normal, but occasionally may have virus-like symptoms. Irregular ripening has been observed on several cultivars of tomatoes as well as plum and cherry tomatoes.</font></p>

  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">History</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Ripening disorders such as graywall or blotchy ripening occur from time to time in Florida tomatoes. However, the incidence of these disorders is usually low because of the use of resistant cultivars, and can often be traced to faulty fertilizer application or some unusual weather situation.</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Irregular ripening occurred on tomatoes grown on the east coast, in the Homestead and southwest Florida (Immokalee-Naples) areas in the 1987?88 season. The occurrence of the disorder was much more severe in the Immokalee-Naples area than in the other two areas. No verified report of the disorder came from the Palmetto-Ruskin or Quincy production areas.</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">In southwest Florida, irregular ripening was first noted in mid-March, and was initially thought to be graywall. The disorder was soon evident throughout the area, and was recognized as being distinct from graywall. No reports of the occurrence of irregular ripening in other parts of the world could be found.</font></p>
  <p class="head2"><b><font face="Arial">Observations</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">The first appearance of irregular ripening was noted in some crops at first harvest, whereas in other crops it was not observed until the third harvest. Usually, there was an association between sweetpotato whitefly populations and the severity of irregular ripening. Because of the strong association between high populations of the sweetpotato whitefly and the occurrence of irregular ripening, it is thought that damage may occur from direct feeding of the insect, by introduction of a toxin which may cause physiological imbalances resulting in irregular ripening, or by introduction of a virus or some other pathogen. At this time the cause of irregular ripening is not known.</font></p>

  <p class="head"><b><font face="Arial">Recommendations</font></b></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Because of the association between the sweetpotato whitefly and the occurrence of irregular ripening, growers are urged to manage the sweetpotato whitefly as recommended by Price, Schuster and Kring (3).</font></p>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">The best sweetpotato whitefly management begins with sound sanitation and other cultural practices that may avoid, delay or lessen the severity of the problem. The following are some important points of cultural management that can have an important impact on the management of sweetpotato whiteflies in tomato crops:</font></p>
  <ol>
   <li>
   <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial"><b>Crop succession.</b> New tomato crops should not be established in or near fields or greenhouses presently experiencing a sweet potato whitefly problem. Cooperation for whitefly management should be established among neighboring vegetable and ornamental growers.</font></li>
   <li>
   <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial"><b>Whitefly movement into transplant production houses.</b> Transplant production houses located in regions where the sweet potato whitefly occurs should be enclosed where possible to exclude whiteflies. Do not wear yellow clothing or use anything yellow in production houses as sweetpotato white flies are attracted by that color and they may hitchhike on such materials or be attracted to tomato production houses.</font></li>
   <li>
   <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial"><b>Volunteer plants and weeds.</b> Volunteer tomato and other crop plants and weeds serve as excellent hosts for sweetpotato whitefly between seasons and during production. These plants should be removed from the environs of the tomato land well in advance of the crop.</font></li>
   <li>
   <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial"><b>Tomato transplants.</b> A field crop can be infested by whiteflies introduced on transplants. Therefore, transplants should be inspected to ensure they are free of the insects before setting.&nbsp;</font></li>
   <li>
   <p class="rgtxt"><b><font face="Arial">Post harvest activities.</font></b><font face="Arial"> Sweetpotato whiteflies continue to develop on tomato vines after harvest, even after irrigation to the crop has been terminated. These insects can infest other crops and weeds in the area and can serve as a reservoir for whiteflies in the following season. Insecticides should be used to kill adult whiteflies present on the plants when the harvest is complete. The crop then should be destroyed immediately with an approved herbicide.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p class="rgtxt"><font face="Arial">Where sweetpotato whiteflies have become a problem in a tomato crop, crop management practices will differ from those previously used. Such changes, especially new insecticides chosen and new insecticide schedules, can have an important effect on other insects and mites. In view of these effects, tomatoes should be scouted very carefully for various other pests and plans should be developed to respond to additional pest problems.</font></p>
