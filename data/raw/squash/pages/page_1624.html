      <b>James Willstrop</b> became the inaugural Canary Wharf Classic Champion, 
      beating Thierry Lincou 4-2 in the best of seven final, 9/7, 9/5, 5/9, 9/4, 
      9/10, 9/2 in 87 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Willstrop took a 2-0 lead, and for a while it looked like the Frenchman's 
      earlier exertions might have taken their toll. But Lincou fought back to 
      take the third, then received a couple of calls from the referee he wasn't 
      happy with as Willstrop took the next to lead 3-1.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Willstrop leads 3-1 ...&quot; was the historic call that started the fifth 
      game in this first-ever best of seven final, with Willstrop eventually 
      winning 4-2. <b><br>

      WILLSTROP:<br>
      A FLICK TOO FAR!</font></b><span style="font-size: 8pt"><br>
      “James was too deceptive for me! He possesses mobility in the lower arm 
      that is just amazing” admitted the defeated Thierry Lincou. “It’s so hard 
      to read his game, and James truly deserves to win.”<br>
      <br>
      And he meant it. <br>
      <br>
      “Super Squash”…. “Not bad at all”… “How did he do that?”… “What was 
      that?”….<br>
      <br>
      The vox pops were unanimous. Both players gave us some pretty wonderful 
      squash. But James Willstrop was playing that much better. Thierry put too 
      many drop shots in the tin. James’ game was solid, simple and structured. 
      Both of them went for lengths, precision and technique, and each added 
      each their flair for attacks, their patience, their intelligence of the 
      game.<br>
      <br>
      The crowd was behind James, that was to be expected, but actually was much 
      more divided than it was on Thierry’s game against Ong Beng Hee. I could 
      hear quite a few English accents “Come on Thierrrrrrrry”, “Come on 
      Frenchie” (bless them). <br>
      <br>
      And Lincou did win the crowd over when in the 5th game (James leading 3/1, 
      sounds weird, I know), he played 3 backhand drives that literally slowed 
      down and stuck to the wall. In all the matches I saw in my life, I never 
      ever saw such precision. He did 2 in a row, and just to make it complete, 
      did another one a few shots later. The crowd, all connoisseurs, were 
      absolutely gobsmacked and a thunder of applause saluted the end of the 
      rally.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, I have to say I was far from being impressed by the 
      Referee. In my opinion, and it’s only my opinion, he had a bad day. It 
      went to the point where it did look like he was biased, and I refused to 
      believe that. You know, Thierry is not the kind of player who asks for 
      lets for no reason, and he was refused so many it became ridiculous. Not 
      to mention some 'strokes' that not only were not awarded, but not even a 
      let was given. Mind you, he did the same towards James twice: two strokes 
      awarded to Thierry where honestly it should have been only a let.<br>
      <br>
      No, sorry, Ref, not a good match indeed for you today.<br>
      <br>
      The 5th game was long and high in emotions (and ref mistakes). Thierry 
      eventually won it very rightly indeed 10/9, but it went Deuce, Adv James, 
      Deuce, Adv Thierry, Let, Deuce, Let, Adv James, Let Let, Deuce, Adv 
      Thierry and finally game Thierry.<br>
      <br>
      The last game was just awesome. <br>
      <br>
      “I did 3 or 4 flicks that really took him by surprise”, James told me 
      after the game. “I flicked him from left to right, and from right to left. 
      I got in front of him, and when you succeed in getting in that position, 
      it gets very difficult for your opponent to get to the ball”.<br>
      <br>
      James won, and in such a brilliant fashion. He was up 8/1, and won the 6th 
      and last game 9/2.<br>
      <br>
      “I’m proud that I succeeded to get to the final. It’s a big opportunity 
      for a young player to get to play some of the best players in the world. 
      So I decided to attack in my game with Thierry, but in a measured fashion, 
      I really wanted to win! Sometimes, I got caught in his rhythm, as he likes 
      to slow down the rallies. I had to quicken the pace and shorten the 
      rallies so as to not let Thierry get in control.”<br>
      <br>
      During the event, young 20 years old James Willstrop beat a former World 
      Champion, a former world number 1 (currently word number 2), and the 
      actual world number 1. Obviously, I didn’t know what I was talking about 
      when I told you a few reports ago that James was about to become World 
      number 1. But what do I know?...<br>
      <br>
      His coach, Malcolm Willstrop said “James played very well, it was a very 
      good quality game. They played some very good lengths and cross courts. I 
      think James surprised Thierry. It was a very enjoyable match.”<br>
      <br>
      Hear Hear!<br>
      <br>
      So, one event gone, another one already started. I’m now off to Esporta 
      Croydon, to see some more squash.<br>
      <br>
      No rest for the wicked….<br>

      Peter Nicol is the perfect Ambassador for the game of squash. So many 
      times I’ve seen him going to Charity Events. He doesn’t stop. Tonight, it 
      was for the </span><b><font style="font-size: 8pt">Raynaud's &amp; Scleroderma 
      Association</font></b><span style="font-size: 8pt">, the disease from 
      which Peter’s mother died 12 years ago.<br>
      <br>
      So before the final, several pieces were auctioned, raising nearly £3000. 
      Star item was a rugby ball signed by Martin Johnson and George Gregan, 
      captains of the teams the 2004 Rugby World Cup Final [which England won 
      ... Ed], which alone got £1,750! <br>
      <br>
      </span><b><font size="4">NICOL: I’M NOT HAPPY<br>
      ABOUT THE NEW SCORING ...</font></b><span style="font-size: 8pt"><br>
      “And you can quote me on that one!”, said Peter Nicol after the last game 
      while talking to Sir McKenzie and myself. <br>
      <br>
      “I think the decision was hasty, that it should have been tried first. We 
      [the players] were not consulted, and I think it’s a mistake. Why couldn't 
      they wait for this tournament, to see how PAR to 9 would stand in a big 
      event?” <br>
      <br>
      He added; “The best of seven games final was just a test, and didn’t 
      really add anything to the game. It was only designed to give spectators 
      value for money, but because we gave them an exhibition game, the final 
      would have been OK as best of five.”<br>
      <br>
      When I mentioned that we were the ONLY SPORT where the score changes for 
      every event, time of the month, or weather conditions, the Boss concluded. 
      “We should only have scoring up to 9. The professionals would play in a 
      PAR system with deuce/advantage, and the non pro would play 'Standard' 
      scoring. Therefore, the score would always appear to be the same”.<br>
      <br>
      Sorry, PSA, but this is the first time in a looooooooong time that I've 
      heard a sensible solution.<br>
      <br>
      Now we know why the Boss is up there…</span></p>

      <br>
      “This week has been wonderful, I had a great time. Apart from yesterday, 
      that is. But I’m expecting to win tonight…” <br>
      <br>
      It’s with those words that the Boss, a very smiling<b> Peter Nicol,</b> 
      started the evening. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Alan Thatcher</b>, co-promoter and compere of the event, then commented 
      on the funny side of things, as here we had a Scottish player that was now 
      playing for England, and an Australian now playing for Scotland!<br>
      <br>
      You have to admit that it is surprising. “Let’s put the English in their 
      place” concluded <b>John White</b>, to the delight of the crowd.<br>
      “Hear hear!” I was bold enough to add loudly.<br>
      <br>
      Cheeky…<br>
      <br>
      The next 59 minutes were not a real match, but a wonderful exhibition of 
      skills and shots and hits and rallies from hell. The instructions were I’m 
      sure “We don’t asks for lets, we play everything”, as those two just went 
      for everything. Imagine what happens when you say to a player like John 
      White, “go for every shot”! Already, when supposed to behave himself, he 
      hits everything in sight… Believe me, whatever those guys are getting 
      paid, it’s not enough! White attacked the ball every shot he made, and 
      Peter retrieved as if his reputation was at stake.<br>
      <br>
      After the 1st game, won by Peter Nicol 9/6, Alan Thatcher asked John White 
      what was his game plan for the next one. “No idea” exclaimed the tall 
      Scot! And when the compere asked a spectator what advice he would give 
      Peter, a voice in the crowd shouted “Get a hair cut!”.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see, the atmosphere was aggressive and blood was about to be 
      drawn! <br>
      <br>
      In the second, Peter asked for a let. “No let” barked the referee. Both 
      players opened the door and stood there, pretending to be mad. “I could 
      have got to the ball, ref” said Peter. “He couldn’t get to the ball, he 
      couldn’t even see it!” retorted John. “He hit a drop shot, I hit a boast, 
      and he took a taxi!” No let, thank you” concluded the referee.<br>
      <br>
      Then, Peter asked another for let as it was obvious that he slightly 
      touched John with his racket while playing a left side boast. He started 
      an explanation, that the ref couldn’t hear, so he was about to explain it 
      again, and then stopped and just smiled “oh just forget it!”. Big John won 
      the second 9/4.<br>
      <br>
      “Well, not bad for somebody who didn’t have a game plan”, laughed&nbsp; 
      Thatcher. “I’d better stick to it then” said John, “it seems to work!”.<br>
      <br>
      In the 3rd game, won by John 10/9, Peter pretended to argue that one of 
      his shots was not up, and stood still. So John went to him while Peter was 
      still arguing with the Ref, took Peter’s racket, slid it the other side of 
      the court, where Peter should have stood to receive his serve, then as 
      Peter was still talking, took him by the hand and took it where the racket 
      was. It was not a sad moment, let me tell you.<br>
      <br>
      The 4th was outrageously John’s, even if it’s Peter who eventually won it 
      10/9. Triple wall boast? You want them, here they are; volley kills, 
      nicks, attacks, drives and crosscourts. That cannon speed-gun thing 
      couldn’t have detected half of them, and yet Peter was retrieving, 
      retrieving, and retrieving. <br>
      <br>
      It was beautiful. Funny yes, but beautiful.<br>
      <br>
      After a rally that last forever, John started slowing down the shots, and 
      so did Peter, and I swear that for a few minutes, I had the impression 
      that both players were playing in slow motion. It was actually an 
      impressive display of technical skills. The ball seemed to float, slowed 
      down, the lobs, the drives… Amazing.<br>
      <br>
      At Deuce, Peter serving, John pointed at the line to indicate to the 
      marker that Peter’s lob serve might have been out, and looked in the 
      direction of the 2 refs. Nothing to smile about apparently, apart from the 
      fact that he went on doing it for the whole rally! As Peter won it, John 
      started a discussion with the ref, who tried to say something about yellow 
      line, side wall, serve bla, bla, bla. Peter seemed baffled (we all were) 
      and said “What are you, what do you, are you confused? I’m confused!” It 
      was hysterical!<br>
      <br>
      But the best was still to come. First, for those who read my previous 
      reports at the Nationals and the Inter Counties, you know that I’m a ball 
      magnet. Well, in the last game again, the ball flew out of the court, and 
      it landed at my feet.<br>
      <br>
      What can I say! Even the ball can’t resist the attraction…<br>
      <br>
      And then, during the interval, Linda Davie (the cheeky Scottish tournament 
      referee) came and gave Ellery Hanley a rugby ball that the League legend 
      hid under his seat. Something was up.<br>
      <br>
      At 4/6 on John’s serve, Hanley threw the rugby ball onto the court. 
      Immediately, the two players dropped their rackets, and started fooling 
      around with the ball. John then asked his coach to come and join them.<br>
      <br>
      “Peter is going to stand there, I’m going to throw him the ball, and 
      you’re going to go through him” ordered John to the strong man. And he 
      did! He tackled Peter, and pinned him on the floor. <br>
      <br>
      Do I dare? Of course I do….<br>
      <br>
      </span><b><font style="font-size: 8pt">SOME GET ALL THE LUCK!</font></b><span style="font-size: 8pt; "><br>
      <br>
      And please, please Mrs Hanley, I AM JOKING.<br>
      <br>
      “No, no, you didn’t do it properly, do it again!” added John White.<br>
      <br>
      The match ended not long after this by a logical victory for Peter. I 
      think, and it’s only my opinion, that as a mark of respect for the 
      promoter, John wanted Peter to get the last point. I may be wrong, but 
      I’ll stand with my opinion.<br>
      <br>
      Only one not so pleasant thing - the smell of grilled fish for about five 
      minutes each evening while watching the games. Good idea to have some food 
      for the Sponsors up in the Gods, but next time, try and avoid fish 
      please….</span></p>

      As usual, a word about the referees. No incident to report, a bit of 
      discussion here and there, but nothing worth mentioning. So, just a list

      professional job.<br>

      Also, two people that are worth mentioning. Two volunteers, one who is 
      coming from far away just to help out and drive 
      the company van and the players back and forth, <b>John Whitfield</b>, who is 
      normally in the Sport Goods business. And <b>Ken Narain</b>, from Ilford, 
      that most of the players and spectators know as “the towel and door man”. 
      You know, the one who gets the floor dry for the players, and opens and 
      closes the glass door, who is actually a masseur for many of the pros, 
      like Peter Nicol.<br>
      <br>
      “Sir” McKenzie, Mr Squash Player, is actually coming to watch the finals 
      tonight, so, rejoice, the Master may report, and I can relax [Oh no, you

      Yes, 5.30.<br>

      Why, you may ask? Because there are two of us working on these reports I’m 
      writing. And if you think that my English is not that good (and you are 
      soooo right, but I can’t wait to hear your French…), you don’t know what 
      they look like before Steve Cubbins amends them! Yes, Steve is always on 
      stand by. He patiently waits near his phone to hear from me as soon as the 
      match finishes. He stays up late to get the reports I have had the time to 
      finish before going to bed, and wakes up as early as I to get the ones I 
      send him before he goes to work. And when there are events at weekends 
      like Inter Counties, or Wimbledon Cup, or Esporta tomorrow and Sunday, he 
      stays near his computer to get all the reports on line.<br>
      <br>
      So, there again, team work. Nothing gets done if you’re doing it alone. 
      Like for the players, like for organising an event, you need a team.<br>
