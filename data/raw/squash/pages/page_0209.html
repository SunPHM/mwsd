<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Home gardeners encounter many problems in producing high quality
vegetables in back yard gardens including identification of insects that occur there. This
slide set is designed to aid home gardeners in learning to distinguish between harmful
pests and insects that do no harm or are beneficial.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the first tasks is to identify insects found in the home garden.
It is also important to understand pest life cycles and to know when insects occur during
the season.</p>

Colorado potato beetle adult</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the adult stage of the Colorado potato beetle. It feeds on the
potato foliage beginning in early summer but causes little damage itself. Soon after the
adults become active, they mate and lay yellow eggs in masses of 10 to 20 on the
undersides of potato, eggplant, pepper, and tomato leaves. Handpicking and destroying
adult beetles from potato foliage is an effective control measure when just a few plants
are being grown.</p>

Colorado potato beetle young larvae</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newly hatched Colorado potato beetle larvae are dark in color as they
begin feeding on foliage. Soon they appear orange or red as they mature over 2 to 3 weeks.
Control measures are most effective applied when the larvae are very small. Sevin applied
as a dust or spray is very effective, as are the Neem-based products among the organic
choices.</p>

Mature Colorado potato beetle larva</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the time the larvae reach larval maturity, they have caused
significant damage to potato foliage and may limit the yield. When the mature larvae
finish feeding they crawl to the ground and burrow into the soil to pupate. Some emerge as
late summer adults to start a second generation but the numbers of larvae and damage
produced are small.</p>

Wireworm adult and larva</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wireworms pose a different type of problem. The adult beetle on the
left does no damage except to lay eggs in the soil in late summer that become tiny larvae
by the following spring. Larvae feed on many types of roots of annual vegetables or the
tubers of potatoes. Three to four years may be needed in the soil for larvae to develop to
the mature larva seen on the right in this photo.</p>

Potato damaged by wireworm</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wireworm damage does not occur in every garden. But when it does, this
is the type of damage caused in potatoes. Damaged areas may be cut away and the potatoes
still used, but wireworm damaged potatoes do not store well.</p>

Mexican bean beetle</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mexican bean beetles are a serious pest in Idaho and must be kept from
commercial growing areas. Adult beetles are shown in the upper left and lower left. They
are pale yellow with 8 black spots on each wing cover. Eggs are laid on the leaf and soon
hatch into the spiny yellow larvae seen in the lower right. Larval feeding damage can be
seen near the center in the upper right.</p>

Imported cabbage worm adult</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the adult butterfly that lays the eggs that hatch into damaging
caterpillars on the leafy vegetables. It does no damage itself. Spotting them around the
garden should be a warning that the damaging caterpillars will not be far behind.</p>

Corn earworm</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Insects that affect corn include the corn earworm, aphids, wireworms,
and earwigs. The corn earworm is the most important pest of garden corn and can be a
serious pest in some years. One egg is laid by the adult moth on the green silk of a
developing ear. The emerging larva penetrates into the ear and feeds on developing kernels
resulting in the damage seen here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b><a href="Home_&_Garden/aphids.jpg"><img border="0" src="aphidst.jpg" width="100" height="67"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aphids</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several species of aphids may be found on corn and many other garden
plants. They cause considerable concern from home gardeners. Usually they occur after corn
is well developed and the damage is unimportant.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b><a href="Home_&_Garden/squash%20bug.jpg"><img border="0" src="squash_bugT.jpg" width="100" height="67"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Squash bug</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main pest of squash and pumpkins is the squash bug. This pest feeds
on the main stem eventually killing the entire plant. The adult squash bug is about<font SIZE="1"> 3/4 </font>inch long (upper left). Eggs are laid on the underside of the squash
plant leaves (upper right and lower left). Emerging nymphs feed on the base of the plant
injecting their toxic saliva resulting in wilted leaves and dead plants (lower right).
Winter squash and summer squash are susceptible while melons and cucumbers are not usually
affected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b><a href="Home_&_Garden/tomato%20hornworm%20larva.jpg"><img border="0" src="tomato_hornworm_larvaT.jpg" width="100" height="67"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tomato hornworm larva</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tomato plants are relatively free of pest insects except for the tomato
hornworm. This large caterpillar is green with white markings and feeds on tomato leaves.
Usually the worms do not cause serious damage. Handpicking the larvae from the plants and
destroying them is the best control when only a few plants are being grown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b><a href="Home_&_Garden/tomato%20hornworm%20moth.jpg"><img border="0" src="tomato_hornworm_mothT.jpg" width="100" height="67"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tomato hornworm adult</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eventually the tomato hornworm caterpillars mature and leave the tomato
plant to pupate in the soil. Once development as a pupa is completed, the adult moth
emerges to lay eggs and start the life cycle again. These moths are often called hawk
moths or hummingbird moths because of their hovering behavior near flowers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b><a href="Home_&_Garden/grasshopper.jpg"><img border="0" src="grasshopperT.jpg" width="100" height="67"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grasshopper</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a few insect pests that may be found on many different types
of garden plants. Grasshoppers are general feeders and can quickly strip garden plants of
foliage when numerous.</p>

<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="Home_&_Garden/white%20grub%20adult%20and%20larvae.jpg"><img border="0" src="white_grub_adult_and_larvaeT.jpg" width="100" height="67"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
White grub larvae and adult</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">White grubs develop in the soil and feed on root systems and seedlings
of many garden vegetables. In well-established gardens, these are rare pests. But when a
garden area has recently been plowed from grassy areas, white grubs already in the soil
cause considerable damage during the gardening season. The adult beetle is shown in the
inset photo. White grubs are the larvae of June beetles and usually require three years to
complete development in the soil and emerge as adults.</p>

Spinach leafminer larva and damage</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The maggot form of a fly is the spinach leafminer. Eggs are laid on the
undersides of leaves. Newly hatched larvae burrow between the leaf surface layers. The
mines become large blotches as the larvae grow and eat more.</p>

<b>

Millipede damaged carrot</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Damage to tuber vegetables by millipedes looks like what is shown on
this carrot. They feed in cracks on the tubers making them larger as they go. Chewing
marks are not as large as those caused by white grubs or cutworms.</p>
