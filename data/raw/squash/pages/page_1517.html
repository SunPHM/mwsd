<P><B><IMG height=321 alt="Helen Compton" hspace=10 
src="images/helen_compton.jpg" width=193 align=left vspace=5 border=0>Helen 
Compton</B> is a 14-year-old student at Kirkley High School in Lowestoft, 
Suffolk, England. </P>
<P>Kirkley is noted as a designated sports school and Helen's main sport is 
squash - a game at which she excels, representing her county at national 
level.</P>
<P>People have encouraged her to write since she was very small and she has 
developed a love of the written word, spending a lot of her own time working on 
her stories. </P>
<P>She wrote her first book - a story about children's homes - when she was only 
eleven years old. The book we aim to publish shortly was written when she was 
thirteen! </P>
<P>Helen takes her GCSE examinations during the current academic year (2003/4) 
so her efforts will be concentrated on her other studies, to the probable 
detriment of her writing. But she has her whole life ahead of her and her dream 
to be published is soon to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>She has an amazingly mature head on her young shoulders and her subject 
material has not always met with the approval of her school teachers, 
particularly her use of basic English oaths. Hence her writing at school has 
been restricted to the literature many of us loved to hate when we were still at 
school.</P>
<P>However, Helen has a burning ambition to succeed as an author and possibly 
later as a film director and we are convinced we will see and read more of her 
works.</P>

<h5><span lang="EN-Uk"><font color="#820000">Synopsis</font></span></h5>
<p>This is a story about people; some related, some unrelated. They are all strangers in a small world yet their paths are inextricably linked by circumstances.</p>
<h5>Taster</h5>
<h2>Patrick</h2>
<p class="extract">&quot;Yes, I checked twice,&quot; he sighed, leaning over the blue suitcase, zipping up the corner. He saw his reflection in the black, shiny toggle, 
it was pale, old and very depressed. He needed a holiday and they were so close to getting one. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;Are you sure? What about the tickets? Are they in your wallet? You know how forgetful you are. Remember the holiday to Portugal? That was a 
bloody disaster and you know why,&quot; Angela nagged.</p>
<p class="extract">She was quickly cut off by her angry, tired husband. &quot;Because I forgot the tickets. Angela … sweetheart … that was ten years ago. Can we 
please drop the subject. I'm packed and we've checked everything a hundred million times. Can we just go!&quot; Patrick snapped. </p>
<p class="extract">Angela raised one eyebrow, made a slight tutting sound and stared at the map. Patrick knew he was in the right - she had been bloody annoying 
since this morning. She had been tense and uptight for the past four months and he knew she would never let it go. He wondered if he should apologise. No, he 
argued with himself. She's a silly, fussy old cow, who needs to be told. &quot;Sorry sweetheart, I didn't mean to snap. I'm just nervous. Once we're there we can 
relax and catch some sun,&quot; he crawled knowing he was being pathetic. But he had lost his pride the day he married Angela and, as long as she was happy, he could 
live a quiet life. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;Well, I'm only trying to help. In future, I just won't bother. If it wasn't for me, we wouldn't even be going on this holiday. I organised 
it all. You're useless!&quot; she shouted, raising her voice. </p>
<p class="extract">He did not want an argument but, with Angela, whatever he said would immediately start one. &quot;Honey please don't raise your voice. There's no 
need to get upset,&quot; he said patronisingly. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;I'M NOT SHOUTING, YOU'RE SHOUTING!&quot; She yelled angrily.</p>
<p class="extract">He stared into his wife's eyes and watched as they began to melt from ice cold spikes to warm puddles of goo. He had calmed her with a look. 
It was one of the few things he could do right.</p>
<p class="extract">She smiled and laughed quietly to herself. &quot;Aren't we silly? At each other's throats before the holiday even begins. Don't argue anymore 
Patrick. Let's just try to get along … hmmm?&quot; </p>
<p class="extract">He hated that damned annoying sound - the one which says I'm better than you are, I'm mature and you're a stupid little loser. &quot;Fine,&quot; he 
said bluntly, wishing he could add more but deciding to give up. Indeed, he'd given up years ago. As she marked pointless points on their already full map, he 
stared at her face. At sixty-two, she did not look bad. Her high cheekbones, blue, bright eyes and thick red lips were still distinct on her face and, like when 
they met thirty years ago, her hair had remained blonde and curly, still luscious and shoulder length. The odd grey had managed to slip in somehow and she had 
dyed it a lot but on the whole she wasn't bad for sixty-two. </p>
<p class="extract">He watched as small beads of sweat made a ring on her forehead and bunched together below her eyes causing her mascara to run slightly. 
Make-up was what seemed to fill most of their bags. How much make-up could one old lady wear? They were only going to Costa Rica for a week - not the fucking 
Miss World final! </p>
<p class="extract">All he could remember packing for himself was a clean pair of underpants and his toothbrush. He got used to packing light. He hadn't been in 
the army; he just never owned much and, anyway, he was always sure Angela would need him to take out his only spare shirt in order to squeeze in her eyelash 
curlers. </p>
<p class="extract">He fiddled with his tie, loosening it. Was it him or was it hot in here? He decided it was him. Their lounge was about as warm as the North 
Pole at night. He examined it for the millionth time.</p>
<p class="extract">Why did Angela insist on everything in their lounge being flowery? Every bloody cushion, curtain, decorative item or card had to have a 
flower on, usually a brown dead-like flower. When he was eighteen, he had visited his grandmother's house the day she was laying on her deathbed, opening her 
heart to him. He was staring at the bedroom thinking if I ever reach the stage where everything in my goddamn house is brown and has a flower on it I will kill 
myself. But look where he was, in a lounge in which hell probably looked more inviting. </p>
<p class="extract">He loved his wife with all his heart, but no longer enjoyed good times with her. His friends were all old and cynical and his house smelt of 
mothballs and cinnamon. He didn't want to a lonely old bastard with Angela at his funeral making a tactless speech, mentioning how he loved his kids, and her, 
and was a good man. He was, and he did love his kids, but he wanted to die a hero. He wanted to go out with a bang. This life was pointless, he wanted more. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;Are you sure you've got the passports?&quot; she asked, annoyingly.</p>
<p class="extract">Patrick suppressed a sigh and stared out onto the street. A BMW rolled past, its window slowly opening. As it lowered, he stared into the 
eyes of ...</p>
<h2>Antoine Delta …</h2>
<p>… looked at the elderly man sitting in a hunched position on the flowery couch. 'If I ever get like that, I'll kill myself,' he thought. </p>
<p class="extract">Thistledown Road - the height of boredom, he thought. Yet decent enough houses. Probably a load of expensive gear in there too. </p>
<p class="extract">The elderly man was surrounded by a shit load of suitcases and he appeared to be talking to someone just out of Antoine's view. Off on a nice 
relaxing holiday in the sun, Antoine thought to himself. Perfect! </p>
<p class="extract">As he drove slowly by, he made a note of the house name - Castle of Treasure. What a terrible fucking name, he thought as he sped up and 
disappeared down the quiet street. </p>
<p class="extract">He flicked back his long, glossy; black hair - held away form his face in a small hair tie - and admired his reflection in the mirror above 
his head. Hot, he thought. He was tanned, thanks to his sun bed, and he had a nice little goatee. </p>
<p class="extract">He turned out of Thistledown just as his mobile rang. The 'Nelly' song, 'It's Getting Hot in Here' filled his ears and with it a memory. That 
tune was the first song the hired DJ played at his most recent party - his twenty-third birthday bash. All his mates had been there and some pretty hot exotic 
dancers. Good times! He smiled to himself and snatched up the vibrating phone. &quot;What, I said no calls until I'm back,&quot; he aggressively barked down the phone.
<br>
&quot;Sorry boss, but that shit Cooper's gone left the apartment and took his clothes with him. What do you want us to do now?&quot; the meek voice replied, terrified by 
what the response would be. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;That little bollocks! George, this little piece of crap has been taking the piss for too long. Screw the money … just find him and kill 
him.&quot; Antoine said more calmly than he expected. &quot;And do it slowly, would you? Make sure he pleads and make sure he pisses his pants before he dies,&quot; Antoine 
ordered, smiling at the prospect. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;Cool, that's cool. But where will he be?&quot; George asked. </p>
<p class="extract">&quot;His brother's … he always bails him out. Kill his brother too. Little arsehole! But make sure you leave no evidence and be quick, George. 
I've got another little job for some of the guys. Send some over whenever you're done.&quot; Antoine did not even bother waiting for a response. </p>
<p class="extract">It was a hot day and some fine ladies were walking beside the car. He brushed his hair back, threw the phone onto the car seat and smiled his 
flawless smile, slowing beside them. &quot;Wow it must be difficult to look that good every day of the week.&quot; He smiled, his tone completely changed from the one he 
used during his discussion with George. The ladies were uglier than he had previously thought and considerably older - at least twenty. <br>
They giggled and edged nearer to his car. Antoine decided the best move was to turn the radio on loudly and drive speedily off. Which is exactly what he did, 
racing past them towards his flat </p>
<p class="extract">He felt a bulge in his trousers. Damn gun! he thought. Why did he always carry it? It was a major risk. Not just because of the police. If he 
leaned on it, it may blow his dick off. He wanted to shift it to the back of his trousers but if he did he would reveal it to the woman standing with her 
daughter at the traffic lights. </p>
<p class="extract">Instead he shifted his weight clumsily, and turned the music up louder. As the light turned to amber, he sped off, smiling briefly at …</p>
