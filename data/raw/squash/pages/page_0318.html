<P>Walking into the field house, one can't miss the construction that has been underway on the new squash courts. The courts, which will be completed in February of 2003, are conducive to the further development of Lawrenceville's squash program, as they will be up to par with international standards.</P>
<P>The new structure, adjoining the northern side of the field house, will consist of ten new courts, two of which will have seating capable of holding close to one hundred people. This addition will bring Lawrenceville's squash facilities up to date with the caliber of the program. Lawrenceville's squash team was one of the finest in the country last season, and the coming year's looks to be no different. Verdi DiSesa '04, varsity squash player, comments, "We have one of the top programs in the country, and now we finally will have the facilities to match it."</P>
<P>Having ten regulation courts will also allow more practice time for JV teams, further developing the program. When asked about how the new squash courts will affect his game and Lawrenceville's JV program, Ben Sussna '04 responds, "With our great coaching staff and the new courts, I hope to take my game to the next level. The depth of our teams will allow us to be even more competitive against the Philadelphia powerhouses at the JV level." </P>
<P>The varsity coach, Interdisciplinary Department Chair Matthew Miller, is eagerly awaiting the completion of the construction: "We're very excited about the new courts and the potential for growth that comes with them. We will be able to host national and international events and compete with the best talent out there."</P>
