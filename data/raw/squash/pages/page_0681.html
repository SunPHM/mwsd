            When summer harvests are at their peak, 
            every kitchen gardener can relate to the happy challenge of putting 
            all that great produce to good use. If you really have a surplus, 
            give a call to local homeless shelters or ask your local 
            Agricultural Extension office if your community has a ”Plant a Row 
            For the Hungry” program as these organizations are set up to help 
            distribute fresh food to those who need and want it.<br>
            <br>
            In our 
            own kitchens, hot weather and a focus on the garden makes us all 
            look forward to lighter, fresh tasting meals. It’s a perfect time to 
            bring your vegetables to the center of the table and feature them in 
            colorful satisfying main dishes. All over the country both good home 
            cooks and innovative chefs are recognizing that using fresh 
            vegetables and herbs as the centerpiece of a meal is a practice of 
            long standing in many of the world’s great food styles. If you enjoy 
            Mediterranean, Indian or Chinese meals, for example, you already 
            know that vegetables are the key ingredients in their most delicious 
            dishes. The range of flavors you’ll find in your “pick of the crop” 
            summer vegetables can add a whole new dimension to everyday as well 
            as special occasion lunches and dinners.</p>

            <p style="margin-right: 10">One great way to use extra summer squash is to cut them in half 
        lengthwise and scoop out their flesh (saving it for another use). Use 
        the zucchini shells as holders for your favorite fresh homemade ravioli 
        filling mixture, then cover and bake until tender and top with fresh 
        tomato or cheese sauce. <br>
        <br>
        Or make zucchini pizza: slice the squash into thin ¼ inch slices and 
        brush with olive oil then bake at 400 degrees about 5-7 minutes, just 
        till tender. Top with well-seasoned pizza sauce, fresh chopped basil and 
        grated cheese and pop under the broiler for a few minutes until the 
        toppings are hot and bubbly This is a sure-fire way for kids of all ages 
        to eat zucchini!

            <img border="0" src="../seeds/art/vegies115/chard-bright_5610.jpg" align="left" width="115" height="102">Many of us are familiar with traditional stuffed cabbage rolls but try 
        some variations using the abundant bright green leaves of nutritious, 
        tasty Swiss chard. Cut out the chard stems and reserve. Then dip the 
        leaves briefly in a big pot of boiling water to make them limp. Put a 
        tablespoon of stuffing in the center of each leaf, tuck over the ends 
        and roll up the leaves like fat cigars.&nbsp; A filling made of a rice 
        mixture seasoned with sautéed garlic and onion, fresh chopped herbs, 
        lemon juice and toasted chopped nuts is delicious. Another filling I 
        like is a combination of rice, sautéed mushrooms and grated cheese or 
        try sautéed Italian or Chinese sausage, bread crumbs and herbs bound 
        together with a beaten egg. </td>

        stuffing and rolling up the chard leaves, chop up the reserved chard 
        stems and put into a big deep pot. Lay the chard bundles over the stems 
        and add enough seasoned chicken or vegetable broth to cover the stems. 
        Steam/braise the rolls for 7-10 minutes until cooked through, then serve 
        with or without grated cheese. With a loaf of crunchy bread and a robust 
        wine, these stuffed rolls make a savory dinner (and terrific leftovers 
        to heat in the microwave for lunch the next day).<br>

        <img border="0" src="../seeds/art/herbs115/basil-pesto_5455.jpg" align="left" width="115" height="103">Don’t 
        neglect to make full summer nights extra memorable with a big aromatic 
        pesto feast. Combine in a food processor: 3 cups of loosely packed fresh 
        basil leaves, ½ cup chopped parsley, 3-5 large garlic cloves, ½ cup pine 
        nuts, 1 teaspoon fresh oregano, ½ teaspoon pepper. Add ½ to ¾ cup of 
        fruity extra virgin olive oil and process just enough to make a smooth 
        paste. Add one cup of freshly grated Parmesan or Asiago cheese and salt 
        to taste. Serve over hot pasta, using a little of the pasta water to 
        help spread the sauce evenly, or enjoy the pesto on grilled portobella 
        mushrooms or hot baked potatoes. <br>
        <br>
        <img border="0" src="../seeds/art/vegies115/tomato-rainbow_5795.jpg" align="right" width="115" height="95">I 
        also like to halve fully ripe tomatoes, brush with olive oil and chopped 
        garlic and bake them at 350 degrees for an hour or so until they are 
        tender and concentrated in flavor. Then top with a generous dollop of 
        pesto sauce and pop under the broiler just for a minute or two. With 
        crusty bread to sop up the juices, this makes a fabulous supper dish! 
        Pesto sauce is also great with fresh grilled corn on the cob. A 
        combination of grilled vegetables, like eggplant slices and chunks of 
        sweet peppers and summer squash topped with pesto sauce and served over 
        rice is another great main dish meal.<br>
