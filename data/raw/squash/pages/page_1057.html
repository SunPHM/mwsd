10.31.01 : "something simple" - take-out white pizza with ricotta and prosciutto<p>
10.30.01 : chicken saltimboca (chicken wrapped around prosciutto, parm, and
sage, seared in butter) with spinach, fennel, and ugly-fruit (they're kinda
like big funky oranges) salad (with balsamic vinagrette) and two-fennel
(roasted and fresh stalks) soup, olive bread and olive oil for dipping<p>
10.29.01 : spice-rubbed salmon, wilted mixed salad with pancetta and
almond-rolled chevre
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>spice-ribbed salmon</i><p>
2 fillets (tails) of salmon, salt and pepper, 1 T coriander seeds, 1/4 t
cloves, 1 1/2 t cumin seeds, 1 t fresh grated nutmeg
</td><td>
from the <i>minimalist</i> - my dad had given me a tail of salmon that he
brought back frozen from alaska, which i thawed for several days in the
fridge.  when i filletted it, i thought it had gone bad, since the meat was
mushy rather than firm, but not so!  it turned out awesome.<p>
start by laying the salmon skin-side-down on a baking sheet and sprinkle
liberally with salt and pepper. grind up the spices - there are two ways to do
this: a spice grinder (wayne wouldn't let me use the coffee grinder), of
mortar and pestle (in this case, the butt end of a wooden bottle opener i made
this summer, and a small glass).  layer on the spices evenly, rolling the
glass over them to press into the fish, then cover with saran wrap and let sit
while you take a shower or something.  when you're done, preheat the oven to
450, heat up a pan on medium-high, then melt some butter and pan sear the
salmon for 3 minutes.  flip over on to baking sheet, and bake for about 4-5
minutes. made enough for 4... i shoulda invited my dad over.

<i>wilted mixed salad with pancetta and almond-rolled chevre</i><p>
small bunch of beet greens, a cucumber (salted, seeded, and sliced into thin
wedges), a leek (sliced into rounds and seperated into two piles), green
onion, sherry vinegar, salt and pepper, some pancetta, garlic, a package of
chevre, bround almonds
</td><td>
on the side, spread out some ground almond (we had some left over from weeks
ago) on a plate.  in a small pan sautee half of the leeks in butter, and let
cool.  mix in with goat cheese, then use a knife to seperate a clump, let it
stick to the knife, and coat in almonds on three sides, the unstick it fom the
knife and roll it around.  we heated these up in the toaster oven before we
put them on the salad (watch out, they're gooey. gooey is good).
<p>
start by cooking up the pancetta with a clove of garlic (discared this, unless
you wanna chew on it for a while...), then add to beet greens, the other half
of the leeks, some green onion, and some salt and pepper.  get a medium pot
heated up a bit, then toss in the mixture with a glug of sherry vinegar and
put the lid on for a few seconds.  remove from heat and put into a bowl, and
add cucumber.  serve on plates and add chevre.

10.28.01 : wayne's antipasti of four bruschetta: olives and anchovy, tomato and 
goat cheese, prosciutto and parmigiano reggiano, mushrooms and sage; chris' 
first try at home-made pasta: pumpkin-filled raviolis in butter 
and sage sauce (the filling rocked, but i still need practice with the 
pasta...)<p>
10.27.01 : chris' dinner - radish greens salad with goat cheese and walnuts, 
sweet potato fries with poblano catsup (hmm... shoulda thrown out that poblano 
puree a bit earlier...)<p>
10.25.01 : barbequed beef with pumpkin seed mole (a wierd bastardization of
emeril's <a href="http://foodtv.com/foodtv/recipe/0,6255,18159,00.html">recipe
with chicken</a>.  how do you shell pumpkin seeds anyway?  oh, and the beef
was rubbed in cayenne and fennel seeds, and slow cooked for about 3 hours),
steamed sugar snap peas, and mashed potatoes<p>
10.24.01 : chris's lunch: pastrami and goat cheese sandwich on sourdough
with salted plum tomato and pepper mayo; dinner: lemming stew<blockquote><table
cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>lemming stew</i><p>
half an onion, about 1/4 lb of pancetta (aw yah philly italian market), clove
o' garlic, 1 c white wine, one can drained and passingly rinsed cannellini
beans, about 1.5 - 2 c of stock (we made ours last night from all the frozen
leftover bones of the past few weeks, plus carrots and roasted fennel), a
splash of sherry vinegar (not too much - it can overwhelm), liberal salt and
pepper, one sprig each fresh oregano and thyme (thanks mom), fresh parsley
(thanks supermarket people), hunka-hunka parmesan (go fig - that's the
dictionary spelling...), and a package of tortellini (until we start making
our own...)
</td><td>
so we set up a diving board over the soup pot to see what would happen... ok,
actually it's tortellini in broth, but for some reason during dinner we
started talking about lemmings.  but it got ya interested, didn't it? anyway:
sautee rustic cut onions and pancetta in olive oil, and toss in a crushed
clove of garlic, until pancetta is starting to brown, 7-8 minutes.  add wine,
beans, and stock, cook for few minutes.  add sherry vinegar, salt and pepper,
and tortellini, then cook until tortellini are about ready.  toss in fresh
oregano, thyme, cook for a minute or so, then serve, garnished with parsley
and lots of parm.  the bean starches will make this more like a stew than a
soup, but you can add more broth to get, well, a more brothy soup.  served 2
pretty darn well.

10.23.01 : cider-cumin beef kabobs, roasted fennel bulb, goat cheese and walnut spinach salad with
sherry vinegar-dijon-garlic vinaigrette
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>cider-cumin beef kabobs</i><p>
marinade: 1/2 t each of cumin, coriander seed, and curry, plus a dash of
paprika, salt, and pepper, mixed into enough cider to cover meat<p>
about 1 pound of london broil or thick-cut beef trimmed of fat (get your
hands in there) and cut into 2 inch cubes, three colors of bell peppers, half
an onion
</td><td>
start marinading the meat about half an hour to an hour before charging up the
grill.  by then it will be dark, so bring a flashlight.  slice peppers and
onions thickly, enough to have them hang on the skewer, about an inch for the
peppers, and at least 1/2 an inch for the onion. skewer meat interspersed with
veggies, and lay on the grill.  flip after about 5 minutes, then let cook with
the lid down until you don't get red juices out of the beef when you squeeze
it, about 15 minutes.  flip, and cook for a few more minutes, and remove from grill.  this gave
us medium-well beef, which was tender but not as red as some carnivores
desire. and don't be afraid of char... it tastes good. really. boil down pan sauce with a dallop of sour cream, and pour over dismantled
kabob.  serves 2.

10.22.01 : chinese takeout for chris<p>
10.21.01 : breakfast: buttermilk pancakes, homefries, pear butter
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>buttermilk pancakes</i><p>
2 c flour, 3 c buttermilk, 1/2 stick (4 T) melted butter, 2 eggs, 1 T each of
baking powder, baking soda, and salt, and a dash of sugar
</td><td>
[new, perhaps improved method:]
start by melting the butter and beginning to let it cool.  take the eggs out
of the fridge and let them warm to room temp (this seems wierd, but i think it
helps). mix the dry ingredients, then add buttermilk and mix in (you don't
want to overmix the batter at any point now, because the acids in the
buttermilk are what react with the baking soda and make the pancakes kinda
fluffy).  add sugar to butter and cream together a bit, then mix in eggs
(alternative method: add butter to batter, then eggs, then sugar. the idea is
not to cook the eggs with warm butter, and also not to freeze the butter with
cold eggs.  never thought it could be so complicated, huh?).  lumps are
alright.  heat up a pan over medium/high heat, wake up your friends, and go
for it. try making silver dollar pancakes... they're fun.  always use real
syrup. serves 6-8.
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>pear butter</i><p>
pears, butter, ginger, cinnamon
</td><td>
this idea is from our landlord - i went to ask if i could pick pears from her
tree along the driveway.  she gave me three pears (they ripen off the tree,
she says), and suggested not too many spices, since the flavor of the pears
can be easily overpowered.<p>
slice up the pears into smallish pieces (1/4 inch is best - they cook faster).
i didn't peel the pears, which gave a more gritty consistancy in the end,
which i kinda liked.  start heating a small pan on medium heat, and put in
about a tablespoon of butter - this may be too much, since it appeared
congealed when i put it the mixture a jar in the fridge, but it works pretty well when
reheated.  start sauteeing the pears in butter, and add about a half teaspoon
of ginger and a shake of cinnamon. <p>
put the heat on low.
the cooking process was an experiment - the idea is that it will take about
2-3 hours over low heat to fully cook/caramelize the pears.  i alternated
covering and uncovering the mixture to control water content (covered keeps in
moisture, uncovering lets it evaporate).  you will know it's done when the mix
is a nice deep brown and the pieces of pear are no longer distinct.  this goes
well with the pancakes, and refridgerates for at least a few days.

10.20.01 : monk's restaurant in philly for wayne's birthday<p>
10.19.01 : butternut squash stuffed with sausage and apples<p>
"don't you guys cook anything without sausage?"
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>butternut squash stuffed with sausage and apples</i><p>
a butternut squash ("great for picking up the chicks"), 8 oz breakfast
sausage, 1 large apple or two small apples, 2 T butter softened, 1 T brown
sugar, handful of sage leaves, salt and black pepper<p>
<img src="images/stuffedbutternut.jpg" width=300 height=225>
</td><td>
based on the <i>joy</i>: preheat the oven to 375.  halve and seed squash, then
put on baking sheet and put a few thin pats of butter on it.  bake the bugger
for 30-40 minutes, until soft and brown on top.  after 45 minutes, when you've
forgotten about the squash in the oven, spring up at random and freak out your
roommate, and save the squash from oblivion, and let the poor thing cool.  in
the meantime, crumble sausage into skillet and cook until no longer pink.
peel, core, and cut apples into 1/4-1/2 inch cubes, then add to skillet and
cook for a few minutes until tender but still crisp.  scoop out most of the
squash's insides (you mean person you), leaving a 1/2 inch shell.  mix squash
into stuffing, along with butter, brown sugar, ripped-up sage, salt and
pepper.  stuff back into the carcass, top with a some more brown sugar and
butter, and bake at 375 for about 20 minutes (if impatient: 10 minutes).
serves 3, including one guy who can't eat wheat or dairy... sorry about the
butter dude ; ) ...  "i eat so well whenever i come here.  it's awesome."

chicken", or "there are two sides to every chicken". hint: stuff it with lemon) 
with roasted turnips and celery root, wayne's mom's cucumber and
onion salad, stirfried broccolini and sugar snap peas
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>

a cucumber, some of an onion, about a cup of half &amp; half, 2 T sugar, 2 T white vinegar
</td><td>
slice the cucumber and onion into salad-sized pieces, and sprinkle over about
a teaspoon of salt.  let these sit for an hour (of if impatient, 10 minutes),
then squeeze then within an inch of their lives.  set aside.  in a bowl mix
the half &amp; half, sugar, and vinegar (it won't curdle.  don't ask why. we
mixed the sugar and vinegar together first in a glass, just because we were
nervous), then toss in veggies.  let sit for an hour (if impatient, 10
minutes, but apparently this is the secret, so do it).  feeds two.

10.16.01 : grilled pizza with assorted mystery cheeses, herbs from chris'
mom's garden, pancetta, and orange tomatoes
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>grilled pizza dough</i><p>
1 t active dry yeast, 2 c flour, 1 1/2 t salt, olive oil<p>
<img src="images/grilledpizza.jpg" width=300 height=225>
</td><td>
from the <i>joy</i>:<p>first dissolve yeast in 2 T of warm water (not too hot,
or it will kill the little yeastlings), about five minutes, then give the
mixture a stir.  in a bowl mix flour and salt, then wash out the yeast bowl
with 2/3 cup of cool water, into the dry stuff, and stur until all is
incorporated.  here comes the fun part: with a thing of flour ready at hand,
start kneeding the dough, adding flour so that you can actually kneed the
stuff without it climbing up your arms, but you don't want it too dry either.
kneed for ten minutes, then place in an oiled bowl, swirl around until top is
also covered with oil, then cover and let sit for about two hours (it should
double in size) in a warm place.  yay gluten formation.  punch the bugger,
then let sit for another 45 minutes.<p>get the grill ready at a decent heat,
then stretch the dough onto the oiled back of your significant other, i mean, a cookie
sheet.  if the dough doesn't stay, give it some time to relax, then strech
again... but don't over-handle the stuff, cuz it'll get wierd - i had the most
success with just removing it from the bowl, placing on the sheet, and pushing
out once.  also, thin is good, because the grill with make it puff without it
being too too filling.  anyway, take it down to the grill, outside in october,
when it is now completely dark, and lift or slide onto the grill.  watch it,
and allow for charring (it tastes good).  when ready, flip, add toppings (if
using an olive oil base, be sure to sprinkle with salt), and
close the top to melt.  remove when bottom is good one done.

<i>wayne's sage mashed potatoes</i><p>
So buy yourself a food mill.
<p>
That's the first rule of making beatific mashed potatoes.  Use a food mill.
It turns potatoes into pureed angel wings.  Trust me.
<p>
Cut some baking potatoes into quarters and throw 'em into boiling water--don't
bother peeling.  Cook 'em until they're fork tender (or forking tender, as
they say in some neighborhoods).  Meanwhile, heat up some cream in a saucepan.
Throw in a clove or two of garlic, slightly crushed, and a few sage leaves
into the cream.  
<p>
When the potatoes are done, take a little of the cooking water and place in
the mashed potato bowl to warm it up.  Drain the potatoes and carefully pull
the peels off.  Dump the water out of the potato bowl.  Place the potatoes
into the food mill and start milling them into the bowl.  When all the
potatoes have been milled, strain the cream and add to the potatoes.  Stir it
together.  Add some buttermilk.  Stir, stir, stir.  Add butter, salt and
pepper.  Stir and fluff.  Eat while still hot.  Yum.

10.11.01 : our first meal of two (as far as we know) original (and darn good) recipes: stuffed peppers and
eggplant wrapped around mozzarella
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>wayne's stuffed bell peppers</i><p>
3 bell peppers, 3 c rice (1 c short grain rice, 2 c water, 1/2 T butter, 2 large pinches
salt), 1/2 lb of italian sausage removed from casing, a
head of spinach (stems removed), mashed clove of garlic, salt and pepper,
splash of sherry vinegar, 1 T butter, 1/2 cup parm, handful of sage leaves
<p>
<img src="images/stuffedpepper.jpg" height=300>
</td><td>
start cooking rice. preheat oven to 500 degrees. take peppers and make a cut
all the way around, about a half an inch from the top. twist the cap, remove
seed bundle and seeds, and set aside. cut off the bottom of the pepper so that
it stands upright. in a pan, brown sausage in olive oil, then add spinach,
garlic, s&amp;p, and sherry vinegar.  when rice is 75% cooked, place in pan
with meat mixture, add rice wine vinegar, more salt and pepper, and sage
leaves, and cook.  when ready to stuff, stir in butter and parm, stuff into
pepper.  slather pepper in oil, sprinkle salt on the cap, and place upright in
a skillet or oven dish.  cook for 10 minutes or so, until the caps blister
pretty well.  place some extra rice mixture on the plate, and place stuffed
pepper in the center of it.  served 2, but it should serve 3.
<p>
wayne had an idea for a variation: roast peppers first, with a slit in the
side. remove skin, pry open, remove seeds, and stuff the buggers.

<i>chris's eggplant-wrapped mozzarella</i><p>
two 14-18 inch japanese (long and skinny) eggplants, olive oil, bread crumbs,
about a 1/4 lb fresh mozzarella
</td><td>
start by removing the tops and bottoms of the eggplants and slicing them into
about 1/4 inch strips.  sprinkle the slices with salt, and set aside, next to
a plate with oil on it, and a plate with bread crumbs in it.  start heating a
pan, and when it is hot, add a liberal amount of oil.  dredge both sides of
slice in oil, them in bread crumbs, and fling into the pan.  brown them, then
drain on a paper towel until you can handle them.  while they cool, slice up
the mozzarella into rectangular prisms about 1/4 inch on a side and about 2
inches long, enough for one per slice of eggplant. preheat your toaster oven
to about 300 degrees.  when the eggplants are ready, carefully wrap each one
around a piece of mozzarella, starting at one corner of the eggplant, so that
it wraps in a spiral around the mozzarella and covers it from end to end.
place on toaster tray and bake until cheese begins to melt (but doesn't run
out the sides too much), about five minutes.  served 2, could serve 3.

about a cup of risotto rice, a cup of white wine, half an onion, several
garlic cloves, 2 T butter, 1 T chopped fresh rosemary, about 3 cups of broth,
salt and pepper, parm
</td><td>
it seems like the ways of making risotto should be public domain, but this
idea at least was marcella hasan's...
<p>
start by heating up the broth and having it simmering nearby.  dice onion
fairly small, and sautee in either a deep skillet or 4 qt. pot (you want even
heating).  add garlic after a few minutes, then when the two are ready, toss
in rosemary, stir a few times, and then pour in rice, stirring to coat the
rice, and then add half the wine.  let the wine soak up almost completely,
then pour in rest of wine.  continue this process of adding liquid (now the
broth) and letting it get soaked up, until the rice is good (no longer
crunchy) - be sure near the end to not add too much liquid, because at least i
don't like rosiotto soup-style.  add pepper and check to see if you need salt,
which you may not depending on the broth you used.  grate in some parm, and
serve hot, since it can turn from creamy to cement somewhat easily. serves 3.
