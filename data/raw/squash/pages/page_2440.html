<P><B><FONT COLOR="#7d007d" SIZE="+2">CELEBRATE AUTUMN INDOORS AND OUT</FONT></B></P>

<P><font color="#000000">Fall is an excellent time of year to decorate your home, 
  yard or business with the vibrant colors and interesting forms of Autumn. Shocks 
  of corn stalks, Indian corn, pumpkins, gourds, squash, chrysanthemums, flowering 
  cabbage or kale, and colored leaves can all be used effectively to celebrate 
  the season. The Hawks Nursery Co. offers the following ideas for Fall decorating.</font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">The outside of a home or business building can be brightened 
  with garlands and wreaths of small gourds and miniature pumpkins strung on wire 
  or heavy cord, and hung over doors or windows. Groupings of unusually shaped 
  and colored squash and gourds along with orange pumpkins, backed by tawny colored 
  corn shocks, can brighten up the yard as the flowers of summer fade.<img src="Photo%201.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4"></font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">Potted and blooming chrysanthemums can also liven up 
  tired beds or be placed on decks or patios. Flowering cabbage and kale, special 
  varieties of the vegetables, produce very attractive heads of foliage tinged 
  with bright magenta or creamy lime green, and can be set into garden beds. The 
  colors in these plants intensify as the weather cools and can remain effective 
  until well into November.<img src="Photo%202.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4"></font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">Colorful Oak and Maple leaves can be collected and strung 
  or glued to Styrofoam wreath forms to brighten a bare wall. Grape vine wreaths 
  can be made up with fresh materials like lemon tree leaves (Salal), and fresh 
  roses with bittersweet berries, pine cones, and natural colored leaves, and 
  then allowed to dry naturally for a very rich look.<img src="Photo%203.jpg" width="133" height="200" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4"></font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">Indoors, pumpkins can be hollowed out, either in the 
  traditional manner or lying on their side, and used as a container for a fresh 
  flower arrangement. The pumpkin must be lined with an appropriate sized container 
  to hold the water and flower arranging foam. Centerpiece arrangements can include 
  fresh flowers, with fresh or preserved leaves, nuts, pods, cattails, bittersweet, 
  wheat and oat heads, straw flowers, and many dried and preserved flowers.<img src="Photo4.jpg" width="155" height="200" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4"></font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">Our own gardens can provide a wealth of material for 
  arranging, some just as they are from the garden, and some may require a little 
  preparation. The flower or seed heads of many plants begin to dry right on the 
  plant and often they can be used immediately after cutting. Some of these plants 
  are, Astilbe, Caraway, Celosia Chinese lantern, Clematis, Eryngium, Flaxseed, 
  Grasses, Globe amaranth, Hops, Hydrangea, Lavender, Love-in a-mist, Pearly everlasting, 
  Straw flowers, Teasel, and Wheat.</font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">The leaves and flowers of some plants can be soaked in 
  a solution of glycerin to preserve their color and form better and make them 
  less fragile for arranging. Glycerin may be purchased at most drug stores and 
  diluted at a rate of one part glycerin to two parts hot water. Fresh cut stems 
  should be stripped of leaves two inches from the bottom and placed in a container 
  with two to three inches of the glycerin mixture. The time required to absorb 
  the glycerin may be from three or four days to two weeks, depending on the species.</font></P>
<P><font color="#000000">Some plants which respond well to this treatment are 
  Beech leaves, Bells of Ireland bracts, Eucalyptus branches, Maple leaves, Rose 
  hips, and Rosemary sprigs. Brightly colored flowers that would turn brown and 
  shatter if air dried can be preserved in a desiccant like silica gel, which 
  can be purchased at many floral shops. Some of the flowers that respond well 
  to this treatment include, Chrysanthemum, Cornflower, Delphinium, Love-in-a-mist, 
  Calendula, Rose, and Zinnia. If your garden is lacking in these varieties, plans 
  to incorporate them can be made during the winter, but for now, many of these 
  flowers can be purchased at garden centers or floral shops.</font></P>
