Any type of winter squash will work in this 
dish but butternut is the easiest to peel 
and cut. Use a good vegetable peeler to 
remove the skin, then cut with a sharp 
chef's knife.

Preparation: </B></FONT><BR>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 400 F. 
<li>Heat an 8-10" skillet (preferably cast 
iron 
or other oven proof pan), add the 1 teaspoon 
olive oil and the onion. Sauté about 2 
minutes and add the pork (or turkey), 
breaking it up with a fork. 
<li>Add the chopped squash and continue to 
sauté 
about 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook 1 
minute. Add salt and pepper to taste, the 
sage, hot sauce and 1/2 cup water. Bring to 
a simmer, cover and cook 5-8 minutes until 
the squash is almost tender. Correct 
seasoning. 
<li>Brush 1 sheet of phyllo lightly with 
olive 
oil. Top with another sheet and brush again. 
<li>Top with the third sheet and brush 
again. 
<li>Place the stacked phyllo over the 
filling, 
crumpling and tucking as necessary to make 
it fit the pan. 
<li>Bake in the preheated oven about 10 
minutes 
until the phyllo is crisp and the filling is 
bubbly. Serve with a cooked green vegetable 
or green salad and crusty bread if desired.
