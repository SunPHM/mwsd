      <P>Winter squash is a warm-season vegetable that can be grown 
        in most of the country. It differs from summer squash in that it is harvested 
        and eaten in the mature fruit stage, when the seeds within have matured 
        fully and the skin has hardened into a tough rind. When ripened to this 
        stage, fruits of most varieties can be stored for use throughout the winter.</P><BR clear=right>

        feet per hill. Plant seeds one inch deep (four or five seeds per hill). 
        Allow 5 to 6 feet between hills. When the young plants are well-established,

      <P>Squash plants should be kept free from weeds by hoeing and 
        shallow cultivation. Irrigate if an extended dry period occurs in early 
        summer. Squash requires minimal care after the vines cover the ground.</P>
      <P>Bees are necessary for pollinating squash and pumpkins

      <P>Winter squash can be harvested whenever the fruits have 
        turned a deep, solid color and the rind is hard. Harvest the main part 
        of the crop in September or October, before heavy frosts hit your area. 
        Cut squash from the vines carefully, leaving two inches of stem attached 
        if possible. Avoid cuts and bruises when handling. Fruits that are not 
        fully mature, have been injured, have had their stems knocked off, or 
        have been subjected to heavy frost do not keep and should be used as soon 
        as possible or be composted (watch for seedlings in the compost). </P>
      <P>Store in a dry building where the temperature is between 
        50 and 55&deg;F. For prolonged storage, do not pile squash more than two 
        fruits deep. It is preferable, where space allows, to place the fruits 
        in a single layer so that they do not touch each other. This arrangement 
        minimizes the potential spread of rots.</P>

      <P><FONT color="#000000">A. Yes. Any variety of squash 
        or pumpkin in the same species can cross-pollinate. Cross-pollination 
        does not affect the current crop, but the seed does not come true the 
        following year.</FONT></P>

        as pumpkin?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color="#000000">A. Yes. Most people cannot tell 
        whether pumpkin or squash is used in a pie. This finding is not surprising 
        given the whimsical application of the names pumpkin and squash. Many 
        cooks prefer winter squash to pumpkin because they make a non-fibrous 
        pie, much more akin to the <I>C. moschata</I> processing pumpkins commonly 
        bought canned. (<I>C. moschata</I> is closely related to butternut squash.)</FONT></P>

        Can I control them with insecticides?</B></FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color="#000000">A. No. Vine borers cannot be controlled 
        effectively with insecticides. You can reduce potential damage the following 
        season by disposing of infested plants. Vining types of squash can be 
        encouraged to root at the nodes, giving the plant some ability to withstand 
        attacks of vine borers. Some success in control of an active infestation 
        may be achieved by carefully splitting open areas being fed upon and removing 
        the larvae.</FONT></P>

        <P>The squash family <I>(Cucurbitaceae)</I> includes pumpkins, summer 
          squash and winter squash. They are really edible gourds. There are many 
          varieties with a wide range of flavors and textures. Winter squash does 
          not look the same either. Their tough outer shells can be smooth or 
          bumpy, thin or thick and rock hard with a wide array of colors.</P>
        <P>The most popular winter squash includes acorn, buttercup, butternut, 
          calabaza, delicata, Hubbard, spaghetti, sweet dumpling, and Terk&#146;s 
          Turban. There are many more, but this section will be limited to the 
          above-mentioned varieties. </P>
        <P>Winter squash is planted in the spring, grows all summer and is always 
          harvested at the mature stage in early autumn before the first frost. 
          Immature winter squash lacks flavor, so wait until the rind is hard. 
          Harvest winter squash with two inches of stem remaining. A stem cut 
          too short is like an open wound, which will cause early decay. </P>
        <P>For storage, harvest sturdy, heavy squashes with fairly glossy skin 
          that is unblemished by soft spots, cuts, breaks or uncharacteristic 
          discoloration. Most winter squash benefits from a curing stage; the 
          exceptions are acorn, sweet dumpling and delicata. Curing is simply 
          holding the squash at room temperature (about 70 degrees) for 10 to 
          20 days.</P>
        <P>After curing, transfer to a cool (45 to 50 degrees), dry place such 
          as the basement or garage for long term storage. Careful, do not allow 
          them to freeze. The large hard rind winter squash can be stored up to 
          six months under these conditions. Warmer temperatures simply mean shorter 
          storage time. </P>
        <P>The smaller acorn and butternut do not store as well, only up to 3 
          months. Store cut pieces of winter squash in the refrigerator. Refrigeration 
          is too humid for whole squash, and they will deteriorate quickly.</P>
<P><A name="9"></A><IMG src="images/nutrition.gif" width="442" height="26"></P>
        <P>Winter squash is a tasty source of complex carbohydrate (natural sugar 
          and starch) and fiber. Fiber, which was once called roughage, absorbs 
          water and becomes bulky in the stomach. It works throughout the intestinal 
          track, cleaning and moving waste quickly out of the body. Research suggests 
          that this soluble fiber plays an important role in reducing the incidence 
          of colon cancer. </P>
        <P>Winter squash is also a source of potassium, niacin, iron and beta 
          carotene. The orange-fleshed squash is also an excellent source of beta 
          carotene. As a general rule, the deeper the orange color, the higher 
          the beta carotene content. Beta carotene is converted to Vitamin A in 
          the body. Vitamin A being essential for healthy skin, vision, bone development 
          and maintenance as well as many other functions.</P>
        <P>The nutrient content of winter squash varies, depending on the variety. 
          The following information is a summary of all varieties, cooked, baked 
          and cubed.</P>

        <P>Peeling winter squash can be a challenge to the novice. The thin-skinned 
          varieties (acorn, butternut, delicata and sweet dumpling) can be peeled 
          with a paring knife or vegetable peeler.</P>
        <P>Most recipes using these varieties call for cutting the squash in half. 
          Position the squash on a cutting board, stem end facing you. Place the 
          blade of a heavy chef&#146;s knife horizontally along the length of 
          the squash. With a hammer or mallet, repeatedly hit the back of the 
          blade near the handle to drive it into the squash until it breaks in 
          half. </P>
        <P>Place the larger varieties (Hubbard and Turk&#146;s Turban) on newspaper 
          and use a sharp cleaver to split the hard-rind open. Or use the chef&#146;s 
          knife method described above. Once you have a slit cut, bang on a hard 
          surface and pull apart. Pieces are easier to peel. With a spoon, scoop 
          out the seeds and strings and discard, or set aside if you plan to roast 
          the seeds. For instructions on roasting seeds, visit our website <A href="../pumpkins/index.html">Pumpkins 
          and More</A> and substitute squash seeds in the recipe.</P>
        <P>To cook winter squash, place unpeeled pieces cut sides down on a shallow 
          baking dish and bake in a 350&#176;F oven for 30 minutes or longer. 
          Check for doneness by piercing with a fork or skewer. When tender, remove 
          from the oven and allow the pieces to cool. Spoon out the soft flesh 
          and mash with a fork or process in a blender or food processor. Peeled 
          pieces can be cut into cubes and boiled until tender. Use with any recipe 
          calling for cooked mashed or pureed squash. Or microwave the squash 
          pieces on high for 15 minutes or longer.</P>
        <P>Small acorn squash and spaghetti squash can be pierced in several places 
          with a long-tined fork or metal skewer and baked whole. Piercing prevents 
          the shell from bursting during cooking. Place the squash on a baking 
          dish and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at 325&#176;F. Test for doneness 
          by squeezing the shell. When it gives a bit with pressure, it is done. 
        </P>
<P><A name="11"></A><IMG src="images/preservation.gif" width="442" height="26"></P>
        <P>Store whole winter squash in an area where temperatures range from 
          45 to 50&#176;F for three to six months. At room temperature reduce 
          storage time to one and a half to three months depending on variety. 
          See the selection and storage information above.</P>
        <P>Cooked squash freezes well. Pack into freezer containers or freezer 
          bags leaving 1/2 inch head space and freeze for up to one year. Canning 
          is not recommended unless the squash is cut into cubes. </P>
        <P>Mashed squash is too dense and heat penetration is uneven. Because 
          spaghetti squash does not stay cubed on heating, it should be frozen 
          instead of canned. For all other varieties, follow the procedure and 
          processing times outlined in canning pumpkin.</P>
<P><A name="12"></A><IMG src="images/recipes.gif" width="442" height="26"></P>
        <P>Herbs and spices used to enhance the flavor of winter squash include 
          garlic, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, basil, parsley and a pinch of ground 
          cloves. Sweeten squash pulp with maple syrup, honey, brown sugar, or 
          orange juice concentrate.</P>

        <P>Equally delicious for breakfast, snack or as a light dessert, this 
          honey sweetened loaf can be spread with low-fat cream cheese or whipped 
          butter. To warm: Wrap thick slices in a paper towel and microwave for
