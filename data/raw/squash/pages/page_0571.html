<P><I>Abelmoschus esculentus</I> Malvaceae OKRA, GUMBO, LADY'S FINGERS

<P>Native to Asia, introduced to North America by slaves and has become
a staple ingredient in Southern U.S. cooking. Grown as an annual. Bristly,
stout stems, to 6 feet tall, leaves palmately divided to compound, often
more than 12 inches across. Flowers, to 3 inches across, produced solitary
in upper leaf axils. Fruit a capsule, five angled, beaked and bristly.

<P><I>Allium cepa </I>Amaryllidaceae ONION

<P>Native to Northern Hemisphere, mostly perennial or biennial herbs, all
strongly odorous, especially when bruised. Only known in cultivation, up
to 4 feet tall, usually shorter, bulbs large with outer bulb coat drying
to form a membrane. Leaves are hollow and cylindrical. Scape is also hollow
and supports an umbel inflorescence. Bulbils may be produced in flowers
of certain types (potato or multiplier onions, shallots).

<P><I>Asimina triloba&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </I>Annonaceae&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PAWPAW

<P>Native to eastern North American including Kentucky.&nbsp; Shrubby deciduous
tree reaching to 30 feet tall.&nbsp; Leaves obovate to oblong, may reach
1 foot long, drooping on the plant.&nbsp; Flowers are purple, 2 inches
across, and are produced prior to the leaves in early spring.&nbsp; Fruit
is an oblong fleshy berry, 3-5 inches long, green becoming brown when ripe.&nbsp;
Seeds are flattened, may comprise most of the fruit,&nbsp; desirable cultivars
with smaller or fewer seeds have been selected.&nbsp; Most aree not self-fertile,
need another plant to cross-pollinate and produce fruit.&nbsp; Often found
growing in colonies or "patches" that may have arisen from root suckers,
so all plants in the colony are genetically idnetical with little fruit
set.&nbsp; Pawpaw germplasm repository is at Kentucky State University
in Frankfort.

<P><I>Citrullus lanatus</I>&nbsp; Cucurbitaceae&nbsp;&nbsp; WATERMELON

<P>Native to tropical and southern Africa.&nbsp; Leaves borne on trailing
hairy stems that may reach 15 or more feet long.&nbsp; Leaves up to ~6
inches across, pinnately divided.&nbsp; Flowers are yellow, 1.5 inches
across.&nbsp; Fruit is a globose to oblong berry, dark or light green skin,

or white.&nbsp; Best fruit quality is obtained during hot, dry weather.&nbsp;
Seedless watermelons arise from crosses of dipoid and tetraploid plants.&nbsp;
The resulting seeds aree triploid and relatively sterile.&nbsp; The vines
have branched tendrils, the dendril opposite the fruit will often shrivel
and die once the fruit is ripe.

<P><I>Rubus</I> spp. Rosaceae BLACKBERRY, RASPBERRY

<P>Native mostly to Northern Hemisphere, woody biennial canes (primocanes
and floricanes), most prickly. Modern cultivars resulted from hybridizing
many native species, specific progenitors of cultivars is not usually known.
Leaves alternate on the stem, compound with 3-7 leaflets. Leaves serrate,
often with spiny petioles and midribs. Flowers are white to pinkish to
rose and usually clustered on the stem. Fruit is an aggregate of small
drupes witch may (blackberry) or may not (raspberry) remain attached to
the receptacle at maturity. Fruiting usually occurs on floricanes which
are last year's primocanes. Certain raspberry cultivars fruit heavily on
the terminus of primocanes and are valued for their fall crop.

<P><I>Zea mays</I> Poaceae CORN

<P>Native to tropical America though wild parent is considered extinct.
Annual grass having separate male (tassel at stem terminal) and female
(giving rise to the ear in leaf axils, enclosed in bracts=shuck) flowers.
Grows to 15 feet, modern varieties usually much shorter, suckering at the
base. Leaves generally two ranked on the stem, 4 inches wide and up to
4 feet long with a prominent midvein. Seed/kernel color varies from yellow,
