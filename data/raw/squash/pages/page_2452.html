<h2><center><u> 1999 Wiltshire Summer League Final - RMCS Champs Again</u></center></h2>
<p>
This year's final was played between RMCS Blues and Frome 2nd team. 
Both teams had played in the White League, finishing top and second 
respectively, thus earning themselves their semi-final places. 
<p>Frome played their semi down at Marlborough against Dave Lorrain's 
Marlborough Birds and won through by a comfortable 3-1 margin, with 
the Borrett youngsters proving too hot for Lorrain's ageing 
warriors to handle. 
<p>The Blues played their semi against a previously unbeaten Lyneham team. 
Lyneham, despite missing Rob Munday appeared confident at the outset but 
were soon put in their places when RMCS went two up after the 
first two matches. 
Nigel Rowe, playing at 1, dropped one sloppy game but had far too much 
class for John Spanton to cope with. 
At the same time, Derek Bray, was tearing apart his Australian opponent, 
Dave Mayhew, using his customary grinding style, to leave the way clear 
for either Tony Doyle or Diesel James to sew things up. 
Doyley admitted to a previous night of sleeplessness and it certainly 
showed when he went down 3-0 to Steve Watts in no time at all. 
The stage was set for Trig to come up with the goods against Bob Chapman 
but he, too, looked all nerves and matters appeared rather ominous 
when he was 1-2 down and facing match ball at one stage. 
But we needn't have worried, Diesel was only toying with his team-mates; 
our hero eventually regained his composure and came through to take the 
fifth by 9-7, giving the boys a break from having to play the dreaded 
doubles.
<p>And so on to the Final. 
This was played at Frome Squash Club on Thursday August 26th with a 
tumultuous encounter expected by one and all. 
Team selection was a problem - luckily Jim Shelston was still on hols 
so that was one less place to worry about. 
Also Big MacDonald chose to be non playing captain once again, thus 
making way for the semi-final team to take the stage once again. 
Unfortunately, neither Lyneham or Frome was able to field a lady player 
so RMCS's Elspeth Holland had to take a back seat, much to her 
displeasure. 
<p>Frome were expected to be strong, with the Jonah Barrington coached 
Borrett youngsters expected to be a handful for Bray and Rowe. 
Life was also expected to be difficult for Doyley and Trig at 3 and 4, 
Mitch was expecting some fireworks so decided to come along for the ride. 
Frome alerted us of their cock-up as sonn as we arrived - no wonderkids! 
They'd decided to go to a rock festival instead (obviously the prospect 
of facing Rowe and Bray was too much for them). 
Frome asked if we minded if Club Coach Paul Clark played instead (just to 
make a game of it!) - Bray agreed, looking forward to seeing Rowe 
chasing shadows all evening. 
Diesel went on first against the most unorthodox opponent in the world 
- a 3-0 win was eventually scraped out after a bit of a struggle. 
Meanwhile, Doyley was 0-2 down against an extremely immobile looking 
Rich Elsden. 
Big Tony eventually found his form, however, to squeeze out a crucial 
3-2 win. 
At the same time, Nigel was enjoying a lesson off Paul Clark on the 
adjacent court. 
This was something of an exhibition match and Nigel demonstrated just 
how much he's improved recently by taking the third game. 
He was also up in fourth and an upset looked on the cards but Clark 
hit a purple patch and put together a flurry of winners to finally come 
through by 3-1. 
<p> This meant that the match hinged on Bray at number 2 against 
renowned ranter and raver, Gary Dawson. 
A close match was expected but Dawson looked overweight and 
completely out of sorts and was wiped away in about 10 minutes flat by 
the rampant Welshman, despite some ludicrous Frome refereeing. 
So, once again, no need to play the doubles, RMCS winning the trophy for the 
fourth time in five years by a healthy 3-1 scoreline. 
A good time was had by all, especially Mitch, who managed to sink 
about a gallon of German beer while the boys were on court.
