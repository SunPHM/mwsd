              My expertise comes from the opportunity to be educated by many
              generations of Enchantresses in plant life.&nbsp; We know the
              valuable sources plant s give and we hope that you not only enjoy
              learning of this, but incorporate&nbsp;it into your daily lives.<a href="../../2000update/October/basil1.jpg"><img border="2" src="../../2000update/October/basil1_small.jpg" alt="basil1.jpg (92179 bytes)" align="left" width="100" height="101"></a><br>

              So, without further delay, let us begin.&nbsp; Today's topic will
              be&nbsp;the beautiful herb, Basil.<br>
              <br>
              Basil is known to be the herb of &quot;Good Wishes&quot;.&nbsp;
              Giving someone, you feel special about, a basil plant is a
              beautiful and loving gesture.&nbsp; The aromas in each type of
              basil are different ranging from pungent, sweet, spicy, oriental
              and even lemony.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Basil originated from India then&nbsp;spread to&nbsp;Mediterranean
              countries.&nbsp; In Hindi it is known as Tusi meaning sacred
              basil.&nbsp; Basil is grown primarily outside, but in our world it
              is considered a must as a indoor plant as well.&nbsp; It is used
              in our foods,&nbsp; added to oils for muscular pain, stiffness and
              inflammation, as well as our baths and&nbsp;bath products. Using
              basil on an insect bite can give relief from a sting.&nbsp; It is
              considered&nbsp; an aide to help protect our homes from evil and
              give us the gift of open love.&nbsp; I, myself, have quite a large
              garden section dedicated to basil, of various edible types, along
              with several pots of basil in my home.<br>

              When two gnomes fall in love, and decide to become one, they go
              through a ceremony similar to human weddings using several
              traditions.&nbsp; The female gnome carries a&nbsp;bunch of
              collected wild plants representing certain things.&nbsp;Basil for
              protection and open love, rosemary for remembrance, chervil for
              sincerity and violets for faithfulness.&nbsp; Together,&nbsp; the
              two will walk<br>
              down a path, among their families and friends,&nbsp;carpeted with
              olive branches for peace and harmony.<br>
              <br>
              For the feast of this celebration, you will always find a delicacy
              called Pesto.&nbsp;Now pesto is always enjoyed by&nbsp; gnomes,
              even without celebrations, but it just couldn't be a grand
              celebration without this dish.&nbsp; To make pesto you will need:

              1/3 cup basil leaves (fresh)

            <div align="center">
              2 cloves of garlic

            <div align="center">
              pinch of salt<br>
              1/2 cup pine kernels (optional)
            </div>
            <div align="center">
              3/4 Parmesan cheese a dash of coarsely<br>
              ground pepper
            </div>
            <div align="center">
              1/2 cup olive oil
            </div>
            <div align="center">
              &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div align="left">
              In a blender add the basil, garlic and olive oil, process for few
              seconds and then gradually add the pine kernels, cheese and salt.&nbsp;This
              should be a thick creamy sauce and a wonderful topping for either
              pasta (1 lb cooked) or spaghetti squash.<br>
              <br>
              You can add a few drops to grape seed or&nbsp; almond oil to aide
              in the relief<a href="../../2000update/October/basil_leaves.jpg"><img border="2" src="../../2000update/October/basil_leaves_small.jpg" align="right" alt="basil_leaves.jpg (40853 bytes)" width="100" height="102"></a>
              of sore muscles followed by a massage.&nbsp; For relief of sore
              gums, make a tea out of 8 basil leaves in a cup of boiling water
              and swish out your mouth.&nbsp; Add 3 or 4 drops to your bath
              water&nbsp; for a refreshing smooth bath experience with a
              wonderful aroma.&nbsp; In jojoba oil add a few drops to create a
              hair conditioner that is suppose to stimulate hair growth.&nbsp;<br>

              Basil has a broad range of usages.&nbsp; One study has shown that
              basil stimulates the immune system.&nbsp; Basil is also of the
              many healing herbs, containing both pro and anti-cancer
              substances.&nbsp; It contains vitamins A and C and anti-oxidants
              that help prevent cell damage.&nbsp; We gnomes also believe that
              basil contributes to our long term memories.&nbsp; <strong><font color="#ff0000">Caution:
              Do not use basil oil while pregnant.<br>

              To <u>grow basil</u>, select the type or types of basil your nose
              finds appealing.&nbsp; There are several varieties to choose from
              such as:&nbsp; Purple Ruffles having ruffled jagged purple leaves
              and it's scent is like licorice and cinnamon. <a href="../../2000update/October/cinnamonbasil9198.jpg"><img border="2" src="../../2000update/October/cinnamonbasil9198_small.jpg" align="left" alt="cinnamonbasil9198.jpg (47663 bytes)" width="100" height="93"></a>
              Tai basil has a oriental aroma and taste with lavender flowers,
              lemon basil has a lemony&nbsp; taste smell with white flowers, and
              sweet basil is just that, having a delicate sweet aroma and
              flavor. There is also Italian basil, Genoa basil,&nbsp;and spicy
              global basil all with a spicy scent and flavor.&nbsp; I recommend
              several because once you discover what a tasty treat basil is, you
              will want to experience with other flavors.&nbsp; Basil can be
              purchased as a small plant but easily grown from seeds.&nbsp;
              Plant in a well drained area or container and make sure basil has
              a minimum of 3 hours of sun daily.&nbsp; Do not over water but
              continue to keep basil in a moist soil. Pinch off flowers and
              leaves to promote bushiness.<br>
              <br>
              Since basil requires very little maintenance and is one of the
              easiest herbs to grow,&nbsp; indoor or out, there is no excuse for
              not having this valuable herb.&nbsp; It is a major part of our
              life and we wouldn't consider not having this plant in our
              possession.&nbsp;<br>
