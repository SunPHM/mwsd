<p><img SRC="gran3.jpg" ALT="The outside of the granary as it appears today." HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=3 height=145 width=365 align=LEFT><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Foodstuffs
were stored in the granary for distribution to the village people.&nbsp;
Prior to the coming of the Spanish, the <a href="soba.html">Pima</a> diet
consisted of squash, beans, corn, small game, and wild plants.&nbsp; The
Spanish brought sheep, goats, and cattle, adding protein to the diet.&nbsp;
They brought wheat, which could be grown in winter, as well as fruit trees,
such as apricot, fig, apple, and pomegranate, providing a pleasing dietary
variety.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The stairs led to a loft
where extra food and animal fodder were stored when the granary was in
use.&nbsp; The food was kept in baskets and clay pots for later distribution.&nbsp;
The mission was a communal system of growing, collecting, and distributing.</font></font><img SRC="gran4.jpg" ALT="Ristas of red chilies drying in the granary." HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=3 height=167 width=251 align=RIGHT>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>How were fruits, fleshy foods
and meats preserved without refrigeration or canning?&nbsp; Extensive use
of the hot desert sun and dry climate was made in preserving many foods
for year-round use.&nbsp; Fruits, meat, and grains were all dried before
placing them in their respective containers to be used during the non-growing
season.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The granary is the only known,
two-story auxiliary building in the mission complex.&nbsp; Holes in the
walls for vigas, horizontal beams of mesquite or cottonwood, mark an upper
story.&nbsp; A stairway and vestibule divide the ground floor into two
rooms; no evidence exists for an upper story partition.&nbsp; One prominent
room feature is a bench with 13 circular depressions believed to be pot
rests.</font></font>
