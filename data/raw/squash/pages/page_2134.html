    Just like a squirrel, as winter closes in, I get the urge to start hoarding
    food away, just in case….. .In case there's an earthquake, in case I'm
    broke and destitute, in case there's a record breaking snowstorm and I can't
    get out of the house, or in case I end up with a few un-expected bodies
    around the dinner table. Nothing gives me a greater sense of security in the
    dark days of fall and winter then filling the kitchen with an assortment of
    colourful, long lasting squashes and pumpkins. Although we live on a farm,
    because squashes cross pollinate easily, we only grow one or two varieties
    and keep them as far away from each other as possible so we can save the
    seed without the surprise of a mutated harvest. Instead I enjoy buying a
    variety of different squashes as they catch my eye in the market place.
    Because squash is actually one of the vegetables the bio-tech industry has
    genetically engineered for the commercial industry I always buy organic, and
    there is a good selection of organic squash from B.C.&nbsp; </font></p>

    Dense squash varieties such as buttercup or pumpkins such as sugar pie and
    sweet dumpling have a lower moisture content and dark, sweet flesh most
    suitable for baking in pies or muffins. Delicata, butternut, and red kuri
    are good for baking, while hubbard, the Carribean calabaza and Japanese
    kabocha are good for soups and stews. The curved ribs of an acorn squash
    make it easier to stuff and bake than to peel, and for a completely
    different texture and quicker cooking time try a spaghetti squash.</font>

    For many years I have been making a Butternut Squash Soup with white wine
    and apples. The recipe comes from my friend chef Andrew Milne-Alan who owns
    &quot;Zucca&quot; (co-incidentally Italian for pumpkin!) a wonderful
    Trattoria at Yonge and Eglington in Toronto. The soup was a standard on the
    menu at College Street's popular Bar Italia when they first started to serve
    food.</font></i>

<p align="center"><u><b><font size="4" face="Arial">Butternut Squash Soup with</font></b></u><font size="4" face="Arial">
<u><b>White Wine &amp; Apple</b></u></font>
<p>
    <font size=2 face=Arial>
    4 cups of peeled, de-seeded squash cut into 2 inch cubes<br>
    2 cups of chopped white onion<br>
    4 large cloves of garlic finely minced<br>
    2 stalks of celery, finely diced<br>
    2 Tbsp olive oil<br>
    4 firm, red skinned apples<br>
    1 bay leaf<br>
    1 cup of dry white wine, such as pinot blanc<br>
    4 cups of chicken stock, vegetable stock or water<br>
    salt and black pepper to taste<br>
    sour cream and freshly chopped dill, fennel or chives for garnish</font>
<p align="justify">
    <font size=2 face=Arial>
    Toss the cut pieces of Butternut squash with ½ tsp of salt and half of the
    white wine. Lay the squash out on a baking tray. Cover the squash with foil
    and bake at 350 F. until soft, approximately 45 minutes to an hour. When the
    squash is finished baking, sauté the onions in the Olive oil with a pinch
    of salt, the celery, the garlic and the bay leaf. Once the onions have
    become soft and translucent, add the cooked squash. Add the stock or water,
    another pinch of salt and some freshly ground pepper and cook for
    approximately 40 minutes at a gentle simmer. While the soup is cooking, cut
    the apples into ¾ inch pieces without peeling the red skin off. Simmer the
    apples in the remaining ½ cup of wine and reserve for garnish. Puree the
    soup in a blender or a food mill and adjust the seasoning with salt and
    pepper and the consistency with water. The soup should not be too thick, but
    should not be watery either. Heat the soup and serve in soup bowls with a
    dollop of sour cream, a spoonful of the wine-cooked apples and some freshly
    chopped dill</font></p>
