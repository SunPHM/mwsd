Powdery mildew can be a serious problem on foliage and stems of
cucumbers, melons, squash, pumpkins, and ornamental gourds. The
disease is widespread in Ohio.
</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>
Small patches of fine, white threads develop on surfaces of infected
leaf blades in late July on most vine crops in Ohio. These patches
grow together and eventually cover stems and foliage with white,
powdery masses of spores. In severe infections, leaves will yellow and
die. Petioles, stems and, rarely, fruit will also become infected.
Early death of leaves can decrease the total amount of fruits formed
as well as reduce fruit size. Loss of foliage hastens maturity of
fruit and increases sunburning. Stems infected with Powdery Mildew
become brown. This can spoil the appearance of the "handles" on
pumpkins which lowers value of the fruit.
</p>

<h3>Causal Organisms</h3>
<img src="images/3111_2.jpg" alt="Severe powdery mildew on the stem of a pumpkin" align=right>
<p>
Two fungi cause powdery mildew on vine crops, Sphaerotheca fuliginea
and Erysiphe cichoracearum. S. fuliginea is most common in Ohio.
Powdery mildew fungi thrive under conditions of high relative
humidity, warm temperatures, low light, high fertility, and succulent
plant growth. Unlike bacteria and many fungi, free moisture on leaf
surfaces actually inhibits infection by these pathogens, although very
high relative humidity is required for spore germination. Powdery
mildew fungi grow only on living host plants. They survive the winter
as dormant mycelium on perennial plants or as spores in thick-walled
fruiting structures. Powdery Mildew spores can be blown into Ohio in
the spring from warmer southern areas. Mature foliage is most readily
infected; very young leaves are nearly immune.
</p>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p>
<ol><li>Plant resistant cultivars of cucumbers and muskmelons. Pumpkin
varieties vary greatly in susceptibility to this disease.
</p>
<p>
<li>Use cultural practices that avoid excessive succulence,
overcrowding, shading, overwatering, or excess fertilization
especially with nitrogen.
</p>
<p>
<li>Avoid making new planting of vine crops in the vicinity of older
plantings, especially if mildew is already present.
</p>
<p>
<li>Beginning in late July or early August when Powdery Mildew first
appears, regular applications of fungicides may be required. 
</ol>
<p>Fungicide
recommendations are contained in the <i>Ohio Vegetable Production Guide</i>
(OSU Extension Bulletin 672).
