    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's an old saying: To be a successful gardener, grow 
    pumpkins. With this truth, you only need one thing to produce pumpkins: seeds! 
    Still, there are always questions. Surely there's more to it than just placing 
    the seed in the ground ... What about the fine points? Herewith are a few 
    questions and answers. They are designed to supplement the tiny print on the 
    back of most pumpkin seed packets.</P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="what_kinds">What kinds of pumpkins grow the best?</A></B></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A HREF="#top">Top</A>
  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Almost any pumpkin seed ultimately will produce 
    pumpkins. The important question is: what kind of pumpkins do you want to 
    grow? <BR>
    <img src="pics/punksky.jpg" width="112" height="72" align="RIGHT" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Pumpkins" border="1">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The traditional Jack O'Lantern is a particular variety 
    officially known as the Connecticut Field Pumpkin. They are usually between 
    10 and 20 pounds each (though they can grow as big as 50 pounds) and have 
    a bright orange color and the classic pumpkin shape. It is the picture-book 
    pumpkin and the one produced by most commerical growers. Looks aside, the 
    Connecticut Field variety is plain-tasting, not especially sweet, and somewhat 
    watery for pie. Fortunately there is a vast and varied population in the pumpkin 
    world. Some of their names bring to mind wrestlers or race horses: Baby Boo, 
    Munchkin, Spooktacular, Big Max, Cinderella, Lumina, Atlantic Giant ... and 
    there are many more. Pumpkin varieties come in a wide range of potential sizes 
    (from a few ounces to over 500 pounds) and in several colors (ranging from 
    white to pink to red to traditional orange). The big ones require more garden 
    space, but the leaves and flowers of the different types look remarkably similar. 
    <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which one to plant? Be my guest. They are all very 
    willing to enjoy your nurturance. I like to grow several kinds in my United 
    Pumpkin Nations Patch! They all seem to get along quite well. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is exciting and satisfying to grow seeds that 
    have been saved from last year's pumpkins. But there are a few uncertainties 
    to be noted. First, be sure the seeds were dried in the air, not the oven. 
    Also there is a possibility that the seed will produce a hybrid -- a cross 
    between a pumpkin and another kind of squash. These are called Squmpkins and 
    their color, size, and shape are unpredictable. Still, they are exotic, weird, 
    and one of a kind. </P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><img src="pics/lighthouse.jpg" width="216" height="119" alt="Pumpkin Field" border="1" align="RIGHT" vspace="5" hspace="5"><A NAME="where_when">Where, 
    when, and how should the seeds be planted?</A></B></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A HREF="#top">Top</A> 
  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where: Pumpkins love a sunny spot -- the more 
    sun the better. Choose a place that gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight 
    every day. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When: Seeds can be planted directly in the garden 
    when the days consistently reach into the low 70's and the spring rains have 
    tapered off. In colder climates, the seeds can be started indoors and transferred 
    to the garden when the weather warms. Most pumpkins require 110 to 140 frost-free 
    growing days. The amount of time depends mainly on the variety, the climate, 
    and the number of daylight hours during the summer days. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How: Pumpkins seeds typically are planted in the 
    middle of small hills or mounds that are about three feet in diameter. Surround 
    each hill with a moat (about 4 inches wide and 4 inches deep) to help contain 
    water around the roots. Plant 4 to 5 seeds in a circle in the middle of the 
    hill, and space the seeds about 6 to 8 inches apart. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thankfully, pumpkin seeds know which way is up, 
    regardless of how they are set in the ground. Traditionally, the seed is laid 
    on its side, narrow edge skyward. Soaking the seeds the night before planting 
    will soften the outer shell and make sprouting easier and faster. But don't 
    let this little step hold you up if you are suddenly ready to plant. Cover 
    the seeds with about an inch of soil to block out light and hide them from 
    hungry birds. The soil should be loosely packed and kept moist but not wet; 
    think of it as a well-squeezed, damp sponge. <BR>
    <img src="pics/dicotglv.jpg" width="147" height="108" align="LEFT" alt="Pumpkin Dicot" vspace="5" hspace="5">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the seed stage, water gently with a sprinkling 
    can to avoid washing away the covering soil. Don't peek under the soil or 
    you may disturb the delicate root hairs that are forming. After 7 to 14 days, 
    the seed sprout cracks the soil, and within a day, two succulent oval baby 
    leaves break through and unfold like a pair of opening hands which soon look 
    like low flying butterflies. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are planting more than one hill of pumpkins, 
    the hills should be 10 feet apart. Once the seedlings are established (two 
    weeks after they have sprouted), thin to two or three of the strongest and 
    largest young plants per hill. This may take some courage, and it may seem 
    impossible to make the right choice. Take heart in the promise of abundance. 
    In the pumpkin garden, it will surely be fulfilled. </P>

  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pumpkin plants are vigorous vines and love to 
    sprawl. A single vine can grow as long as 30 feet, sending out many vine shoots 
    all along the way. Looking down from an airplane, it will appear as a carpet 
    of lush green leaves. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Does this mean pumpkins can't get along with their 
    neighbors? Absolutely not. The vine can be pruned, trained, and redirected 
    to live harmoniously with other plants. Pumpkins are often planted at the 
    edges of a corn and bean patch. The corn supports the climbing beans, and 
    the pumpkin vines are trained to creep among the corn stalks, The huge leaves 
    of the pumpkin plant serve as a floating mulch that holds down weeds and keeps 
    the soil moist. This classic Native American combination -- sometimes called 
    the three sisters -- not only grows well together, but their blended tastes 
    and textures make a delicious main course. <BR>
    <img src="pics/punkroof.jpg" width="85" height="144" align="LEFT" alt="Pumpkin Roof" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While pumpkins usually keep low to the ground, they can 
    be encouraged to grow where other plants might never venture. I've seen them 
    climb over shrubs, up fences and onto roofs. They do this with the help of 
    their tendrils -- curly grabbers that develop like a hand at every leaf node. 
    Tendrils are touch sensitive and will tightly curl around any waiting objects 
    in the path of the vine -- sticks, weeds, plants, anything that has a loose 
    end. The tendrils keep the vine stable as it reaches out across the garden. 
    If you train a pumpkin to grow up and onto a flat or slightly sloped shed 
    roof, it is like adding another floor to your garden. Direct the growing vine 
    to the side of a building and use 3" galvanized nails (drive them in about 
    half an inch) as tendril handles. With your guidance, the tendrils will curl 
    around the nails and ultimately the vine will reach and sprawl along the roof. 
    When pumpkins develop on the vine as it climbs the building, tack up old nylon 
    stockings as slings to support the swelling fruit. Or pinch off the baby pumpkins 
    until the vine reaches the roof. Then let them flourish on their penthouse 
    porch. Pumpkins on the roof! Your neighbors will drop their jaws as they scan 
    the horizon. </P>

  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the pumpkin seeds packets say: "Plant in 
    rich soil". But how do you know if your soil is rich enough? If the spot you've 
    chosen for your pumpkin patch has traditionally grown lots of weeds, then 
    it definitely has something to offer. But is it rich enough? Soil, like bank 
    accounts, can always use at least a little bit more. The question then becomes: 
    What to add? Compost and aged manure are often recommended. Check with a local 
    garden center for packaged products. Pumpkins are considered "heavy feeders" 
    and do well with a little extra nourishment. One nutrient source that works 
    well and is reasonably priced has the dismaying name "fish emulsion". It is 
    a concentrate of fishy by-products, rich in minerals, that smells a little 
    like low tide. Add a few glug-glugs (about a quarter of a cup) to a gallon 
    of water and sprinkle it on each pumpkin mound every three of four weeks. 
    It is definitely a power booster. There are many "miracle" goods on the market. 
    They promise a large supply of big pumpkins while posing the question of pushing 
    versus encouraging the natural process. <br></P>

  <P> <img src="pics/punkwater.jpg" width="104" height="144" align="RIGHT" alt="Pumpkin Water" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If pumpkins could speak, their first words would probably 
    be: "Gimme a drink." Between 80 to 90% of every pumpkin is water; and water 
    is an essential medium for bringing nourishment to the entire plant. Fortunately, 
    the plant has a built-in water-gathering and water-conservation system: The 
    huge leaves are a hovering mulch, mediating ground and sky, shading the soil, 
    keeping it moist, and inhibiting competition from weeds. They also are exquisitely 
    designed to draw nourishment from the sun and guide water to the base of the 
    plant. The question is not whether to water pumpkins, but when and how much. 
    A major factor is the kind of soil in the patch. Sandy soil needs more water 
    than soil with high deposits of clay. In either case, the rule of thumb is: 
    turn off the water when puddles appear; and wait till the soil is dry on top 
    before watering again. It is best to water the plant at the roots rather than 
    sprinkling from above. Drip systems and soaker hoses are efficient, reasonably 
    priced, and easy to install. Check with any local garden shop or hardware 
    store for supplies </P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="develop">How do pumpkin plants develop and reproduce?</A></B></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A HREF="#top">Top</A>
  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About a week after the two baby leaves appear, 
    the first "true" leaf, sporting jagged edges, starts to grow from the center 
    of the young sprout, providing a glimpse of the plant to come. After three 
    true leaves are established, the pumpkin plant moves into wild and crazy leaf 
    and root development that lasts about eight weeks. At its peak, the vine can 
    grow as much as 6" a day. <BR>
    <img src="pics/punkflwr.jpg" width="93" height="144" align="LEFT" alt="Pumpkin Female Flower" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ten weeks after planting, the first flowers suddenly appear 
    between leaves and tendrils. Each flower blooms for only one day. They start 
    to unfurl just before dawn, and during a four hour period, they open into 
    luxurious velvet bowls. By mid-day, they are on a slow course of folding in 
    on themselves; and by dusk, they are sealed forever. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every pumpkin plant has two kinds of flowers -- 
    male and female. Both are golden yellow, suggesting the color of the fruit 
    to come. On the surface, males and females look quite similar. However, with 
    a little observation you can begin to tell them apart. The male flowers, which 
    appear first, sit on long thin stems and are more plentiful than females. 
    The females sit closer to the vine and rest like queens on fuzzy round thrones 
    -- baby pumpkins in waiting. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In pumpkin land, the bees are the matchmakers, 
    gathering pollen from the center of the males and depositing it inside the 
    female flower while glutting themselves on sweet nectar. The bees are so busy 
    with their gathering and guzzling, they are oblivious to onlookers and very 
    unlikely to sting. So, if you are inclined, arise early in the morning, get 
    out your binoculars and have a close look. It is like watching the California 
    gold rush: greedy miners discovering the motherlode. Between watching bee 
    visits, take a deep breath, and the delicate fragrance of the flower will 
    add a new reward to your careful peeking. <BR>
    <img src="pics/beeflwr.jpg" width="122" height="122" align="RIGHT" alt="Bee and Flower" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some avid growers (and seed "manufacturers") imitate the 
    bees and pollinate the pumpkins manually in order to control and develop certain 
    traits. The process is quite simple: use a small artist's brush to gather 
    pollen from the males; carefully carry it to a chosen female and deposit the 
    pollen by "painting" the center of her flower. To keep out all other would-be 
    pollinators, place a small paper bag over the female flower and secure it 
    with a rubber band. Not nearly as exciting as watching the bees, but interesting 
    in a scientific sort of way. </P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="pruning">Should pumpkin plants be pruned?</A></B></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A HREF="#top">Top</A> 
  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pumpkins plants are vigorous growers. Almost 
    from the beginning, they are like adolescents -- bursting with energy, going 
    places without permission, and displaying their amazing abilities over and 
    over again. <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pumpkin vines withstand pruning quite well. Properly 
    done, it strengthens the plant and helps it thrive. In most cases, the plants 
    require some cutting if only to keep them from growing into your kitchen. 
    Every pumpkin plant has a main and a secondary vine that usually grow in opposite 
    directions. Each of these two vines produce shoots (or tertiary vines) which 
    can be selectively pruned as the plant develops. It is best to clip when these 
    new side shoots begin to develop. The plant will leak or bleed a little when 
    it is clipped, but it seals over quickly. The amount of pruning usually depends 
    on how much garden space is available. Trimming the plant is definitely necessary 
    to train the vine to run in a long narrow line along the edge of a garden 
    and to keep the plants from crawling over each other and their neighbors. 
    <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When pruning plants, wear long pants and gloves: 
    the vines are prickly. As you walk through the garden to check on pumpkins 
    or to tame runaway vines, remember that there are roots all along the vine 
    that spread out like a fancy hairdo just beneath the top few inches of soil. 
    It is best to walk on boards or tiles -- or at least to follow the same path 
    each time. This will help the soil remain soft and loose and keep the roots 
    "fluffy" so they can take in water and nutrients. <BR>
    <img src="pics/punkvines.jpg" width="157" height="108" align="LEFT" alt="Pumpkin Vines" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to pruning the vines, some gardeners prune 
    the fruit -- selecting a few for special attention and removing the rest. 
    This population control concentrates the energy of the plant and yields larger 
    but, of course, fewer pumpkins. Wait for the pumpkins to reach grapefruit 
    size before pruning. Even without selective pruning, all baby pumpkins do 
    not necessarily grow to maturity and may suddenly yellow and shrivel on the 
    vine. Perhaps they were not fully pollinated or maybe they were poorly located 
    on the vine, competing for nourishment with a more developed neighbor. The 
    harsh truth is that not every tiny pumpkin is destined to make it to the end 
    of the season. </P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="disease">What about danger and disease?</A></B></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A HREF="#top">Top</A> 
  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pumpkin plants are hardy and strong, but like 
    all living things, they are vulnerable to outside forces. In the early stages, 
    the main danger is frost. If the young plants are in the ground and the nights 
    threaten to become very cold, protect the seedlings with inverted clay flower 
    pots or a small cold frame, removing the covering each morning. Strong wind 
    is another threat to the sprawling plant. The tendrils help to hold the vine 
    down, but sometimes it is necessary to add anchors: u-shaped stakes made from 
    coat hangers work very well or criss-cross 18" bamboo sticks over the vine. 
    <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the season progresses, many insects and critters 
    will visit. Almost all are friendly and many are simply on their way to another 
    land. Even snails seem to overlook pumpkins, preferring, instead, less fuzzy 
    fare. In different regions, pumpkins are variously plagued by gophers and 
    moles, vine borers and beetles, aphids and mildew and other unwelcome visitors 
    and conditions that threaten their security. When these forces find their 
    way into your patch, they will need to be discouraged. Garden books offer 
    a wide range of "solutions" ranging from harmless but effective soaps to heavy 
    duty poisons. Throughout the season, keep an eye out for any irregularities, 
    especially in the leaves (both the top and bottom). To diagnose the problem, 
    take a sample to the garden center, another <img src="pics/bud.jpg" width="73" height="108" align="RIGHT" alt="Pumpkin Bud" border="1" vspace="5" hspace="5">knowledgeable 
    gardener, or the library (where the best books have pictures of squash plants 
    and their problems). As with your own health, early detection is the best 
    way to prevent a major problem and usually requires the least intervention. 
    My own preference is to keep the patch as organic as possible. A healthy well-fed 
    plant, basking in sunlight, unburdened by competition from weeds, and properly 
    watered has the best chance of successfully resisting danger as well as recovering 
    from attack. </P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="care_fruit">What should be done to take care for the developing fruit?</A></B></FONT> &nbsp; &nbsp; <A HREF="#top">Top</A> 
  </P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The basic rule for taking care of the developing 
    pumpkin fruit is to handle it as little as possible. At the same time, there 
    are a few widely practiced interventions. First, to encourage the classic 
    pumpkin look (round as opposed to lop-sided), adjust the fruit so that it's 
    bottom or flower-end is sitting squarely on the ground. This pumpkin "chiropractics" 
    should be done after the fruit is well-established -- usually a month after 
    its appearance and when the flower has dried and fallen off. Gently but firmly 
    lift the stem and the vine together with one hand, the pumpkin with the other, 
    and slowly rotate the position of the fruit without using undue force. You 
    may have to cut or loosen a few surrounding tendrils before lifting. At this 
    point, pumpkin "complexion" can be helped by slipping a shingle between the 
    young pumpkin and the soil. This prevents scarring or bruising as the pumpkin 
    grows and rotting if the soil becomes too soggy. Wear gloves; those vines 
    are prickly; and take care not to crease or snap the vine. <BR>
    <img src="pics/spooky.jpg" width="170" height="144" align="LEFT" alt="Spooky Pumpkin" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="1">&nbsp; 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people, especially kids, like to personalize their 
    pumpkins -- inscribe their names or draw a picture or a face on one of their 
    growing treasures. Perhaps it has something to do with the urge to establish 
    ownership, engage in primitive tribal scarring, or simply to co-create with 
    nature. Wait until the pumpkin is about 3 to 4 weeks old or developed enough 
    to have smooth, slightly toughened skin (all fuzz long gone). Any blunt tool 
    will do; a large nail works fine or even a ball point pen. Break the skin 
    and don't penetrate more than 1/8 inch. There will be some "bleeding" for 
    a few hours after surgery. Wipe the marking during the next few hours, and 
    it should seal within a day. At first, it may be hard to see the results; 
    but the scar will show in time and will grow in size along with the pumpkin.

    </B></FONT></P>
  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By late August, the days and nights grow colder 
    and the green pumpkins begin to change colors like the fall leaves. As the 
    fruit ripens, the vine displays the inevitable signs of age: older leaves 
    become tattered, fewer flowers bloom and the energy of the plant seems to 
    turn more inward, focusing on the fruit filled with the seeds that hold the 
    promise of the future. Eventually, the scraggly vines lie like skeletons through 
    the garden while the pumpkins -- fiery skulls that have trapped the energy 
    of summer -- are scattered throughout. At this point, it is always good to 
    invite a friend over to marvel at the fruit and to help to adjust to the shifting 
    mood of the garden. <BR>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pumpkins are ready to harvest once the color of the fruit 
    has deepened into one of the shades of the setting sun -- somewhere between 
    deep yellow and fiery red, depending on the variety. Leave several inches 
    of stem -- it helps them stay fresh -- and let them cure in the sun for 10 
    days. Cover them at night if there is danger of frost. Then, store the harvest 
    in a dry cool place. With proper care, you may just have pumpkins until Spring.

  <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There may be more questions. There are always 
    more questions. Rest assured that pumpkins do not require answers. All through 
    the growing season, these gregarious, lush plants display extraordinary vitality. 
    As natives to the American continent, they reflect the American spirit -- 
    generous, innovative, filled with energy, drawing resources and nourishment 
    from every possible corner, and imposing their presence wherever they grow. 
    And the fruit, the largest in the vegetable kingdom, has inspired cooks to 
    prepare delicious food and kids to carve horrific faces. Hail to pumpkins 
    -- nurturing body and arousing spirit. We are honored to witness your glory!
