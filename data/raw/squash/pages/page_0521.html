  theme should be vegetables: &quot;Give peas a chance -- after all, the
  game is called squash.&quot; Well, no longer. We gave into our inner farmer

  popular vegetables to plant in a garden. Eggplant, Radish, Tomato and Zucchini
  were the team names.</FONT>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD><FONT SIZE=+1>Thanks to John Lorence for suggesting this season's theme.
  To be accurate, John's suggestion was to use various types of summer squash
  such as Zucchini, Crookneck, Straightneck, Scallop, Spineless Beauty, Patty
  Pan and Moon Shine. We went a little beyond the fruit of the Cucurbitaceae
  family but everyone seemed to enjoy their vegetables.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Long before venti soy mocha macchiato--even before the
cool artiste types embraced berets and dark colored clothing--there were
beat writer/poets and beatniks. The word 'beat' was primarily in use by
jazz musicians and hustlers after World War II as a slang term meaning down
and out or poor and exhausted. In 1944, the word 'beat' as used by a Times
Square <IMG SRC="scrapbook_pics/Beat_Authors.gif" WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="160"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">hustler came to the attention of writer
William S. Burroughs. Through Burrows, it was passed on to Allen Ginsberg
and Jack Kerouac.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The intertwining lives of the Beat writers--who demonstrated
a carefree, reckless approach to literature as well as a contrary stance
toward what was referred to as &quot;The Establishment&quot;--was the theme
for the Spring 2003 Squash League.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Our season ended with Team Burroughs beating Team Kerouac
by 18 to 17 in the championship. As usual, the last night of league was
celebrated with pizza at Lombardino's.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Beats revolted against tradition; they have been accused
of many things, including starting the whole hippie movement in the '60's.
Perhaps we can use them as an example as we confront the &quot;squares&quot;
at the University to expand squash court access for general public players
who comprised 43-percent of Spring League registrations.</FONT></P>

<DL>
  <DD><FONT SIZE=+1>So you are one of the world's best squash players and
  your name is Peter Nicol and you get invited to baptize a new squash club
  in some little burg in Ohio. You've never heard of the guy who built a
  no-frills, three-court facility using $700,000 of his own funds. So, what
  do you do? Ba-ding! Bring a friend! But--realizing you are from Australia
  and the club is in Ohio--which friend to ask? You need someone who can
  play good squash and understand Australian English well enough to translate
  your remarks to the local bumpkins. Why yes. . . trusty Simon Anderson,
  that guy you drilled with when you were a young spud. <A HREF="http://www.squashtalk.com/html/news/usnews15.htm">Click
  here for the rest of the story courtesy of squashtalk.com</A>. Call it
  &quot;Simon and Damon's Road Trip&quot; and subtitle it with the caption
  &quot;Why Simon Didn't Accept Steve's Invitation to Go the EAA Fly-In This
  Year.&quot;</FONT>
  <DD>&nbsp;
  <DD><FONT SIZE=+1>Simon and Damon participated in a mini-clinic with Peter
  Nichols (current world #2) and Chris Walker (world #10) and also watched
  the pros play a demo match. Here's a Road Trip recap e-mailed by Simon:
  &quot;Damon and I started playing around noon on Saturday. We played each
  other and a few acquaintances of Damon's and then I played Chris Olsen,
  son of the owner, who plays #6 (I think) for Yale, and we actually went
  1 and 1 in two games. Then Damon and I played doubles against Chris and
  Charlie Johnson--he's now the squash pro there two days a week--and we
  won 2 to 1. Not bad given that Charlie is a very reputable doubles player
  and gives clinics on doubles play, and Chris is no slouch either. After
  that there was a clinic with the pros, exhausting drills and exercises,
  hints on shots plus practice for 40 minutes, then an exhibition match to
  watch, finally stopping playing squash after nearly 6 hours on the court.
  At the end we were unbelievably hurting!&quot;</FONT>
