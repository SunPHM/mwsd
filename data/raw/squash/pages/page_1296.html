			 appeals to many children because it requires all their senses. They can see
			 plants in all their glory, touch and feel the soil, hear the calls of birds,
			 animals and insects, smell the scent of flowers and of the good earth and once
			 the garden is producing, they can taste the results of their labors.
			 </B></FONT><BR><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><B>If you are ready to embark
			 on the great adventure of gardening with kids, get ready for a messy but
			 unbelievably rewarding experience. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide
			 some ideas and suggestions.<BR><BR>Choosing an appropriate spot for a child's
			 garden is key to making the experience happy and successful. The size of the
			 plot of land should be appropriate for the age of the child and his or her
			 physical abilities. If you are concerned about how the child's garden may look
			 (messy, perhaps!) and that concerns you, then you may want to choose a spot
			 that is somewhat hidden away. However, the chosen spot should have good
			 sunlight and be fairly flat. <BR><BR>Easy access to water is a must. If
			 watering the garden is too difficult a task, the child may avoid it and that
			 could spell an early end to the garden and the child's
			 enthusiasm.<BR><BR>Provide tools that are appropriate in size to the
			 child--both for ease of use and for safety's sake. Show children how to clean
			 and put away their tools every time they finish gardening.<BR><BR>Choose a pair
			 of sturdy shoes or garden boots--to avoid injury to tender toes. And make sure
			 the child has a pair of garden gloves to protect hands. Of course, there will
			 be times when the gloves will come off--as well they should. Gardening is,
			 after all, a tactile experience and children should be encouraged to touch and
			 feel the soil, plants, seeds and more.<BR><BR>Have your child wear old clothing
			 so that they don't have to worry about rips, tears or
			 dirt.</B></FONT><BR><BR><IMG SRC="images/tip!.jpg"

			 <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#006600"><B>You can
				help your child keep a garden journal. Seed packets can be clipped to a

				enter information about the plants progress, weather, days to harvest and

			 obstacles like weeds or a lack of rain also gives kids a chance to develop
			 problem-solving skills.<BR><BR>Here are a few suggestions for plants to use in
			 a child's garden:<BR></FONT></B><BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial"
			 SIZE="-1"><FONT COLOR="#006600">Pole beans and other beans or peas.</FONT>.
			 They grow quickly and some of them make good fresh-eating.<BR><FONT
			 COLOR="#006600">Squash or gourds.</FONT> They are easily grown and gourds can
			 be used to make pots and other vessels.<BR><FONT COLOR="#006600">Salad
			 greens.</FONT> Easy to grow and they make for good fresh grazing.<BR><FONT
			 COLOR="#006600">Sunflowers.</FONT> Easy to grow, dramatically colorful and
			 large and the source of seeds to eat and to save for planting later.<BR><FONT
			 COLOR="#006600">Marigolds or zinnias.</FONT> Easy to grow, colorful and they
			 make great cut flowers.<BR><BR>When selecting seeds, GardenToad recommends
			 open-pollinated seeds over hybrids. That's because open-pollinated seeds
			 produce plants with seeds that will grow plants that are "true".
			 </FONT></B><BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">True in this case means the
			 plants will have the same characteristics as the parent plant. With seeds from
			 hybrids, the plants are unlike their parents--and usually are of far poorer
			 quality than the parent plant.<BR><BR>Open-pollinated seeds save you money as
			 you can collect and plant seeds from your garden plants instead of having to
			 buy seed each year. Open-pollinated seeds also encourage plant
			 diversity.</FONT></B><BR></TD>
