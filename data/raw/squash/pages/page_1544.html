  <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Became aware of his pregancy 
  whilst playing Charlie Mott in his first game of this new ladder. Since then, 
  he's been busy toning himself for the re-match - the fitness is back but the 
  tummy bulge remains. This too will be toned and he'll be back and punching above 
  his weight as they say in more combative circles.<img src="images/SimonB.jpg" width="320" height="240"></font></p>

  <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Says of himself that whilst 
  he's always been enthusiastic, he's never been a star of a player. The extra 
  pounds he's put on in recent months needs to be shed, so show no mercy with 
  him!</font></p>

<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a href="mailto:Matthew.P.Johnson@cgey.com">Matthew 

  Johnson</a><br>

  </b>Describes himself as being 'on the ground floor', and 'I don't mind starting 

  at the bottom of the ladder as I'm not renowned for my squash ability'. Ah, 

  sweet.</font></p>


<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><a href="mailto:Charles.Mott@cgey.com">Charlie 

  Mott</a><br>

  </b>Known for his altheticism, but relatively new to squash and still making 

  the most of his beginners luck period. His game has been described thus:</font></p>

<p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Charlie never really gives 

  up but he does get riled when he misses shots/points so if you can get the better 

  of him on the run-around and get him worked up, you'll help break his composure. 

  He gets worked up and misses more shots that way. He doesn't lob very much and 

  is quite disciplined at getting back to position. It's important that you play 

  every shot and if (and usually is) he's in the way, run into him to get the 

  replay as he's not keen on let's when it would be dangerous to play the shot. 

  He has good racket control when he's not riled and his favourite shots are very 

  short ones and straight down the wall into the corner. Vary your game play as 

  it throws him completely.<img src="images/CharlieM_DuranceGeorge.jpg" width="275" height="417"></font></p>

  </b>Says of himself &quot;I have not played for about 9 months so I'm a bit 

  rusty, but normally I'm an average player with 1 or 2 good shots.&quot; Tough 

  opposition eh?</font></p>
