October 24, 1998, the Hafey family moved from a house in Rockdale to Hurstville,

a suburb further south of the Sydney CBD (slightly).&nbsp; Consequently,

all the garden that I had planted at Rockdale (including in excess of 200

tomato plants!) needed to be transplanted into pots and moved, along with

everything else, to the new house.&nbsp;</font></font></b><img SRC="tomato_jungle3.jpg" ALT="Tomato Jungle 3" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=5 height=259 width=166 align=RIGHT>

some gardening paraphernalia and various plants.&nbsp; To the right of the picture

to collect quite a lot (a whole brown paper lunch bag full) of seeds, and have 
started planting more around about the place.</font></font></b>

<br><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#663366">Nasturtiums are

a useful insect repellent.&nbsp; If planted around broccoli, cauliflower,

the cabbage family, radishes, tomatoes, cucumbers and fruit trees, they

deter white flies, squash bugs, and are a trap crop for aphids.&nbsp; They

also limit woolly aphid damage to apple trees if planted in a circle around

them.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#663366">Nasturtiums are

cultivated mainly for their ornamental qualities, but are sometimes used

for their spicy, peppery tasting leaves, seeds and flowers.&nbsp; The leaves

are eaten in sandwiches and salads, the flowers are used as a garnish for

salads and to flavour vinegar, and the seeds are pickled in vinegar to

be used like capers.</font></font></b><img SRC="pavers.jpg" ALT="the once hidden, but now exposed, pavers!" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=5 height=104 width=415 align=RIGHT>

I started planting out my tomatoes I noticed the soil was rather thin under

my gardening stuff.&nbsp; Imagine my surprise when, upon striking the soil

with my trusty shovel, I discovered it was indeed thin, only about an inch

deep, and under it were some pavers!&nbsp; We Hafeys are yet to decide

whether or not it is a good thing for said pavers to remain exposed.&nbsp;

I suppose they can be yet another area for Eilis to ride her dinky trike.&nbsp;

I could put my pots there...Maybe that's why they were covered up in the

first place - someone didn't know what to do with them once they'd been

laid!</font></font></b><img SRC="bricks.jpg" ALT="more pavers!" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=5 height=244 width=184 align=RIGHT>

<p><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#663366">Even more recently

(like Tuesday) I was wanting to unpot some of my marigolds.&nbsp; All was

well until I reached a part of the garden near the close line.&nbsp; More

pavers!&nbsp; Methinks the property was a whole lot larger in the past

than it is today!&nbsp; Sort of limits my direct-to-ground gardening, but

I think it adds a certain "something" to the garden.&nbsp; I just don't

yet know what that something is!</font></font></b>

plants.&nbsp; They were a little shocked at having been first grown in pots, then 
transplanted into the garden at Rockdale, then repotted for the move to Hurstville, 
and then once again, planted out into the ground!&nbsp; I was a little concerned 
at first, but they now seem to be doing alright.&nbsp;<a href="/tomatoes.html"><img SRC="potted_babies.jpg" ALT="potted babies" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=5 height=233 width=255 align=LEFT></a>Planted

<br><b><font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#663366">As with selecting

real estate, an important consideration when planting a vegetable garden

is position, position, position!&nbsp; Do not restrict yourself (if possible)

to the fenceline, rather, locate garden beds in the centre of the yard,

in order to obtain optimum sunlight, year round.&nbsp; Of course, if planting

shade or cool season crops, such as brassicas or lettuces, the fenceline

can prove to be a useful location.&nbsp; My garden beds have been located

in the sunniest parts of the yard, with the future ambition of joining

them together to form a patchwork of beds with paths between.&nbsp; At

present, I am consolidating eight garden beds, which were of a temporary

nature.&nbsp; The plan is to have them join (as much as possible) into

the one bed, growing as I need the space.&nbsp; Only one of these beds

was established prior to our moving here.</font></font></b><img SRC="tomato_jungle1.jpg" ALT="Tomato Jungle 1" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=5 height=281 width=213 align=LEFT>

  This bed on the right is for the berries, and I don't seriously believe that 
  they will stay contained in this small area!&nbsp; Among the varieties planted 
  here are boysenberries, blackberries and raspberries.&nbsp; Before we moved 
  house, I harvested 3 luscious raspberries!&nbsp; Mmmmm!&nbsp; I think it was 
  a bit of an accident that they were produced, because we haven't seen any since!&nbsp; 
  Hopefully some will grow in late summer or autumn. Apparently these berries 
  are best suited for colder climates, but as they were selling locally, I believe 
  they should do well enough.&nbsp; The berries too suffered from some shock in 
  the move, and I actually thought one of the plants had died, but they are all 
  now producing new growth.&nbsp; It's <i>berry </i>encouraging!</font></font></b>

Oakleaf, "Russian Red" Kale, Rocket, and a variety of other lettuces and

leafy greens that I can't think of right at this very moment.&nbsp; Beautiful

stuff.&nbsp; Right now they are too little to cut, but I had a huge patch

of Mesclun greens at Rockdale, and this kept us going all the way through

winter.&nbsp; I don't just serve these in a salad, I also use them in cooking,

as any other green leafy vegetable.&nbsp; Pure Health!</font></font></b>

quite remember the variety of beans planted here, but I do remember that

the method of planting known as the "three sisters" recommends one plants

beans with corn and squash.&nbsp; It's an Aztec gardening method.&nbsp;

First off, to provide nutrients for the soil, they would dig a couple of

holes and put dead fish in them.&nbsp; <i>(Bother!&nbsp; Knew I forgot

something!&nbsp; No dead fish!!)&nbsp; </i>A little while after they would

then hill up some rows and plant 2-3 kernels of corn, and wait for it to

grow a bit.&nbsp; Then they planted some beans in the hills, which would

twine their way around the stalks of corn.&nbsp; Around the whole garden

are planted squash seeds.&nbsp; These feed from any water that runs off

the corn and beans, and keep the ground moist with the shade from their

leaves.&nbsp; In turn, the beans and corn shade each other.&nbsp; Beans

enrich the soil with nitrogen, which corn takes out of the soil, and corn

enriches the soil with lysiene, which the beans extract.&nbsp; When eaten

together (as say, in a tortilla), these three combine to provide a pretty

nutritious meal.&nbsp; The ancient Aztecs pretty much survived on things

like this, adding tomatoes, tomatillos, and chile peppers as well to round

it all out.</font></font></b>
