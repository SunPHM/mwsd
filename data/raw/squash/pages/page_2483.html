<br>&nbsp;
</p><p><font size="+4">T</font>he year 1986 began as a great one for me and my
family. My dental practice was very successful. Our two children, ten-year-old
Natalka and six-year-old Andriy were doing very well in school. I was enjoying
every sport activity imaginable: hockey, baseball, tennis, squash, racquetball,
swimming, water-skiing,&nbsp; golf, you name it.
<br><img src="../pictures/snowmobile.jpg" border="0" height="303" width="425" align="right">
</p><p>My children and I loved throwing a ball around on summer evenings I
was doing some volunteer work as Canadian President of the Ukrainian Youth
Association. Helen was teaching part-time in a Ukrainian school and driving
the children to their various music and sports activities. Helen and I
had just joined a choir which was preparing for its premiere performance
with a new conductor that March. All in all, we were a thriving, active
and happy family.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; February 19, 1986, I went to choir practice as usual.
Helen was not feeling too well and was not with me that evening. On my
drive home, I stopped at an intersection preparing to make a left turn.
In my rear view mirror, I saw two headlights coming around a bend in the
road at tremendous speed. The last thing I remembered were those two headlights
almost on top of me. To this day, I can't remember getting out of my car
but what I do remember is standing outside leaning to support myself on
the hood of the car which had been propelled by the impact of the collision
to the other end of the intersection. I was feeling very weak and nauseous.
Eventually a policeman arrived on the scene and charged the other driver
with reckless driving. There was an ambulance station on the corner of
the intersection but neither the attendants nor the policeman thought to
take me to the hospital. They just let me go home in my own car.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow I managed to make it back to the house that
night but the next morning it really hit me. I couldn't move. The pain
in my head, neck, shoulders and back was excruciating. I had to cancel
that day's patients and see my doctor. Thus began an <font color="#ff0000">endless
eight-year long </font>procession of visits to doctors, lawyers, therapists,
chiropractors, specialists, X-ray laboratories, even a psychiatrist, for
examinations and various treatments, none of which were helpful for very
long if at all. I had a bad reaction to much of the prescribed medications
and couldn't use them. All I was left with as a pain killer was Tylenol-3
which didn't have any adverse effects on me. Like clockwork for eight years,
Helen would renew my prescription for 100 Tylenol-3's every three weeks.
What did the doctors have to say? There was permanent damage to my neck
and jaw (TMJ). Nothing could really be done. What I had to look forward
to was increasing arthritis in my neck and upper back and retirement within
five years due to increasing disability.
</p><p><b><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">A Different Way of Life</font></font></b>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the accident I was in constant pain seven days
a week. Tylenol-3 only made it a bit more bearable but not always. Often
there were periods of excruciating pain that lasted for 40 hours that no
pain killer could control. At these times I would have to lie flat on my
back on the floor, unable to move, unable to eat. Very often the pain would
make me vomit.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also a walking barometer able to sense weather
changes 48 hours in advance better that the weatherman. I would rather
not remember the two days leading up to a tornado that hit a community
near our city one year.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gone was the joy I had had in attending meetings
with the youth group. Those I attended, because I absolutely had to be
there, I would spend lying on the floor during the course of the meeting.
It was tremendously painful just to wake up every morning and try to lift
my children. They wondered why I was always mad at them; I had a short
temper now and kept telling them to leave me alone.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our social life dwindled to almost nothing and over
the years we had to cancel so many invitations and engagements that we
lost quite a few friends. At the office, I was not able to work comfortably;
I struggled with my pain. Many times I had to be driven home by someone
from my office because I couldn't manage it myself. Within six weeks of
my accident both my staff members left because they couldn't the stress
of the situation. Helen had to step in for one of them while we found someone
else to replace my assistant. I thank God that most of my patients understood
my problem and didn't mind too much when I had to cancel their appointments,
sometimes on very short notice. This happened so regularly after the accident
that some patients would call in before leaving home just to see if I was
still there. Between February, 1986 and April, 1994, I lost between 1/2
to 2 1/2 day's work every week; I have the figures documented. And it doesn't
take much to figure out how this affected our financial situation. I just
thank God that I didn't lose my practice altogether and that He saw us
through the worst of it.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of all this, I fell into a terrible state
of depression with only my family (my wife, Helen, my mother, Irene, and
my brother, Jerry) for support. Many times I asked Helen to get an axe
and hit me over the head or neck and put me out of this misery, and misery
it was for when I was in absolute agony, nobody could talk to me or help
me in any way.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the troubles this was causing me in
my office, I had to give up all my volunteer work. I withdrew into myself;
<font color="#ff0000">life
wasn't worth it</font><font color="#000000">.</font>
</p><p><b><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">A Changing Attitude</font></font></b>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not particularly religious
at this time, but I found myself changing.<img src="../pictures/helenandme.jpg" height="239" width="366" align="right">
This was mainly due to the fantastic support I was receiving from my wife,
Helen, and my mother, both religious persons. Suddenly, I found myself
praying nightly. I began to read the Bible and promised God I would read
it every night for the rest of my life.
<b>There were no conditions</b>.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mainly prayed for my mother
whom I loved very deeply and who about this time was diagnosed with cancer.
And while I was praying for her, she was constantly praying that God would
help me.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was because of my mother
that Helen and I wound up going to </font><font color="#3333ff">Garabandal</font><font color="#000000">.
She really lived her faith devoting much of her time to the Church and
the women's league, cooking and baking for the sick and visiting them even
when she wasn't feeling well herself. She often went on weekend retreats
with the women's league.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After various cancer treatments
proved ineffective and the doctors declared that nothing more could be
done, she was resigned to the fact. That was in the summer of 1993 and
Helen and I decided that perhaps a pilgrimage would be good for her. I
knew she would like to go on a religious pilgrimage but that she wouldn't
go alone. So I told her that we were planning to go to </font><font color="#3333ff">Garabandal</font><font color="#000000">
and promised her that we would all go together. She was extremely happy
and hoped to live long enough to make the trip.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, throughout September
and October of 1993, her condition deteriorated rapidly. Now when I prayed,
I asked God that if He wished to take her,<b> it was His choice</b>. And
take her He did on November 14, 1993. I, of course, was deeply saddened
but also happy for her - but&nbsp; I missed her. I completely forgot about
our proposed visit to </font><font color="#3333ff">Garabandal.</font>
</p><p><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">The Trip</font></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after New Year and
our Ukrainian Christmas, I felt something bothering me. I remembered my
promise to my mother about going to Garabandal and this thought kept eating
away at me. I told Helen and so we decided to join The </font><font color="#00cc00">Workers
of Our Lady of Mount Carmel</font><font color="#000000"> trip to </font><font color="#3333ff">Garabandal
</font><font color="#000000">for
Holy Week and Easter.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were to fly from Toronto
to New York where we would meet up with the rest of the group; but before
we left I didn't speak about going to</font><font color="#3333ff"> Garabandal</font><font color="#000000">
only Spain. Even on the trip to New York I kept saying to Helen that I
didn't know why I was going. I wasn't very religious, not the type of person
to walk around with a Bible in my hands or to be praying all the time.
I mentioned to Helen that we would be the youngest ones there and even
brought along a spy mystery novel to read in case I got bored. But boy,
</font><font color="#ff0000">was
I ever mistaken</font><font color="#000000"> about the people going to
Garabandal! And this trip was the best thing I ever did in my life. </font><font color="#ff0000">It
saved my sanity, my family life, my marriage, my career and most important,
my soul.</font>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the airport in New York, Helen and I immediately
recognized <font color="#000000">Joey and Marilynn Lomangino</font> because
we had seen countless pictures of them. Rosemarie Melenchuk, the tour guide,
greeted us but we were too shy to approach <font color="#3333ff">Joey</font>.
However, we were thrilled that he was on the pilgrimage.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived safely at the village of <font color="#3333ff">San
Sebastian de Garabandal </font><font color="#000000">and it was just as
we had imagined it would be, quiet, serene, picturesque, home. We felt
very much at ease there but my pain was with me nevertheless. I had my
medication and kept taking the Tylenol-3's like clockwork.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in the village, it was
announced that </font><font color="#3333ff">Joey</font><font color="#000000">
would give a talk about his experiences in the afternoon of the following
day in the village church. Of course, Helen and I planned to be there.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Joey's talk, we got on
line with everyone else to venerate his medal (kissed by </font><font color="#3333ff">Our
Lady at Garabandal</font><font color="#000000">). I was feeling my usual
self, pain in my neck, shoulders and jaw. But when I kissed Joey's medal
-- it was </font><font color="#ff0000">I cannot explain it to this day</font><font color="#000000">
-- it was as if suddenly all the energy just drained out of my body down
through my feet. I can still remember the feeling even today. I was barely
able to stand and would have fallen if I had not held onto the pews for
support. Helen was kneeling in prayer when I got back to our place but
I didn't have the strength so I just sat there. Slowly, my strength returned
and then and only then could I kneel down to pray. The pain was still there.
Never before in my life have I experienced a similar feeling. I thought
perhaps it was the stale air or that I was over tired. It was not a common
fainting feeling. A couple of days later, Bob House, one of the tour members,
noticed something about me, perhaps a pained expression or the way I was
walking and approached us. We talked and I mentioned my accident and the
subsequent chronic pain. Bob suggested I ask </font><font color="#3333ff">Joey</font><font color="#000000">
to put the&nbsp;</font><font color="#3333ff"> medal</font><font color="#000000">
on my neck but I told him I didn't come to </font><font color="#3333ff">Garabandal
</font><font color="#000000">for
that. I had come for my mother, to fulfil a promise I had made to pray
for her. I told him that if anything were to happen, it would happen anyway
but I wasn't going to ask for myself.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Friday was a cold and
damp day that intensified my suffering; Holy Saturday was even worse. I
was taking my Tylenol-3's every three hours just to be able to move around.
In the evening the situation became acute; I didn't sleep all night.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early Easter morning, April
3, I wasn't able to get out of bed to join the rosary procession through
the village streets. The pain was so excruciating I couldn't even raise
my head as the villagers passed by the house where we were lodged singing
the rosary. After two more Tylenol-3's we were somehow later able to attend
Mass celebrated by tour spiritual director, Father Thomas Blessin. The
day dragged on until finally 6:00 o'clock came when I took my last two
Tylenol-3's.</font>
</p><p><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">The Cure</font></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At eight o'clock, we went to
dinner, I didn't feel much like eating but Helen urged me to go. As we
entered the inn run by Serafin, the visionary </font><font color="#3333ff">Conchita</font><font color="#000000">'s
oldest brother, Bob House came up and asked if </font><font color="#3333ff">Joey</font><font color="#000000">
had put the </font><font color="#3333ff">medal</font><font color="#000000">
on my neck.<img src="../pictures/joeymedal.jpg" height="291" width="198" align="left">
I replied that I hadn't asked him. Bob then took me by the arm to where
</font><font color="#3333ff">Joey</font><font color="#000000">
was standing in the corner of the room and said, "Joey, here's a man with
a sore back." Joey, always the gentleman, immediately took out his medal,
asked me where it hurt and to guide his hand. I didn't know what he was
saying but imagined he was praying. Then he told me to pray and (while
applying the medal) said, "</font><font color="#ff0000">Remember it's up
to God...all I can do for you is pray.</font><font color="#000000">" I
thanked him. I felt no change at this time and the tremendous pain I was
enduring was still there. We all had dinner and then left to pack our bags
since we were scheduled to depart early the next morning.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hours later, after packing,
I instinctively reached for my medication. Suddenly I realized there was
absolutely no pain in my neck, back or jaw. My neck hadn't felt like this
for years, in fact, I couldn't remember the last time I had felt so totally
pain free. I said my prayers before going to bed and took no medication,
but felt I would have to get up in the middle of the night to take it.
At 2:00 a.m., I awoke to go to the washroom and afterwards as I sat on
my bed, reached for my medication. But wait, <b>there was no pain</b>.
I felt terrific! I was sure the pain would "kill me" in the morning but
I didn't need any medication at this time. I prayed the rosary and thanked
Our Lady and God for these few hours.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up early Monday morning
and to my utter amazement, I felt absolutely wonderful. I thanked God and
waited for the pain to begin later. My wife, Helen, knew nothing about
these wonderful few hours for me. As we got on the bus I waited for the
pain - but it didn't come.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob House, wonderful caring
Bob, came to me as we were getting on the bus and before even knowing what
happened to me, gave me his medal which was an exact replica of Joey's
and told me to use it daily. I have been doing this faithfully and have
it in my possession constantly.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the bus made its way to
the Santander airport, I realized it would be unfair of me not to tell
Joey and the rest of the group about the wonderful few hours I had just
experienced. Eight hours without pain was just phenomenal for me and I
told everyone on the bus about the present state of my health.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the way I expected the
pain to hit me but it didn't. Our new friends kept coming up to me and
asking, "Are you still all right?" "Yes," was my answer.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen and I missed our connecting
flight to Ontario from New York's Kennedy Airport and had to wait even
longer on an already exhausting day. When we arrived home very late, it
was cold and raining, the kind of weather that usually kept me in the house.
The next day, my office staff members were surprised when I showed up for
work. The weather was terrible and they knew that normally, on days like
this I would not be able to work. They saw my face, they heard me speak,
they saw my energy and how I walked. They couldn't get over it. Whatever
happened to Mike?</font>
</p><p><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">A New Lease on Life</font></font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that time, vitually all
my patients have been amazed at the tremendous change in me. I was like
the old Dr. Mike before the accident. I joked, I was happy, I was radiant.
Weather has not affected me since then and Helen complains that she has
lost her walking barometer. Energy? I have too much even for my staff whom
I have managed to exhaust every day since then. I relate the </font><font color="#3333ff">story
of Garabandal </font><font color="#000000">constantly. Once my assistant
said to her mother, "Mike is so happy I can't stand it." You see, she didn't
know me before the accident. And I can swing those golf clubs again, cart
a heavy wheelbarrow, lift heavy weights and do all those things I couldn't
do for eight years. It's wonderful.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, Helen and I have
given a number of talks on Garabandal and will continue to do so as long
as we are able. I thank all those who are happy for me and if it's God's
plan that my pain should return even this minute, don't feel sorry for
me. I have had one of the greatest gifts anyone could have. I felt very
lucky after a few short hours and now after seven months one can imagine
fortunate I consider myself. (update....it is now over seven years without
pain).</font><img src="../pictures/joeygroup.jpg" height="198" width="257" align="right">
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of this unexpected
gift the lives of my family, friends and patients have all been changed
for the better, not to mention the many others who have seen me suffer
for years. Helen and I will pray that they, too, will be rewarded and that
we'll all be able to witness the great Miracle soon.</font>
</p><p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To this day I ask, Why did
it happen to me? I have no answers. How long it will continue only God
knows. But I thank Him every day for the tremendous blessing He has bestowed
on me. ***</font>
