First we got a partner and a bag. Then we went into certain rows and started picking. This is how we picked it. We went down a row and went up to a corn stalk and looked for corn cobs to pick.  <p><img src = "cornbag.jpg" alt = "people with bags" align = "right"></p>We picked all the corn cobs we could find. You might think you are just supposed to pull but that didn't work really good. You can twist and pull. That worked <em>really </em> good! When we picked it we threw it into a bag. It was really fun. We picked until the bag was full. It was hard to carry when it was full. When we got our bags full. they were hard to carry. So how did we get them up? Some kids had help from a parent or teacher who carried their bags. But others dragged their bags. When the class got the bags back to the shucking area we put the bags down and peeled the corn. If it was bad corn, we threw it into a pile. But if it was bad it would not have a lot of kernels, could be brown, or have a bug in it. When there was a bug in it, some kids thought they were getting sick and dropped the corn. But if it was good, you were supposed to put it on a table. Some kids predicted it was good corn even though it was bad sometimes. There was a lot of good corn and a lot of bad corn. Corn is one of the three sisters. That makes it very important to the Oneida people. <p><img src = "sun.jpg" alt = "corn and sun"  align = "left"></p>The three sisters are squash, beans, and corn. The three sisters are very important to the Oneida people because they helped each other to grow. The squash helps the corn by growing around it. It has prickly leaves so raccoons can't get the corn. The corn helps the beans by having the beans grow on a tall stalk so nothing can eat the beans. Beans help the other plants by getting nitrogen from the air for all the plants to use in the soil. The Oneida took the best ears of corn, dried them and shelled them for the next year to plant.</p><p align = "center"><img src = "cooncorn.jpg" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center">by Isaiah </p><p align = "left"><img src = "treetop.jpg" alt = ""><a href = "#top">To top of page </a></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h1 align = "center"><font color = "#238e23">Breakfast and Dinner at Our Campsite</font></h1><p align = "center">We ate dinner and breakfast where we camped. At dinner we ate hot dogs and chili. Some kids put tobasco on the their chili to make it <font color = "#ff2400">HOT! </font> Tabasco is a hot, hot sauce. We had hot apples for dessert and hot apple cider to drink. <p><img src = "hotdogs.jpg"alt = "hotdog roast" align = "left">We went to the woods to get a hotdog stick for our hotdogs. When we got back to our campsite Ms. Rosenberg sharpened our sticks. Then we got our hotdogs. We held our sticks with the hot dogs on them by the fire. Then the teacher brought this little stove and warmed up the chili there. Then the teacher put paper foil on the apples and put them in the fire. In the morning we ate oatmeal, hot cocoa, bananas, bagels and muffins. We baked the bagels by the fire. <p><img src = "Imfull.jpg"alt= "drawing of girl" align="left"></p>A teacher cooked the hot cocoa by the stove. Then they put water on this big can for the oatmeal. The food was yummy and made Dominique's stomach full. </p><p align = "center">by Oscar </p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h1 align = "center"><font color = "#238e23">Hikes</font></h1><p align = "center"><img src = "path.jpg"alt="drawing of path"></p><p align = "center">When we went to the Oneida Reservation, we went on hikes. One hike I will tell you about was when Oscar, Morrie, Kevin and I were hiding. Early in the morning we were playing soccer. The teacher said if you want to you can go on a hike. "Come on now," Ms. Germain yelled. Oscar, Morrie, Kevin and I asked if we could go by ourselves. We were hiding from the class because we did not want to be all one group. The teacher said we could. But we had to come back when the horn blows. We went down the trail. It was muddy. We saw a baby bird in a tree. There were lots of trees and firewood. There was bark on the ground for fire. I like going on hikes because you get all dirty and you get to explore with your friends. We followed the horse poop on the trails to know how to get back to the camp. When we were in the woods, there were logs on the path we got to jump over. It helps me get my exercise by being out on hikes. </p><p align = "center">Where I live I don't get to go on hikes very much. So I really enjoyed it. </p><p align = "center"><img src = "oscar.jpg" alt = "oscar">&#160;&#160;<img src = "morrie.jpg" alt = "morrie">&#160;&#160; <img src = "calvin.jpg" alt = "calvin">&#160;&#160; <img src = "kevin.jpg" alt = "kevin"></p><h1 align = "center">Oscar + Morrie + Calvin + Kevin =  </h1><h1 align = "center">Friends<img src = "boys.jpg" alt = "..."></h1><p align = "center">by Calvin </p><p align = "left"><img src = "treetop.jpg" alt = ""><a href = "#top">To top of page </a></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h1 align = "center"><font color = "#238e23">Storyteller</font></h1><p align = "center">When the storytellers came they got out their instruments and sang and played music. They sang good songs and sad songs. There were three men and one lady. When they sang they closed their eyes. I wanted to know why. I didn't want to ask them why. But we got to play instruments. One of the instruments had a turtle claw on it. Well, it sounded like beans were in them. They had about eleven instruments. Some of them sounded funny. They told us a couple of stories. One was about a boy and a snake. There was one about a boy who came back home and lived with the wolves. He turned into a wolf. </p><p><img src = "heart.jpg"alt = "heart" align = "left">There was another one about a woman who ran away from home because her husband wasn't treating her right. When she was running, she knew her husband was tracking her. She left skunks behind so he couldn't find her. He wasn't calling her by her name or putting food on the table for her. He also had his heart broken when his wife ran away. He decided to go home and change his ways. He named the place where all the skunks were what we now call CHICAGO.</p><p align = "center">Then it was time to go back to their jobs. (the storytellers). So they left. It was cool that they came there. </p><p align = "center">by Kevin </p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h1 align = "center"><font color = "#238e23">Tents!</font></h1><p align = "center"><img src = "realtent.jpg"alt="tents"></p><p align = "center">When we got to Oneida, we set up our tents and went for a hike. When we got back to camp, we made a campfire and unrolled our sleeping bags and went back to the campfire. When we were sleeping it rained and we got very wet. Toby said that her tent was waterproof but it was not. That is why I got wet. I slept with Tiffany, Shosh, and Toby, also with Becky. <p><img src = "4girls.jpg" alt = "4 girls" align = "left"></p>I have never camped out with my friends before. But I have camped with my family. It was different because my tent doesn't collect water at the bottom, that I know of. I haven't camped out in the rain before. It was different because we didn't have a campfire when I camped with my family. Tiffany and Shosh got up in the middle of the night and were going out to get a drink. When they were going out, they stepped all over my legs. </p><p align = "center"><img src = "emily.jpg"alt="girls"></p><p align = "center">The next morning Toby woke up first. I woke up second because Toby yelled something. The rest of my friends woke up on their own. Actually, in the middle of the night, I couldn't find my pillow so I had to use a blanket for a pillow and a blanket to cover up. I realized that my blanket was wet in the middle of the night. I was wet too. But I was too tired so I went back to sleep. When I woke up Becky was wet too. She was sleeping by the wall. Her hair was really wet because in the morning she slipped off her pillow. Her hair was really wet and looked like a mop of hair. In the next tent over, Silke (parent chaperone) got wet too. But her son stayed dry. So mostly everyone got wet. People had a good time anyway. </p><p align = "center">by Emily </p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h1 align = "center"><font color = "#238e23">My Trip to Oneida</font></h1><p align = "center"><img src = "Shantay.jpg" alt = "art"></p><p align = "center">Hi! My name is Shantay. We are going to see the kitties. They are fuzzy and pretty. I like kitties. I saw kitties. They ran and we ran too. We had fun. We saw one again. We ran and they ran too. We picked corn. <p><img src = "braids.jpg" alt = "corn braids"align = "left"></p>We all had fun and we picked pumpkins. <p><img src = "clare.jpg" alt = "Clare" align = "right"></p>We played in the pumpkin patch. We went to the farm and we had fun. We had fun hiking. We hiked very far in the woods. We went to Turtle School. We played LongBall. We had fun. Maxine told us about the three sisters. We all had fun. Did you have fun? </p><p align = "center">by Shantay </p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h1 align = "center"><font color = "#238e23">Rain</font></h1><p align = "center"><img src = "purpltnt.jpg" alt = "purple tent"></p><p align = "center">When you think of rain, what do you think of? If you put rain and camping together, what do you think of? If you don't have any idea it's going to be easy to think about after you read this story having to do with rain. When we got to the campsite, it was sunny but cold. It wasn't until after the campfire (at night) that it started to rain. It rained all night long.<p><img src = "wetsock.jpg" alt = "girl and socks" align = "right"></p> When the kids who slept in the tent with me woke me up, we were soaking wet, and so was all of our stuff. We came out of the tent but we had to put on our wet shoes. <p><img src = "tents2.jpg" alt = "boots"align = "left"></p>Most of us got dry clothes on and two of us got to wear other peoples dry extra shoes. We asked everybody if they had gotten wet. We found out that out of the seven tents, we were one of the tents to get wet. Rain is a great thing when you are camping, if you are prepared. </p><p align = "center">by Shoshana </p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><h2 align = "center"><img src="apple.gif"alt=""><a href= "part3.htm">Go to Part Three</a></h2><p align = "center"><img src = "r63.gif" alt = "..."></p><p align = "center"><font color = "#9932cd">Thank you to everyone who helped make this a wonderful trip.
