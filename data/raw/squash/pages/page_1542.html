<p align="center">"The natural charm of Prince's Grant transcends all prejudices and allows for appreciation of this God given setting and accommodates all those who are at one with the world. The golf course is the cherry on the top - interesting, challenging and beautiful"  Alistair and Marilyn Forbes&nbsp;<br>

This is perhaps why, of the original 462 property stands on the estate, 94% have been sold. Such is the beauty and tranquility that surrounds this 154 hectare estate, it is difficult, if not impossible, not to fall head over heels in love with. On entering the estate you immediately succumb to a time frame of a distant era, being engulfed by the same dream that the developer had some 23 years ago. Yes indeed, it is a dream come true. As your stay here goes by, you will realise exactly what Prince's Grant has to offer that you won't find elsewhere. Its magnetic attraction will tear at your heart and you will find yourself yearning to be a part of this lifestyle. As one of our owners said "if you invested for quality of life, you made an excellent decision that you need to capitalise on as a matter of urgency; my recommendation, speaking from a personal experience, is that you build and enjoy the best times at Prince's Grant".&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">  "We originally bought a plot at Prince's Grant because the whole family was 'golf mad'. We considered it an ideal opportunity for our teenage sons to improve their handicaps and play as much golf as they desired. We built immediately and have never had any regrets. Over the five years we have been there it has developed into much more than a golf estate. We now consider it an ideal escape from the pressures of the office and from the moment we drive through the gates we unwind and relax" Barbara and Martin Rotteveel.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/property_sales/House_Green_by_river.jpg" width="427" height="350"></p>
<p align="center"> The stress free atmosphere puts at peace your mind and soul. An individual's longevity is bound to increase when living in this environment, engaging in an active lifestyle and soaking up the cool refreshing sea air. The sub tropical climate ensures that residents costs are minimal as far as cooling and heating requirements are concerned, whilst at the same time being faced with magnificent weather all year round. Levies are extremely low for this type of development, only R478 per month, with annual membership fees for the golf club R2850 for your family -  husband, wife and children up to the age of 26 - with no charge for green fees either.<br>

"Prince's Grant offers an unsurpassed golfing experience which is significantly enhanced by the beauty of the natural indigenous environment, the beautiful lagoon and seascapes and the solitude that is experienced on many parts of the estate" Bill and Carol Dixon.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/property_sales/Rivermouth.jpg" width="329" height="241"></p>
<p align="center"> This is not just a golf course, but with a magnificent 1.5 km beach frontage it provides the discerning beach goer with the ultimate escape. Then there is the Umhlotaan lagoon, stretching 4 kms inland, for those who wish to take a leisurely paddle and enjoy the tremendous birdlife, of which there have been over 200 species spotted, or even cross the flight of some of the resident fish eagles. For those who love a walk, a superb nature trail has been carved along the lagoon, through the wetland forest where you will encounter many rare plants, and perhaps take time to relax on one of the boardwalk jetties overlooking the lagoon. Of course, should one wish to throw a line, there is some fine fishing likely to provide entertainment, in the lagoon or sea and some bass fishing in the dams on the golf course. And if that's not enough, the energetic can partake in a game of squash or tennis and refresh themselves afterwards in one of the three communal swimming pools.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">"Prince's Grant - the most tranquil spot on the North Coast - where we can just get away from it all. Exquisitely maintained golf course, beautiful beach (dolphins galore), sunset canoe cruises, forest walks, the most amazing bird life…..We love it - it's a little piece of heaven on earth" Jadrick Coetzee<br>
 The urban structure of Prince's Grant supports the idea of community, made up of villages where the buildings line the streets and then relate out into the countryside again. Practically all sites have incredible panoramic views, sea views, lagoon views or a fair portion of the golf course. The sites have been interspersed with nodes that will be common ground providing space for community activities, whilst the street should be more than just a connector, but where interaction with neighbours be encouraged.<br>
<br>
Architectural designs are extremely important whereby a harmony of form, colour, and texture will create a unified character of colonial and traditional influences. This will have the effect of narrow winding village streets, with houses that will be designed with generous usable verandahs, steeply pitched white corrugated profile roofs and colours that will follow those of African people of the region. Privacy is incorporated within the walls onto interior courtyards, verandahs and swimming pools.</p>
