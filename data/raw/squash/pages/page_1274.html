  of the All-America Selections for 1980 are of particular interest to vegetable 
  gardeners. A wonderful vivid yellow zucchini, named Gold Rush, sets loads of 
  squash on compact plants (they take up a mere four square feet!). The unusual 
  plant's habit of growth is upright and open, so air can easily penetrate to 
  the base and prevent overly wet soil and rotting fruit. Furthermore, just think 
  how attractive bright yellow Gold Rush would look when steamed up with a crisp 
  batch of dark green Scallopini squash ... a Patty Panlzucchini cross that was 
  an All -America winner in 1977!</em></font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  <em>Another 1980 prizewinner, the bronze medal Holiday Time pepper, is both 
  ornamental and edible! The compact plants (a full-grown specimen can be put 
  in a quart jar) will even bloom and set fruit indoors . . . and you don't need 
  to worry about insect-or hand-pollination. The fruits poke up through the foliage 
  like tiny dunce caps, and they color as they mature from yellow to orange to 
  scarlet. When it's time for some spicy food, you'll find that the little peppers 
  can make a pungent contribution to your meal. </em></FONT> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"><em>And 
  here's a little more All-American news: The (organic, naturally) garden at MOTHER's 
  Eco-Village has been designated a display garden by the All-America Selections 
  folks. This means we'll be exhibiting AAS winners from </em></FONT> <em><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the

  It Sweet</strong></FONT></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Folks used to joke that the only way to really appreciate the flavor of sweet 
  corn was to have a pot of boiling water next to you in the field as you cut 
  the succulent ears . . . because the time it took to walk from the corn patch 
  to the kitchen was considered long enough for this delicate vegetable's rich 
  supply of sugar to start changing to starch. </font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  Well, the need for such haste disappeared-back in 1961-with the development 
  (based on research done at the Universities of Michigan and Illinois) of the 
  "shrunken gene" varieties of extra sweet corn. The two new hybrids </FONT> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(known 
  as Early Extra Sweet and Illinichief Super Sweet) are twice as sweet as normal 
  corn at the moment of harvest and-because the sugar content converts to starch 
  more slowly-four times as sweet 48 hours after picking. In fact, the only problem 
  with these fine cultivars is that they absolutely must be kept isolated from 
  other varieties of corn ... since cross-pollination causes the extra-sweet hybrids 
  to revert to their dominant ancestor, starchy field corn. </font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
  several seed houses are now offering alternative varieties that don't need to 
  be separated from other types of corn: the EH (for everlasting heritage) hybrids. 
  These corns remain tasty for up to two weeks after pickin', and their pericarps 
  -the protective skins of the kernels-are much more tender than those of "normal" 
  corn. The new EH hybrid species are called Kandy Korn (Gurney), D-5 (Burrell), 
  Tender-treat EH and Mainliner EH (Burpee), Golden Sweet EH (Stokes), and losweet 
  EH (Herbst). Try 'em . . . and leave the pot on the stove! </font> </p>

  introductions on page 36 of this issue, but some of the exciting vegetables 
  introduced for 1980 are just too new for Brent to have tried. Burpee, for instance, 
  has come up with a compact cucumber-Bush Champion -that can be grown as close. 
  ly, as 12 inches in the row . . . and does a terrific job in pots on the patio, 
  too. The same company's new Butter Boy Hybrid butternut squash produces a bumper 
  yield in one-third less space than the old favorite Waltham takes up. Burpee 
  has an upgraded beefsteak tomato, as well-called Super-steak-that brings Fusarium 
  and Verticillium resistance to the old favorite. </FONT> </p>

  For the latest in leaf lettuce, Park is featuring Crispy Sweet (which combines

  butter-head types with the cut-and-come-again qualities of loose-leaf varie.

  has a unique tropical flavor. </FONT> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  An "ever bearing" potato is going to be offered by Henry Field: called the McNeilly 
  va. riety, the hybrid continues to make new tubers through September ... allowing 
  you to harvest some and leave the rest to mature. Gurney, in turn, has introduced 
  the Butte potato ... which out-produces the Russet Burbank and has 58%a more 
  vitamin C </FONT> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and 
  20%a more protein than other varieties. </font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  Gurney also offers a novel dwarf grapefruit tree-the product of the company's 
  Micro-Budding technique-which will bear fruit indoors in two to three years 
  ... and that's up to ten years earlier than normal kinds!</FONT></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000">As 
  you can see (and we've dropped just a few tantalizing tips), 1980 is going to 
  be a great year for new vegetables. So pen a line to some of the companies in 
  MOTHER's seed-supplier access list on page 174 ... and order up some wish books!

<p ALIGN="justify"><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">REGIONAL 
  SEED MERCHANTS </font> </strong></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
  can, of course, get a fine selection of seeds from any one of the big national 
  outfits, but did you know that there are companies that specialize in varieties 
  for particular geographical areas? Hastings and Wyatt-Quarles, for example, 
  offer plants for the South, while Burrell sells far West favorites. Roswell, 
  on the other hand, deals in items for the Southwest . . . and Johnny's, Farmer, 
  and Vesey all have hardy seeds for the far North. </font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  So if your climatic conditions are <em>really</em> unusual-very dry, or cold, 
  or hot-consider placing your garden purchase order with one of the regional 
  seed merchants. (By the way, some of the <em>big</em> companies regionalize 
  their catalogs, too: Burpee has its famous "bulls-eyes" to indicate vegetables 
  particularly suited to your area, Thompson &amp; Morgan indicates-with asterisks-varieties 
  that will do well in the South, and the Dave Wilson Nursery in California breaks 
  down the country into 41 zones and suggests fruit trees especially adapted to 
  each!)</FONT></p>
