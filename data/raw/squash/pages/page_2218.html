					<p>Bob Sommer, UC Davis&#146; own Jimmy Carter of department chair diplomacy, is stepping down from his most recent post after 2 1/2 years of ministering to the organizational needs of the art faculty and staff. But that doesn&#146;t mean he&#146;s ready to retire.</p>
					<p>He has chaired four departments over the past 13 years: psychology, environmental design, rhetoric and communication, and art, rather disparate disciplines that one might think unconnected unless you knew of Sommer&#146;s newest fantasy: chairing the Department of Nematology. &quot;I&#146;ve never seen a nematode, but I&#146;d like to prove that being a chair is a generic role -- it&#146;s the liberal-arts model of administration,&quot; he says.</p>
					<p>&quot;Being a chair has become my long-term racket: making the world better through moving chairs around. But Emily Post knew that long before I said it.&quot;</p>
					<p>At age 71, Sommer can boast having passed up three golden handshakes. He&#146;s taking a sabbatical this next quarter to work on his newest interest: art of the mentally ill. &quot;It&#146;s clearly a sublimation of my work here in art,&quot; he says.</p>
					<p>Sommer is an environmental psychologist who arrived at UC Davis in 1963 after making a name for his work in mental-hospital reform. Since then he has studied and advocated the results of his research on more humane prisons, urban trees, farmers&#146; markets, cooperatives, &quot;<a href="http://www.newssearch.ucdavis.edu/Dateline/022396/22396no6.html">the soft classroom&quot; </a>and bike paths, to name just a few of his global interests. He met his wife, Barbara, a longtime psychology lecturer on campus, while riding a bike in Davis.</p>
					<p>A man for all seasons, this mushroom hobbyist, gardener, painter and former snail farmer says he remains true to the goal he set for himself in college.</p>
					<p>&quot;When I was an undergraduate, World War II had just ended and we had had the atom bomb and the Holocaust and a lot of other terrible things,&quot; Sommer says. &quot;I decided to make this world a better place. I felt the problems were in human relations and I still do.&quot;</p>
					<h3>What is your idea of perfect happiness?</h3>
					<p>Hiking in the Sierra. It&#146;s like climbing to the rooftop of the world through a floral rock garden. I love reaching the summit with a 360-degree view and having no sign of human habitation. You get up there and you can&#146;t see roads, you can&#146;t see houses, you can&#146;t see any sign of human habitation.</p>
					<h3>Your idea of utter misery?</h3>
					<p>Being stuck in a windowless room reading 200 essay answers to the same dull questions; grading papers using percentages with a narrow range -- you know, when they&#146;re all between 20 and 25 points.</p>
					<h3>Your greatest extravagance?</h3>
					<p>Self-publishing a booklet about the struggle to save the Stanislaus River. We did everything: layout, paste-up, I did all the photographs. We ended up with cartons of unsold books in the garage. It was a really nice experience, but we decided we weren&#146;t sales people.</p>
					<h3>The living person you most admire?</h3>
					<p>Jack Kevorkian, who repeatedly puts himself on the line for a good cause: death with dignity. I really like the idea that he takes responsibility for his actions.</p>
					<h3>Your philosophy of life?</h3>
					<p>The best baseball player averages only one hit in three times at bat but still keeps on going to the plate to try to hit the ball. It&#146;s because most of the things that I do don&#146;t pan out. When I heard that the best baseball player only hits .333 -- that&#146;s a good batting average -- it gave me confidence that even if most things don&#146;t pan out, when you get occasional successes, that&#146;s terrific. The prison work I did I don&#146;t consider a success. I spent at least 10 years on it.</p>
					<h3>Something you&#146;d never do?</h3>
					<p>Eat beets or rutabaga. Nobody likes them.</p>
					<h3>What character in popular culture are you most similar to and why?</h3>
					<p>Woody Allen: We look alike, both of us come from New York City, have a similar type of warped humor, dwell on introspection, and share interests in philosophy and psychology. But he&#146;s more neurotic than I am.</p>
					<h3>What&#146;s something about you people would be surprised to know?</h3>
					<p>I am very shy, almost to the point of having a social phobia. People who hear me lecture to large audiences would have a difficult time believing this. I work very well on a one-to-one basis. In small groups, I&#146;m not that comfortable or effective. I do much better in a large lecture class than in a small class.</p>
					<h3>What&#146;s your pet peeve?</h3>
					<p>People who miss my best lines and who take me seriously because I look like a serious person. I&#146;ve always looked like a serious person. I had a friend who was Bolivian who was a much more serious person than I was. He would carry around this stack of books and no one would consider him seriously. For me, no matter what I do, people regard me as serious. My mother made a distinction between funny-ha ha and funny-peculiar and my humor is in the latter category.</p>
					<h3>What do you do when you are bored?</h3>
					<p>Go out into the garden -- there is always something that needs to be done. I always find some new weed, some new insect, something that needs to be watered, pruned or tied up.</p>
					<h3>If you could pass a universal law for the campus, what would it be?</h3>
					<p>Rotate people into different jobs. Get someone from Information Technology working in the ceramics studio and station a physicist in the English department. Shake things up. Put the universal back into university. I find that has really helped me stay young. If I had to hang around Young Hall [home of the psychology department] for 37 years I&#146;d feel like I was shuffling down the hall in slippers. I&#146;m not going to retire -- not at least in the next year. I passed up three golden handshakes because I felt there was some opportunity to give back to the university. I really appreciate them letting me get away with it all these years.</p>
