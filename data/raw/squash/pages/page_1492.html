			Hi!  Xena is absolutely awesome and very, very beautiful.<br>
	 		<br>
			She really has been a great girl ever since we got her.  All in all relatively easy, She and Fergus are great mates and now that she is growing up and not so prone to nip as part of play they hang out together outside without much in the way of incident.<br>  
			She is also very brave and not so stupid!  Our garden was invaded by cows the other week and she was all up for helping me herd them out even though one turned and made a run for her.  She stood her ground for a second, barked and then thought hiding behind me was probably a better option!<br>

		<td colspan="2"><br>
			It has been busy for us here with the new baby and Xena has taken to her new role as protector of the baby very well.  She is great mates with Fergus and it is a joy to see them both playing in the garden.  Xena is such a lovely girl and is very very pretty.<br>
			<br>
			She is a real companion for me too and pretty much wants to be everywhere I am which can sometimes not be all that helpful - like when I am gardening and she decides a big hole would be a good idea!  We were even discussing getting another as a playmate for her.<br>

			Hi there.  Just to let you know that Tessie continues to be the all round wonder dog and has been promoted to the role of chief bull quietener.  As you might remember we have an Angus stud and sell up to 35 bulls are year.  We have a mob around the house side of the farm and for the last couple of years they have been the quietest.<br>
		</td>	
  </tr>
  <tr>	
		<td>
			One of the reasons is all the noise around the house etc (3 girls and a shouting mother) but also Tessie goes to visit them.  She licks their noses as they crowd around her but any little hints of agression by them towards her and she shows her teeth or in extreme cases nips their ears.  It is amazing to watch - the bulls are worked by the farm dogs but that is usually all rush in barking and chasing - they do not at all know what to make of her sitting and lying in front of them and as a result all stand quietly around her and us also if we are there.<br>

	Has also made himself at home in our garden water feature, mind you it was very hot! Josh and Bronson are like long lost friends and love playing together.<br>

  	Have I told you lately how wonderful our dog is? He has such a lovely temperament, and he hardly ever barks (except for about 20 minutes every day when he just goes crazy and chases his tail around the coffee table!). I take him just about everywhere I go, and the people in the local cafe have come to love him too. Now if I could just get them to stop feeding him bacon scraps!<br>

  	This is a shot of Henry on his bed, with his new best friend Roscoe (the neighbour's miniature Schnauzer). Our cat, Owen, who just loves Henry, is not quite so sure about Roscoe.<br>
  	<br>
  	Henry is great.  Dogs are now allowed back on the beach during the day (up here they are not allowed on the beaches until 7pm during daylight saving), so he's been doing lots of running on the beach again. And, it turns out, he does like the water after all (initially he didn't seem too sure). We've also got much softer about allowing him on the couch, and he's become a bit of a BBC world addict.<br>
  	<br>
  	Henry spends lots of time in the car, so he's a good traveller - either with his head out of the window in the breeze, or fast asleep on the seat.<br>
  	<br>
  	Hope you like the photo. We think he's the most beautiful dog in the world. But we might be biased!<br>
  	I know I'm now biased, but RRs have become my favourite breed.<br>

    Just to let you know about Sabi's wellbeing.<br>
	She is the most beautiful Ridgeback. Though relatively very small for a Ridgeback she looks stunning and elegant. Very lean with a beautiful reddish dark caramel hair and a black muzzle. Her eyes have a very warm dark brown not that yellowish often found in Ridgeback.<br>
	Still the best part is her character.<br>
	Loyal, loving and also likes to be around us and our staff which all adore her. Still playful and much fun. Good with all people but still barking when somebody approaches the property, though not really very brave. She is a bit of a coward, lots of bluff and bravado...<br>
	Louis takes her with him on huge hunting tracks into the mountains where they sleep in DOC huts (Sabi of course with lots of covers inside). You would never bring her to sleep outside. She is a freezer and anyway rotten spoiled by us...<br>
	As you can see, you did great work of breeding such a wonderful animal.<br>

    Thanks Rachel!<br>

    Maximus is superb.  Still as cheeky as ever. Loves sleeping on (and in) the bed.  He's fascinated by our daughter.  He's really just a complete joy to have and is such a great part of the family.<br>

    Hi…Just a quick catch-up.<br>

    Colin continues to be really great with the kids and visitors. He is still looking lean and trim.<br>
    He even shares his water and mat with Kasee's kitten. I must admit that the cat was quite tough with Colin. He was not scared of him in the least, as much as Colin tried to scare him. They are good mates now.<br>
    Next time your up this way give us a ring and come and see him. I tell you though he is a right #%*@ when he gets off his lead for a run, the @3@$* wont come back!! To make it worse he passed his basic obedience test!<br>
