If you have not been to the latest addition to the Relais & Chateaux association of
luxurious privately owned hotels, then we suggest you take a trip to the Morrison
House Hotel in Alexandria soon because once the word gets out about this fabulous
restaurant, it will be next to impossible to get a reservation. Try the Crispy Yellow Tail
Red Snapper with Taylor Bay Scallop and Osetra Emulsion. It’s light, delicate, a little
sweet, and goes great with their outstanding wine list that is a yearly winner of the
Wine Spectator Award of Excellence.

Their Homemade Spinach Tortelloni stuffed with Butternut Squash
in a light Butter and Sage sauce is Washington Life’s #1 dish of
choice when having office birthday parties and celebrations. Squash lover or not,
we promise, you will crave this dish year round and go back again and again for
this mouth-watering pasta specialty. Try it once and you’ll become addicted too.

One of Washington’s favorite restaurants welcomes a new chef, Andy
Brooks, who brings with him a signature dish that has regular
diners clamoring for more. His Salmon Tartar is finely chopped and layered with
cucumber, dill and citrus served on a crisp of fennel seed flatbread. It is accompanied
by chopped parsley, capers, and tomatoes and served in a martini glass.

The only reason not to order two appetizers at this Bethesda eatery is to save room
for the incredible desserts that pastry chef Robert Underwood creates each evening.
His lemon semifreddo (that’s a heavenly mix between mousse and ice cream) with
poppy seed cake and blueberries in a chamomile sauce is an incredible ending
to the evening. Die-hard chocoholics will find the Warm Chocolate Tart with Walnut
Crust and Kahlua Sabayon equally blissful.

The warm yellow ambiance of the West End restaurant that is famed
for its French cuisine with a Flemish flair will have you feeling as if you’ve
been transported to Provencal France. The Boudin Blanc, Chef Robert Wiedmaier’s
signature appetizer (and a favorite of his four year-old son’s) is a white sausage
spiced to perfection with caramelized onions and lardons of bacon in a truffle
red wine sauce. Believe it or not, it tastes even better than it sounds.

This welcome addition to the DC restaurant scene is from the
culinary masterminds that brought you Jaleo and Café Atlantico.
The tapas-style food that made these restaurants such
a success is back, this time drawing on the Mediterranean influences of Greece,
Turkey and Lebanon. Among their varied
menu is an excellent selection of vegetarian mezzes. With over two dozen choices
picking our favorite was tough, but the complex flavors of the Huvac Koftesi,
carrot, apricot and pinenut fritters with pistachio sauce, won us over.
