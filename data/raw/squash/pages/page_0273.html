<h1>Summer Squashes</h1>

<p>Summer squashes are picked while they are
still tender and immature. They tend to be small with thin skins
that rarely need peeling, and should be eaten within a few days
of receipt.</p>

<p>Most people will be familiar with courgettes
(also known as zucchini), which can be either green or yellow,
but are not so familiar with Patty Pan or Little Gem squash. Try
baking Gem squashes whole. Cut off the top to form a lid, pull
out the fibres and seeds. Insert a knob of herb butter, or plain
butter, and seasoning. Replace top and stand in a baking dish in
some water. Bake at 350F/180C (gas mark 4) until tender (about 30
mins), Add more water if the squashes are dry, cover with foil if
they begin to burn. When young, the seeds may also be eaten and
have a slightly nutty flavour. Alternatively, microwave whole.
Slice off top; scoop out seeds and fibres. Replace top and place
in microwave dish. Add 2tbsp water, cover with film, pierce and
cook on high until tender - about 8 minutes for 2 Gem
squashes.</p>

<p>Patty Pan squashes can be yellow, green, white
or even striped; are slightly firmer than courgettes, with a
similar flavour. They are very decorative with their scalloped
edges. They can be sliced and grilled in the same way as
courgettes or fried with garlic. To make the most of their size
and shape, steam them whole until tender.Patty Pan squashes can

<h3>Spaghetti Squash</h3>

<img src="spasquash.jpg" alt="Spaghetti Squash" hspace="20"
vspace="20" align="right"> 

<p>Long and pale yellow, they earned their name
from the resemblance of the cooked flesh to spaghetti.</p>

<p>To boil a spaghetti squash, first pierce the
end, so that the heat can reach the middle, then cook for about
25 minutes or until the skin feels tender. Cut the squash in half
lengthways, remove the seeds, and then fork the strands of flesh
out on to a plate. It has a fragrant; almost honey and lemon
flavour and tastes good with garlic butter or pesto. May also be
served with any other of your favourite spaghetti sauces.</p>

<p>N.B. Sometimes we cut the larger ones in half
for the vegeboxes.</p>
