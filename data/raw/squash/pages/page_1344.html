<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="7">Gardening in the Carolinas</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">When I lived in Denver a hundred years 
  ago or so (well actually in the 1970's), I always had a nice garden.&nbsp; As 
  soon as the ground had thawed in the spring I would haul in a few cubic yards 
  of manure, rent a tiller, and begin to work the soil.&nbsp; Broccoli, corn, 
  beans, tomatoes, and strawberries, were a few of the things I grew each year.&nbsp; 
  I discovered that the joy was more in the planning, the digging, and the growing 
  than in the harvest and subsequent eating of the food.&nbsp; To someone who 
  is not a born gardener, I am sure this makes no sense, but I was fascinated 
  from an early age with growing things.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">I guess it was partially an inherited thing; 
  my mom always grew beautiful flowers and my grandparents tended abundant gardens 
  as far back as I can remember.&nbsp; Later, after I moved to California and 
  again to Florida, I turned to other interests.&nbsp; But it seems that in cooler 
  climates there is an appreciation for the warmth of spring and the verdant growth 
  that comes forth from the ground after months of brown and gray and frozen soil, 
  much more than in places that stay warm year-round.&nbsp; I can remember vividly 
  starting a couple plants of corn when I was in second grade.&nbsp; We grew them 
  in cutoff milk cartons and later took them home to plant in the ground.&nbsp; 
  I was elated as they grew and ultimately produced several ears of delicious 
  corn, all this from a couple small seeds.&nbsp; I was hooked. My dad was constantly 
  pulling up seedlings of peaches, cherries, apples, and avocados that grew from 
  seeds I planted all over the yard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">My grandparents helped me plant my first 
  garden in about 1971.&nbsp; It wasn't too large or too productive, but from 
  it I learned what worked and what didn't.&nbsp; In the frozen months of late 
  Colorado winter, as many did, I would spend hours looking through the seed catalogs 
  I had ordered and compiling orders from those things that caught my attention.&nbsp; 
  As the garden grew in size, I learned about tillers, those tools that would 
  vibrate and jump around, and twist the body this way and that, but in the long 
  run would save hours of hand digging and the related sore back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">As my gardens became larger and the quality 
  of the soil improved, the harvest yields grew.&nbsp; Soon I was producing more 
  than we could eat or give away and as I watched the vegetables rot away in the 
  garden and in the refrigerator, my enthusiasm waned.&nbsp; And so I turned my 
  attention more to growing flowers and finally orchids, the best of the flowers.&nbsp; 
  Upon moving to North Carolina, the cooler climate and Flora's enthusiasm for 
  canning rekindled my interest in vegetable gardening.&nbsp; The first year I 
  grew just a few things, but in subsequent years, I increased the area of my 
  garden to about 800 square feet.&nbsp; </font></p>

    <td width="50%"> <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The work begins each 
      year with tilling of the soil.&nbsp; I purchased a front-tine tiller, the 
      style that works the soil more and the operator less.&nbsp; The soil here 
      is rocky and pure clay.&nbsp; If I had a potter's wheel, I could throw great 
      pots using with this stuff, but growing a garden in it takes more work.&nbsp; 
      Each year I dig in as much horse manure, leaf mulch, and other kinds of 
      organic matter as I can find, but still it seems like pure clay.&nbsp; Early 
      on I made a big mistake.&nbsp; I generally have always grown organically, 
      favoring natural nutrients to chemical types of fertilizers, but that year 
      I had a 50 pound bag time-release 14-14-14 fertilizer that I was using on 
      the orchids and I thought that since the clay was so dense, some extra fertilizer 
      might be required.&nbsp; As I will explain later, this was errant thinking 
      and I paid a big price for it, especially with the tomatoes. </font> </td>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">It took several sessions with the tiller 
  to get the clay broken up, and in the process I removed several wheelbarrows 
  full of five-pound rocks, enough to line the borders of several flower beds.&nbsp; 
  Finally, I gave up and things were as good as they were going to get this year.&nbsp; 
  I had started seeds for many things (peppers, tomatoes, squash, watermelons, 
  etc.)&nbsp; in the greenhouse, so I planned the layout to best utilize the limited 
  amount of sunlight that filtered through the oak trees and I planted the early 
  spring crops.&nbsp; We had a very dry windy spring and many of these things 
  did not germinate too well.&nbsp; Next year I will mulch better and earlier 
  to help correct this situation.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">And speaking of mulch, applying some 
        kind of mulch is one of the most important things to do to a garden.&nbsp; 
        Mulching helps to keep the soil from drying out and if an organic mulch 
        is used, it will add nutrients to the soil as it is decomposes.&nbsp; 
        I have access to quantities of hardwood mulch, so that is what I normally 
        use.&nbsp; In the past, I have also used straw, leaves, and even weed-stop 
        fabrics.&nbsp; The hardwood mulches are nice because they last through 
        the season and then when they are plowed under, they provide much needed 
        organic material to help break up the clay.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Another soil amendment much need 
        in this heavy clay is ground limestone, which can adjust the pH of the 
        soil.&nbsp; Without this addition, blossom-end rot is common in tomatoes 
        and peppers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">I have also been using asphalt shingles 
        to mulch around the growing areas. Nothing can grow through them and they 
        can be used year after year. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">In 2002 we had extreme drought conditions 
        and outside watering was not allowed for much of the growing season. Heavy 
        mulching became a high priority to keep everything from dying of thirst, 
        and even with that, many things failed.</font></p>

        pocket in the bottom.)&nbsp; Not to be confused with butternut, which 
        is commonly found in the supermarket, the buttercup squashes have a great 
        flavor and will keep for several months on a cool, dry shelf. During the 
        drought years this is one plant that often does not live, and in 2002,

        overshadow them.&nbsp; From two or three vines, we are able to harvest

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3"> Tomatoes are the next large category of 
  vegetables we grow each year.&nbsp; I have planted several varieties, but ultimately 
  grow mostly Romas or plum tomatoes and usually one variety of cherry tomato.&nbsp; 
  This is where the use of chemical fertilizers turns out to be a real problem.&nbsp; 
  I start my plants in the greenhouse, so by the time the soil in the garden is 
  warm enough to plant tomatoes, the plants are usually over a foot tall.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; I had always heard that excessive amounts of nitrogen should be avoided 
  with tomatoes and initially I thought that a 14-14-14 fertilizer would work 
  well, given that the nitrogen is in a timed-release form, but I was wrong.&nbsp; 
  The first year I tried this, for weeks the plants got bigger and bigger.&nbsp; 
  They started crowding each other, even though they had been planted 3 feet apart 
  and then they started to crowd everything around them but still, not a tomato 
  in sight.&nbsp; I had to keep pruning back the growth and still the tomatoes 
  grew over the pepper plants and everything else in sight.&nbsp; Late in the 
  summer, I finally got a good harvest from them, but not until they had sprawled 
  all over the garden, unable to support even the weight of their own growth.&nbsp; 
  Now I know know to avoid even a balanced nitrogen blend.&nbsp; </font></p>

      the plants early in the season in the greenhouse.&nbsp; By the time the 
      ground was warm enough to begin planting them, I had 28 plants of about 
      a dozen varieties.&nbsp; None was really too exotic, but I had a good selection 
      ranging from the mild Ancho to the scorching Scotch Bonnet.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      We enjoy cooking spicy foods, so the goal was to grow some varieties to 
      use in daal, chili, and with omelets, and also to be able to make chile 
      rellenos.&nbsp; I planted four rows of seven plants, spacing them three 
      feet apart.&nbsp; Because of the nitrogen, they too grew and grew before 
      they started setting fruit, but by midsummer we began getting a few peppers 
      and by August I was harvesting them by the five-gallon bucket full.&nbsp; 
      We discovered the joy of grilled peppers, although it is important to select 
      varieties that won't blow the top of your head off.&nbsp; We also began 
      putting sliced hot peppers on our homemade pizza.&nbsp;In 2002 I made huge 
      batches of delicious chili rellenos (from the pablanos) and my annual batch
