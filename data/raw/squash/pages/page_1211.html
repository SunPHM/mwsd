<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The squash (<I>Cucurbita maxima</I>) is a coarse,
annual plant grown in practically all parts of the United States.
It has long, running, cylindrical stems which are somewhat prickly
and hairy. The stems are often 12 to 24 feet in length and root
freely at the nodes. They are nearly always grown from seed planted
in the field and only rarely started under protection and transplanted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seed of the Golden Hubbard variety was planted
June 2, in hills 8 feet apart, at the rate of three seeds per
hill.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Early Development.</B>--When examined on July
13 the plants had each about 12 large green leaves, of which the
blades were 3 by 5 inches in width and length, respectively, and
7 smaller ones. In addition there were 4 or 5 discolored and dead
leaves. The plants were 8 inches high and had a total spread of
1 foot. The leaf surface was 3.4 square feet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The root system was characterized by a strong taproot
which, although zigzagging considerably in the hard soil, pursued
a rather vertically downward course. Maximum depths of 28 to 32
inches were attained. The upper portion of the taproot was quite
fleshy. It was 7 millimeters thick near the ground line but tapered
to a width of about 1 millimeter at a depth of 7 inches. At greater
depths it became quite thread-like. Many long, mostly horizontal
branches, the longest extending 30 inches laterally, and numerous
short ones arose from the first 18 inches of the taproot (Fig.
87). At greater depths the laterals were short and simple. The
last 2 to 3 inches were without branches. In the surface 18 inches
laterals occurred at the rate of five per inch, approximately
two-thirds of them having a length less than 1 inch. Most of these
short roots were unbranched, some were poorly clothed with branches.
But on the longer branches laterals occurred rather regularly
at the rate of five to eight per inch and varied in length mostly
from 0.1 to 1.5 inches. Some of the laterals on the older roots
were again branched and the rather infrequent, long, secondary
branches were well furnished with rootlets. Thus the plant was
rapidly developing a widely spreading and efficient absorbing
system.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a whole the root system was slightly yellow
in color; many of the smaller laterals were quite yellow but the
younger portions were always glistening white.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Midsummer Growth.</B>--Two weeks later a second
examination was made, July 27, when the plants had just started
to blossom. The plant finally selected for detailed study had
a total length of 6.5 feet. The main stem had two branches and
a total of 20 large leaves and 8 smaller ones. Some of the largest
plants possessed twice this number of leaves. A very large transpiring
area was presented by these leaves, since those of larger size
had blades averaging 9 by 8 inches in length and breadth, and
the smaller ones 4 by 4 inches, respectively. The plants were
making a very vigorous growth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The general root habit was of the same plan as
that found 2 weeks earlier but much more extensive and elaborate.
The taproot, which was now 1 inch in diameter near the soil surface,
penetrated downward in a very zigzag manner, tapering to 2.5 millimeters
at a depth of 6 inches. At greater depths its diameter was variable,
decreasing to 1 millimeter but enlarging again to 2.5 millimeters
only to become more slender at deeper levels. Near the root end,
at 42 inches depth, it was 2 millimeters thick. Not only had the
root thus increased I foot in depth but also the former maximum
lateral spread of 30 inches was now extended to 5 feet. This was
attained in the surface 8 inches of soil. In fact, the chief growth
was that of the laterals which had extended more widely, were
more profusely branched, and had many more longer branches than
before. The degree of ultimate branching had also increased. In
regard to root habit in the deeper soil, <I>i.e.,</I> below 19
inches, it was almost identical with that in the second foot of
soil at the earlier examination (Fig. 87). A few of the deeper
roots were decayed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Maturing Plants.</B>--A final study was made
Aug. 21. As usual several plants were examined but the one chosen
for final study had two main vines. One of these was 18 feet long
and had five branches which were 3 to 7 feet in length. The other
was 21 feet in length with seven branches, the longest being 7
feet. These vines were furnished with two rows of leaves. The
leaves averaged 1 foot in length and width. Thus they presented
an enormous transpiring area, probably losing several gallons
of water in a single day. The plants were in the late blossoming
stage. Nine fruits ranging from 2 to 7 inches in diameter were
found.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The squash plant in its later development is very
much like certain native plants in having two rather distinct
parts to its root system. The one is largely superficial but widely
spreading and the other spreads much less in the deeper soil where
it may reach depths of 6 to 7 feet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The taproot and its deeper branches had made considerable
growth and were extensively branched to the 6-foot level. The
branches were, however, relatively short so that below 2 feet
not a very large volume of soil was occupied. Some of these deeper
roots were decayed at the tips.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important, most active, and by far the
most extensive portion of the root system occupied the surface
soil. Five to seven main shallow roots were common. These were
4 to 7 millimeters in diameter and, although 10 to 14 feet long,
usually ran at a depth of only 6 to 8 inches below the soil surface
and were never found below the 12-inch soil level. Even near their
tips and after giving rise to numerous large branches, they were
still 2.5 millimeters thick. As shown in Fig. 88, they spread
on all sides of the plant and branched profusely except in the
first 12 to 18 inches of their course in which branching was sparse.</P>

  11 weeks old and the main roots were still growing at the rate
  of nearly 2.5 inches per day.</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In studying the figure it should be kept in mind
that all of the main roots were between depths of 4 and 12 inches
and usually at the 6- to 8-inch level. Sometimes they turned upward
or downward abruptly (in which case they usually gave rise to
major branches) but often ran for several feet at approximately
the same depths. These shining white, cord-like structures penetrating
the mellow soil, the last 8 inches or more usually being free
from both root hairs and branches, were striking objects in the
dark-colored soil. Frequently one could pull out five or more
inches of root ends intact.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous main lateral branches on these widely
spreading roots greatly increased the general root territory which
later the sublaterals with their branchlets so thoroughly occupied.
Most of these roots had extended 12 feet and some to a distance
of 17 feet from the hill. Because of their curved and tortuous
courses the lateral extent was usually much less than the actual
root length. Branches occurred at the rate of about four to five
per inch. For the sake of clearness only a part of the branches
have been included in the drawing. Most of them were 4 to 14 inches
long and well rebranched. Infrequently, long branches (1 to 2
per foot of root) occurred. They varied from 2 to 8 feet in length
and were rebranched profusely. Practically all were found in the
surface foot, sometimes very near the soil surface. A few penetrated
into the deeper soil but only rarely did they occur below the
2-foot level. The roots were white and tough and rather readily
excavated.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Determination of the Rate of Growth.</B>--To
determine how rapidly the roots were growing, the following experiment
was performed. The soil, 10 to 15 feet from the hill, was carefully
examined until the uninjured, glistening white, smooth ends of
the main roots were found. The end of the root was immediately
engaged in a loop of stout cord and the root quickly covered with
moist soil. The cord was tied to a small stake driven by the side
of the root, the upper end of the stake being plainly visible
and marking the position of the root when the soil was entirely
replaced. Several roots were marked in this manner on Aug. 22.
A week later an examination showed that some of the roots had
made a growth of 17 inches in length, nearly 2.5 inches per day.
Great changes, moreover, had occurred. The marked, unbranched
root ends were now clothed with branches 0.3 to 2 inches long.
The diameter of the root had decreased to one-half or only one-third
of its former size. Microscopic examination showed that this was
due to a shriveling of the deteriorated cortex. Root tips showed
the beginnings (primordia) of lateral roots to very near the growing
point. These had grown through the cortex and elongated 2 inches
and the cortex deteriorated in the moist soil all during a period
of 7 days. During a 2 weeks period some of the roots elongated
2 feet . It is evident that the picture (Fig. 88) is incomplete.
A mature root system fills the soil to a distance of 15 feet on
all sides of the plant. Seven hundred cubic feet of the richest
soil may be occupied by the roots of a single plant. How thoroughly
the soil must be ramified in a field of corn where squash or pumpkins
are growing among the corn! There must be keen competition for
water and nutrients unless the corn at this season is depending
more largely on the deeper soil for its supplies of these essentials.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still another part of the root system is to be
described but just how important it became was not ascertained.
The squash plant takes root at most of the nodes of the prostrate
stems. At this time these roots were just beginning to develop.
They were found to penetrate 4 to 8 inches deep and then turn
and run laterally, often again approaching the soil surface. The
shaded and protected vine-covered soil dries slowly and long,
thread-like, minutely branched laterals were found just beneath
the soil surface. These were already often 2 feet long (Fig. 89).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Summary.</B>--The rooting habit of the Hubbard
squash is very similar in general plan to that of the watermelon
and other cucurbits. The deeper portion of the taproot system
is better developed, however, and the shallower part almost as
extensive as the coarse, widely spreading vines. Plants with a
spread of tops of only a foot are rooted 2.5 feet deep and are
supplied with numerous, much branched, horizontal laterals 16
to 30 inches in length. Thus an efficient absorbing system is
developed early. Within a period of 2 weeks and when blossoming
has just begun, the vines have grown to a length of 6.5 feet.
The taproots have increased only a foot in length but the horizontal
laterals 2.5 feet, thus spreading somewhat less widely than the
vines. Branching throughout is much more profuse.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Maturing plants have a wonderfully intricate and
extensive root system which still develops at the rate of approximately
2.5 inches per day. A plant with stems 18 and 21 feet long has
a taproot which is extensively branched (but with short laterals
only, below 2 feet) and reaches the 6-foot level. Branches spread
rather widely in the second foot but are relatively of less importance
than the really wonderful root development in the surface foot
of soil. A radial spread of 13 to 19 feet is attained. Five to
seven main roots, with numerous branches 2 to 8 feet long and
all again rebranched, form the groundwork which supports a remarkably
branched root network that completely ramifies the surface foot
of soil. Nodal roots, already 4 to 5 feet long and also superficial
but extremely well rebranched, increase the absorbing area. Thus
nearly 1,000 cubic feet of soil give of its supplies of water
and nutrients to the support of a single plant.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Other Investigations on Squash.</B>--Descriptions
and measurements made on a squash plant grown in Massachusetts
are of interest since they have been widely quoted and much disputed.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;But our squash vine affords the
  most astonishing demonstration of all that has been said about
  root development. Growing under the most favorable circumstances,
  the roots attained a number and an aggregate length almost incredible.
  The primary root from the seed, after penetrating the earth about
  4 inches, terminated abruptly and threw out adventitious branches
  in all directions. In order to obtain an accurate knowledge of
  their development, the entire bed occupied by them was saturated
  with water, and, after 15 hours, numerous holes were bored through
  the plank bottom, and the earth thus washed away. After many
  hours of most patient labor, the entire system of roots was cleaned
  and spread out upon the floor of a large room, where they were
  carefully measured. The main branches extended from 12 to 15
  feet, and their total length, including branches, was more than
  2,000 feet. At every node, or joint, of the vine, was also produced
  a root. One of these nodal roots was washed out and found to
  be 4 feet long, and to have 480 branches, averaging, with their
  branchlets, a length of 30 inches, making a total of more than
  1,200 feet. As there were 70 nodal roots, there must have been
  more than 15 miles in length on the entire vine. There were certainly
  more than 80,000 feet; and of these, 50,000 feet must have been
  produced at the rate of 1,000 feet or more per day.</FONT><FONT
   SIZE="-2"> 26</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The vine grew at a maximum rate of 9 inches per
day. The total extent of the main vine was 52 feet. the lateral
branches being removed when 2 to 3 feet long. It had 100 leaves.
The largest leaves were nearly circular and slightly lobed. Their
diameter was 2.5 feet and the area about 700 square inches.<FONT
 SIZE="-2"> 26</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;This remarkable root development has been quoted
widely in many of the older standard textbooks of botany and plant
physiology but later its authenticity was questioned.<FONT SIZE="-2">
52</FONT> This led to a similar experiment in England with a gourd
plant (<I>Cucumis sativus</I>). The gourd was grown in a frame
10 by 6 feet in dimensions under the most favorable conditions.
The roots were examined when the plant was fully grown and had
borne 14 fruits. The vine with its branches measured 32 feet long
and bore 140 leaves. The roots were recovered by so carefully
washing away the soil that none were lost. Careful measurements
of both the main root system and the nodal roots gave a total
length of 281 feet.<FONT SIZE="-2"> 52</FONT> The small size of
the gourd root as compared with that reported for the squash has
led some facetious reviewer to remark that the &quot;figure [for
the squash] is exaggerated and applies perhaps to Jonah's gourd
but not to any other cucurbit.&quot;<FONT SIZE="-2"> 39</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A careful comparison, however, as regards number
and length of main roots with that of the squash plant already
described leads one to more nearly accept the Massachusetts findings.
It is unfortunate that the work was not accurately checked. At
least it has served a purpose in calling attention to the remarkable
extent to which the root systems of cucurbits may develop. Of
course, length in itself is not of such great significance as
absorbing area. Many of the larger and older roots rapidly lose
the power of absorption and serve only for conduction. It may
be recalled that root decortication, in the field experiment where
the rate of growth and branching was determined, occurred within
a week after the new root growth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature squash plants were examined at Geneva, N.
Y., where they had grown in a fertile clay loam soil underlaid
at a depth of 6 to 10 inches with a tenacious subsoil of gravelly
clay.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of this vegetable were
  examined with considerable interest, because it has been often
  stated that they extend as far as the runners. Observations showed
  that this view is based upon fact; indeed, in the bush varieties,
  the roots extended much further than the stems. In a plant of
  the Yellow Scallop Bush squash, examined Sept. 8, a root was
  traced horizontally a distance of 8.5 feet without reaching the
  end, while the longest runners extended but about 4 feet. This
  long root grew almost its whole length within 3 inches of the
  surface. In a plant of the Hubbard squash, of which the roots
  were washed out Sept. 11, one of them was traced horizontally
  a distance of 10 feet from the base, and at this point it was
  1/8 inch in diameter, or about a third of its thickness at the
  start. It might doubtless have been followed much further, but
  was accidentally broken at this point and the remainder could
  not be distinguished among many other roots. This long root grew
  at a depth of 2 to 5 inches below the surface. It frequently
  changed its course, but pursued in general a rather straight
  line. It put out branches throughout its length, some of which
  were 1/8 inch in diameter. The number of branches in the 10 feet
  was 385 or on the average 38.5 per foot.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2">

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At Saratov, Russia, it was found that the chief
mass of the roots of squash occurs in a soil layer not more than
12 to 16 inches deep. The main root had a diameter of 28 millimeters
before it began branching at a depth of 2 inches. Beyond 2 inches
it tapered gradually to 1 millimeter in thickness at a depth of
39 inches. The soil at this depth was very hard, the root was
broken and not traced farther. Below a depth of 16 inches there
was very little branching. The largest and longest laterals were
found at a depth of approximately 2 to 5 inches in the mellow
surface soil layer.. The strong horizontal roots spread to distances
equal to that of the vines which were 11.5 to 20.3 feet long.
The ends of the roots were less than 1 millimeter thick. Some
laterals of the second and third order reached a length of nearly
16 feet. With their profuse branches they formed a dense network
in the surface soil. The root system was found to be less extensive
than that of the watermelon and citron but exceeded that of the
muskmelon and cucumber.<FONT SIZE="-2"> 76</FONT> Other investigations
confirmed this study. In the black soil of Russia a great development
of horizontal roots occurred in the plowed horizon, comparatively
few roots of the second order penetrated vertically to a depth
of about 40 inches.<FONT SIZE="-2"> 76a</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies all agree in confirming the extensive
and superficial rooting habits of the squash and the lesser development
of the more deeply penetrating portions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Root Development in Relation to Cultural Practice.</B>--Both
the root and aboveground habits of squash are so similar to the
cucurbits already described that it is not surprising that soil
preparation, methods of planting, fertilizing, cultivation, etc.
are very similar to those already discussed. The chief difference
is that the squash is a somewhat hardier plant, does not require
so long a growing season, and is not so exacting in its requirements.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In applying barnyard or other coarse manures to
the soil, especially where relatively shallow-rooted crops like
the cucurbits are grown, it should be the prime object to mix
the manure with the soil as thoroughly as possible. If it is turned
under in thick layers, without being disintegrated and mixed with
the soil to a considerable extent, the layer of manure will prevent
the capillary moisture from reaching the upper layer of soil and
thus cause the plants to suffer for water very soon during drought.
Under such conditions roots have been repeatedly observed to make
a vigorous growth in the enriched layer and branch profusely.
But when this poorly compacted layer becomes dry the absorbing
rootlets die and the main roots merely serve as conductors between
the rootlets still functioning in the moist layers below and the
parts aboveground. Hence, well-decomposed stable manure is best
for the garden, especially when manure is used in large quantities.
It is easily mixed with the soil which becomes compacted about
it. Thus not only the main roots of the plants but those arising
adventitiously from the nodes find a congenial substratum for
growth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Roots of Cucurbits in Relation to Disease.</B>--The
development of nodal roots in squash and pumpkin is connected
in a measure with recovery from the injuries of certain insect
enemies. The squash vine borer in the larval stage of development
tunnels into the stem at or near the soil surface. Usually decay
sets in, water conduction is interrupted, and the vine begins
to wilt. Covering the stems with soil so as to encourage the development
of nodal root growth is a common control measure. Although preferring
squash and pumpkins, the borer attacks all species of cucurbits,
often causing great destruction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of other disease-producing organisms attacking
or gaining entrance through the roots of cucurbits are as follows:
Watermelon wilt is caused by species of <I>Fusarium</I> fungi
which live in the soil and through the roots gain entrance to
the water-conducting tissue of the stem. When, due to the growth
of the fungus, the water supply becomes insufficient the vines
suddenly wilt and die. Root knot, due to a nematode, causes the
roots of watermelons to become greatly enlarged, the vines to
lack vigor, and the melons to remain small. The striped cucumber
beetle tunnels in the main roots or stems of various cucurbits
below ground. Blossom-end rot is probably a physiological trouble
of watermelon brought on by rapid changes in soil moisture just
as the young fruits are starting to grow.<FONT SIZE="-2"> 146</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;As pointed out elsewhere, the relation of root
development to disease resistance of crops is important and requires
intensive study. Recent experiments have demonstrated a close
relationship between root growth and disease resistance.<FONT
 SIZE="-2"> 59</FONT>A thorough knowledge of the development of
the root habits of cultivated crops is needed in combating plant
disease produced by soil-borne parasites or resulting from physiological-environmental
relations of the root systems.</P>
