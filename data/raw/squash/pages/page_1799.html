  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><font color="#CC0033"><b><i>By Martin 
    Bronstein<br>
    </i></b></font></font><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Ong Beng Hee had 
    the slightly embarrassing, if happy, task of asking Organiser Andrew Shelley 
    to postpone his flight from Hurghada to England. He'd booked to go back the 
    day of the semi-finals not thinking that he would get past the quarters. But 
    with some solid play founded on his ever-increasing maturity, Beng Hee had 
    played his way into the semi-finals of the PSA Masters for his first ever 
    meeting with Jonathon Power.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> The young Malaysian's second round match 
    against Alex Gough, ranked 12, one place above him, was a two <img src="../photos/profiles/ong/BengHeeT06.jpg" width="350" height="241" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">hour, 
    five-game grind. Trailing 7-13 in the fifth it seemed that he had been right 
    in his flight booking. But noticing Gough was cramping, Beng Hee kept each 
    rally going as long as possible and pulled up to 14-all. Gough called no set 
    and during the rally seemed to fall over his own feet to give Beng Hee the 
    victory - just.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> In the quarters he faced local favourite 
    Omar El Borolossy, who had been doing some giant -killing of his own, to the 
    delight of the Egyptian crowds. In his next match Beng Hee beat El Borolossy 
    despite the vocal support for his opponent. It was an 82 minute 3-1 victory 
    and good preparation for his semi-final match against the world number one 
    who was playing better, faster, sharper than ever. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Like Power's previous opponents, Beng 
    Hee went down in three straight, but <img src="../photos/profiles/ong/BengHeeT09.jpg" width="200" height="413" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">kept 
    Power on court for 52 minutes, longer than any other player. His tight, controlled 
    shots forced Power to be patient and Beng Hee rarely opened up the court to 
    give Power the freedom of the city.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> It was good to watch and a long way from 
    the first time I saw Ong Beng Hee as a16 year old, also in Egypt, playing 
    in the world junior championships in 1996. He floated around the court, held 
    the racket in his own unique way and had his own vision of the game of squash: 
    feathery drops and lobs. I wrote at the time that he played squash in slow 
    motion. He lost in the quarters which included Stewart Boswell of Australia 
    and Lee Beachill of England, who are also now ranked in the world's top twenty. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">There followed a year of coaching with 
    Jamie Hickox, the Anglo-Canadian, and then some time with Neil Harvey. Two 
    years later in Princeton, Beng Hee won the world junior championship as we 
    all knew he would. His game had changed a little and his father said that 
    Harvey had made him tougher. Since then the immensely likeable and impeccably 
    behaved Ong Beng Hee has been part of the Neil Harvey team (which he outlines 
    below) and lives just outside London when he is not on the road. We spoke 
    in the garden of the Grand Resort in Hurghada.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> <i><b>What was the major difference between 
    junior and senior squash?<br>
    </b></i>In the juniors I used to get through the first two rounds very easily. 
    In the seniors I would be struggling in the second round like I was against 
    Alex Gough in Hurghada. Seniors are a lot stronger. As a junior I was never 
    fit, my squash was good enough to beat the rest of the juniors. But if I played 
    a senior it was a lot harder and the matches were a lot longer. Seniors volley 
    a lot more than the juniors.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> I found it very difficult, after winning 
    the world junior title to go on to the senior tour. There is a very big gap 
    and I had to do a lot of catching up. I'm very glad that I train with players 
    like Peter Nicol.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b> I noticed that he was advising 
    you between games.<br>
    </b></i>Yes, I train with him every day and we're team -mates. But if I'm 
    playing an <img src="../photos/profiles/ong/OBengHee02.jpg" width="250" height="271" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">English 
    player, because he is now part of the England team, he won't advise me. But 
    as long as I'm playing somebody else, we help out each other. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">We are all with Neil Harvey, there's six 
    or seven of us including Peter Genever, Tim Garner, Lee Jemmett, Tim Wyant 
    from the US, and sometimes Linda Charman-Smith. We do routines but as if we 
    are playing a match. There are different 'conditions', like playing length, 
    but we play it like a match. When you look back at yourself a year ago, how 
    have you changed? Last year at this time I was ranked 44 and now I'm 13th. 
    I am a lot stronger now and I can cope with the ten top players. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b><i>How did you get stronger?</i></b><br>
    It's from training with Neil Harvey. He does a very hard course and I thought 
    this is what I need to get to the top. When I was training with Jamie Hickox, 
    he said the only thing I was lacking was strength. Now I'm in the gym three 
    times a week for strengthening exercises, but when I am playing league matches 
    and tournament, I try for just once a week.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b> Are you surprised at your rapid 
    rise up the rankings?<br>
    </b></i>Yes. But after the British Open, where I got a good draw and made 
    the best of it, I was confident that I would make the top twenty. I don't 
    look behind me at the players coming up because I am still looking at the 
    top ten. I beat David <img src="../photos/profiles/ong/xOBengHeeMC2.jpg" width="200" height="414" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">Evans 
    (World number three) in the Flanders Open and that gave me a lot of confidence. 
    I know that Pete Nicol and Jonathon Power are a class above, but from three, 
    four and five, I've got a good chance of, if not beating them, giving them 
    a good run.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> I get confidence from not only winning 
    but playing well. Even if I lose, if I feel I played well and given one hundred 
    percent, that gives me confidence. If I lose to a player in three, than I 
    work on it and next time I play him, I try to get a game off him and then 
    take it from there.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b> Now that you are reaching the quarters 
    and finals, you have to handle four or five hard matches in a row. How are 
    you handling that? </b></i><br>
    Well, it's not as hard as training. Training is very hard work, you do six 
    days and you don't get a day off. So by comparison a tournament is easier, 
    you have just one match a day. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b><i>How has your game improved? </i></b><br>
    Technically, I've improved my swing since I've been with Neil. I used to have 
    a really big swing and it took a long time to hit the ball but now it's not 
    so big and much more consistent. I basically went back to step one. It was 
    drastic and I found it hard to cope, changing my swing and my movement. The 
    year after winning the world junior's, I suddenly felt like a beginner again. 
    I decided that I had to do it then or struggle and be in the top 40 and be 
    happy with that. I have always wanted to be in the top ten or at least giving 
    those in the top ten a good game. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">So for the whole of 1999 I didn't achieve 
    a lot. I won a couple of satellite tournaments but it was a holding year. 
    I kept working on it, hoping I would get a few good wins and that would boost 
    my confidence, so I would build from there. I lost quite a lot of matches 
    in 1999 but that didn't bother me because I was always working towards something.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b> How do you work on strategy - what 
    shots to play when?<br>
    </b></i>I think I have always had that in me naturally. Basically it's simple. 
    Everybody <img src="../photos/profiles/ong/BengHeeRyanT09.jpg" width="250" height="323" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">knows 
    how to play the game. If your opponent is at the front you want to get him 
    to the back, there's not a lot of thinking to do. To start with I started 
    to hit everything straight and I've been working on that ever since. That 
    is to stop your opponent volleying. To get the ball past your opponent you 
    have to think whether you are going to hit it high or low or hard. It keeps 
    you thinking. We do that in training, and if I don't, Neil Harvey says 'do 
    20 court sprints for not thinking.' I've been doing thousands of court sprints 
    because there are times I am so slack. He wants us to be aware of what we 
    are doing. Why are we hitting a boast? Are we hitting a boast because we want 
    to or because we have to. It's because we want to and that's when you start 
    winning. It all comes from training. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b><i>When you watch ordinary club players, 
    what is the most common error you see?</i></b><br>
    They open up the court too much and that makes them do too much running. Once 
    you start to boast or cross court then you have given your opponent an option 
    whether to play a drop shot or cross court and suddenly you're in trouble. 
    I think it's even preferable to play a straight drop rather than a cross-court 
    drop. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b><i>Do you still watch a lot of squash? 
        </i></b><img src="../photos/asia/bengheelow1.jpg" width="220" height="169" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"><br>
        I love watching the top five guys - the top ten even. I just try to pick 
        up something from all of them; what they play, how they move, their favorite

        I wouldn't mind one a month and then spend the next two weeks training.

    or three month break in the year?<br>
    </b></i>At some stage in the year you need two months of just training to
