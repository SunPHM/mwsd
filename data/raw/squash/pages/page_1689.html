        from Texas cities and beyond saw the third leg of the battle for 
        supremacy of the current world number one and two on the WISPA Court at 
        the Texas Open.<br>
        <br>
        Natalie Pohrer had beaten Carol Owens in a pulsating World Open 
        semifinal last fall, finally winning 10/8 in the deciding game. When 
        they next met last month in the final of the Arader &amp; O'Rourke 
        Tournament of Champions at Grand Central Station in New York the match 
        also took five games to find a winner. This time it was Owens who came 
        out on top.<br>
        <br>
        Here Pohrer came out of the blocks fastest, racing to an
        <span lang="en-gb">8-2</span> lead <span lang="en-gb">in the </span>
        first game before Owens began to settle. Her volleying became more 
        fluent and drops more dangerous and she began to eat into the lead. 
        Eventually the lead was gone and eight all reached, Owens having saved 
        six game balls. Another was saved at 8/9 before two tinned boasts took 
        the New Zealander to her first game ball. This was saved and another 
        attacking boast, this time won, gave Pohrer the game after 27 minutes 
        instead of the nine minutes at which she first served for it.<br>
        <br>

        it was the New Zealander who rapidly progressed to 8/0, but although she 
        dropped one point Pohrer was unable to stage a comeback and Owens closed 
        at 9/1 to level the match. <br>
        <br>
        Both players were now employing a combination of attacking boasts and 
        higher floating balls, but Pohrer could only win rallies rather than 
        points as she didn't have enough patience and Owens score climbed. The 
        Auckland based defending champion got to game ball at 8/1 before Pohrer 
        staged a mini revival created by Pohrer forging openings at the front 
        and putting away volleys. But a tinned one at 4/8 allowed Owens to move 
        two games to one ahead.<br>
        <br>
        St. Louis based Pohrer was still finding it difficult to deal with the 
        athleticism, resolution and accurate placement of Owens despite the 
        vocal support of the crowd. Pohrer had finally reached meltdown. Owens 
        reached match ball and though denied the first time by a deft cross 
        court drop took it second time with a traffic stroke to hold onto her 
        title and reinforce her hold on top spot in the WISPA World rankings.
        <br>
        <br>
        Owens was especially pleased, saying &quot;I don't think that I have had back 
        to back wins before so I am pretty happy. I've had a great week - it has 
        been superbly staged and we have been so well looked after.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile Natalie reflected &quot;The first game was tough but I was a little 
        too sluggish, my length a little too short, my lobs too low. What a 
        melon!&quot; </font><p>

        </font></b><font style="font-size: 8pt">The Texas Open was another major step forward 
        for the WISPA Tour with the glass court erected in a Dallas ice rink. We 
        set nine points for promoter <b>Susan Morrison</b>, president of the 
        Texas SRA, to answer.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b>1: What size audiences did you attract each day? <br>
        <br>
        A: Audiences each day in the stands were about 100-150 each day and over 
        200 for the finals but the stands are surrounded by a food court and 
        retail office complex with numerous walkways and balconies for casual 
        spectators. The total number of viewers during busy periods thus 
        approached around 1,500. <br>
        <br>
        2: What was the response from spectators who had not seen squash before?
        <br>
        <br>
        A: The response by the audience who had not seen squash was good. Most 
        thought it was racquetball but we made available flyers called &quot;Squash: 
        A Guide for New Viewers&quot; to help educate. The announcer also gave basic 
        info about the game, rules, and strategy. During the first round of the 
        main draw which took place over lunch hour when the atrium was filled 
        with office workers on their lunch break, people were fascinated. The 
        building's property manager said she had never heard the lunch crowd be 
        so quiet as they were absorbed by watching the games. The women were a 
        big hit - attractive to attract attention initially but so athletic to 
        also amaze and impress after that. <br>
        <br>
        3: Were you pleased with the venue? <br>
        <br>
        A: We were very pleased with the visibility and attractiveness of the 
        venue. The owners/property manager were quite helpful and happy by all 
        the attention which brought more business for their retail tenants. We 
        did have some problems with sunlight reflecting from surrounding office 
        buildings on to the rink and the court. If we can find ways to cope with 
        that by court placement or scheduling it could be an ideal spot to reach 
        a bigger audience for squash. <br>
        <br>
        4: What was the response from the local media? Did you do anything 
        special to get them involved? <br>
        <br>
        A: The local media was very interested but uncertain what to make of 
        this. We hired a local PR firm to help get coverage. We got regular 
        results coverage and a lengthy article in the major local paper with 
        lots of info about the event and basic squash facts. Only the Spanish 
        language TV stations covered the event. Mainstream TV was preoccupied 
        with a huge NASCAR event here this weekend as well as with NCAA 
        Basketball which featured the University of Texas - it's a very 
        competitive sports market here and this weekend was especially full. We 
        will continue to work on getting more coverage. The court is such a 
        spectacle that getting pictures vs. print is very helpful so we will 
        continue to push for TV. <br>
        <br>
        5: Were the players happy with the whole production? <br>
        <br>
        A: I believe the players were happy. The public venue meant there were 
        more distractions than usual - light, noise, movement around the court. 
        It may not have made for ideal conditions for perfect squash but the 
        WISPA women understood the trade-off to reach a larger audience in this 
        type of location and were flexible &amp; cooperative in making it work. <br>
        <br>
        6: Next year it's off to Houston. Have you decided on a venue? <br>
        <br>
        A: Houston has not settled on a venue yet. We will consult together I'm 
        sure but for now are still digesting lessons learned here in Dallas. <br>
        <br>
        7: Were your title sponsors pleased with the production? <br>
        <br>
        A: The sponsors were extremely happy with the visibility accomplished 
        with this first use of the glass court. We and they understand that this 
        is a start and that we will work to build on this foundation. This was a 
        very new thing for us but even this inaugural effort was a success in 
        terms of the goals set out for ourselves to demonstrate that the court 
        can make staging squash events a more commercial proposition by reaching 
        larger audiences, even those unfamiliar with the game. <br>
        <br>
        8: Did you attract any new or potential sponsors during the week? <br>
        <br>
        A: We may have attracted some interest from new sponsors. We did invite 
        potentials and used this event as a &quot;display.&quot; It's very difficult to 
        explain squash and the potential of the glass court in abstract. It has 
        to be SHOWN. Now we will work to build on that. We now have film, 
        photos, print to use as examples as we solicit support from bigger 
        companies. <br>
        <br>
        9: Looking back, is there anything you would do differently? <br>
        <br>
        A: We might have scheduled matches differently to avoid problems with 
        the sunlight on the court. We had been checking on this over that past 
        several months but with the changing seasons the patterns and timing of 
        light problems differed. The court looked spectacular at night but we 
        also wanted to reach the busy daytime office visitors. It was a 
        trade-off between larger audience vs. ideal conditions which we will 
        have to rethink if using this venue again. </font></span></p>

        four-game victory over second seed Natalie Pohrer.</font></span><p>
        <font style="font-size: 8pt">A large and enthusiastic gallery of squash enthusiasts 
        from Texas cities and beyond saw the third leg of the battle for 
        supremacy of the current world number one and two on the WISPA Court at 
        the Texas Open.<br>
        <br>
        Natalie Pohrer had beaten Carol Owens in a pulsating World Open 
        semifinal last fall, finally winning 10/8 in the deciding game. When 
        they next met last month in the final of the Arader &amp; O'Rourke 
        Tournament of Champions at Grand Central Station in New York the match 
        also took five games to find a winner. This time it was Owens who came 
        out on top.<br>
        <br>
        Here Pohrer came out of the blocks fastest, racing to an
        <span lang="en-gb">8-2</span> lead <span lang="en-gb">in the </span>
        first game before Owens began to settle. Her volleying became more 
        fluent and drops more dangerous and she began to eat into the lead. 
        Eventually the lead was gone and eight all reached, Owens having saved 
        six game balls. Another was saved at 8/9 before two tinned boasts took 
        the New Zealander to her first game ball. This was saved and another 
        attacking boast, this time won, gave Pohrer the game after 27 minutes 
        instead of the nine minutes at which she first served for it.<br>
        <br>
        The second game started in similar fashion to the first, but this time 
        it was the New Zealander who rapidly progressed to 8/0, but although she 
        dropped one point Pohrer was unable to stage a comeback and Owens closed 
        at 9/1 to level the match. <br>
        <br>
        Both players were now employing a combination of attacking boasts and 
        higher floating balls, but Pohrer could only win rallies rather than 
        points as she didn't have enough patience and Owens score climbed. The 
        Auckland based defending champion got to game ball at 8/1 before Pohrer 
        staged a mini revival created by Pohrer forging openings at the front 
        and putting away volleys. But a tinned one at 4/8 allowed Owens to move 
        two games to one ahead.<br>
        <br>
        St. Louis based Pohrer was still finding it difficult to deal with the 
        athleticism, resolution and accurate placement of Owens despite the 
        vocal support of the crowd. Pohrer had finally reached meltdown. Owens 
        reached match ball and though denied the first time by a deft cross 
        court drop took it second time with a traffic stroke to hold onto her 
        title and reinforce her hold on top spot in the WISPA World rankings.
        <br>
        <br>
        Owens was especially pleased, saying &quot;I don't think that I have had back 
        to back wins before so I am pretty happy. I've had a great week - it has 
        been superbly staged and we have been so well looked after.&quot;<br>

        <br>
        Meanwhile Natalie reflected &quot;The first game was tough but I was a little 
        too sluggish, my length a little too short, my lobs too low. What a 
        melon!&quot; </font>

          Neither player was afraid of going in short with both so quick to the 
          front wall, but Grinham was not as steady as she had been against her 
          sister Rachael the night before.<br>
          <br>
          Grinham's backhand cross court drops feathered from the back of the 
          court and some delightful straight drops were too infrequent to enable 
          her to mount a serious challenge.<span lang="en-gb"> </span>&quot;I left it all behind yesterday,&quot; Grinham said.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Thankfully Natalie started nervously because she is very tough and is

          Pohrer 
          was even more at sea in the fourth, peppering the tin and giving away 
          strokes as Atkinson raced to a 7/1 lead and then closed out as two

          Natalie, unseeded, was in control from the start, combining more

          hit a hot spell. Pohrer eventually prevailed 9-7 3-9 10-8 3-9 9-6 in 
          64 minutes to reach her sixth successive WISPA semi-final.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;I knew that I needed to get a good start in the fifth as Cassie was 
          dominating the court, so I tried to bottle her up at the back more,&quot;

        </font></b><font size="1">Natalie Pohrer led domestic interest in the opening round of 
        the Women's Texas Open in Dallas in powerful style as she crushed 
        Egyptian qualifier Omneya Abdel Kawy in straight games 24 hours after 
        being elected the first US President of&nbsp; WISPA.<br>
        <br>
        Office workers and shoppers looked down from the balconies and windows 
        of the levels on all four sides of the Plaza of the Americas in downtown 
        Dallas, where the first WISPA Grand Prix event of the year is being 
        staged on WISPA's all-glass showcourt on the atrium ice rink - a highly 
        innovative and public setting for the high-level competition between the 
        world's top women squash players.<br>
        <br>
        Second seed Pohrer, the 25-year-old world No2 from St Louis, took just 
        23 minutes to beat 17-year-old Kawy, the world No13, 9-4 9-1 9-5 to earn 
        a place in the quarter-finals.<br>
        <br>
        Pohrer, raised in South Africa but born in England, next faces former 
        compatriot Cassie Jackman, the seventh seed who survived an all-English 
        first round clash with unseeded Jenny Tranfield.&nbsp;Tranfield, who boasts a 
        PhD in Sports Psychology, scurried to an 8-3 lead in the opening game, 
        but Jackman - winner of the Las Vegas Open four days earlier - fought 
        back to claim a 10-8 9-1 9-4 victory in 35 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Another all-English battle went the full distance when qualifier Vicky 
        Botwright pulled back from 2-0 down to level the match against 8th seed 
        Rebecca Macree.&nbsp;The Lancastrian had little left in reserve at this 
        point, and Macree stormed to a 9-6 9-5 6-9 5-9 9-1 win in 65 minutes to 
        move into the last eight where she faces top-seeded New Zealander Carol 
        Owens.<br>
        <br>
        Title-holder Owens, playing in her first event since becoming world No1, 
        beat England's Fiona Geaves 9-4 9-0 9-5 in 30 minutes.&nbsp;&quot;I've come over 
        here feeling good after having some good hits at home and getting to a 
        few local men's event<span lang="en-gb"> </span>finals,&quot; said the 
        confident favourite afterwards.<br>
        <br>
        The most disheartened competitor was undoubtedly England's sixth seed 
        Tania Bailey, hoping to resume her playing career after resting 
        completely for more than two weeks trying to shake off a mystery virus.&nbsp; 
        The world No4 from Lincolnshire withdrew after practice in the morning, 
        feeling &quot;sick and shaky&quot; again after the workout.&nbsp; &quot;I thought it had 
        cleared my body as my practice went okay yesterday and my heart rate was 
        fine.&nbsp; Now I feel bad again so need to get some more tests done,&quot; said 
        the disconsolate 23-year-old.<br>
        <br>
        Australia's unseeded Natalie Grinham was the beneficiary of the walkover 
        and will now face her sister Rachael Grinham in the quarter-finals.&nbsp; 
        Fourth-seeded Rachael took just 19 minutes to conquer Hong Kong 
        qualifier Rebecca Chiu 9-2 9-1 9-6 to set up the siblings' first WISPA 
        World Tour clash since the British Open last April, when the older 
        Rachael won in<span lang="en-gb"> </span>straight games.</font></blockquote>

        </font></b><span lang="en-gb"><font size="1">In a titanic battle between 
        two former world champions, New Zealand's Carol Owens twice had to come 
        from behind before beating England's Cassie Campion to lift the AON 
        Women's Texas Squash Open title. The climax of the first Texas Open 
        marks the 2000 world champion's 19th WISPA World Tour title, and Owens' 
        sixth successive win over 1999 world champion Campion since April 2000.<br>
        <br>
        Campion, the second seed, raced to a 7-4 lead in the opening game, then 
        lost concentration after a disputed call on a drop shot. After saving a 
        game ball, England's British National champion regrouped to take a 1-0 
        lead. Top-seeded Owens, the former Australian dressed in a distinctive 
        &quot;Kiwi&quot; all-black dress, began to wake up and started to find her range 
        on her tight drops, and levelled. In the third, Cassie pulled back from 
        0-4 down to take the game in 18 minutes.<br>
        <br>
        The fifth game decider was totally absorbing and competitive, but Owens 
        ultimately kept up the pressure to claim her winner's cheque after 69 
        minutes.<br>
        <br>
        Carol dedicated the win to her grandmother, who died the previous day, 
        aged 94. &quot;She followed my career all the way through, and it was 
        terrible that I read the news in an e-mail just before the match. I 
        don't normally read my mail before a final.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        AON Natural Resources Group Managing Director Jim Pierce was absolutely 
        delighted with the WISPA show, and told a cheering audience: &quot;This has 
        to be the first of many Texas Opens.&quot;</font></span></p>
