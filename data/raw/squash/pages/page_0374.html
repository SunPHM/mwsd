<FONT SIZE=2><P>November '92, a little after the beginning of the new school year and we needed to recruit some new victims for the swim team. A meeting was held and a number of enthusiastic Form l's and 2's who'd never heard that such a team existed in the college, collected at the end of the covered way. I didn't know if I was going mad but every seconds I kept hearing the same two questions : <I>"when we goin' to de pool?" and " dis is for people who could swim?"</i></P>
<P>The first day of practice for the new recruits eventually came and again I was bombarded with another set of questions : <I>"Ah could jump of de diving board?" and "how yuh does swim freestyle and butterstroke?", "deh does swim doggie paddle in de competition?"</i></P>
<P>Yes, some interesting new names and inventions of swimming strokes were found that day and also the people who'd asked the two questions didn't seem to make the team somehow. That first day was dreadful and poor Jules (trainer) had to jump in and save se who thought they could swim. They</P>
<P>realised that being able to make 100 laps in a bathtub, no matter how long or deep, does not qualify you as a swimmer. It looked as though we would continue our long string of second places in the non-competitive category behind CIC with their lucky string of first places. The team's lack of a perfect performance is due to the fact that no pool exists in the college, except for the ones formed on the field during the wet season. For the past couple of decades they've been saying that a pool is going to be built soon but I'd probably have to wait 10 lifetimes before I'd get to swim in Presentation's very own swimming pool.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite this major factor, it did not hold us back. Determined to get to a pool we would jump into one or two cars (all 20 of us) or travel by taxi to go down to Pointe-a-Pierre. Most or should I say all of these training sessions took place 2 weeks before the actual meet. The day finally arrived and being from Presentation College we kept our record of arriving late, intact. Some of the team members decided that they were not swimming and another member kept his record by spraining his wrist playing some other sport yet again.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we got our programme we realised that there were several errors. We had setbacks, but we struggled until the last race and then waited for the results. <B>We</B> <B>managed to win 2 trophies and also tie with CIC for first place in the non competitive category.</b></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year '93-'94 the team is much more fortunate in that we have access to the Norwegian pool down at King's Wharf It is a small pool only about 11 metres long but it is better than nothing. We can now train on a weekly basis and this year we're going to make it to first place again ALONE!!</P></FONT><DIR><DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>Squash in Presentation College has always been of an extremely high standard and last year was no exception.</P>
<P>Presentation produced a team comprising of Sheldon Skeete, Paul de Verteuil, Ian Williams, Paul Lee, Bryan Bahadur, A. Peiham Braithwaite, William Bushe and Rudhra Persad for the National InterClub League. The team was managed by Mrs. C. Mackie who generously donated her time and effort. THANKS! we would also like to thank Mr. William Bushe for the use of his vehicle.</P>
<I><P>July 1993 saw Kwami Johnson(U-14), Rudhra Persad (Team Reserve), A. Pelham Braithwaite (U-19) and P. Lee (U-19) heading off to Guyana for the 1993 JUNIOR CARASRA TOURNAMENT as part of the National Junior Squash Team.</P>
<P>Kwami placed second in the U-14's boy's category, while P. Lee and A. Pelham-Braithwaite tied for fifth in the under 19 boy's category. The boy's team placed third overall.</P>
</I><P>Due to the absence of steady coaching there has been a steady decline in quality squash playing in the lower forms. However, the court was as full as ever with enthusiastic first and second formers. With the return of our coach, Mrs. Cecelia Prudent great strides are being made in the quality of squash being played and students seem more interested than ever.</P>
<P>To all you squash enthusiasts, Good Luck and Have Fun.</P></FONT><DIR><DIR>
