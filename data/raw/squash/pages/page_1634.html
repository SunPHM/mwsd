      migration of sun lovers from Victoria to St. Johns to New York
      for their escape from sleet, snow, and spinning tires to the
      swaying palms, murmuring surf, and secluded beaches of the Turks
      &amp; Caicos Islands. Many who enjoy the attractions of tropical
      living have decided on a more permanent respite from the ravages
      of winter. But vacations are to residing as dating is to marriage;
      expectations over the long term far exceed those of a short stay.
					<CENTER>
						</CENTER>
					<P>That's why the purchase of real estate in the Turks &amp;
      Caicos Islands (TCI), and Providenciales in particular, is attracting
      worldwide attention. In some cases, this interest is based on
      the Islands' tax-haven status, as TCI off-shore legislation is
      most progressive - particularly in the area of residency. As
      well, there are no restrictions on the purchase and ownership
      of property by foreign investors. However, it's hard not to be
      swayed by the country's sheer natural beauty, uncrowded beaches,
      and magnificent surrounding waters. The fact that island natives
      are friendly and accommodating, the climate is <IMG SRC="JPG/sapodla.jpg"
      ALT="Aerial photograph of Sapodilla Bay" height="120" width="262" ALIGN="LEFT"
      NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">temperate and sunny, and recreational
      activities -- including SCUBA diving, fishing, golf, and tennis
      -- only increases the temptation to purchase land or a residence
      for temporary or permanent habitation.</P>
					<P>In fact, we have seen a gradual shift in the reasons for buying
      property. In the 1980s, the majority of purchases were speculative
      in nature. This changed in the 1990s, as most purchasers now
      plan to build retirement or income-generating homes in the Turks
      &amp; Caicos.</P>

      <P>With daily 90-minute jet flights from Miami, weekly 3 hour
      charters from Toronto, New York, and Boston, and same-day travel
      from Europe, Providenciales is quickly becoming the fastest-growing
      destination in the Caribbean.</P>

      <P>Providenciales, known locally as &quot;Provo,&quot; is the
      most developed of the Islands and already a tropical &quot;home
      away from home&quot; to nearly 2,000 Americans, Canadians, and
      Europeans. Lifestyle, environment, health, and security are the
      keys that opened the doors from island dreaming to island living.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Our Location</FONT><BR>
      The Turks &amp; Caicos Islands lie some 575 miles southeast of
      Miami - about 1 hours flying time - with the Bahamas about 80
      miles to the northwest and the Dominican Republic some 100 miles
      to the southeast.</P>

      <P>The country consists of two island groups separated by the
      22-mile-wide Columbus Passage. To the west is the Caicos group
      of islands: West Caicos, Providenciales, North Caicos, Middle
      Caicos, East Caicos, and South Caicos. To the east is the Turks
      island group: Grand Turk and Salt Cay.</P>

      <P>The Turks &amp; Caicos total 166 square miles of land area
      on the eight islands and forty small cays. The Islands' population
      is approximately 14,000.<IMG SRC="JPG/motorb2.jpg" ALT="Aerial photograph of motoboat"

      Multi-channel satellite television is received from the U.S.
      and Canada. The local media consists of a private television
      station, local radio station, two bi-weekly newspapers, and a
      quarterly magazine.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Immigration<BR>
      </FONT>Those wishing to live in the Islands need a resident's
      permit. For those intending to work or establish a business,
      a work permit or business license is also required. These are
      generally granted to those offering skills, experience, and qualifications
      not widely available on the Islands. Priority is given to business
      enterprises that will provide employment and training for Turks
      &amp; Caicos Islanders.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Government/Legal System<BR>
      </FONT>TCI is a British Crown colony. The Governor, from Britain
      and appointed by the Queen, presides over an Executive Council.
      Local self-government is headed by the Chief Minister and is
      carried out by elected ministers and a legislative council, which
      is empowered to enact local statutes. Government offices are
      located on Grand Turk.</P>

      <P>The legal system is based upon the common English law and
      is administered by resident magistrates and non-resident judge
      who visits at quarterly intervals.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Recreation</FONT><BR>
      Sporting activities are centered around the water. Visitors can
      choose from deep-sea, reef, or bonefishing, sailing excursions,
      windsurfing, water-skiing, parasailing, snorkeling, Scuba diving
      and beachcombing. <IMG SRC="JPG/ncrdiving.jpg" ALT="ncrdiving.jpg (9119 bytes)"

      reefs, abundant marine life, and excellent visibility make TCI
      a world-class diving destination. Golfers will enjoy the beauty
      and challenge of the 18 Hole Carl Litten designed course. If
      you are not a straight hitter, bring lots of balls. The islands
      are an ecotourist's paradise. Visitors can enjoy unspoiled wilderness
      and native flora and fauna in 33 areas set aside as National
      Park Nature Reserves, sanctuaries, and areas of historical interest.</P>

      <P>Nightlife includes local bands playing traditional island
      music at bars and restaurants, some nightclubs, and a casino
      on Provo. Stargazing is extraordinary! There is no personal security
      problem, and it is safe to walk around anywhere at night.</P>

      <P>Souvenir shoppers will find Caribbean paintings, T-shirts,
      shells, locally-made handicrafts, and videotapes about the Islands.

      </FONT>There are no direct taxes on either income or capital
      for individuals or companies. There are no exchange controls.
      Indirect taxation comprises customs duties, stamp duty on certain
      transactions, and departure tax.<IMG SRC="JPG/conch.jpg" ALT="Conch display from Boogaloo's Restaurant in Blue Hills"

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Economy<BR>
      </FONT>Historically, the economy of TCI relied upon the export
      of salt. Currently, tourism, the offshore finance industry, and
      fishing generate the most private sector income. The Islands'
      main exports are lobster and conch. Practically all consumer
      goods and most foodstuffs are imported.</P>

      <P>The Turks &amp; Caicos Islands are now recognized as an important
      offshore financial centre, offering a wide variety of financial
      services and products, including company formation, offshore
      insurance, banking, trusts, limited partnerships, and limited
      life companies. The Financial Services Commission regulates the
      industry, spearheads the development of offshore legislation,
      and promotes the industry in the major world markets.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Language<BR>
      </FONT>The principal language of the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands
      is English.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Currency<BR>
      </FONT>The United States dollar is the primary currency of TCI.
      The Treasury also issues a Turks &amp; Caicos crown and quarter,
      both of which are legal tender. Travelers' checks in U.S. dollar
      amounts are widely accepted and other currency can be changed
      at local banks. American Express, VISA, and MasterCard are welcomed
      by many locations.</P>

      the heat and keep life comfortable.</P>

      <P>Casual resort and leisure wear is accepted attire for daytime;
      light sweaters or jackets may be necessary on some breezy evenings.
      Visitors are advised to wear protective clothing and a sun hat,

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Entry Requirements<BR>
      </FONT>Most visitors are required to carry a passport. Visitors
      from North America may enter without a passport if they have
      a birth certificate and one piece of identification bearing a
      photograph. A valid onward or return ticket is also required.
      Check your airline for luggage restrictions.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Customs Formalities<BR>
      </FONT>Visitors may bring in duty-free for their own use one
      carton of cigarettes or cigars, one bottle of liquor or wine,
      and some perfume.</P>

      <P>The importation of all firearms, including those charged with
      compressed air, without prior approval in writing from the Commissioner
      of Police, is strictly forbidden. Spear guns, Hawaiian slings,
      controlled drugs, and pornography are also illegal.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Transportation<BR>
      </FONT>A valid driver's license from a visitor's normal place
      of residence is suitable when renting vehicles. A government
      tax of $10 U.S. is levied on all hired cars and $5 U.S. on motor
      scooter rentals (Insurance is extra). Driving is on the left-hand
      side of the road. Taxis are abundant throughout the Islands.
      Bicycle rentals are also available.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#408080" SIZE="+1">Lifestyle<BR>
      </FONT>Life on Provo is slow-paced, laid back, and informal.
      A wait in the bank is an opportunity to chat with friends or
      tourists. Socks and watches soon disappear and stress ebbs away
      with the tides. For new arrivals who can't go &quot;cold turkey&quot;
      and need their stress fix, the 32-channel cable television with
      CNN provides the solution!</P>

      <P>Residents soon rediscover the art of conversation, as personal
      social interaction replaces the more public group functions of
      the North American social scene. &quot;Going out&quot; can be
      dinner with friends, a game of tennis, squash, golf, or bridge,
      a day on the ocean, a picnic on a nearby uninhabited Cay, cocktails
      at sunset, or simply a walk on the beach.</P>

      in which a good time is always had by all. There is a garden
      club, bridge clubs, fishing and diving trips, book exchanges,

      of cotton in January, the delectable fragrance of the frangipani
      in summer, and the delicate blue-purple flowers covering the
