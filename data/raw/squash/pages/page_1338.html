<p><b>China During the Sui, Tang, Sung, and Ming Dynasties, ca 600-1644:</b>&nbsp;
Chinese history is dominated by the rise and fall of Dynasties,
interspersed
with intervals of disorder, warfare, and foreign invasion.&nbsp;
220-581:&nbsp;
Age of Disunity, when disorder, warfare and foreign invasion plagued
China;
581 and 618: two Sui emperors, Emperor Yang and his son ruled;
618-907:&nbsp;
the T&#8217;ang Dynasty, during which Chinese civilization reached new
heights,
especially in size and the realms of culture; 907-960:&nbsp; an
interlude
of disorders; 960-1279: the Sung Dynasty; 1279-1368:&nbsp; the Mongols
under Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty, which lasted until it
was
overthrown by rebellious Chinese; 1368-1644: the Ming Dynasty; and
1644-1911:
the Manchu Dynasty, which ruled until overthrown in the Chinese
Revolution
of 1911.
</p>
<p>Were the 1,000 years between the advent of the Sui Dynasty and the
end
of the Ming a period of disorder and chaos?&nbsp; Chinese civilization
was stable and continued traditional lines, and China was &#8220;the richest,
most populous, and, in many ways most culturally advanced country in
the
world.&#8221;&nbsp; China contrasts with Western Europe following the fall of
the Roman Empire.&nbsp; T&#8217;ang capital of Chang&#8217;an had a population of
2,000,000
in the 8th-9th centuries; Chang&#8217;an had broad boulevards, shrines,
palaces,
and was a cosmopolitan center of trade.&nbsp; But:&nbsp; Chinese
political,
social, and cultural stability as well as wealth and psychological
security
came at price.&nbsp; Chinese civilization changed little.&nbsp;
Meanwhile,
the West made great advances in technology, in economics (the
beginnings
of capitalism), and in politics, and it expanded overseas.&nbsp; The
West
became a dynamic civilization that ultimately dominated the globe, came
into contact with and then disrupted and ultimately destroyed
traditional
Chinese civilization.
</p>
<p><b>Four Key Themes:</b>
</p>
<p><b>1.&nbsp; Success and Failure of Buddhism:</b>
</p>
<p>Important prior to the re-unification of the Chinese Empire by the
Sui
Dynasty in 581 was the spread of Buddhism and artistic ideas which
blended
Greek, Roman, and Indian traditions.&nbsp; Buddhist practices were
joined
to Confucianism and Taoism, and the religiously tolerant Chinese were
able
to practice all three simultaneously.&nbsp; Cave temples were dug and
filled
with sculpted Buddhas, which reveal a blending of Greco-Roman, Indian,
central Asian, and Chinese styles.&nbsp; Some 142,289 Buddhist
sculptures
survive from these years and may be found near Loyang, once a capital
with
a population of 500,000-600,000 in 500 and some 1,367 wooden temples,
all
of which have been lost.

Buddhist
Temple.
</p>
<p>During the early years of T&#8217;ang rule, Buddhism spread, and Buddhist
monasteries became important centers of learning and medicine.&nbsp;
The
scholar Hsuan-tsang translated volumes of Buddhist texts into
Chinese.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, over the years, Buddhism became sinicized.&nbsp; During
the
sixth century, an early version of Zen Buddhism&#8212;with its emphasis on
meditation
and intuitive enlightenment&#8212;also developed.&nbsp; By the mid-800s, the
influence of the Buddhists frightened T&#8217;ang rulers and the Confucian
scholars,
and Buddhism underwent a period of severe persecution.&nbsp; Shrines
and
monasteries were destroyed, and some 26,000 monks and nuns were forced
to return to ordinary life.&nbsp; Although Buddhism remained in China,
its importance ended, and it did not remold Chinese society as
Christianity
did European.&nbsp; Confucianism accordingly remained the dominant
belief
system.

<p><b>2.&nbsp; Chinese Intellectual and Cultural Achievements:&nbsp;
The
T&#8217;ang and Sung Dynasties.</b>

</p>
<p>T&#8217;ang cultural achievements were in lyric poetry, art, and
sculpture.&nbsp;
Thousands wrote poetry, and the most famous was Li Po (701-762), author
of &#8220;Drinking Alone by Moonlight.&#8221;&nbsp; Landscape painting
flourished;&nbsp;
Buddhist statues were carved; secular sculptors made ceramic figures of
animals, including horses and camels,&nbsp; human figures, and other
artifacts.&nbsp;
T&#8217;ang tombs, like that of T&#8217;ai Tsung, were filled with these objects.

</p>
<p>The Sung Dynasty presided over a period of innovation and cultural
flowering.&nbsp;
Entrance in the Civil Service system was made fairer; examinations took
place on a triennial basis, first at the local and then at the national
level; fewer than 10% passed the local examinations; fewer than 10% of
the survivors passed the national examinations.&nbsp; Sung artists
became
expert in the art of calligraphy, and they painted natural scenes under
the influence of Taoism, particularly mountains rising above misty
hills
and swift flowing rivers and waterfalls.
</p>
<p>Also important was production of fine porcelain, much prized for its
value as an export item.
</p>

</p>
<p>Inventions made earlier were perfected during the Sung Dynasty,
including
gunpowder, which was first used about 1100, and printing by movable
type,
although the block print (invented ca. 868)
</p>
<p><img src="chinese_book_868.jpg" height="420" width="618"> The First

</p>
<p>was preferred because of the 40,000 Chinese characters; however
printed,
books were plentiful and inexpensive (books were needed by candidates
for
the Civil Service examinations).&nbsp; Confucianism revived, largely
the
work of scholars like Chu Hsi (1130-1200) whose Neo-Confucianism was a
blend of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.&nbsp; He taught that the
universe
was governed by natural law, which could be understood and respected;
that
people were good by nature; and that they could become more perfect;
evil,
he continued, resulted from neglect and an inadequate education; hence
it could corrected.&nbsp; Chu Hsi achieved the status in China that
Thomas
Aquinas enjoyed in the medieval west.&nbsp; According to a scholar of
the
Ming Dynasty, &#8220;Ever since the time of the philosopher Chu, the Truth
has
been made manifest to the world. No more writing is needed: what is
left
to us is practice.&#8221;&nbsp; Neo-Confucianism focused on ethical concerns,
contending that &#8220;human fulfillment in this life is possible through
self-cultivation.&#8221;&nbsp;
This interpretation of Confucianism shaped the school curriculum and
the
civil service examinations until the collapse of the Manchus in 1911.
</p>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; The Mongols and their Achievements.</b>
</p>
<p>The Mongols came from central Asia, and they were a nomadic people
who
raised horses and sheep; they were also sturdy and self-reliant, and
they
developed into fierce warriors who fought on horseback.&nbsp; With
strong
ambitious leaders, they conquered vast territory.&nbsp; Under their
greatest
ruler Genghis Khan (1167-1227), they conquered an empire from the
Pacific
to eastern Europe.&nbsp; With a population of about two million and an
army of 130,000 cavalry, the Mongols accomplished this feat using
superior
military technology and innovative battle tactics.&nbsp; Mongol
horsemen
could travel up to ninety miles a day, they had saddles and stirrups
designed
so they could fire arrows accurately from horseback, and they developed
the tactic of encircling their enemies.

</p>
<p>the Mongols captured China, Korea, central Asia, most of Persia,
Russia,
Poland, and Hungary.&nbsp; The Mongol Empire was divided into four
parts:&nbsp;
the Kipchak Empire (Golden Horde) included Russia and parts of central
Asia; the Empire of Persia included the lands south of the Caucasus
Mountains
and the Oxus River and west of the Hindu Kush; the Empire of Chaghatai
included central Asia, and the Empire of the Great Khan, which included
Tibet, the Gobi Desert, and China.&nbsp; Most splendid of the emperors
was Kublai Khan (1214-1294), who ruled from a lavish palace in Beijing
after 1264, which Marco Polo (1254-1324) visited and described for
astonished
Europeans.
</p>
<p><img src="china_mongol_map.jpg" height="418" width="613"> Mongol

</p>
<p>The Yuan Dynasty:&nbsp; Established by Kublai Khan in northern China
in 1271; in 1279, they defeated the last of the Sung Dynasty, and they
ruled China to 1368.&nbsp; Mongol achievements:&nbsp; 1) Peace
permitted
population growth; 2) Kublai Khan extended the Grand Canal to Beijing,
so South China rice could be shipped to his growing capital city; 3) he
built a paved road 1,100 miles in length so that messengers could
travel
north and south; other roads linked China to India and Persia, thus
facilitating
trade and other contacts.&nbsp; 4) paper money encouraged the
development
of trade.&nbsp; Still, there was friction between the Chinese and their
Mongol rulers, largely due to linguistic and cultural
differences.&nbsp;
After Kublai Khan&#8217;s death (1294), several Mongol rulers governed;
unrest
led to revolution; in 1368, the last Mongol was overthrown by a former
Buddhist monk named Zhu Yuanzhang; the new dynasty was the Ming, which
united China under Chinese rule.

<p><b>4.&nbsp; The Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644) and the Closing of China
to the West:&nbsp; Restore the glories of the past, conservative, and
resistance
to change.</b>
</p>
<p>Peace prevailed, and Chinese culture grew and flourished.&nbsp;
Characteristics
of Ming Civilization:&nbsp; 1) the defeated Mongols were considered
barbarians
and savages, so the Ming emperors tried to eradicate any trace of their
presence.&nbsp; To do so, they sought to recreate the splendor of the
past,
that of the Han, T&#8217;ang, and Sung Dynasties.&nbsp; 2) the government was
autocratic, with more power in the hands of the emperors than
before.&nbsp;
3) the army, which was utilized for defense, reached a size of four
million
men, but there was little technological innovation and China lagged
behind
the West.&nbsp; 4) Neo-Confucianism was restored as the official
ideology
of the government, and the traditional examination system for entry
into
the Civil Service was reemphasized to the extent that reverence for
tradition
stifled innovation.&nbsp; 5) Confucian ideology divided Chinese society
into four classes:&nbsp; the land-owning gentry and scholar-bureaucrats
who administered the empire in the name of the emperor, and both groups
had a vested interest in preserving the status quo; the peasants;
artisans;
and merchants.&nbsp; Chinese merchants did not have the potential of
the
urban dwelling European bourgeoisie.&nbsp; Their lowly status revealed
a lack of interest in trade as a means of increasing China's
wealth.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, during the early Ming period, the emperors sent out great
fleets of junks to India and the Middle East.&nbsp; These trading
expeditions
were ended by an imperial order in 1433; the reasons behind it remain
mysterious.
</p>
<p>Contact with Europeans began in 1515; networks of trade developed,
even
though a one-way voyage required a year.&nbsp; The Portuguese were
established
in Macao, and they sent tea, porcelains, silks, spices, lacquerware,
and
other luxury items home.&nbsp; The Dutch also traded with the Ming
Dynasty.
</p>
<p><img src="china_ming.ceramic.jpg" height="120" width="120"> Ceramic

</p>
<p>Catholic missionaries arrived in the sixteen century, and the
Jesuits
won influence at court.&nbsp; Beginning about the 1550s, the Ming
rulers
sought to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and to protect
their land borders.&nbsp; They moved the capital to Beijing, which is
not
far from the strengthened Great Wall.
<br>
&nbsp;Ming rule lasted until the rise of the Manchus in the 17th
century.&nbsp;
Nurhachi, a Manchurian chief, united small tribes into a single
people.&nbsp;
He then led them in the conquest of Korea and Inner Mongolia in the
1630s,
and the Manchus captured Beijing in 1644 and founded the Manchu, or
Ch&#8217;ing,
Dynasty.

<p><b><font size="+1">Japanese Civilization from its Early History to
1467</font></b></p>
</center>
<p><b>Readings:&nbsp; Craig, <i>World Civilizations</i>, Chapter 9.</b>
</p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp; The Chinese dominated the development of
East Asian nations east and south of the steppes and deserts in a way
unparalleled
by any one nation in the West.&nbsp; Absent thus is the political and
cultural
diversity characteristic of the West following the fall of Rome in the
sixth century.&nbsp; Hence, where Vietnam and Korea are now found,
agricultural
societies heavily influenced by Chinese civilization developed.&nbsp;
The
history of Japan is different.&nbsp; An island-nation over 100 miles
distant
from the mainland, Japan experienced less direct political and cultural
influence from China than did either Vietnam or Korea.&nbsp; This
greater
independence on the part of Japan allowed it to play a more significant
role in Asian as well as world history.
</p>
<p><b>Geography influenced Japanese history</b>, much as it did that of
Greece or Great Britain.&nbsp; 1) Japan is an archipelago, a group of
islands,
the largest and most populous of which are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku,
and
Kyushu;
</p>
<p><img src="jap_map.jpg" height="394" width="610"> Map of Japan.
</p>
<p>2) Japan also is mountainous, and little of its territory is
suitable
for farming; 3) its climate, however, is good for producing abundant
crops,
particularly of rice, which, with fish, is a Japanese staple; 4)
Japan&#8217;s
distance offshore shielded it from foreign invasion.&nbsp; Before
Japan&#8217;s
defeat in World War II, only the Mongols had seriously threatened
Japan;
the Mongols tried and failed to invade Japan with a fleet of 3,500
ships
and 140,000 men in 1281.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; the Japanese were close
enough
to benefit from the advanced Chinese civilization but removed enough to
allow them to pick and chose what they wanted to import.&nbsp; Hence
the
development of Japanese civilization is characterized both by a
willingness
to borrow from the Chinese and by a drive to develop along an
independent
path.
</p>
<p><b>Early Japanese history:</b>&nbsp; Traditions like 1) Shintoism
and
2) reverence for the emperor have distant roots.&nbsp; Shinto = &#8220;the
way
of the gods&#8221;; based on the worship of spirits called Kami who reside in
waterfalls, trees, and such natural objects; Mount Fuji is a Shinto
holy
place; it lacks scripture, specific doctrines, codes of ethics, or a
priestly
class; the main Shinto deity was Amaterasu (sun goddess), the
protectress
of the Japanese nation; hence Japan is known as the Land of the Rising
Sun.&nbsp; Shintoism was closely connected with the growth of the
Japanese
state and its rulers.&nbsp; Early social and political organization was
based on clans, each ruled by a hereditary priest-chieftain.&nbsp; Over
time, the Yamato clan was recognized as superior and its chief became
the
emperor; according to legend, Jimmu was the first emperor (ca. 660 BC).
</p>
<p><b>Japanese Borrowings from China:</b>&nbsp; From the Chinese, the
Japanese
borrowed writing in the 5th century;&nbsp; the Buddhist religion in the
6th (Shintoism and Buddhism peacefully coexisted, with many believing
in
both); artistic styles; concepts of engineering; medical knowledge and
practices; a system of weights and measures; the calendar; and concepts
of government.&nbsp; Important in encouraging this borrowing was Prince
Shotoku (573-621), who brought Buddhism to Japan, along with the
Confucian
ideas that underlay his Seventeen Article Constitution (604), and who
began
the practice of sending embassies to China (607).
</p>
<p><img src="jap_shotoku.jpg" height="374" width="256"> Idealized
Statue of
Prince Shotoku.
</p>
<p>This influx of Chinese ideas and practices resulted in the Taika
Reforms
of 645, a major restructuring of Japanese institutions in accord with
Prince
Shotoku&#8217;s ideas; the model was the T&#8217;ang Dynasty.&nbsp; A centralized
government
was created, with a bureaucracy similar to the Chinese; land was
nationalized
and then granted to peasant-farmers in exchange for payment of a land
tax
of rice and labor.&nbsp; Japanese aristocrats retained a large amount
of
tax-exempt land and control over high government offices.&nbsp;
Japanese
law codes, modeled on the Chinese, were proclaimed by emperors in the
7th
&amp; 8th centuries; they regulated every aspect of Japanese life and
centralized
power in the hands of the emperor.&nbsp; They also built a new capital
city named Heinan in about 794, which remained the Japanese capital
until
1869 and which evolved into the modern city of Kyoto.
</p>
<p><b>Feudal Japan:</b>&nbsp; Major Characteristics:&nbsp; 1) about the
middle of the 9th century, the Japanese stopped borrowing from China
and
began 350 years of assimilation and innovation; 2) power of the central
government declined and Japan entered the feudal period;&nbsp; an
emperor
continued to rule, but power fell to families like the Fujiwara, who
held
key offices and who married into the emperor&#8217;s family, thus enabling
them
to dominate the Japanese government from the early 9th to the mid-12th
century; 3) great warrior-landowners living distant from the capital
built
up private armies; when law and order broke down, farmers and small
landowners
traded part of their land for protection, and the landowners became
even
more powerful.&nbsp; Called the Daimyos, these lords were a bit like
the
feudal barons in England and France and they won the loyalty of the
lesser
samurai; 4) the Fujiwara were challenged by the Minamoto; after years
of
struggle, the latter emerged victorious in 1185 and held onto power
until
1338.&nbsp; In 1192, they introduced the office of the Shogun (= &#8220;Great
General&#8221;); over time, the Shogun won control over the military,
finances,
the laws, the courts, and appointments to office, he was in effect a
military
dictator; 5) the power wielded by the Shogun made the office the target
of ambitious men.&nbsp; In 1338, the Ashikaga family seized the office
and held it for over 200 years.&nbsp; In brief, then, the structure of
feudal Japan consisted of a figurehead Emperor, a powerful Shogun, the
Daimyos, the Samurai, and, at the bottom, the mass of peasants,
farmers,
artisans, and merchants; 6) important were warriors called the Samurai
(= &#8220;one who serves&#8221;); the Samurai's claim to power rested on the
possession
of land, on a tradition of descent from earlier local leaders, and on
his
prowess with the sword; their code of conduct was called Bushido, or
the
"way of the warrior," and it stressed bravery, loyalty, and honor;
Samurai
who lost their honor were expected to commit seppuku, or ritual
suicide.
</p>
<p><b>Japanese cultural and religious achievements:</b>&nbsp; feudal
Japan
witnessed a religious awakening.&nbsp; Older Buddhist traditions taught
that salvation came from contributions to monasteries and the study of
Buddhist texts, opportunities that were available only to wealthy
aristocrats.&nbsp;
New was Zen Buddhism, which arrived about 1200; it taught that
salvation
was achieved through enlightenment rather than faith, and enlightenment
was achieved by lengthy periods of meditation and self-discipline.

<p>Zen appealed to the Samurai who found that it helped them live in
accordance
with the code of Bushido.&nbsp; The Ashikaga Shoguns actively supported
the spread of Zen Buddhism by building monasteries and encouraging
Zen.&nbsp;
During the 14th and 15th centuries, new art forms inspired by Zen
teachings
appeared in Japan, and they include landscape architecture, the art of
designing gardens (a meticulous arrangement of rocks, trees, and water
to represent the essential beauty of nature),<br>

<p>the Japanese tea

and the No play.&nbsp; The latter were highly stylized dance dramas,
usually
with religious subjects, performed&#8212;not unlike the Greek tragedies&#8212;by
male
actors wearing masks, while a chorus chanted the story.&nbsp; Prominent
works of literature were <i>The Pillow Book</i> by Lady Sei Shonago, a
sketch of life, manners, and morals at court, and the <b>Tale of the
Genji</b>
by Lady Murasaki, a novel about the romantic life of a prince.
</p>
<p><b>Establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate:</b>&nbsp; During the
15th
and 16th centuries, the Japanese experienced a Civil War and ended it
establishing
the Tokugawa Shogunate, a blend of feudalism and a centralized monarchy
which survived until 1868.&nbsp; The Ashikaga family declined and
finally
lost control of the Shogunate; meanwhile powerful Daimyos fought for
control
of Japan.&nbsp; Of these, the most important was Toyotomi Hideyoshi; by
the 1580s, he had defeated and subdued most of his rivals; to control
them,
Hideyoshi reduced their land holdings and made it impossible for a
peasant
to become a warrior; the warrior class henceforth was hereditary.&nbsp;
In 1592, Hideyoshi invaded Korea.&nbsp; Motives were varied; he aspired
to create an empire; he also wanted to keep Japanese warriors occupied
in Korea while he increased his power at home.&nbsp; At first the
campaign
went well, but soon Korean resistance stiffened, and the Japanese
abandoned
the campaign after Hideyoshi died in 1598.
</p>
<p><b>The Reform of Feudalism:</b>&nbsp; Succeeding Hideyoshi was
Tokugawa
Ieyasu, who defeated his rival Daimyos and was named
Shogun(1603).&nbsp;
Ieyasu did not destroy Japanese feudalism, but he reformed it by
reducing
the power of the great lords, much as William the Conqueror had done
after
the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.&nbsp; 1) the Daimyos were
permitted
to keep their lands, but they were required to swear an oath of
allegiance
to Ieyasu and his family; 2) within their lands, the Daimyos exercised
almost complete control, and they collected taxes from the peasants to
support themselves and the samurai; 3) lands possessed by the Tokugawa
family equaled about 25% of the land area of Japan; 4) over the lesser
Daimyos, the Tokugawa exercised greater control:&nbsp; they were
forbidden
to build castles and to make alliances with other Daimyos, thus
preventing
them from amassing enough power to challenge the central government;
they
were required to spend every other year in the Shogun's capital of Edo
and to leave their families there as hostages when they travelled to
their
own lands; 5) an additional measure to limit the possibility of revolt
was a continuation of the Hideyoshi policy of disarming the
peasants.&nbsp;
In short: the Tokugawa Shogunate combined a strong central government
with
a limited feudalism.&nbsp; Results: peace from about 1600 to 1868.
</p>
<p><b>The Closing of Japan:</b>&nbsp; The Tokugawa also adopted a
strict
policy of isolation in the 1630s, and they closed Japan because they
viewed
outside contacts as a challenge to their authority.&nbsp; Before the
16th
century, the Japanese had limited trading contacts with China and
Korea;
some Daimyos also traded with the Portuguese, who introduced both the
musket
and Christianity to Japan.&nbsp; Christian missionaries converted about
a half million Japanese by the early 1600s.&nbsp; But, because
Christianity
taught obedience to a power higher than the shogun, the Tokugawa
opposed
it's spread and then actually outlawed it.&nbsp; They also first
limited
trade and then cut it off entirely, and they banned Japanese from
travelling
abroad.&nbsp; The Tokugawa Shogunate was more successful than the
Chinese
in eliminating foreign contacts, largely because Japan was an
island-nation.
</p>
<p><b>Other Changes in Tokugawa Japan:</b>&nbsp; Cities grew, largely
because
of internal trade; various cultural practices also grew up within the
cities,
including Kabuki theater, Bunraku theater (large puppets acted in
historical
or realistic dramas), and the writing of haiku poetry, a three line
poem
limited to 17 syllables which gave the reader a momentary image of
picture
[&#8220;A trout leaps high&#8212;/below him, in the river bottom,/clouds flow
by.&#8221;&#8212;a
poem by Onitsura].

<p><b>Conclusion:</b>&nbsp; The Tokugawa policy of isolation ended only
in 1854, when the Treaty of Kanagawa opened Japanese ports to American
ships.&nbsp; As the subsequent history of Japan in the 19th and 20th
centuries
reveals, however, the conservatism of the Tokugawa merely concealed an
underlying dynamic element in Japanese civilization.&nbsp; Japan,
therefore,
and unlike China, was able to respond in a positive and creative manner
to challenges from the West.&nbsp; Japan quickly imported western ideas
and practices, especially military ones, and adapted them to its own
use.

<p><b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp; Much is known about African civilizations
north of the Sahara Desert and along the Mediterranean coast&#8212;Egypt,
Libya,
Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco; less is known about those south of the
Sahara.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; the absence of written sources, the type of records that
historians
are accustomed to use for the writing of specialized studies and books
like our text.&nbsp; Scholars who study the early history of Africa
must
therefore use other sources, including 1) the study of languages and
their
diffusion, like Bantu; 2) oral traditions; 3) archeological
excavations,
like those at Zimbabwe; 4) artifacts, like the Axum Stele, and 5)
accounts
by outside observers, like those by the fourteenth-century Ibn
Battuta.&nbsp;
Information from such sources is often scanty and, more important,
difficult
to interpret.&nbsp; Two examples.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) The knowledge provided
by the work of archaeologists is fragmentary since the tropical climate
of sub-Sahara Africa destroys many artifacts.&nbsp; Even when extensive
remains have been found&#8212;as is the case with the ancient civilization of
Zimbabwe&#8212;it is difficult to decipher their meaning or importance.&nbsp;
2) Equally problematical are the accounts of outside observers.&nbsp;
Most
were Islamic or European in origin, and they are sometimes biased, thus
creating unfortunate stereotypes about sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp; This
said,
it is also a fact that such sources, however fragmentary and
problematic,
must be used, since there are few others available.&nbsp; Since it is
impossible
to make simple generalizations about a continent as diverse as Africa
before
1500, we will survey it by geographical areas.
</p>
<p><b>The Kingdoms of Kush and Axum:</b>&nbsp; In the area south and
southeast
of Ancient Egypt, two important kingdoms arose and flourished.&nbsp;
First,
came the Kingdom of Kush, which arose along the Nile in the area called
Nubia (origins may be as early as 3,000 BC) and reached its height
between
250 BC and AD 150.&nbsp; Cities in Kush were originally trading centers
that supplied the Egyptians with everything from building materials to
slaves, ivory, and ebonywood; in turn, Kush civilization was much
influenced
by Egyptian culture, especially after the Egyptian conquest.&nbsp; By
the
10th century BC, Kush had become a more or less independent kingdom,
and
their emperors briefly ruled all of Egypt between 712 and 663 BC.&nbsp;
Wars with the Egyptians, however, forced the center of Kush further
south
to the city of Mero&euml;, and contacts with the Mediterranean world
diminished.&nbsp;
Although the early leaders of Kush were Mediterranean-like peoples, it
is thought that by the 6th century BC, they were black.&nbsp;
Mero&euml;
became an important center of trade between sub-Sahara Africa and Egypt
and the Mediterranean world.&nbsp; Mero&euml; also became a center of
iron
smelting and produced weapons and tools.&nbsp; Monuments from this era
include rows of royal pyramids, palaces, and city walls.&nbsp; The
kingdom
of Kush began to decline in the 2nd century AD, and it disappeared in
the
4th century, possibly because of the rise of the competing state of
Axum.
</p>
<p><img src="axum_stelae01.jpg" height="444" width="553"> Axum Stele.
</p>
<p>Axum was located in the Ethiopian highlands to the southeast of
Kush,
and it sat upon the great trade routes from the Red Sea northwest to
Egypt
and southwest to the interior of Africa.&nbsp; One important
development
occurred during the 4th century when the Axumite king Ezana converted
to
Christianity, founding the Ethiopian Church.&nbsp; From Axum,
Christianity
spread into central Africa.&nbsp; Axum remained an important kingdom
until
the rise of Islam reduced its importance as a trade center by cutting
its
trade routes.
</p>
<p><b>East African Civilizations:</b>&nbsp; Along the coast of the
Indian
Ocean a number of important city-states developed, but no kingdoms like
Kush or Axum, and they dominated coastal trade.&nbsp; These coastal
Africans
traded spices, slaves, ivory, rhinoceros horns, and tortoise shells for
cotton cloth, copper and brass, iron tools, and gold and silver
plates.&nbsp;
A unique culture developed, the Swahili, and its language was Bantu in
origin but with Arabic and Persian influences.&nbsp; How old these
cities
are is uncertain, but a first century AD merchant-seaman described them
in some detail.&nbsp; Following the Islamic conquest of Mediterranean
Africa,
trade became even more important along this coastline.&nbsp; Because of
the presence of Muslim traders, Islam secured an important foothold
along
the East African coast.&nbsp; Important East African city-states
include
Mogadishu and Malindi; further south was Kilwa, the leading East
African
port in the 12th century.&nbsp; According to Ibn Battuta, it was a
large
and elegant city with stone houses and rich decorations.&nbsp; Trade
linked
the East African coast with India, China, and the Indies to the East.
</p>
<p><b>South Africa and Zimbabwe:</b>&nbsp; Southern Africa remained
untouched
by outside influences, including those of the Mediterranean world and
Islam,
until the Portuguese arrived in the late 15th century.&nbsp; In the 8th
century, Bantu-speaking peoples arrived, settled down, and blended with
the native peoples.&nbsp; The most impressive monument in Africa south
of Egypt and the Nile are the ruins of Great Zimbabwe, discovered in
1871
by a German explorer.

</p>
<p>Great Zimbabwe was built between 800 and 1500, although the site had
apparently been occupied for centuries.&nbsp; Remains consist of sixty
acres on which are located two large complexes of stone buildings, a
fortress,
and a structure now called the Temple.&nbsp; It was surrounded by walls
32 feet high and 17 feet thick, made up of 900,000 granite
blocks.&nbsp;
The stones of the entire complex stay in place without mortar, and
there
are the remains of an extensive drainage system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zimbabwe
was
likely built because of the gold trade with the coastal cities; it was
mined along the Zambezi River in Central Africa and shipped to the
coast.&nbsp;
The people inhabiting Zimbabwe suddenly abandoned the area in the 15th
century.&nbsp; Causes are unknown, but it is possible that exhaustion
of
the soil led to such a drop in food production that an urbanized
population
could not be supported.
</p>
<p><b>Kingdoms and Civilizations of West Africa:</b>&nbsp; Between Lake
Chad and the Atlantic Ocean, a number of important Africa kingdoms
flourished,
including Ghana (ca. 800-1200), Mali (ca. 1200-1500), and Songhai (ca.
1350-1600).&nbsp; Behind the growth of these kingdoms was the conquest
of North Africa by the Muslims in the 7th century, which stimulated
trade
across the Sahara Desert.&nbsp; This trade was made possible by the
introduction
of the camel before about AD 200.<br>
</p>
<p><img alt="Camel Caravan" src="camel_caravan.jpg"
 style="width: 612px; height: 340px;"> Caravan of Camels.<br>
</p>
<p>A camel could carry 500 pounds
of cargo and travel 25 miles a day, often not drinking water for days
on
end.&nbsp;&nbsp; Powerful and wealthy Arabs wanted luxuries, including
West Africa's gold, ivory, slaves, and other goods.&nbsp; Peoples
living
in the savannas south of the Sahara Desert took advantage of this
demand
and founded kingdoms to control markets and trade routes across the
Sahara
and to provide safety for traders from the north.&nbsp; The little
known
about these kingdoms comes from oral traditions and from the writings
of
African scholars and Muslim merchants.
</p>
<p><img src="malimap1.gif" height="359" width="327"> Map of Mali.
</p>
<p><b>The Kingdom of Ghana:</b>&nbsp; Arose shortly after AD 800, and
its
purpose was to protect as well as profit from the trans-Saharan trade
routes.&nbsp;
It was located between the Upper Niger and Senegal Rivers and the
western
boundary of the Sahara Desert.&nbsp; Although its economy had a solid
agricultural
base which supported a population of about 20,000, its wealth came from
its location as the trade center between black Africa and North
Africa.&nbsp;
Its people traded gold from the south and west for salt, textiles, and
other goods brought in caravans across the Sahara Desert.&nbsp; Located
in the capital city of Kumbi, the government controlled the amount of
gold
that could be traded and taxed the gold and salt that crossed its
lands.&nbsp;
These revenues were then used to support the government and a sizeable
army&#8212;the observer who claimed it consisted of 200,000 men, including
40,000
archers, no doubt exaggerated.&nbsp; The ruler of Ghana also received
tribute
in taxes and goods from a number of smaller states.&nbsp; According to
a ninth-century visitor al-Ya-qubi:&nbsp; Ghana&#8217;s &#8220;king is mighty, and
in his lands are gold mines.&nbsp; Under his authority are various
other
kingdoms&#8212;and in all this region there is gold.&#8221;&nbsp; The ruling kings
possessed absolute political and judicial power, and they governed with
the assistance of a large bureaucracy composed of family members and
appointed
officials.&nbsp; The kingdom of Ghana declined and then split into a
number
of small feuding kingdoms after Berber warriors destroyed its capital
of
Kumbi in 1076.
</p>
<p><b>The Kingdom of Mali:</b>&nbsp; It took over Ghana&#8217;s role as
protector
of trade routes, and it built on foundations remaining from its
predecessor.&nbsp;
In the 11th century, its rulers converted to Islam.&nbsp; Important
Mali
rulers included Sundiata (r. 1230-1255); he expanded the kingdom by
conquering
his neighbors, built a new capital at Niani, and won control over the
Saharan
trade routes.&nbsp; Mansa (= &#8220;emperor&#8221;) Kankan Musa (r. 1312-1337),
either
the grandson or grandnephew of Sundiata, was the greatest and most
famous
king of Mali.&nbsp; According to accounts of his pilgrimage to Mecca in
1324-1325, he took along some 60,000 other pilgrims, 12,000 slaves, 500
of whom carried six pounds of gold each, and 80 camels, each loaded
with
300 pounds of gold.
</p>
<p><img src="mansa_musa.gif" height="121" width="185"> Image of Mansa
Musa
from a Fourteenth-century Map.
</p>
<p>The spending of this gold had the unintended consequence of
producing
widespread inflation.&nbsp; From Mecca, Mansa Musa brought with him
scholars,
artists, and architects, and his capital of Timbuktu became an
important
center of Islamic learning and culture.&nbsp; His mosques built of
burnt
bricks served as centers for the conversion of Africans to Islam.&nbsp;
The Kingdom of Mali began to break up shortly after 1400, due in part
by
raids by desert nomads and in part by rebellions in states subject to
rule
by Mali.

</p>
<p><b>The Kingdom of Songhai:</b>&nbsp; It began when their king Sunni
Ali captured Timbuktu in 1468 and then the remainder of the Niger
valley.&nbsp;
The major items traded by Songhai were gold, ivory, and slaves, and
this
commerce brought in great wealth.&nbsp; Important among the later
rulers
of
Songhai was Askia Mohammed (r. 1493-1528), whose ambition was to create
an Islamic empire.&nbsp; Askia made a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1496, and
he had in his train 1,000 foot soldiers, 500 horsemen, and great
amounts
of gold.&nbsp; Like Mansa Musa, he brought back scholars and
teachers.&nbsp;
And, once again, Timbuktu became a center of Islamic religion and
culture.&nbsp;
According to a contemporary:
</p>
<blockquote>In those days, Timbuktu did not have its equal . . . from
the
province of Mali to the extreme limits of the region of the Maghrib for
the solidity of its institutions, its political liberties, the purity
of
its morals, the security of persons, its consideration and compassion
towards
foreigners, its courtesy towards students and men of learning.</blockquote>
Or, to quote the Moorish historian Leo Africanus:
<blockquote>Here are great stores of doctors, judges, priests, and
other
learned men that are bountifully maintained at the king's cost and
charges,
and hither are brought divers manuscripts or written books of Barbary,
which are sold for more money than other merchandise.</blockquote>
The Kingdom of Songhai lasted until 1591, when the Sultan of Morocco,
aspiring
to gain greater control over the trans-Saharan trade, sent a
three-thousand
man army armed with firearms to invade its territory, and this force
won
an easy and decisive victory.
<p><b>Common Characteristics of the Kingdoms of Sudan, Mali, and
Songhai:</b>&nbsp;
1) each had an economy based on trade, and each sought to control both
the import of salt from the north and the purchase of gold from the
south;
2) governments derived their revenues from taxes imposed on the buying
and selling of salt, gold, and other goods; 3) important for the Mali
and
Songhai kingdoms was the influence of Islam, for it furthered trade,
provided
administrators, and stimulated intellectual life.&nbsp; Despite its
importance,
Islam was an urban faith, and it did not penetrate the countryside,
where
most people retained their traditional beliefs and gods.&nbsp; Hence
the
reliance of ruling kings upon Islam was a short-term strength and a
long-term
weakness; 4) more important was the aggressiveness of Berbers to the
north,
who sought the sources of African gold and who wanted to impose their
version
of Islam.&nbsp; Foreign invaders destroyed both the Ghanan and the
Songhai
kingdoms.&nbsp; In the aftermath of the second, a 17th century
historian
in Timbuktu wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>From that moment everything changed.&nbsp; Danger took the
place of security; poverty of wealth.&nbsp; Peace gave way to distress,
disasters, and violence. . . .</blockquote>
<b>Conclusion:</b>&nbsp; About 1500, the continent of Africa housed a
wide
variety of languages, cultures, and political and economic
arrangements.&nbsp;
Along the Mediterranean coast, the influence of Islam was
all-important,
and it reached into the Sudan and along the eastern coast.&nbsp; In the
center, native traditions still predominated.&nbsp; Important new
developments
during the 15th century were the presence of ships along the Atlantic
and
Indian coasts carrying European traders and missionaries from Portugal,
Holland, Spain, and England.&nbsp; Initially, the Europeans established
trading and supply centers along the coast, making little or no effort
to move inland.&nbsp; Important consequences nonetheless stemmed from
the
arrival of the Europeans.&nbsp; Their presence constituted the first
step
toward involving Africa in a new and expanding global trading system
that
would be created and dominated by Europeans.&nbsp; Overall,
unfortunately,
this system has exploited rather than benefitted most Africans, as the
infamous Atlantic slave trade illustrates all too well.

<p><b><font size="+1">Civilizations in the Americas Before 1500</font></b></p>
</center>
<p><b>Readings:&nbsp; Craig, <i>World Civilizations</i>, Chapter 14.</b>
</p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b>&nbsp; 1) Paleolithic (hunter-gatherers) peoples
probably came to the Americas as early as 40,000 years ago, while most
migrated during the last of the great ice ages (about 10,000 BC),
crossing
the Bering Straits on a land bridge.&nbsp; 2) After the glaciers
melted,
these new Americans were cut off from cultural developments
elsewhere.&nbsp;
3) Over time, these migrants settled down in widely dispersed and
isolated
groups, and they developed different languages and cultures.&nbsp; 4)
Technological
advances allowed them work softer metals like gold, silver, and copper,
but they did not use bronze or iron; further, metal objects were made
primarily
for decorative purposes, while tools and weapons were made of stone
(obsidian),
wood, or bone.&nbsp; 5) Agriculture was probably invented in the
Americas
between 9,000 and 6,000 BC, largely because climatic changes reduced
opportunities
for hunting.&nbsp; The earliest farm communities were located in
Mexico,
Central America, and the Peruvian highlands, and early Americans grew
corn,
beans, squash, and assorted root crops, like the potato.&nbsp; Plows
were
not invented because no domestic animals large enough to pull them were
available, nor were wheeled vehicles used.&nbsp; 6) By the time the
first
voyages of discovery reached the Americas late in the 15th century,
agriculture
had developed sufficiently to support towns, and advanced civilizations
had grown up in Mexico, Central America, and the Andes Mountains along
the Pacific coast of South America.&nbsp; We will focus on the Olmecs,
the Toltecs, the Mayas, the Aztecs, and the Incas.
</p>
<p><b>Olmec Civilization:</b>&nbsp; It originated about 1200 BC along
the
Gulf of Mexico in present-day Mexico.&nbsp; The Olmec developed a
written
language using hieroglyphics, which unfortunately is unreadable
today.&nbsp;
They also invented intensive agriculture, a number system and calendars
derived from observing the heavens.&nbsp; For religious purposes, the
Olmecs
built huge temples and they carved gigantic heads from volcanic rock.
</p>
<p><img src="olmec-style-mask.gif" height="500" width="427"> An Olmec
Mask.
</p>
<p>Since these heads, which weighed as much as 18 tons, were
transported
some 80 miles from the quarry, the Olmecs must have had a sophisticated
political and social organization and some technology.&nbsp; Other
religious
rituals included a type of ceremonial ball game called pok-a-tok, at
the
end of which losing players were sacrificed to the gods.&nbsp; Olmec
civilization
vanished mysteriously about AD 200; nevertheless scholars believe it
greatly
influenced later Central and South American civilizations.&nbsp; Olmec
carvings have been found throughout Central America, and later peoples
adopted and improved upon the Olmec system of writing, number system,
calendar,
architecture, and ritual ball games.
</p>
<p><b>Mayan Civilization:</b>&nbsp; It developed in the Yucatan
Peninsula
on the site of present-day Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize.&nbsp; This
advanced civilization reached its peak between AD 300 and 700.&nbsp;
Mayan
civilization developed around religious centers, which became populous
city-states housing thousands.
</p>
<p><img src="MayaRealmMap2.gif" height="371" width="367"></p>
<p>The population of Tikal was about 70,000.&nbsp; Mayan cities traded
and fought wars with each other, and government was in the hands of an
absolute ruler.&nbsp; The social structure consisted of upper classes
made
up of priests, nobles, and warriors who did not work, while the vast
majority
of people were peasant farmers.&nbsp; Mayan religion was preoccupied
with
time.&nbsp; The failure to perform ceremonies at the correct time, for
example, could lead to destruction.&nbsp; Hence the Mayans developed an
extremely accurate calendar and a number system based on 20.&nbsp; Like
the Olmec, Mayan writing cannot be read today.&nbsp;&nbsp; For
mysterious
reasons, Mayan civilization collapsed beginning about AD 850, and the
people
left the religious centers.&nbsp; Their descendants still live in
Central
America, and the Mayan language is still spoken.
</p>
<p><b>Toltec Civilization:</b>&nbsp; It flourished in central Mexico
between
the 7th century AD and the beginning of the 13th.&nbsp; The Toltecs
invaded
from the north and conquered the great city of Teotihuac&aacute;n,
which
had arisen in the 1st century AD.
</p>
<p><img src="tenoch8.gif" height="480" width="640"></p>
<p>At its high point, this great city covered 8 square miles, and
housed
a population of perhaps 200,000; at its center was the massive Pyramid
of the Sun.&nbsp; Toltec religion focused on the worship of
Quetzalc&oacute;at,
the Feathered Serpent god, who had brought the blessings of
civilization.&nbsp;
The Toltec invaders, who had a lower level of civilization than the
people
they conquered, adopted much, and by about AD 1,000, they had built an
advanced civilization centered on the capital city of Tula.&nbsp;
Around
1200, the Toltec civilization was ended by foreign conquest.
</p>
<p><b>Aztec Civilization:</b>&nbsp; It originated in the migration of a
nomadic tribe from the north to central Mexico.&nbsp; Beginning about
1325,
the Aztecs slowly extended their authority over the local tribes, and
they
received tribute from them in the form of gold, turquoise, corn,
animals,
and slaves.&nbsp; They also built their capital city of
Tenochtitl&aacute;n
on an island in a lake on the site of present-day Mexico City.
</p>
<p><img src="TENOCHTITLAN1.jpg" height="228" width="398"></p>
<p>It was linked to the mainland with causeways and had aqueducts to
ensure
a supply of fresh water; sewers carried waste materials away.&nbsp;
Over
the years, Tenochtitl&aacute;n grew into a great city with open plazas
and marketplaces.
</p>
<p><img src="Tenochtitlan2.jpg" height="300" width="447"></p>
<p>Farming was done on artificial islands called Chinampas.&nbsp; From
the peoples they conquered, the Aztecs borrowed architectural
techniques,
the calendar, and a writing system, not to mention their social system,
their religion, and many of their arts and crafts.&nbsp; Aztec
government
was in the hands of an emperor who held absolute power and who was
usually
elected by the priestly and warrior elite.&nbsp; Held in awe like a
god,
the emperor was head of state, commander-in-chief of the military, and
head priest, and his word was law.&nbsp; Aztec religion was
polytheistic,
and priests used a sophisticated calendar to determine the feast days
of
each god.&nbsp; Priests also sought to predict the future by reading
signs,
much as did their Roman counterparts.&nbsp; Blood sacrifices to the sun
were necessary, and in times of difficulties, the sacrifice were human
hearts.

<p>In 1487, some 20,000 captives were sacrificed on the steps of Aztec
pyramids.&nbsp; Aztec civilization ended in the late 15th century,
partly
because subject peoples rebelled and partly because of the arrival of
Spanish
conquerors in 1519 under Herman Cortes.&nbsp; The Aztec Empire was the
last of the great Indian empires in Mexico and Central America.

Andes Mountains about the same time as that of the Aztecs.
</p>
<p><img src="Inca_Mts.jpg" height="418" width="717"></p>
<p>Early peoples had developed the technique of terrace-farming, so
that
they could grow potatoes, squash, beans, peanuts, cotton, and other
crops
on the sides of mountains.&nbsp; They also learned basic irrigation
techniques.&nbsp;
Although a number of city-states grew up in these valleys after about
1,000
BC, none became the dominant power until the 15th century.&nbsp; Then
the
Incas began the creation of an empire.&nbsp; At its height, it ranged
some
2,000 miles along the Pacific Coast of South America (present-day Peru,
Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina) and had a population of perhaps
6 million.

Communications
between parts of the empire were made possible by an elaborate network
of roads and bridges.&nbsp; People's lives were controlled by the
government,
which, for example, forced every one to marry and restricted
travel.&nbsp;
Because the Incas lacked a written language, they kept records by using
the <i>quipu</i>, a knotted string used to prod the memory; their
spoken
language of Quechua survives and is widely spoken.
