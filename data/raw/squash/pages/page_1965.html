  very up-to-date, what with the costs of food and its processing getting higher

  The term "root cellars," as used here, includes the whole range of ingenious 
  vegetable-saving techniques, from hillside caves to garden trenches. The traditional 
  root cellar is an underground storage space for vegetables and fruits. Where 
  space and lay of the land permit, these cellars are dug into a hill and then 
  lined with brick, stone, or concrete block. Dirt-floored or insulated basement 
  rooms-less picturesque but probably more numerous-are also traditional. </FONT>

  important to remember that cool air absorbs less moisture than warm air. You 
  get a pretty unstable situation in a place that's both cold and very damp. A 
  slight drop in temperature can cause air that, at 34&deg;F, say, has room for 
  a bit more moisture, to suddenly become fully saturated at 32&deg;. When this

  To understand how air can circulate through a root cellar, remember that warm 
  air rises and cool air falls. In a large or tightly enclosed cellar, you'll 
  need both an air intake and an outlet. The intake should be low, and the outlet 
  should be high; ideally, the two should be on opposite sides of the room to 
  best circulate the air. Cool air will enter through the low intake and warm

  Your most important consideration. A good root cellar can both borrow cold and 
  keep cold. You borrow cold by digging into the ground, where the temperature 
  well below frost level remains a fairly constant 52&deg;F or so. This works 
  because the deep-down earth temperature is slow to be affected by ultra-cold 
  surface temperature, so your underground vegetables will have an extra margin 
  of protection. You can borrow cold by letting the night air into the cellar

  If you can maintain temperatures between 32 and 40&deg;F, you have an excellent

  storage of root vegetables and apples, and will keep onions and some of the 
  short-lived storage vegetables like peppers, tomatoes, and eggplant in good 
  shape for a month or so. </FONT> </P>

  In an indoor root cellar, the area close to the ceiling will be a few degrees

  If you prefer an outdoor root cellar, you can either dig into a hill or go straight 
  underground and top the cellar entrance with a bulkhead door, patio, or porch. 
  Most outdoor root cellars are dug into a north-facing hill or are underground 
  on the north (coolest) side of the house. You'll find exceptions to this rule 
  in some of the northern states and Canada, where temperatures plummet well below 
  zero in winter, and stay there. Some of the old-time outdoor root cellars in 
  these areas are built on southern exposures for easier winter access. Once winter

  As we discussed earlier, a space of 8' X 8' should be plenty for the average 
  family. But consider setting up a cooperative root cellar, with maintenance 
  tasks shared by several families. Building the cellar could be a joint effort, 
  too. Or one owner could accept produce and charge a small rent or accept barters.

  Darkness: An electric light is a big help when you go to plunder your store,
