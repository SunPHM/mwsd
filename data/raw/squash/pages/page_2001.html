</A>They are also known as steam-jacketed kettles because the "kettle"
consists of two bowl-like sections of welded stainless steel with air space
between for circulation of steam to heat the inner "bowl". The food does
not come in to contact with the steam. The steam supply can be direct-connected
or self-generated. Shallow kettles are always full-jacketed, while deep
kettles may be fully or two-thirds jacketed.

</A>Kettles are available in sizes from 10 to 150 gal for stationary types
and from 1 qt to 80 gal for tilt types. They may be table or floor-mounted
on legs, a pedestal or the wall and may be open or fitted with a hinged
cover and a mixing agitator.

<P><A HREF="http://www.udel.edu/cmanning/ntdt325/jpg/smasjk.jpg"><IMG SRC="smasjksm.jpg" HSPACE=8 HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=135 ALIGN=LEFT></A>Sizes
of 12 gal or less are suitable for table mounting and vegetable cookery.
The two common methods of removing the food product are through a tangent
outlet (for straight-flow drain-off of liquids or thin mixtures) or by
tilting and pouring.

<P>Deep kettles, especially tilting, are best for soups, gravies, sauces
(e.g. spaghetti sauce), puddings and pie fillings as the quality of these
food products is not adversely affected by the large mass and stirring.
Pasta and beans and lentils can be cooked in deep kettles. Shallow kettles
are suitable for braising meats, corned beef, and stews.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Safety Features</B>
<BR>All kettles should have a steam outlet safety valve to release excess
steam and pressure gauge to monitor steam pressure. Controlling the degree
of tilt on tilt kettles and preventing splash of hot liquid in draining
stationary kettles are other safety considerations. Drain boxes are available
for controlling splash .

<P>&nbsp;<B>Cleaning</B> (after each use)

</A>Food is cooked by direct contact with steam in the cooking chamber.
Steam enters the chamber or compartment at 5 to 8 pounds per square inch
(psi) or 15 psi (high pressure) and may be direct-connected or self-generated.
Some cookers use convection generators to produce steam without pressure
so that doors may be safely opened any time during cooking. The appropriate
steam temperature is 212 degrees F.

<P><B>Features</B>
<BR><A HREF="http://www.udel.edu/cmanning/ntdt325/jpg/stempres.jpg"><IMG SRC="stempressm.jpg" HSPACE=8 HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=135 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>
Cabinets are available with 1 to 4 compartments and adjustable shelves
(1 to 3 per compartment). High pressure steamers usually have a smaller
capacity of 1 to 2 counter pans as they cook the food faster. A drain in
the bottom of the compartment removes condensate. Preheating ensures shorter
cooking time, and some models have a thermostat that adjusts to size of
compartment load and original product temperature. Steamers are especially
good for dense root products such as potatoes and carrots as well as fragile
vegetables (broccoli and asparagus), rice, shrimp, and eggs in the shell.
Covering food increases the cooking time.

<P><B>Safety features</B>
<BR>Cabinets should have timers and automatic shut-off, and safety throttle
valve for each compartment so doors cannot be opened until steam pressure
is reduced. Heavy duty door gaskets prevent steam leaks. Four compartment
steamers usually have inconvenient top and bottom compartments. Pan sizes
should be suitable for workers to lift.

<A NAME="Ovens"></A>Ovens</H3>
Heated, insulated boxes or ovens are of two design types:
<BR>still-air radiation - heated air circulates around outside of heating
chamber and radiates through a lining convection - heated air is forced
over and around food racks by fan in rear of oven.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Features</B>
<BR>The most common oven is the conventional roasting and baking oven which
may be single as in a range or stacked as two, three or four decks high.
Deck ovens save space, but it is best to limit stacking to two ovens. Two
decks will not be too high or too low and thus decrease the risk for burned
arms. Common products prepared in ovens are bacon, sausage, fish, oven-fried
or roasted chicken; roasted turkey, beef, pork; casseroles, macaroni &amp;
cheese; baked and scalloped potatoes, winter squash; meringues, pies, cakes,
cookies, breads and rolls, bread pudding and custard.

<P><A HREF="http://www.udel.edu/cmanning/ntdt325/jpg/convec.jpg"><IMG SRC="convecsm.jpg" HSPACE=8 HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=135 ALIGN=LEFT></A><A HREF="http://www.udel.edu/cmanning/ntdt325/jpg/convec.jpg">
</A>In convection ovens time and temperature must be adjusted to achieve
a quality product. Generally, lower temperatures (25 degrees F to 75 degrees
F lower) and shorter times (1/3 to 3/4 of conventional oven time) are used.
Overloading is the biggest problem in convection ovens.
<BR>There are also several types of combination ovens:
<UL>
<LI>
convection and pressureless steamer</LI>

<LI>
microwave and convection</LI>

<LI>
light and infrared energy</LI>
</UL>
The convection/steamer combination allows roasting, broiling and baking
to produce a juicier product with less shrinkage and can reheat items quickly
without drying. The recommended steaming temperature is 185 degrees F.

<P>&nbsp;<B>Safety Features</B>
<BR>Ovens should have tables or racks in front for ease of loading and
unloading. Door handle should be of a material that absorbs little heat
and be offset far enough from the door to keep it below the burn temperature
of 125 degrees F.

<P>&nbsp;In convection ovens the fan should automatically stop whenever
the oven door is opened.

<A HREF="http://www.udel.edu/cmanning/ntdt325/jpg/gridle.jpg"><IMG SRC="gridlesm.jpg" HSPACE=8  ALIGN=LEFT></A>A
flat metal plate, made of iron, steel or aluminum, transfers heat to food
for cooking. Fat may or may not be added. Heat transfer occurs by convection
and conduction. Much of the heat generated is wasted i.e. absorbed by the
plate and never used or lost where surface is empty of food.

<P><B>Features</B>
<BR>A chromium steel surface makes the steel surface less porous; this
decreases cooking time, allows easy release of product and easy cleaning.
Carmelization on the surface occurs with a steel plate which interferes
with heat transfer and makes cleaning more difficult.

<P>&nbsp;Shallow grease gutters or deep troughs may be located on the front
and/or back and/or sides and drain into removable grease receptacles and
collect food debris. Some griddles have a fence on two or three sides so
more griddle surface is used for cooking and to act as a spatter guard.

<P>&nbsp;Typical foods prepared using a griddle are: breakfast items -
bacon, fried &amp; scrambled eggs, French toast, pancakes, sausage patties
&amp; links, potatoes; lunch items - minute steaks, hamburger, cheese sandwich,
frankfurters.

<P>&nbsp;Tempering is the filling of the griddle plate pores with grease.
The griddle surface is heated to 400 degrees F and the coated with cooking
oil. After baking for 5 minutes, this oil residue is wiped off. Teflon
and chromium surface griddles do not have to be tempered.

Conventional, pressure and convection fryers cook food by immersion in
heated fat, controlled by a thermostat. Frying times and temperatures varying
with the food material and make and size of fryer. Instant recovery fryers
tend to cook foods at lower temperatures (25 degrees lower, i.e. range
of 325 and 350 degrees F) and in a shorter time than conventional fryers.

<P>Foods commonly prepared in deep fat fryers are: potatoes, breaded onion
rings, shrimp, fish, chicken &amp; cheese; breaded cauliflower, okra, &amp;
zucchini;

<P>&nbsp;<B>Safety</B>
<BR>The control and display system must be easy to see and adjust. If the
fryer bursts into flames, workers should have access to a switch for the
fryer heat source for easy shut-off without risk.

Although many variations exist (such as the mixer steam jacketed kettle,
mixer pressure cooker and vertical cutter-mixer), the overhead motor vertical
mixer is the most common type used in foodservice operations.

<P><B>Features</B>
<BR>Many sizes are available (5 -140 qt with most common being 20, 30,
40, 60 and 80 qt); up to 20 qt models are for use on tables or counters
and larger mixers are set on the floor.

<P>&nbsp;Two feet on the table or floor support the vertical shaft which
in turn supports the housing of the motor, gearing and rotating mechanism.
Attached to the shaft is a sliding yolk which holds the mixing bowl over
the feet. A lever, wheel or motor raises (and lowers)the yolk and the mixing
bowl around the mixing beater. Large and heavy mixing bowls are lowered
on to a special wheeled dolly or cart.

<P>&nbsp;Usually there are 3 or 4 speed levels, and the action of the agitator
and beater are designed for thorough blending and mixing.

<P>&nbsp;Bowls are of tinned steel or stainless steel with stainless steel
being recommended durability. Supporting elements are cast iron or steel
and finished in aluminum or stainless steel.

<P>&nbsp;
<DL>
<DT>
Commonly used accessories include:</DT>

<DD>
flat beater - medium consistency foods for mixing, creaming and mashing;
e.g. cake batters and icings, griddle cakes, corn bread, and mashed cooked
vegetables; medium speed</DD>

<DD>
wire whip - light ingredients to incorporate air; e.g. whole eggs, egg
whites and frostings; high speed</DD>

<DD>
dough arm or hook - heavy ingredients; e.g. bread doughs; low speed</DD>
</DL>
These accessories are made of cast aluminum or tinned or chromed steel.
