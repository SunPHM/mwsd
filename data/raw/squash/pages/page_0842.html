Dartmouth College - had built a squash court building in North American court sizes. After many injuries the American colleges began to use the European size of court and rules allowing softer squash balls, larger courts allowing easier reaction times on rebounds. We removed the original courts and design/built new courts of the proper size. Following this project we renovated the Leverone fieldhouse originally designed by Pier Luigi Nervi. The renovations dealt with surface changes in track and field as well as tennis. We also designed a 60' x 200' addition on the end of the building which has not yet been constructed. Further to this we designed and installed a new outdoor track of 8 lanes by 400 meters.
