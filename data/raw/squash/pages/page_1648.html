			<TD><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Real Tennis as it is called in Britain,
			Royal Tennis as it is called in Australia, Court Tennis as it is called
			in the States, Jeu de Paume as it is called in France or Tennis as it is
			properly known, is the oldest of all the racket games, and unlike most
			of the others, such as squash or lawn tennis, it is a product of evolution
			rather than pure invention.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><IMG SRC="graphics/court1.jpg" ALT="engraving of a French court" HEIGHT=178 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
			game started to form into something recognisable in the 11th century. It
			started as hand ball, played by monks around the cloisters of monasteries
			in Italy and France, much as schoolchildren do in any appropriate corner
			of their school, and rules varied to suit local whims and conditions. Gradually,
			as monks travelled to other monasteries, the more enjoyable rules were
			more generally adopted, the more bizarre rules abandoned and people started
			to add features to their courtyards that improved the pastime, and demolish
			or modify others that detracted from it. The monks enjoyed the game so
			much that the Pope banned the playing of it, and by the 14th century the
			game had spread from cloister to castle and become a game of the nobility.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are, of course, many other theories
			on the history of tennis. Roger Morgan's book '<I>Tennis, The developement
			of the European ball game</I>' is another source of infomation and conflicts
			with the above theories. The forward, written by H.R.H. Prince Edward,
			himself a keen Real Tennis player, says <I>"Many myths and inaccuracies
			are dispelled; chief among these that tennis owes its origins to the monateries
			of France"</I>. Morgan also says that the origins were from a ball game
			played in the streets during the Middle Ages, which is a nice idea, but
			as the streets were also used as sewers, I don't think it would have been
			much fun, so I shall stick to the more romantic 'monasteries' theory for
			the time being. Perhaps in the future I shall devote some space to the
			various other conflicting theories.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>Fortunately, I have just received a
			copy of "<A HREF="javascript:smallwindow('../archive/history/origins.html')" style="text-decoration:none">THE
			TRUE ORIGINS OF ROYAL TENNIS</A>" from a correspondent in Australia. I
			would urge you to read this in order to reach a decision on the subject.
			AUG DE JONG also has a very interesting account of <A HREF="http://www.hvision.nl/~dejonga5/E/Tennisnl/tenhis.html" style="text-decoration:none" target="_top" onMouseOver="self.status='The History of Tennis in the Netherlands'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='The History of Real Tennis'; return true">The
			History of tennis in the Netherlands</A>, which is certainly worth reading.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Equipment - Originally the game
			was played with the bare hand, later with a glove, then someone had the
			bright idea of attaching cord or tendons to the fingers. It was a short
			step to attaching these cords to a frame and adding a handle to form a
			racket. Today Grays of Cambridge are the only Real Tennis racket makers.
			The ball although similar in appearance to a lawn tennis ball is made with
			a core of cork, covered in cloth, tightly bound in string and covered in
			felt. The balls are all hand stitched and last for about 2 weeks. This
			method has been used throughout history, although other substances such
			as hair or wool were used for the centre, and the balls were a good deal
			lighter (1oz as opposed to nearly 3oz), before the advent of the racket.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The modern version of the game is virtually
			indistinguishable from the 16th century version, indeed the actual court
			that Charles I built at Hampton Court in 1625, is still used for championship
			play today. Visitors to Hampton Court Palace can view the Real Tennis court.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><IMG SRC="graphics/vers.jpg" ALT="The Court at Versailles" HEIGHT=217 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
			16th and 17th centuries were a golden age for Real Tennis, it was played
			by the nobility throughout England and France. There were reputably as
			many as 1800 courts in Paris during the game's heyday, although many of
			these were probably quite rough structures. It is even recorded that a
			court was built on a 2,000 ton French ship in the 16th century. The court
			at Versailles was built in 1686 at a cost of 45,403 Francs. By the 1700's
			the game had began to decline. Almost 100 years later, The ‘Serment du
			Jeu de paulme’ (oath of the Real Tennis court) was signed in the Real Tennis
			court at Versailles on the 20th June 1789. The court at Versailles is now
			a museum (see image). 11 months earlier on 21st July 1788, in Vizille castle’s
			"real tennis" room, the assembly of the three orders of the Dauphin&eacute;
			held the meeting that gave birth to the revolutionary process, It contains
			today the museum of the French Revolution. By 1800, partly due to the Revolution
			the game in France was practically non existent.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In England in the Tudor and Stuart
			periods tennis flourished, Henry VII loved the game and his successor Henry
			VIII was an accomplished player and had the original court at Hampton Court
			Palace built. Sadly he was an addicted gambler and many of his financial
			problems were due to his massive wagers on the Real Tennis court. James
			I lost his life due to Real Tennis, as he tried to evade his assassins
			by hiding down the drains his path was blocked by Real Tennis balls! Charles
			I and Charles II both enjoyed the game and tennis thrived during this period,
			apart from some awkwardness between their reigns. Like France, the 18th
			century saw a decline in the game of Real Tennis, although some courts
			were built in this period. An example of this was the court built in Bath
			in 1777. Sadly this court was used for only 37 years, but the building
			still survives as the Bath Industrial Heritage Centre.</FONT></FONT>

			<P><A HREF="javascript:smallwindow('../archive/history/hj.html')"><IMG SRC="graphics/henry.jpg" HEIGHT=225 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=LEFT></A><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=-1>In
			the mid 19th century there was a revival of the game and a flurry of court
			construction, primarily as additions to estates, most of the courts in
			use today are products of this period. The first courts in the USA and
			Australia were built in 1876 and 1882 respectively. The first World War
			cast a deep shadow over the game from which it has only just began to emerge.
			The current state of play is : Australia - 4 active courts (with new courts
			planned), France - 3, the UK 19, (new courts have recently been built at
			The Oratory School and the Harbour Club in London, refurbished in Newmarket
			and further courts planned for Clifton and Bridport ) and the USA - 9 (with
			further courts being planned). The Dutch Real Tennis Association have hopes
			to build a Real Tennis court in The Hague. Even the Russians have plans
			to restore the Real Tennis court in St. Petersburg. Apparently the court,
			which was built around the 1790's, is now a gym. There are a small group
			of devotees keen to get the court going again, including Prince Nicholas
			Galitzine (I didn't know that there were any Russian prince's left). Judging
			by the amount of email from different parts of the world (including Moscow!
			but not St.P) that I have received already from this site, I would suspect
			that Real Tennis really is growing in popularity.</FONT></FONT>
