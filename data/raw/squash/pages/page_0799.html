            <p align="center" class="greenLargeBold">ABBREVIATED RULES OF SQUASH<br>
              based on the 2001 rules, effective 30-Apr 2001</p>
            <p >This abbreviated version of the World Singles Squash Rules is 
              to help players to understand the basics. All players should read 
              the complete Rules. The Rule numbers in brackets in each heading 
              refer to the full Rules.</p>
            <p class="blueBold" >THE SCORING (Rule 2)</p>
            <p >A match is the best of five games. Each game is to nine points, 
              unless the score reaches eight-all. At eight-all the receiver (non-server) 
              has to choose to play either to nine points (known as &quot;Set 
              One&quot;) or to ten points (known as &quot;Set Two&quot;). (There 
              is no requirement that a player needs to be two points ahead to 
              win a game).</p>
            <p >Points are scored only by the server. When the server wins a rally 
              he or she scores a point; when the receiver wins a rally he or she 
              becomes the server.</p>
            <p class="blueBold" >THE WARM-UP (Rule 3)</p>
            <p >Before the start of a match, the two players are allowed up to 
              5 minutes (2&frac12; minutes on each side) to &quot;warm-up&quot; 
              themselves and the ball on the match court.</p>
            <p >When a ball has been changed during a match, or if the match has 
              been resumed after some delay, the players warm-up the ball to playing 
              condition.</p>
            <p >The ball may be warmed up by either player during any interval 
              in the match.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >THE SERVICE (Rule 4)</p>
            <p >Play commences with a service. The player to serve first is decided 
              by the spin of a racket. Thereafter, the server continues serving 
              until losing a rally, when the opponent becomes the server and the 
              server becomes &quot;hand out&quot;.</p>
            <p >The player who wins the preceding game serves first in the next 
              game.</p>
            <p >At the beginning of each game and when the service changes from 
              one player to the other, the server can serve from either service 
              box. After winning a rally the server then continues serving from 
              the alternate box.</p>
            <p >To serve a player stands with at least part of one foot on the 
              floor within the service box. For a service to be good, it is served 
              directly onto the front wall above the service line and below the 
              out line so that on its return, unless volleyed, it reaches the 
              floor within the back quarter of the court opposite to the server's 
              box.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >GOOD RETURN (Rule 6)</p>
            <p >A return is good if the ball, before it has bounced twice on the 
              floor, is returned correctly by the striker onto the front wall 
              above the tin and below the out line, without first touching the 
              floor. The ball may hit the side walls and/or the back wall before 
              reaching the front wall.</p>
            <p >A return is not good if it is &quot;NOT UP&quot; (ball struck 
              after bouncing more than once on the floor, or not struck correctly, 
              or a double hit); &quot;DOWN&quot; (the ball after being struck, 
              hits the floor before the front wall or hits the tin) or &quot;OUT&quot; 
              (the ball hits a wall on or above the out line).</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >RALLIES (Rule 8)</p>
            <p >After a good service has been delivered the players hit the ball 
              in turn until one fails to make a good return.</p>
            <p >A rally consists of a service and a number of good returns. A 
              player wins a rally if the opponent fails to make a good service 
              or return of the ball or if, before the player has attempted to 
              hit the ball, it touches the opponent (including racket or clothing) 
              when the opponent is the non-striker.</p>
            <p >NOTE: AT ANY TIME DURING A RALLY A PLAYER SHOULD NOT STRIKE THE 
              BALL IF THERE IS A DANGER OF HITTING THE OPPONENT WITH THE BALL 
              OR RACKET. IN SUCH CASES PLAY STOPS AND THE RALLY IS EITHER PLAYED 
              AGAIN (&quot;A LET&quot;) OR THE OPPONENT IS PENALISED.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >HITTING AN OPPONENT WITH THE BALL (Rule 9)</p>
            <p >If a player strikes the ball, which, before reaching the front 
              wall, hits the opponent, or the opponent&#146;s racket or clothing, 
              play stops.</p>
            <p >If the return would have been good and the ball would have struck 
              the front wall without first touching any other wall, the striker 
              wins the rally, provided the striker did not &quot;turn&quot;.</p>
            <p >If the ball either had struck, or would have struck, any other 
              wall and the return would have been good, a let is played.</p>
            <p >If the return would not have been good, the striker loses the 
              rally.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >TURNING (Rule 9)</p>
            <p >If the striker has either followed the ball round, or allowed 
              it to pass around him or her - in either case striking the ball 
              to the right of the body after the ball had passed to the left (or 
              vice-versa) - then the striker has &quot;TURNED&quot;.</p>
            <p >If the opponent is struck by the ball after the striker has turned, 
              the rally is awarded to the opponent.</p>
            <p >If the striker, while turning, stops play for fear of striking 
              the opponent, then a let is played. This is the recommended course 
              of action in situations where a player wants to turn but is unsure 
              of the opponent&#146;s position.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >FURTHER ATTEMPTS (Rule 10)</p>
            <p >A player, after attempting to strike the ball and missing, may 
              make a further attempt to return the ball.</p>
            <p >If a further attempt would have resulted in a good return, but 
              the ball hits the opponent, a let is played.</p>
            <p >If the return would not have been good, the striker loses the 
              rally.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >INTERFERENCE (Rule 12)</p>
            <p >When it is his or her turn to play the ball, a player is entitled 
              to freedom from interference by the opponent.<img src="/rules/rule_pic.jpg" width="251" height="277" vspace="10" hspace+"10" align="right" hspace="12"></p>
            <p >To avoid interference, the opponent must try to provide the player 
              with unobstructed direct access to the ball, a fair view of the 
              ball, space to complete a swing at the ball and freedom to play 
              the ball directly to any part of the front wall.</p>
            <p >A player, finding the opponent interfering with the play, can 
              accept the interference and play on, or stop play. It is preferable 
              to stop play if there is a possibility of colliding with the opponent, 
              or of hitting him or her with racket or ball.</p>
            <p >When play has stopped as a result of interference the general 
              guidelines are:</p>
            <p >The player is entitled to a let if he or she could have returned 
              the ball and the opponent has made every effort to avoid the interference.</p>
            <p >The player is not entitled to a let (i.e. loses the rally) if 
              he or she could not have returned the ball, or accepts the interference 
              and plays on, or the interference was so minimal that the player&#146;s 
              access to and strike at the ball was not affected.</p>
            <p >The player is entitled to a stroke (i.e. wins the rally) if the 
              opponent did not make every effort to avoid the interference, or 
              if the player would have hit a winning return, or if the player 
              would have struck the opponent with the ball going directly to the 
              front wall.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >LETS (Rule 13)</p>
            <p >A let is an undecided rally. The rally does not count and the 
              server serves again from the same box.</p>
            <p >In addition to lets allowed as indicated in the paragraphs above, 
              lets can be allowed in other circumstances. For example, a let may 
              be allowed if the ball in play touches any article lying on the 
              floor, or if the striker refrains from hitting the ball owing to 
              a reasonable fear of injuring the opponent.</p>
            <p >A let must be allowed if the receiver is not ready and does not 
              attempt to return the service, or if the ball breaks during play.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >CONTINUITY OF PLAY (Rule 7)</p>
            <p >Play is expected to be continuous in each game once a player has 
              started serving. There should be no delay between the end of one 
              rally and the start of the next one.</p>
            <p >In between all games an interval of 90 seconds is permitted.</p>
            <p >Players are permitted to change items of clothing or equipment 
              if necessary.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >BLEEDING, INJURY AND ILLNESS (Rule 16)</p>
            <p >If an injury occurs which involves bleeding, the bleeding must 
              be stopped before the player can continue. A player is allowed a 
              reasonable time to attend to a bleeding wound.</p>
            <p >If the bleeding was caused solely by the opponent&#146;s action, 
              the injured player wins the match.</p>
            <p >If the bleeding recurs no further delay is allowed, except that 
              the player can concede a game, using the 90 second period between 
              games to attend to the wound and stop the bleeding. If unable to 
              stop it, the player must concede the match.</p>
            <p >For an injury not involving bleeding, it must be decided whether 
              the injury was either caused by the opponent or self inflicted or 
              contributed to by both players.</p>
            <p >If caused by the opponent, the injured player wins the match if 
              any recovery time is needed.</p>
            <p >If self-inflicted, the injured player is allowed 3 minutes to 
              recover and must then play on, or concede a game using the 90 second 
              rest period between games to recover.</p>
            <p >If contributed by both players, the injured player is allowed 
              an hour to recover.</p>
            <p >A player who is ill must play on or can take a rest period by 
              conceding a game and using the 90 second interval to recover. Cramps, 
              feeling sick and breathlessness (including asthma) are considered 
              illnesses. If a player vomits on court, the opponent wins the match.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >DUTIES OF PLAYERS (Rule 15)</p>
            <p >Rule 15 provides guidelines for players. For example 15.6 states 
              that deliberate distraction is not allowed. Players should read 
              this rule in full.</p>
            <p >Some of the 8 sub-sections deal with situations related to matches 
              under the control of officials (Referee/Marker). The use of officials 
              is not covered in this abbreviated version.</p>
            <p align="left"> </p>
            <p class="blueBold" >CONDUCT ON COURT (Rule 17)</p>
            <p >Offensive, disruptive or intimidating behaviour in squash is not 
              acceptable.</p>
            <p >Included in this category are: audible and visible obscenities, 
              verbal and physical abuse, dissent, abuse of racket, court or ball, 
              unnecessary physical contact, excessive racket swing, unfair warm-up, 
              time-wasting, late back on court, deliberate or dangerous play or 
              action and coaching (except between games).</p>
