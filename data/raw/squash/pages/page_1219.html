<p>

<p>Rain threatened, and they'd been curing in the garden long enough, so I brought the winter squash harvest inside. There were a few more, but we ate one of the pumpkins at the Harvest Festival and gave away a couple more squash.</p>

<p>The large pumpkins are the French Silk variety, an excellent baking pumpkin. As one might expect from a French vegetable, they are a very practical winter squash, with a small interior cavity and lots of flesh. Not at all good for jack o' lanterns. The small pumpkins are sugar pumpkins, a wonderfully sweet squash that needs nothing but a bit of butter to be a savory side dish. And then there's the butternut squash. These, as you can tell from the faint green striipes, may not have fully ripened--it was a cool summer. But with the addition of a little brown sugar, they'll cook up fine if that's the case.</p>

<p>This weekend I'll wash them all with a dilute (1:10) solution of household bleach to kill any mold spores or bacteria that might cause rot, and then they go into the library shed, which is dark and humidity-controlled. They will last well into next summer--well, not really, since we'll have eaten them long before then. </p>

To the left is the cornfield (interplanted with beans and pumpkins), in the background the vineyard (and behind it, in the alley plot, the melon patch), and to the right the orchard.

<p>

<p>Here at the Redwood Dragon Farm &amp; Vineyard, we're in the season where we don't buy much fruit or vegetables from the market, for the harvest is pouring in from the garden. Sweet corn, horto beans, 9 varieties of heirloom tomato (including the amazing Mortgage Lifter, which is very much like the <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/hgtv/gl_plants_vegetables/article/0,1785,HGTV_3615_2014677,00.html">Uglyripe</a>), 3 varieties of summer squash, two kinds of eggplant (the standard black, and a neon pink variety), burpless and lemon cucumbers, buttercrunch lettuce, <a href="http://landscaping.about.com/cs/weedsdiseases/a/purslane.htm">purslane</a>  (a common weed here that adds a pleasant peppery note to salads and can also be sauteed), lemon thyme, basil, chives, Comice and Monterey pears (we had some poached in their own syrup on Saturday--pears are indeed the "queen of fruits"), two kinds of apples, wild blackberries, and 3 varieties of melon, including the amazingly tasty Charentais, with overones of caramel. Also lots of pumpkins and butternet squash for the winter and next year. (Tonight, in fact, we ate the last of the winter squash from last year.) And, next spring, we have asparagus (purple and green) to look forward to. Very satisfying.</p>

<p>Next year we're going to try to organize the neighborhood into a cooperative garden of sorts, making sure that no one duplicates varieties so we get an even larger selection of produce. But it's amazing what a difference just 1000 square feet can make in our food budget at this time of year!</p>

<p>

<p>After our <a href="http://www.davetrowbridge.com/MT/archives/week_2005_07_31.html#001425">encounter with the skunk</a> the other night I had a pest control expert, Paul, from Hines Pest Control, come out and spent about an hour learning all I could about skunks, moles, and gophers. Interesting stuff, and oh, what a panoply of death-dealing technologies he had, including some mole bait that looks just like gummy worms (expensive, and in my case unnecessary).</p>

<p>We apparently have one or more skunks living under the house, and this weekend I'll be busy putting in 1" &#215; 2" screening to keep them out. Of course, I may end up trapping them inside, but leaving a cracked hard-boiled egg under the house where I can easily see it from outside will detect them, and the pest guy will come back and build a little one-way hatch to let them out.</p>

<p>Paul told me that if it weren't for their smell (and, I'd add, the rabies that is endemic among wild skunks), they'd be good predators to have around, being very efficient mousers, and also capable of catching gophers and even moles. But with Oka around, I can't afford to take a chance, and anyway, skunks are social animals, so if I don't put a stop to this, I could easily end up with 6-8 females living under the house pumping out 6-16 kits a year. But I think I'm going to try leaving the garden accessible to them--a few tomatoes here and there is not too high a price to pay for rodent and mole control. </p>

<p>He sold me a couple of horrifying scissor traps for moles, which take quite a bit of strength to set, but are easier to position than cinch or loop traps. I thought, from the amount of damage done in the garden, that I must have a dozen moles or so, but in reality, I probably only had one or two, and one of them is dead now. A mole's range is about 2800 square feet, and they do not share territory, although there may be overlap. So I should be able to take care of my mole problem in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Gophers have an even smaller range: about 1000 square feet. I don't think I have any gophers: since I planted everything in wire root baskets, there's nothing for them to eat.</p>

<p>Finally, the damage I had blamed on squirrels was in actuality skunks: conical holes everywhere where they had dug for grubs. Apparently tree squirrels are not much of a garden pest, especially in places, like our yard, where there is a sufficiency of acorns. So I've declared a truce in that particular war.</p>

<p>I did my first mushroom identification today: Pluteus cervinus, the deer mushroom. (It could also be Pluteus magnus, but lacking a microscope, I cannot tell; both are edible.)  I found it in the disturbed soil in my garden a week after the first mowing of the cover crop; it was nourished by the wood chips that are part of my soil mix.</p>

<p>For identification I used perhaps the finest field mycology guide ever written, especially if you live on the West Coast: <i>Mushrooms Demystified</i>, by David Arora. Highly recommended!</p>

<p>Very interesting! Mycology has always been on my wistful wish-list as somethng I would like to learn. Perhaps because my first exposure to SF concerned the unforgettable  Mushroom Planet!</p>

<p>I recently learned that in Italy all Pharmacists are trained to identify mushrooms, and the many hunters there can take their finds to the drugstore to make sure they don't have something poisonous...</p>

<p>You can't do better than to start with Arora's book. It starts with a description of the various parts of a mushroom, and then gives you a series of dichotomous keys that lead you quickly to an identification of any given mushroom. It took me only a minute or so to identify the deer mushroom.</p>

<p>I had heard about Italian pharmacists. Some people divide cultures into two kinds: mushroom-loving and mushroom-hating. The British are the former (hence the word toadstool), the French and Italians the latter. Americans, I think, tend to follow their British heritage.</p>

<p>I just ordered Arora's hip-pocket guide, figuring I'll be more likely to actually use it and take it on camping trips. </p>

<p>"Ayup. That's a fine crop a' manure ye've got there, Farmer Dave."</p>

<p>Not yet, but it's in the ground, now. This weekend I finally got my cover crop planted: Green Manure Mix from General Feed &amp; Seed down in Santa Cruz. It consists of Bell beans, hairy vetch, white clover, and oats. Sowing it requires creating a slurry of the seeds with Rhizobia (nitrogen-fixing bacteria) inoculant. If one mulches and/or tills it in at the flowering stage, it adds the maximum amount of nitrogen to the soil; later mulching adds more organic material (carbon). Such a crop also promotes beneficial insects, and I intend to leave some of it in odd corners here and there, and sow some additional clover, as well.</p>

<p>Here's what the vineyard and upper garden looked like around 2 PM this afternoon; yesterday I rototilled both areas.</p>

<p>Loving the garden updates, Dave. Wishing I had one of my very own, though have been making do around the rental property (heavy trimming of the lilacs, reclaimed the driveway, begun landscaping both front and back - now waiting for spring). The landlord loves the fact that we work on it, so he's frozen our rent!</p>

<p>With the amount of traveling you do, probably best you don't have your own garden just now. </p>

<p>I have to admit, I didn't remember how much work a garden this size can be, especially in a climate with two growing seasons--gardens don't shut down here in the winter like they do in Boston!</p>

<p>The straw covers the green manure crop I planted: vetch, clover, Bell beans, and oats. It'll be tilled under next spring before I put in the melons. Next year I'll plant a green manure strip down the middle, and keep alternating.</p>

<p>It's unlikely we'll have anything until March, although the kale might be ready sooner. (I already have some red kale in the upper garden, but I need to plow that area so I can plant the green manure crop there as well.) </p>

<p>The vineyard, too, awaits sowing and strawing; I ran out of time. And I still have 24 Old Spice sweetpeas to set out. Those I'll do some morning early in the week.

<p>Today I cleared the cornfield to get ready to rototill and plant a cover crop...assuming I get a few rain-free days to let the ground dry out--not likely for next weekend. It was a nice, fairly aerobic 1.5-hour job with lots of bending and lifting; I wore my pulse monitor and found that I was in the "zone" for over 45 minutes total.</p>

<p>Here's the cornfield (part of the alley behind my property) before clearing</p>

<p>You can perhaps discern the rolled-up plastic deer fencing at the back, ready to be deployed again next spring. You probably can't see the drip irrigation tubing looped up through the wire fence to keep it out of the way of the tiller. The steel fence posts will remain, reinforced by some red reflectors on sticks to help ward off the few motor vehicles that may come that far down the alley (one of the neighbors actually drove over my compost pit to dump some wood behind his property, but we've worked that out).</p>

<p>The corn experiment was quite successful, and, in fact, we grew more than we could eat. There were almost two dozen ears of corn left, most of them rather small, which I'll scatter in the yard in an attempt to lure some squirrels within range of Oka. Think of it as Darwinian improvement of the species. Next year I'll plant a little less (not here: this will be my melon patch, and the corn will be where the tomatoes, potatoes, and melons were this year) and give away more.</p>

<p>

<p>Here's a sample of the melons from my garden this year:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Melons-10-2004web.jpg" /></p>

<p>The straw-colored, sort of warty ones are Prescott Fond Blanc, a 19th century French variety. Rather average muskmelon-flavored orange flesh, but worth growing just for their amazing perfume, which scents the whole house and can be smelled  several paces away in the garden, announcing their ripeness even more emphatically than the change from green to straw-color.</p>

<p>The smooth yellow one is, I believe, a Canary Yellow, a green-flesh honeydew with an ambrosial flavor. I will devote a lot more room to this one next year.</p>

<p>Both plants bore heavily, but are subject to powdery mildew (next year I'll spray prophylactically starting in August or so) and, of course, gophers. The latter will be foiled next year by planting in chicken-wire baskets, since poison, gas, and traps haven't been effective yet.</p>

<p>

<p>I really, really hope the robotics industry gets off its butt soon and starts delivering useful devices for the home and garden. I'd really, really like a robo-ferret (with optional <span class="caps">ADW</span>: Anti-Deer Weaponry).</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'm signatory to the Protocols of Pomona, which, rather than the Geneva Convention, are the rubrics for garden warfare. And the Protocols permit poison gas.</p>

<p>Last week, the Gopher Nation invaded the Redwood Dragon's garden; or, rather, the invasion became obvious as the rodent invaders ate a canteloupe (from underneath, mind you!), as well as severing the stalks of several bean plants. I put out more strychnine bait, but wasn't satisfied, based on past experience, that this would work. Poison bait has turned out to be rather a hit-and-miss proposition. And I do not want them to get established in the vineyard, where the damage will be far more serious than losing a few annual vegetables. (In a sense the garden is a honeypot for gophers, luring them away from the vineyard.)</p>

<p>So, while I was at the hardware store, I bought a garden hose adapter for the tailpipe of my car. The prescription is to run your car exhaust into the burrow for 30 minutes; carbon monoxide poisoning is said to be a painless 5-7 minute process. It's likely less painful than strychnine poisoning, which involves savage convulsions. So, I'm hoping that, sometime between 4:15 and 4:45 PM today all the gophers in my garden died. However, given how vigorous the squash plants are, it's possible that one or more mounds were open, which would have reduced the effectiveness of the <span class="caps">CO.</span> We shall see.</p>

<p>This is a never-ending battle. In irrigated areas like my garden, gophers can have up to three litters (of 5-7 pups each) a year. I'm a little better off than most people, since there's a hard-packed alley at the back of my property, which is somewhat of a barrier for gophers. But there are adits for them elsewhere, so today's work, even if successful, delivers merely respite, not resolution.</p>

<p>You have my sympathies...There's nothing more maddening, especially since they can always rebuild their ranks in the neighbor's garden--neighbors never seem to mind gophers. </p>

<p>Did they really eat a whole canteloupe? Wow.</p>

<p>Never tried it but an old family friend burried fish ( small ones like smelt ) in her garden , to repel rodents like gophers . Worked for her . I know what you mean about the grapes ! Possums were our down fall .<br />

<p>Tonight was an occasion for two gardening firsts.</p>

<p>1) The first harvest of sweet corn. "Sweet" doesn't do it justice. This is the Kandy Corn <i>se</i> hybrid. Straight out of the garden it has a strong vanilla overtone that I doubt you'll ever get out of corn from a store or even a farmers' market, as I'm sure it's due to the sugars that are first to be converted to starch after the ear is picked. We'll be eating this for the next two months or so; I planted three blocks of it two weeks apart.</p>

<p>2) The first salad entirely from our own garden (except for one red tomato Deborah threw in): lettuce, arugula, purslane (which grows as a weed throughout the garden), lemon cucumbers, and three tomato varieties: Lemon Boy, Brown Berry, and Green Grape.</p>

<p>The Horto beans are still going strong, but the Liana beans aren't even blossoming yet. The Pattison de Marbre summer squash (a knobby "patty pan" variety) is bearing prolifically. A variety of melons are on the way, along with tons of Futsu winter squash. I'm letting the Tromboncino ripen all the way to the winter squash form, as it's not very interesting when picked early. These squash are so big that I have to hang them in plastic bags on the trellis to keep them from breaking the vine. Unfortunately it looks like we'll get little or no eggplant this year, as they evidently need to be started in a greenhouse early--they didn't do very well seeded directly.</p>

<p>But, all in all, even though I'm sure these are the most expensive vegetables we've ever eaten, we're enjoying the garden enormously.</p>

<p>Eating what you've grown is sweet indeed. And I bet it's even sweeter to have a family to share the harvest with.</p>

<p>Here in the north the tomatoes are still green.<br />
It's becoming a bet with friends to see if they are ready to turn before first frost.</p>

<span class="title">Sumer Is Icumin In</span>


<p>

<p>Saturday I drove up to UC Davis (3 hours each way) for another installment in their excellent Small Vineyard Management series, this time on "Integrated Pest Management and Cover Crops." In a winegrower's version of the Medical Student Syndrome, I am now convinced that everything in the world is out to eat my 26 vines (well, the 23 that survived--I'll have to replant three soon), and am amazed that anyone ever manages to make wine.</p>

<p>In reality, the only disease that most growers on my scale are ever likely to encounter is powdery mildew, and it is so common that it makes owning a vineyard much like having pets or even children. If you're not registered for commercial pesticides, you pretty much have to use sulfur, which means spraying every 7-14 days for most of the growing season--you can't go away for longer unless you find a vinesitter. </p>

<p>One nice thing, however, is that the powdery mildew that afflicts grapes in specific to them--they can't catch it from your garden vegetables or roses. And there's a fairly simple equation based on daytime temperatures that tells you how likely mildew is: it thrives between 70 and 85 degrees F, but doesn't care about low humidity. (In fact, free water kills the spores.) Unfortunately, that pretty much describes the growing season in Boulder Creek, so once my vines are old enough (the third year), I'll be spraying and stinking up the back yard every week.</p>

<p>In the meantime, although the vineyard isn't presently demanding much of my time, the vegetable onslaught is just beginning. The snap peas are done, but the Horto Beans are bearing well (nice beany flavor when cooked, and good raw in salads, too), the zucchini are doing their usual squash-wave attack (but they're easy to dry and make nice chips), there are lots of lemon cucumbers, and the tomatoes are getting ready to deliver. On deck: yellow patty-pan squash, tromboncino squash, liana beans, and sweet corn. The melons and winter squash are thriving, but harvest is a couple of months out, as is that of the apples and pears. For the latter, however, it's time to hang CDs in the trees to discourage the birds, since the fruit is getting ripe enough to attract their attention.</p>

<p>Oh, and the house is brightened by many vases full of sweet peas, dahlias, daisies, and coreopsis. </p>

<p>All in all, a fairly successful first year in the garden.</p>

<p>Glad you asked. Here are the fruits and vegetables I'm growing, assuming the jays and squirrels let me. Unless otherwise noted, the pictures are from the catalog from which I got the seed or plant.</p>


<ul>
<li>Apples (two varieties)
<ul>
<li>Golden Delicious</li>
<li>Red-Striped Golden Delicious</li>
<li>Not my choices, since I like more tangy apples, but the mature trees came with the property. Won't bear much this year due to heavy pruning to reshape trees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Asparagus
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cooksgarden.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10201&amp;catalogId=10067&amp;langId=-1&amp;mainPage=prod2working&amp;ItemId=50176&amp;FromTextSearch=asparagu" target=new>Purple Passion</a>
<ul>
<li>Just like regular asparagus, except the spears are purple. Unfortunately, they turn dull green when cooked. Will take at least a year to become established.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beans. Two varieties.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vermontbean.com/vbsite/vbsiteviewproduct.aspx?ProductID=7001" target=new>Horto</a> (Tongues of Fire)
<ul>
<li>Edible as snap, shell, and dry beans. "Pods are flat and a lovely pale green with reddish-purple streaks with an unusual beany flavor."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vermontbean.com/vbsite/vbsiteviewproduct.aspx?ProductID=7022" target=new>Liana</a>
<ul>
<li>An Asian bean whose pods grow up to three feet long. Harvested as snap beans; good for stir-fry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corn
<ul>
<li>Kandy King Hybrid sweet corn 
<ul>
<li>Specially-bred, very sweet corn that keeps its sweetness for up to two weeks after harvest, due to a gene that slows down the conversion of sugar to starch. Must be isolated from other corn varieties to prevent cross pollination. (Vermont Bean Seed Company)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cucumber
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.organicseed.com/order/product/38/" target=new>Lemon cucumber</a>
<ul>
<li>Just what it sounds like: small, lemon yellow cucumbers. Mild flavor. I'm growing it on a trellis to conserve space, since each plant will sprawl to 25 square feet. I bought them as seedlings at the local nursery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eggplant. Two varieties.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rareseeds.com/catlisting.php?dbswitch=&amp;cat=16&amp;subcat=24" target=new>Thai pea eggplant</a> (scroll to bottom for picture)

<li>Small, thick-rind, fairly sour. Came with the property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Herbs
<ul>
<li>Various varieties of sage, mint, and scented germanium that came with the property. Also lavender. I'll probably add basil soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Melon
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rareseeds.com/catlisting.php?dbswitch=&amp;cat=31&amp;subcat=52" target=new>Prescott Fond Blanc</a> (also French)

<ul>
<li>"large pear with a very juicy, melting flesh"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monterey
<ul>
<li>That's what the former owner called them, but I can't find any such variety listed. Very large, utterly delicious pears with a hard, somewhat grainy flesh. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These mature trees came with the property. Will bear heavily this year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Potato
<ul>
<li>Russian Fingerling
<ul>
<li>Small, finger-size yellow potatoes </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I grow potatoes inside stacks of old tires, adding tires and filling them with mulch as the shoots push upwards. To harvest, just lift the tires away and spread the mulch with your hands to reveal the potatoes: no digging!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Raspberries
<ul>
<li>Thornless, two-crop variety. Came with the property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Radishes

<ul>
<li>Mix of cherry-red, white, plum, and rose pink. Planted with carrots to distinguish row.</li>

<ul>
<li>"Long, slender 15" fruit have a flat bulb at the bottom." I'm growing them on a trellis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rareseeds.com/catlisting.php?dbswitch=&amp;cat=50&amp;subcat=80" target=new>Pattisons Golden Marbre Scallop</a> (French)
<ul>
<li>"A rare golden French heirloom scallop type, fruit is a beautiful bright golden orange marble, very tender and with excellent flavor! Can be used as a summer squash or let ripen and they make good winter squash." Bush type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Squash (winter)
<ul>
<li>Muscat de Provence, or Courge d'Or, as it's called in Lyon, where Deborah first saw it.
<ul>
<li>"Flattened 5-10 lb. fruits have a smooth orange terracotta finish, deep ridges that radiate from the stem, and sweet flesh." </li>

<p>Those tomato names are pure poetry. "Lemon Boy." "Mortgage Lifter!"</p>

<p>And the eggplant "Little Purple Tiger." I want to taste that one! </p>
<p>Posted by <a href="http://www.randomjottings.net/" rel="nofollow">John Weidner</a> at May 20, 2004 12:00 PM</p><br /><br />
<p>The story behind "Mortgage Lifter," probably apocryphal, is that a man facing eviction had this variety show up in his garden and it produced so many big tomatoes that he was able to make his mortgage payments. </p>

<p>The guy in Boulder Creek from whom I got these (via the church plant sale) reputedly has 160 different varieties growing in his garden.</p>

<p>So. Did you quit your day job? How much bigger is this garden than your previous "biggest"? I went ape-crazy the first year we moved to the country ('81)--put in 52 tomato plants (and equally over the top with other veggies as well). </p>

<p>My wife swore she'd leave me if I ever produced produce to that extreme ever again. I won't. Besides, I don't think my joints would be happy with that much work below knee level. Good luck with yours and we'll be wanting pictures, vicarious new-variety-lusters as we are. </p>

<p>This is by far the biggest garden I've ever attempted, Fred, even without the vineyard. It may have been overkill--I seem to have little time for anything else on the weekends. However, with a drip system, weeding should be minimal, so things should slow down during the summer after everything is planted and established.</p>

<p>52 tomato plants are a farm, not a garden. Your neighbors must have run screaming when they saw you coming!</p>

<p>If you're a rose lover, that's likely to be your reaction anywhere within half a block or so of our house, for our Cecil Bruner rosebush is in full blossom.</p>

<p><img src="/images/CecilBruner1.jpg" alt="rosebush"></p>

<p>You actually can smell it quite a ways up and down the street, for what's shown in the picture is only a small part of the bush. It's several decades old, and has climbed forty feet up into an oak tree behind the house. There must be several thousand blossoms on it; so many, in fact, that I was worried it would collapse under its own weight. When it's finished blooming, I'll be trying to figure out how to build an arbor under the portion not supported by the oak, which may actually increase the number of blossoms, since its weight pulled the lower portion shown behind the house and out of the sun. </p>

<p>Next year should be even more intense, since I planted another ten old roses, five of them, Madame du Carriere, against the house. That variety grows 20 feet and up. And as time goes on, I'll put more old roses in, both traditional and musk. A garden should be smelled as much as seen.</p>

<p>But I don't care. I just found out that I can get five cubic yards of horse manure (about 70 wheelbarrow loads) from a local ranch for basically the cost of delivery ($80). And I can get all the wood chips I want free from my tree trimmer. With the addition of a little shovel work every month or so, I'll have all the compost I need each year for next to nothing.</p>

<p>I am one happy gardener.</p>

<p>One caveat about raw cow manure and raw wood chips. You might want to let the manure "bake" in a compost pile for a while. </p>

<p>The raw wood chips I would not use near/against the foundation of the house. Chips you buy in a garden supply outlet are (supposed to be!) treated to keep the bugs (termites) away. We can get free chips from the township, but we've always been warned to keep them in gardens away from the house because they are not treated.</p>
<p>Posted by <a href="http://theeternalgoldenbraid.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Fred Kiesche</a> at April 20, 2004 05:58 AM</p><br /><br />
<p>That's what I meant about a little shovel work every month or so, Fred. I figure it will take about six months for the manure (the nitrogen source) and the wood chips (carbon source) to bake down to useful compost.</p>

<p>And no, I don't allow any untreated wood products anywhere near the house. I just tore down some old woodsheds in the back yard--they were full of termites. A recent inspection of the house, however, shows no problems.</p>

<p>

<p>A Hungarian friend once told me that the impact of any profanity in that language could be greatly increased by adding the phrase "in a dogwood tree." </p>

<p><img alt="Dogwood.jpg" src="http://www.davetrowbridge.com/MT/images/Dogwood.jpg" width="500" height="667" border="0" /></p>

<p>He didn't know why. I don't either, for the dogwood is such a beautiful tree in the spring that one wonders what corner of Hungarian myth or tradition was responsible for such an association. This one is busy beautifying the northwest corner of the soon-to-be vineyard.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the garden this weekend I planted dahlias and sweetpeas, removing and potting a plethora of Shasta daisies and fancier chrysanthemums to make room for them. The left-over dahlia roots that haven't sprouted yet will get buried in a corner of the compost pit; those that sprout will be potted and given away or planted elsewhere.</p>

<p>Next weekend: tomatoes and snap-peas, and perhaps some other vegetable seeds and asparagus roots, if they arrive in time.</p>

<p>This last weekend I prepared the vineyard for planting, and did some planting in the rest of the garden. </p>

<p>Here it is about 9 AM, with 5 cubic yards of compost waiting for me, a shovel, and the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p><img src="/images/VineyardBefore.jpg"></p>

<p>And here it is about 4 hours and almost 70 wheelbarrow loads later.</p>

<p><img src="/images/VineyardDuring.jpg"></p>

<p>And, after Deborah spread out the compost and I added the amendments (lots of extra nitrogen to help break down the compost), here is the vineyard, ready for trellis construction and planting, which will happen in late April or early May.</p>

<p><img src="/images/VineyardAfter.jpg"></p>

<p>You can also see the two wisteria vines I planted at the gate trellis, and the Shasta Daisies (Chrysanthemum maximum) I transplanted from elsewhere in the garden to the upper edge of the retaining wall.</p>

<p>This Saturday our church is having a plant sale, at which some rather nice heirloom tomatoes will be offered, and perhaps some other interesting vegetables. We'll pick up some sugar snap peas and other vegetables at the local nursery, and get started with planting.</p>

<p>Last week the landscaper finished the garden fence. Here's a before picture.</p>

<p><img src="/images/GardenPreFence.jpg"></p>

<p>Saturday a truck dropped off 5 cubic yards of compost, four railroad ties, and some rebar, and I spent the weekend building a small retaining wall and tilling the compost into the upper garden, in preparation for planting vegetables. Here's the garden late Sunday morning, with all the compost (about 50 wheelbarrow loads) and soil amendments (ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and dolomite) spread out and ready for tilling. </p>

<p><img src="/images/GardenPreTilling.jpg"></p>

<p>I was pleased to find that despite two days of fairly strenuous labor, following a six-month period during which I had gotten very little exercise due to the kefuffle attendant on moving, marrying, and selling a house, I wasn't all that sore or stiff on Monday, although it still may catch up with me. Here's an after picture.</p>

<p><img src="/images/GardenPostFence.jpg"></p>

<p>The tilled portion is to be the vegetable garden: asparagus, various pole beans, heirloom tomatoes, fancy melons, lettuce, sweet corn, peas, and, of course, summer squash of various sorts. And perhaps other things that catch my fancy whilst perusing catalogues. The portion closer to the fence will be the vineyard, which we'll plant in late April or early May. Next weekend I'll spread another five yards of compost plus amendments there and till it all in. Then the heavy labor will be largely done.</p>

<p>And, while I have no picture for this, I did make the acquaintance of an important citizen of my garden: a gorgeous garden snake about 15 inches long, resplendent in longitudinal stripes of buff yellow, olive green, and a subdued scarlet. I don't know the species; perhaps <a href="http://blog.ghostdragon.net/">Draconic</a> can identify it from the description. Doesn't matter what we humans call it, Solomon in all his glory couldn't compare to the sleek elegance of that little reptile. After taking it inside to show my wife and daughter, I returned it to the garden in a safer area where it was bound to find all sorts of crunchy insect life. Perhaps I'll see it again--since we don't let the cats out, it doesn't have much to fear.<br />
