    	<p>My desk is extremely cluttered right now. Some items on my desk include:</p>

a roll of tissue;<br />

<p>my dad's <i>Nikon FE</i> 35mm SLR camera, dated 1979. Yes, the thing still works, and works great. Also on my desk are three different lenses and a flash. Heck, my dad even still has the manual.</p>

<p>Now you can see why my desk is extremely cluttered.</p>

    	<div class="title">Hot Pot Dinner</div>
    	<p>My family and I chose to go to a very popular Hot Pot restaurant at Leslie & Hwy. 7 for dinner tonight. The food was indeed very delicious, and the Sichuan spicy soup base that I ordered for my half of the pot (Chinese hot pot pots are usually partitioned into two halves so that the group of eaters can choose two different soup bases) is one of the hottest I've ever tried. Initially you may not feel the hot in your mouth, but eventually the chilis and spices get to you and your mouth and tongue heat up real quick. Most of the other places I've been to just use powder mix which may taste hot but does not give you that almost numbing feeling. This stuff did, and it was wonderful.</p>

<p>One thing that marred the evening was that the restaurant wouldn't accept my Visa card as a valid form of payment. In fact, they accept cash and cash only. Makes fudging the books at year-end a little easier, I guess.</p>

    	<div class="title">Bugs bug me.</div>
    	<p>I had something to say, but as soon as I sat down and noticed the earwig crawling slowly at the top of my wall, right above the window, all that I had in mind fled.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the times in Waterloo when my friend Dennis and I would use rubber bands to try to get at those spiders that were out of our ordinary reach. Most of the time it really was either hit or miss; if we missed, we'd recover the band and try again. If we landed the band on target, we'd take a tissue and clean up the remains of the poor spider's body, which we'd have successfully teared into usually four pieces.</p>

<p>With persistent pests like earwigs, though, I don't think I would try the rubber band trick.</p>

    	<p>In a little while Maria will come by to pick me up and together we will be heading to a nearby community library to study for our SOA exams. I am hoping today will turn out to be a productive day, and that we could continue this habit up until exam time. When I have a study buddy, I am more motivated to work hard, even though all we are really doing is heading to a study room and studying on our own at different desks. But seeing that there is somebody working as hard, if not harder, as you are is a great incentive to work hard myself, too.</p>

<p>Is human desire generally insatiable? We are born with endless ambition and desires for material and immaterial things. The more we have of something, the more we want of it, or we move onto something else that preoccupies our mind — that is, until we grow tired of it and move onto yet something else.</p>

    	<div class="title">Bitter Taste, Good Medicine</div>
    	<p>Chinese medicine has long been established as an effective alternative medication. The prescription formula is composed of herbs, plants or other ingredients which differ depending on the particular ailment. Special pots are used to boil the ingredients in water, which after an hour or so turns into a dark-coloured soup, for lack of a better word. Those who have tried it would appreciate my description.</p>

<p>Although being very effective, the medicine has an extremely bitter taste. In fact, it is conventional for Chinese pharmacists to pack a few packs of haw flakes with it. Hence the Chinese saying, "bitter taste, good medicine" to mean that the more bitter the medicine is, the better it is for the sick's wellbeing.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder if sweet-tasting medicine, if such exists, would inflict harm on the individual.</p>

    	<p>I have officially expanded my customer base to my hairstyling services to <i>two</i>. Other than Wil, I now also cut my dad's hair. He is intent on saving those few bucks he spents at the hairstylist's every month. And why shouldn't he? Cutting his hair was a snap — his hair was so soft and straight that no matter how uneven the cuts are, no-one would ever be able to detect it because it all just flops on his head. Nonetheless, I did the best I could to keep everything as even and tapered as my skills would allow. Not bad for a 20-minute job!</p>

<p>Having been working for more than three weeks without encountering major subway problems is no less of a miracle, but that blissful world came to an end this morning. The Yonge subway line experienced signal problems earlier today, and unfortunately for me I arrived at the Yonge platform at the wrong time — right after the crew fixed the problem. Greeting me after I climbed the stairs from the Bloor line were at least 7 or 8 layers, yes, layers of people crowded on the platform. It wasn't until the third or fourth train that I was able to get on, and it wasn't pretty. People kept pushing — I understand that everyone wants to get on the train, but pushing your way through hundreds of people will get you nowhere other than maybe sending a few of them onto the tracks.</p>

<p>I am now officially resetting the "(major) problem-free subway rides" counter to 0 days.</p>

    	<p>I have just come back from playing two good hours of ping pong at a community church. Two friends of mine, Allen and Dennis, attend the church and are good friends with one of the ministers there, and every Thursdays they gather to play some ping pong, foosball, air hockey, and whatever else that happen to be lying around in the recreation room.</p>

<p>My arms and legs are sore from playing (and I have been out of shape for the last three years or so — yes, ever since I entered university) but I had great fun. I momentarily forgot about everything — impending work, the approaching exam, everything that spells stress in my life were forgetten during those two hours.</p>

    	<p>Walking toward the bus station this morning, flashing red and white lights glared into my eyes. Right at the intersection of Steeles Ave. and Brimley Rd. two cars have collided. The paramedics arrived shortly after, and although there is seemingly no casualty, the impacts on the cars look extremely severe. One car's front was completely crashed and the other car's left wheel was badly misaligned. Both cars looked like totally lost to me.</p>

<p>I am not sure exactly how and when they crashed, but I am glad I was not early enough to witness it.</p>

    	<p>Work has been slow. By that I do not mean I am without work; I have several tasks on hand, but they are of slow, numbing nature. Not to say that they are uninteresting — I don't even know how to describe this. Lately I have get a strange feeling at work; a feeling of desolation, of lack of inspiration. It was never like this last term, and I have no clue as to what is causing this. Exam anxiety, perhaps? Or am I suffering from the co-op syndrome: where more than 4 months at one company is too much? I have absolutely no idea.</p>

<blockquote><p>The stories sounded as far-fetched as a Hollywood thriller. Young Japanese men and women, on peaceful sunset strolls on the beach, were grabbed and abducted by North Korean secret agents in speedboats. They were drugged, brainwashed and forced to teach Japanese to North Korean spies for more than 20 years.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>For decades the tales were just rumours. But in an astonishing confession and formal apology to Japan yesterday, North Korea admitted it had kidnapped at least 12 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, mainly from seashore locations, and taken them to Pyongyang.</p></blockquote>

    	<p>Artoo is now sitting in the corner of my room, overseeing my activities. The hardest part was putting the last piece together, where you have no room to work around. All in all, it was a fun project. I didn't know 3D puzzles could be so time-consuming.</p>

<p>Now that Artoo is completed, I shall have no further excuse to delay my studying.</p>

    	<div class="title">My own Artoo</div>
    	<p>Since Jacquie has her own 3D R2-D2 puzzle now, there is no use keeping the one I originally bought for her as birthday present boxed up and locked in the closet. So yesterday, when I was feeling better but not good enough to study, I decided to open it. Initially the puzzle was intimidating. Many of the pieces looked identical! I picked the easiest part — the head because of all its different colours and patterns — to start with. After dinner Wil came over to see how I was doing and helped me with the puzzle, too. Before he left we have finished the head and the body, and parts of the arms. The droid looks pretty neat, even at half-completion! These 3D puzzles are loads of fun.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to finish it tonight. Then it can sit in the dark corner of my room and help me look out for evil forces.<br />

    	<div class="title">Sick leave (without pay)</div>
    	<p>I didn't make it to work today.</p>

<p>I got up at the usual time of 07:00, suffering from cramps. Cramps are usual for me, so I proceeded as I would every Monday morning and headed out the door at around 07:10. When the bus pulled into the Scarborough Town Centre RT station the pain became unbearable. Not only was I suffering from cramps, my stomach was also hurting incessantly. After I walked up to the RT platform my head was swirling and a nauseating feeling overcame me, making me want to throw up and almost hurling me down the stairs. Wobbling around the RT station in search of washrooms proved futile, so I was forced to exit the station into the shopping mall. After a good half an hour I decided that I was not fit to go to work. I called my sister (who is off work today because it's Yom Kippur, and her bosses are Jewish) and asked her to pick me up. As soon as I were home I plopped on my bed, exhausted. It wasn't until around 13:00 that I woke again.</p>

<p>I hate getting sick.</p>

    	<p>UW students are supposed to be able to check Spring 2002 marks starting today. I say "supposed" because as of now I am still unable to open the login page. Why they decided to release marks on a Sunday escapes my mind, but at least keep your words and let us check our marks!</p>

<p><i>Update:</i> Okay, my bad. <a href="http://connietower.blogspot.com/">Connie</a> just informed me that on the third Sunday of every month our online student system is available only from 16:00 to midnight.</p>

    	<div class="title">My Productive Day</div>
    	<p>I didn't get out of bed as early as I would have liked this morning, but nevertheless, 10:00 wasn't so bad. After having a quick breakfast I dived right into studying for, well, an hour. Had a quick shower before I packed my things so that I could go to the nearest library to continue studying after lunch. My mom, my sister and I went to the Mug Master Café at Kennedy and Denison for lunch — to be honest they don't have much of a choice for lunch. I guess the place is more suited for having drinks. After lunch, my mother and sister dropped me off at the Milliken Mills Community Library. This library isn't very big, but it's cozy and nice, and the brightly lit study room is a very sweet touch. I should mention that I saw my friend Syntheia, who also studies actuarial science at UW, at the library, too. She is also preparing for Course 3. Today I got about 4 hours of studying; not as much as I would like, but it certainly beats zero. And I still have the night, if I so desire to study some more.</p>

<p>At around 16:45 I decided that I had enough of studying, and asked my sister to pick me up. When we got home my mom and I began preparing for dinner — dumplings and wanton. The difference between the two (at least the way we made them tonight) are the wrapping and the way of wrapping. I helped very little with the filling — I diced about 1/20th of the vegetables, maybe? The wrapping was fun, though. My mother and I wrap the dumplings differently; she makes two folds while I make multi-folds in the more traditional method. When time came for the wantons, my mom showed me a new way of wrapping she learned from a friend. The wrapping looks like a nurse's hat, and is quite simple to do!</p>

<p>When we were all done we boiled a big pot of water and dumped about half of what we made into it. We decided to have just dumplings and wantons tonight and didn't make any noodle. I think I had about 20 in total, and now I'm absolutely full.</p>

<p>I think I should go watch some TV now.</p>

    	<p>This morning at work our office was surrounded by fumes from the painting and construction going on in the office next door. Seeing that many people actually complained, our HR personnel contacted the management so that they could do something about it. We received an email indicating that the management will increase the power of the ventilation fans and that it will be rewarding us. About an hour later our HR personnel came by and distributed $25 gift certificates that can be used in a list of malls located in Ontario, the West and the East coasts.</p>

<p>We all said we wouldn't mind smelling more fumes, if we get more gift certificates for it.</p>

    	<div class="title">Borrowed Thoughts from the Subway</div>
    	<p>On the subway today, I overheard two women's conversation. They were apparent part-time English students and one of them said, "I am lazy. I am busy. Writing takes concentration." I couldn't agree more. Attempting to compose a piece, be it an essay, a poem, prose, anything, requires scrupulous attention and effort in the process of brainstorming, writing a draft, and endless revisions.</p>

<p>The same goes for everything else in life.</p>

    	<div class="title">A Year Later</div>
    	<p>A year has passed since the day of the tragic events; the day when the words "September 11" took on a whole new meaning. The event seems to be a distant past, but at the very same time it also seems to have just happened yesterday. Looking at picture after picture in newspapers still send chills throughout my body.</p>

<p>My eighth grade teacher used to tell us that her generation of people all remembered exactly what they were doing when the assassination of President John F. Kennedy took place. Our generation will remember, as much as we wish not to, every minute detail on the day freedom was openly challenged and attacked. In the very same manner that filmmakers of today base many of their films on the two World Wars, those of tomorrow will undoubtedly be making films about the WTC attacks.</p>

<p>Some final words, and I borrow them from a warm touch of our building management, which distributed pin flags attached with a note to every tenant:</p>

<p><i>September 11</p>

<p>A day to look back at an event that changed each of us forever. A day to look forward to creating peace and well being.</i></p>

    	<div class="title">Door Trouble</div>
    	<p>The doors leading from the North exit of the Queen's subway station to the Eaton Centre is biased against handedness. All of the doors swing outward to the right when one is exiting the station and entering into the mall. Not only that, the door hinges a few inches off the edge, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to push the doors open with both hands. As a result, one can only attempt to open the doors using the right hand. For people like me who are naturally stronger with the left, this makes for an annoying and inconvenient task. Of course, the advantage switches to my side for entrance into the subway station.</p>

<p>Why didn't the designer just put double doors there?</p>

    	<div class="title">Monday Tidbits</div>
    	<p>I saw a friend that I haven't seen in a while on the subway today! She just came back from a three-week vacation in Europe, and had quite a few stories to keep me entertained on the otherwise mundane train ride. She told me mostly about things to watch out for: confusing and crazy traffic, pickpockets and impatient drivers who don't wait for you to get on or off completely a bus or tram before stepping on the pedal. She seemed like she had a wonderful trip.</p>

<p>At work, my co-worker and I got so happy talking about in-line skates that we decided to head downstairs to the SportChek in the Eaton Centre to look at them. Prices have fallen since I last purchased a pair, I must say.</p>

    	<div class="title">Buzzzzzz</div>
    	<p>I gave Wil a haircut a few hours ago. It's been a while — maybe a month or so — since I last cut his hair, and frankly it was getting a little wild and out of control for a workplace that requires strict business attire from Mondays to Thursdays (that means a tie is mandatory for the gentlemen and skirts/dresses for ladies). Now his hair is back to a short, clean and more manageable manner, for another week or two, at least.</p>

<p>I might be expecting a second customer for my hairstyling service; my dad had wanted me to give him a crew cut but I was in Waterloo. He couldn't wait any longer and had it cut at a (professional) hairstylist. Maybe next time.</p>

    	<div class="title">So much for the weekend studying</div>
    	<p>I just got home now, and wasted an entire day, as far as studying goes. Because I got home at around 2 a.m. and didn't sleep until around 3 a.m., I didn't wake up until a little past 10:30 this morning. Then, my family went for lunch and after that, we dropped my dad off at a bus station and headed to the Promenade Mall to shop at the new T&T Supermarket. The place was packed with people; the crowd was comparable to one at a Boxing Day sale. My mom said the prices have dropped since the last time she was there, which was about a month ago. Actually, some of the things on special are fairly cheap, too, and the meats and produce were both pretty fresh. We ended up buying more than $70 worth of groceries.</p>

<p>I bet with my sister that she couldn't hold on to the winter melon (see below) for more than 10 seconds. The result? I'm paying for pizza tonight.</p>

<p>I might as well forget about studying tonight and go full-fledge tomorrow. But I was just informed that we will be having tea with my uncle's family (they live in Saudi Arabia) tomorrow morning, so let's see how that will go tomorrow.</p>

    	<p>I can't believe it's already Friday. The week seems to go by faster when I study! I don't want time to fly by this fast; it makes me nervous counting the days left until the exam. Time is already running out, and I am on, what, the first unit. It's depressing.</p>

<p>In a few more minutes I will be heading out to meet up with a few friends for drinks. I haven't seen some of them in a while, so it should be a refreshing experience.</p>

    	<div class="title">Pork Chop likes wife cakes...I think.</div>
    	<p>Connie bought me souvenirs from Hong Kong! She got me a box of very tasty "wife cakes" (that's the English name on the box, I kid you not) and a <a href="http://www.porkchop.com.hk">Pork Chop</a> item...I haven't figured out exactly what its function is, but it looks nice just sitting on top of my study manual! Speaking of the study manual: I have given up trying to study before I have dinner. I need to give myself a break and to replenish my system before hitting the books. Otherwise I just waste precious time staring at page after page, not absorbing anything. Better to use the time to relax and to prepare myself mentally to shift into study gear.</p>

    	<div class="title">Studying is going nowhere</div>
    	<p>I began preparing for my SOA Course 3 examination last night. Progress is painfully slow — either I keep making silly mistakes when I do the practice problems, or I don't know how to do them at all. This is not at all very encouraging, and to think that I have only two months left until the exam! I must find a way to get more than two hours of studying per weeknight or I won't be able to cover all the material.</p>

    	<p>...because Connie started working today! I was very excited to see her walk by my desk in the morning with our receptionist — the only problem was, I had my mouth full of an Egg McMuffin and couldn't talk. This should be a good lesson for anyone who is not convinced that taking big bites is bad for you.</p>

    	<div class="title">Frosh Attack</div>
    	<p>My company is located inside the Cadillac-Fairview building, which is attached to the Eaton Centre. At around 2 p.m. or so today, we heard a loud band playing from inside the mall, to the extent that the volume prevented us from concentrating. Curiosity got the best of us and we stepped out to the mini balcony to look. Waves of yellow tees in hard hats flooded the first and second floors of the Eaton Centre — they were the Ryerson engineering frosh students. Besides the music, they were also hollering cheers that were unintelligible from where we was standing.</p>

<p>When I was a frosh, we never got to tour in malls. In fact, there is nothing that stands prominently in my memories of frosh week at Waterloo. How sad, I know.</p>

    	<div class="title">Labour Day</div>
    	<p>Today is Labour Day.</p>

<p>It used to feel much different on Labour Day. When I was still in high school, Labour Day was a dreaded reminder for me, as well as other fellow students, that school is to commence the following day. Labour Day was no sweet holiday for students.</p>

<p>Today, I sit leisurely at home, relishing this long weekend and pondering about how silly it used to be when I loathed Labour Day. If I had the choice, though, I would love to be a high school student again.</p>

    	<div class="title">The car and the football match.</div>
    	<p>Washed the car today. Found a few scratches; I guess they are unavoidable, especially when my sister drives from Toronto to Mississauga and back every weekday. But now we have a sparkly clean car. For a day or two, anyway.</p>

<p>*** </p>

<p>It was an emotional loss for the U-19 Women's team; they did so well, had so many chances to score but couldn't convert. Losing in extra time by a golden goal is always hard, but I think they took the loss valiantly. To me, they were exceptional throughout the tournament and deserve my salute. The stadium full of Canadian fans gave them a standing ovation and cheered them despite the loss. The girls brought us a wonderful tournament of hard-fought matches, and they should be darn proud of themselves for that.</p>

    	<div class="title">Bug Battle Begins!</div>
    	<p>A giant mosquito just landed on my monitor. I am not even sure if it's a mosquito, but it's huge, about 25 mm long. I stared at it for a few seconds before I grabbed the nearest pad of paper on my desk to smash it. Only that I didn't really get a good hit and now it's gone. I don't think I killed it; I don't see any dead body anywhere. This is not a very pleasant feeling, knowing that there is a loose criminal somewhere around my room.</p>
