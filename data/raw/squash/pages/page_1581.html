        <b>NICOL STEPS UP THE PACE, BOSWELL LEFT BEHIND</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><img src="../photos/toc2002/smBoswellNicol29.jpg" width="300" height="352" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Damn 
        this man Peter Nicol, he must be controlled by the Devil. Nobody can be 
        humanly this good, this fast, this accurate, so damned good. The only 
        exorcism is age and that won't happen for at least a couple of years. 
        I had to feel sorry for Stewart Boswell the likeable, unflappable young 
        Australian, who really did not put a foot wrong in the first game, led 
        13-8 and lost it 15-13. You really don't expect anybody to take eight 
        consecutive points from somebody as good as Boswell. Yet that is exactly 
        what Peter Nicol did. The last point that Boswell won was when Nicol tripped 
        and fell backwards on to the floor. From that moment, Nicol seemed to 
        pick up the pace, stopped balls getting past him and took control of the 
        game. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>GETS THE LUCK TOO</b><br>
        At 12 -13, Nicol fell again, but this time got up, reached Boswell's drop 
        and went on to twin the point. You really had to feel for Boswell. So 
        Now it was 13-13 and Nicol then gets a lucky nick at the back of the court. 
        You could almost feel Boswell's shoulders sag as he contemplated game 
        ball after being so far ahead. The next point ended with Boswell hittinga 
        simple forehand cross court into the tin. To repeat, Boswell had played 
        near perfect squash and for much of the game had Nicol on the hop, but 
        he lost 15-13 after 24 minutes of impeccable squash.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> <b>AND YET ANOTHER GEAR UP</b><br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smBoswellNicol35.jpg" width="350" height="265" align="right">Nicol 
        was now motoring and moving even faster. There were at least four rallies 
        that Boswell had won, only for Nicol to pick up the ball at amazing speed 
        to not only keep the rally going but finally win it. Whether the preceding 
        game had taken away some of Boswell's legs or whether the sheer resilience 
        and patience needed to take a point from Nicol affected his head is hard 
        to say, but it was now Nicol in the driving seat. There were very few 
        short rallies as they kept pushing each other into the four corners and 
        played the ball tight down the walls. Nicol's drop shots were deadly soft, 
        a millimetre above the tin, tight on the wall and never seeming to come 
        off the floor. Fast as he was, Boswell could not pick them up. Nicol led 
        the second game after losing the first point and resisted any counterattack 
        that Boswell could summon up, taking the game 15-8 in 18 minutes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>BYE BYE BOZ</b><br>
        Boswell had no intention of giving anything away and started hitting some 
        winners. He won a huge, long taxing rally to get to 5-all and then lost 
        the next rally, just as big, just as long and just as taxing, when he 
        hit a forehand into the tin. He tied it at 6-all with an unexpected dying 
        boast, the only time that he managed to catch Nicol flat footed. And that, 
        really, was the end. Boswell was tired even though he had done no more 
        running than Nicol, but Nicol has been doing it longer than Boswell and 
        claims that he trains harder than anybody on the tour. He won the game 
        15-8 and the 61 minute match, which he probably regards as a good warm-up 
        to his meeting with John White tomorrow. As I said half way through the 
        US Open in Boston, I can't really see anyone beating Peter Nicol. Unless 
        John White can hit 27 outright winners. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>EVANS EXPERIENCES WHITE-OUT</b> 
        <br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smEvanWhite100.jpg" width="255" height="400" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">After 
        watching John White plays squash you wonder 'Why doesn't everybody place 
        squash like this?' White stands in the back of the court, somewhere in 
        the vicinity of the T , takes a swing at the ball, most times not bothering 
        to bend his knees, and whacks it into the nick. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Just like that. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Why do other players hit up and down 
        the wall and run all over the place, getting sweaty and sticky? I suppose 
        the answer that sometimes White's shots hit the tin and he loses the point. 
        But against David Evans of Wales, White was maintaining a success rate 
        of about 80% and there was very little Evans, no slouch at winners himself, 
        could do to stop that ball dropping down the nick. The first game was 
        over in under ten minutes, before Evans had warmed up, 15-8 in White's 
        favour. </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>SQUASH FOR THE BRAIN</b><br>
        White, the world number three, continued with his unlaboured form of squash 
        in the second game and when he led 9-4 it looked as though Evans was going 
        to get swamped, which was inconceivable after the way he played against 
        Martin Heath in the second round.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> But Evans had demonstrated his ability 
        to ignore big leads and fight back in that match and he did it again today 
        reaching 12-13. The following rally should be bronzed: it was a thing 
        of great beauty, with the brain being used as much as the racket. This 
        was a battle of equals with both players using delay, deception, length 
        and height. It almost took on the fluidity of a ballet and when Evans 
        finally won it to tie the game 13-all, there was prolonged applause. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><b>GOOD, BAD, GOOD BAD, GOOD</b> <br>
        <img src="../photos/toc2002/smEvansWhite28.jpg" width="300" height="314" align="right">Then 
        White demonstrated the shooter's dilemma. An effortless backhand drop 
        put him at game ball 14-13. His next backhand drop hit the tin, 14-all. 
        He called set three and then hit the tin yet again with a backhand drop. 
        Finally Evans had the lead and the next rally was another ballet sequence, 
        with incredible skill and accuracy in all parts of the court. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Evans saved the point three times 
        before White hammered the ball down the centre of the court and Evans 
        simply couldn't catch it.</font> <font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">It 
        was 15-all and it was Evans' turn to make an error as he tried a delayed 
        cross court flick which shaved the top of the tin. White was at game point 
        16-15 and tried to finish it off with a deft backhand half-volley only 
        to hear the sound of tin: 16-all. And then luck stepped on Evans' toes 
        as his slam hit the corner of the front and side walls, (is there no name 
        for this shot? I want to call it a squelch) and squirted into the centre 
        of the court to find Evans adrift with White standing behind him, his 
        racket raised. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Stroke to White, game to White 17-16. 
        The third game was over in half the time of the second (18 minutes) and 
        White simply ran away, the winners still finding the nick and Evans still 
        unable to do anything about it. Pity, I would have enjoyed a five game 
        battle between these two, and would like to see Evans at his peak again, 
        getting back into the top five. </font></p>
