    all that anxious to see my June water bill, nor am I thrilled about all the 
    desert wildlife surviving 
    the summer drought on my plants. Their numbers have greatly increased over the past month while my landscaping has 
    significantly decreased. The wildlife has boldly gone where no critters, except 
    for javelina, have gone before. My home's front entrance was always out of 
    bounds for rabbits and rodents but not any more. I had to pull all chairs 
    away from any outdoor table that might have a plant on it and then some of 
    the animals still managed to get on the table to eat the potted plants.&nbsp; 
    There's nothing I can do to stop the birds from eating the succulent leaves 
    of plants. I took several hanging baskets of green, lush foliage and hung 
    them underneath the ramada. Within two days the birds had butchered the 
    plants' leaves.</font></font></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">I purchased volcanic stone to place around many of the 
    potted plants because birds and rodents constantly dug in the moist soil 
    scattering it every where. They have a little more difficulty tossing out 
    the red volcanic stone but they still manage to make quite a mess more often than not. The 
    animals were looking for a shady, damp spot during the hot days of June to 
    keep cool. Can't say I blamed them.</font><p align="left">
    <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">I'd taken two flats of various 
    cactus I'd grown from seed and moved them to a caged growing bench 
    underneath a mesquite tree. The next day half the cactus had been eaten or 
    pulled out of the growing mix. I moved the flats back to the greenhouse. 
    There, the other half of the cactus was eaten and pulled from the soil mix. 
    Pesky rodents had made their way into the greenhouse.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#808080">If things were bad in the landscape, they weren't much better inside the house. I've never had a 
    fungus gnat infestation in the summer but boy did they come alive in June. 
    My wife was so annoyed with the gnats she gave me a stern ultimatum. &quot;Either 
    the fungus gnats go, or else.&quot; I have no idea what the &quot;or else&quot; meant 
    but I worked diligently treating the soil, 
    placing yellow sticky traps and stalking around the houseplants with a 
    vacuum cleaner sucking up any little gnat I spotted.&nbsp; My wife still glowers every time a 
    gnat crosses her path. I'm blaming the potting soil I used a month or two 
    ago to repot all the houseplants. Simply put, &quot;It's not my fault.&quot;</font></p>

    the pink banana squash and the vines wilted like a dropped lemon-lime 
    Popsicle® on a hot Tucson 
    sidewalk. I watered that evening but the damage was done. Many of the leaves 
    were burnt crisp never to recover. I picked one 24 pound banana squash and 
    several in the two to six pound category. So maybe losing the vines wasn't 
    such a bad thing. How much squash can you really eat? I'm thinking maybe 
    squash soup to freeze for next winter or maybe a squash pie instead of 
    pumpkin.</font></p>
