Corn, pumpkins, squash,cranberries, blueberries, and potatoes were all foods good for NEWHAMPSHIRE climate. Meats were animals that could be hunted like deer,squirrel, rabbit, bear or raised such as chickens, cows, and pigs.They also fished. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">2. Who Grew The Food ?</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">Growing food was an important taskfor everyone. Families depended on food for the winter. Young men,small boys and grown men all worked together to plant. Women helpedwith planting and kept the men fed.At harvest time all helped to pickand bring in what was grown.Young children's chores were things likepicking blueberries and feeding the animals some of which werebutchered for food. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">3.Who Prepared The Food?</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">Many fruits and vegetables werestored or canned for eating during the winter. Women worked togetherdoing this job. Men would butcher pigs, chickens, and beef then storethem after they had been cured with salts to keep them fresh for thewinter. Young women made butter with a churn. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">RECIPE FORFRITTERS</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0"> </FONT><FONTSIZE="+2" COLOR="#6C18B0">By Greg</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="#6C18B0">Mix half a pint of good cream,verythick with flour, beat six eggs, leaving out four whites, and to theeggs put six spoonfuls of sack [sherry wine], and strain them intothe batter; put in a little grated nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon, allvery fine, also a little salt. Then put in another half pint ofcream,and beat the batter near an hour; pare and slice your applesvery thin, dip every piece in the batter, and throw them into a panfull of boiling lard. </FONT></P><P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><CENTER>Last Updated: 6/1/98</CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="mailto:4mcgowan@govwentworth.k12.nh.us">email         us</A> with your comments</CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="../historyfoyer.html">Back to History         Foyer</A></CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="../../floorplan.html">Back to Museum         Foyer</A></CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="../../../index.html">Back to GWRSD         Home</A></CENTER>      </TD><TD>         <P><CENTER><A HREF="COLONIAL_NH.html">Back to Colonial NH         Page</A></CENTER>      </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></P><P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
