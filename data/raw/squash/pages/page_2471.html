<b>HISTORY</b>
<br>
Hawkes’ Bay Lawn Tennis and Squash club was fundamentally a tennis and squash club but in early 1999 that was about to change when a committee member, Kevin Rouse, hatched an idea to introduce a third sport. It was a timely idea as the committee were looking at a flagging membership list and ways of giving the club a ‘boost’.
The idea of introducing the game of pétanque arose when existing club members gathered on Friday evenings after work to relax, have a drink and play pétanque on the sole terrain—laid down some years earlier by the club’s accountants—Gardiner, Knobloch.<br>
So on 24th July 1999 a working bee laid down 5 new terrain and the 3rd H.B. pétanque club was born.
<br><br>



<b>CLUB DAYS</b>
<br>
With the attitude to relaxation at the end of a working week, the club day of Fridays from 6.00 p.m. proves popular for working people. Meals are available from the restaurant kitchen and a well appointed bar and lounge cater for the ‘imbibers’.
A second club day of Saturday afternoons from 2.00 p.m. was decided on so that Lawn Tennis (as it is affectionately known) would not compete with the Sunday play times of the two other established clubs. This allows dual club members maximum choice of playing times. Visitors are very welcome to visit on club days for the small fee of a gold coin.

<b>DISTRICT TRIPLES CHAMPIONSHIP</b>
<br>
HBLT is host to this district event. The inaugural winners in 2000 were Murray Porter, Geoff Greer and Denise Bavidge of Bay View club. They retained the title for 3 consecutive years but 2003 saw them toppled from their position by HBLT members : Kevin Rouse, Ian MacGregor and dual club member Sharon Cannon.
<br>
The 2004 competition will be held on Sunday 21st March.
<br>
Until this year we have not had a trophy on which to record winners but thanks to a trivial pursuit evening held on Jan 30th at HBLT, this will no longer be an issue. Many thanks to those people who supported this evening of hilarity. Excess money from the evening will be placed in the Pétanque Hawkes Bay account and used to help towards traveling costs for inter-regional interclub.

<b>BUSINESS HOUSE</b>

<br><br>

Throughout spring and summer business house, involving 10-12 teams of triples, is enjoyed on 3 consecutive Tuesday evenings from 6.00—8.30 pm approx. Every player receives a prize on the last evening of play so all in all, it is deemed good value at just $2 per person per evening.<br>
These light hearted events are not designed to be taken seriously but are an opportunity to encourage non-pétanque players to experience the game in a supportive environment. In fact ‘heavy seriousness’ by existing members is frowned on.
If you would like to be involved or need details of these fun evenings please contact the club manger, Bryan Thomason 8436573 or Kevin Rouse 8434273.  Come along and witness the fun!
<br><br>

<b>FUNDRAISING</b>
<br>
Lawn Tennis offers fundraising trivial pursuit evenings free of charge to charity orgs., sports teams, clubs or schools. To date, Tamatea High, Colenso High, Life Education Trust (Westpac), Altrusa Club and others have all been supportive of this initiative and benefited from the funds raised. In turn, HBLT has had it’s bar facilities used and benefited from the sales. The lounge room caters for up to 15 or 16 teams of 6 people. Details of this service are available from club manger, Bryan Thomason 8436573 or host coordinator Bethne Rouse on 8434273.

<b>WILD TERRAIN / CAR TRIAL</b>
<br>
<img src="parkpetanque.jpg" width=300 height=183 border=0 alt="" align="left">
New Zealand triples teams representing the country at Nationals overseas have traditionally been supported by Lawn Tennis. Fundraising has up until 2003 been by way of a trivia evening but  last year on 15th June, 9 carloads of people took part in a car rally. This was designed as a car trial not as a speed event. Entry fee was $5.00 per person.<br>
After arriving at the mystery destination (Eskdale Park) , willing participants into a wild terrain melée were asked to enter with a grocery item beginning with ‘c’ for car or ‘r’ for rally. These items were then grouped and given out as prizes.
<br clear="all">
<img src="risque.jpg" width=200 height=236 border=0 alt="" align="right">
The car trial winners were Sharon Cannon, Denise Brown and Richard Hall. Note, in the photo, that Sharon and Denise dressed to the letter ‘r’ (risque) and Richard wore a cape ‘c’!
<br>
The sum of $150 was raised from this day and forwarded to the triples team traveling to Switzerland the following month. Feedback from the rally/melée participants was positive so watch this site for further events!
<br><br>

<b>TERRAIN EXPANSION</b>
<br>
Thanks to a pub charity grant expansion from 5 piste to 9 is in progress (Feb 2004). A working bee on Saturday 21st Feb will see this undertaken. This increase in terrain numbers has been eagerly awaited as the proposal to host a triples tournament in May 2005 to celebrate 10 years of pétanque in Hawkes’ Bay should be successful.
