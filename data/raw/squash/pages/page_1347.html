<h1>Our Garden Journal</h1>
<h2>June 2001</h2>
<h3>June 1, 2001</h3>
<p>Harvested a couple of Ronde de Nice squash from the greenhouse today, and had 
backed squash stuffed with spinach (also from the garden, of course -- we're 
overrun with spinach), olive oil, and parmesan cheese. Yum! Between spinach and 
salad greens, we're definitely reaching the point in the year where all the hard 
work is starting to pay off.</p>
<p>Ronde de Nice, by the way, are a round zucchini -- called Eight Ball Squash 
by some other seed companies. They're quite flavorful, and a nice change from 
the larger zucchini.</p>
<h3>June 2, 2001</h3>
<p>Time for another round of &quot;state of the garden&quot; photos.</p>

<p>The strawberry patch is doing well, and the plants have little green 
strawberries all over them. My mouth waters just to think about harvesting 
these.</p>
<p><a href="images/june3.jpg">

<p>The potato patch is coming along nicely. I'm backfilling the trenches with 
straw as the potatoes grow. There are a variety of squash and pumpkin plants 
just starting to put on their first permanent leaves on the hills between 
trenches.</p>
<p><a href="images/june4.jpg">

<p>Life in the greenhouse. Flats of peppers, eggplants, and okra are waiting to 
transplant out. Swisschard, parsley, broccoli, lettuce, zucchini, and garlic are 
visible in the beds. The green bucket holds our Meyer lemon tree. Other 
containers include spearmint, sage, and basil.</p>

<p>Down in the main garden, another trench full of potato plants. There are 
tomatoes in the tires to the right, and some more in tomato cages along the 
fence to the left where you can't really see them due to the shadows.</p>
<p><a href="images/june7.jpg">
<img border="2" src="images/june7_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/june7.jpg" width="100" height="66"></a></p>
<p>Row crops coming along well: carrots, swisschard, spinach, lettuce, beets, 
parsley. More tomatoes in tires to the rear left. peas along the fence to the 
right.</p>
<p><a href="images/june8.jpg">
<img border="2" src="images/june8_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/june8.jpg" width="100" height="66"></a></p>
<p>The garlic patch is still happy.</p>
<p><a href="images/june9.jpg">
<img border="2" src="images/june9_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/june9.jpg" width="100" height="66"></a></p>
<p>A few sunflowers in the left foreground, onions, leeks, spinach, radishes, 
more garlic.</p>

<img border="2" src="images/june10_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/june10.jpg" width="100" height="66"></a></p>
<p>More tomatoes in the tires. Fuzzy stuff to the left is asparagus being left 
to grow now. The marked-out beds hold a variety of beans and row crops. Compost 
pile along the back fence.</p>
<p><a href="images/june11.jpg">
<img border="2" src="images/june11_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="images/june11.jpg" width="100" height="66"></a></p>
<p>The green in the foreground is shallots overgrown with weeds. The big dirt 
area behind that was just planted with corn. The asparagus beds wrap around the 
corn patch. More compost along the back fence, with sweet potatoes on the hills 
to the left.</p>

<p>Dill's Atlantic Giant squash, just coming up. This will be much larger by the 
end of the season. </p>
<h3>June 3, 2001</h3>
<p>Transplanted a few bell pepper seedlings to the garden, in between bouts of 
weather.</p>
<h3>June 4, 2001</h3>
<p>Finished planting out the rest of the bell pepper seedlings in the drizzle. 
And despite the miserable weather, the Selma-Zebra beans are sprouting. Also the 
Country Gentleman corn and the Black Beauty Zucchini are coming up. I was 
worried the cold and drizzle would keep the corn from germinating, but it looks 
fine.</p>
<h3>June 7, 2001</h3>
<p>Transplanted the eggplant seedlings out to the main garden.</p>

<h3>June 8, 2001</h3>

<p>Transplanted the okra seedlings. Some went out to the main garden, some into 
the greenhouse. Turns out they were all getting pretty badly root-bound. Waiting 
for a second true leaf is apparently too long a wait for okra seedlings in 
two-inch pots.</p>

<h3>June 13, 2001</h3>

<p>There are still a bunch of things I want to plant, but it's been so cold and 
damp that there's not much point to putting seeds in the ground. This may be 
June, but it feels like April.</p>

<h3>June 22, 2001</h3>

<p>The garlic that overwintered in the greenhouse was dying back, so I pulled it 
and put it out on the driveway to cure for a bit. (We've actually already gone 
through a few heads of this garlic). In its place, I planted a few more rows of 
broccoli.</p>

<h3>June 23, 2001</h3>

<p>Started removing the flower heads from the big garlic patch, so that those 
plants will put more energy into making garlic bulbs instead.</p>
