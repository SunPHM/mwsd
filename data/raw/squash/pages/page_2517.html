<P>The skillful fingers that created these quilts handed on a tradition that's as popular now as it was early on. </P>
<P>A cozy thought to wrap around us, to remind us that each generation is nurtured by the ones that went before, creating a quilt of experiences, stitching lives together with threads of honest, simple things - the best cabbages and summer squash, the best bread, pick and home made cheese.</P>
