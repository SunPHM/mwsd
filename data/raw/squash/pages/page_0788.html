	<p>If you are a beginner, its wise to start by reading the squash rules first. Also, Squash City has certain rules of conduct to help ensure your safety, and to keep the game fun. For more information see our <a href="/en/algemeen/huisregels.shtml">house rules</a>. You can also read about the squash rules on the board posted outside court 5.</p>

<p><span class="kop_lg3">Squash rules</span><br>
<ol>
<li>Only clients with a valid squash day card, or a valid squash membership card or a valid squash combination card are allowed on the squash courts.
<li>Every person entering Squash City to play squash must first check in by reception. Only receptionist can allocate a squash court.
<li>Any person found to be using the squash facilities without a valid membership or day card runs the risk of immediate expulsion from Squash City.
<li>A squash period is 45 minutes. Squash courts can be booked by telephone up to 7 days in advance. 2 players can book a maximum of 1 period per day, 3 players can book 2 periods and must pay for 2 full periods, 4 players can book 2 periods etc.
<li>Cancellation of a squash court booking must be done no later than 12 hours before the booking. Failure to cancel will result in a late booking fine, to be paid by the person whose name is on the court booking.
<li>It is required that you check in at reception no later than 5 minutes before your court time starts. Failure to do so can result in the court being given away. Please ensure that you leave the court on time, so that the next players can also start on time.
<li>Only non-marking light soled sport shoes may by used in the squash courts. These shoes must not have been worn outside. Only black non-marking squash balls may be used.
<li>A t-shirt or other sport shirt must be worn at all time on and off the court. Because of the black squash ball, it is advisable to wear light colored sports clothes while playing so you do not lose sight of the ball. A T-shirt or other sport shirt must be worn at all times on and off the court.
<li>It is forbidden to ram the back walls of the squash courts. These are made of glass and can and have broken in the past. Any breakage is the player's liability, not Squash City's.
<li>As all the courts are connected, please keep noise to a minimum. Swearing and other anti-social behaviour is forbidden.
<li>The squash ball can cause pain and injury (especially to your eyes) if played at another player. There are specific international squash rules governing how and when to play the ball, and when not to play the ball. These rules are posted on the ground floor in Squash City. It is expected that you have a basic knowledge of these rules and follow them, for you and your partner's own safety. If in doubt and you think you could hit your partner, play a LET. Protective sport eyeglasses are available at reception. The use of these is recommended. 
<li>Our squash instructors are available to answer any questions concerning the game, and offer professional squash lessons of 25 minutes per lesson. Lessons can be booked in advance at reception. Any cancellation of lessons must be done 24 hours in advance.
<li>Playing squash at Squash City is always at your own risk.
<li>Using our facilities automatically means that you are aware of our squash rules and <a href="/en/algemeen/huisregels.shtml">house rules</a> and that you agree with them and will abide by them.
