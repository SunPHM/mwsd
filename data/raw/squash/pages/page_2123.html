Included in our Homestead are a    log cabin, settler&#146;s house, a smokehouse, barn, commissary, loomhouse, outhouse,    blacksmith shop, and gardens.</p>    <p> The Settler&#146;s house and the Commissary are    original buildings and were built between 1812 and 1836. These two buildings were donated    by the Rollings family and moved to the museum property in 1990.</p>    <p>The remaining buildings in the Carolina Backcountry    Homestead were built from materials salvaged from derelict buildings around Sumter County.</p>    <p> Gardens in the Homestead have been planted with    herbs and vegetables representative of those which would have been grown in the Carolina    Backcountry between 1750 and 1850. The Sumter County Herb Society plants and maintains the    herb and dye gardens for the museum.</p>    <p>The vegetable garden is planted with heirloom    varieties that pre-date 1850. Among the more popular are Turkey Gizzard beans, true    Hubbard squash, Healing squash, and White okra. In the winter you can find the garden    planted with vegetables such as cabbages, turnips, and onions.</p>    <font SIZE="4"><b><p></b></font><strong><font SIZE="4"><b>Gardens</b></font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>    <p></font><a href="images/main2.gif"><img src="images/main2_small.gif" alt="Click to enlarge in a new window" border="0" align="left" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100"></a><strong>Robert Marvin,    famous nationwide 1960&#146;s</strong><br>     Linger for awhile in the gardens that surround the Museum.    Listen to the birds and the trickle of water as it splashes over the fountain and into the    fishpond.</p>    <p>Nationally renowned landscape designer Robert Marvin    designed the original gardens at the museum in the early 1960&#146;s.  Today, Marvin's design can still be seen in the curving walkways and plant groupings. The gardens contain dozens of azaleas and camellias, along with magnolias, dogwoods, and many others.    Towering above this lovely garden are huge 100 year old pecan trees that have grown to over 60 feet high. It's a beautiful place to spend a few quiet minutes.<font SIZE="2"></p>    </font><font SIZE="4"><b><p></b></font><b><font SIZE="4"><strong>Rental information</strong></font></p> </b>
