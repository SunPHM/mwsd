        <p>This variety evaluation was conducted at the Cornell Willsboro Research Farm, in Essex County.  The objective was to evaluate performance of a broad range of winter squash types (butternut, acorn, buttercup, etc) for yield and quality under the cooler, short season conditions of Northern NY.  All varieties were transplanted into raised beds with plastic mulch and drip irrigation, to manage soil temperature and moisture and optimize chance for marketable yields.

        <p>All cultivars produced marketable yields, using transplants and plasticulture.  Total and per plant yields, powdery mildew ratings and fruit quality are summarized in the
        <a href="winsquch.pdf"> tables</a> and in the comments below.  Subsamples were cured and stored for one month prior to measuring soluble solids (BRIX).  The Cornell Powdery Mildew Resistant (PMR) butternut had a lower mildew rating and higher number of marketable fruit per plant than the other tested butternut variety.
