<H2>Michelle Yeoh Exclusive Interview</H2>
<H2 align="center"><img src="images/michelleyeoh/michelleyeoh_preview.gif" width="324" height="270"></H2>


<p>Michelle Yeoh, former beauty queen who rides flying motorcycles onto moving 
  trains, is nothing short of amazing. She is the first lady of Hong Kong action 
  and the only one tough enough to tangle with masters like Jet Li, Sammo Hung, 
  and Chow Yun Fat. Even Jackie Chan has said she's the ONLY woman who should 
  be allowed to do fight scenes! Plus, having just inked a three picture deal 
  with Media Asia, a major production and distribution house in Hong Kong, to 
  start Mythical Films, her newest film "The Touch" will turn her from being a 
  world class film star to a world class film maker. </p>
<p>Martial arts film diva Michelle Yeoh hardly needs to speak before getting noticed. 
  The minute she stepped into the LA suite to meet ASTYLE for this exclusive interview, 
  you could feel the energy radiating from the 5' 4" incredibly toned "Bond girl." 
  All eyes are on her, and not only because of her long silky hair and the fact 
  she's made a career out of being an actress, a beauty, and the best female martial 
  arts star around. Its because of the genuine smile that somehow mesmerizes and 
  bewitches all who see it. </p>
<p>These days, of course, there are more reasons for that smile to be even more 
  radiant. As Michelle says, "I’ve always been very lucky in that I’ve always 
  been given opportunities – but when I do get those breaks, I am very, very ambitious. 
  I will go and do my very best, because I don’t settle for anything less." </p>
<p>Talking about her success, her life, and her latest projects, she uses the 
  word "lucky" and "fortunate" ten times as much as she uses any other adjectives. 
  Indeed, one would think she had to be blessed, to have withstood the calamities 
  she has and still come out on top. Born in Ipoh, Malaysia, where she was taught 
  both Malay and English in school, Yeoh grew up in the tropics of wide open spaces 
  and endless summer. Every moment she could she was on the kinetic go--swimming, 
  bicycling, boating, playing table tennis or squash. "I was a tomboy--and still 
  am!" she says good-humoredly. </p>
<p><img src="images/michelleyeoh/michelleyeoh_ballet.jpg" width="126" height="89" align="left">Young 
  Michelle took up ballet and eventually went to London to study at the Royal 
  Academy of Dance, but to the great fortune of moviegoing audiences worldwide, 
  Michelle’s dance career did not go as planned. She sustained a spinal injury 
  before graduating college and eventually wound up getting a degree in choreography 
  and drama. An event Michelle says "was a blessing in disguise." Returning to 
  Malaysia to start a ballet school, her mother secretly entered Michelle in the 
  national beauty pageant and following through on a lark, she won first place 
  and was crowned Miss Malaysia. </p>
<p>Her success in the pageant led to a commercial shoot in Hong Kong, where she 
  was cast opposite Jackie Chan. Afterward, she was cast in her first role of 
  a much-bullied social worker in "Owl vs. Dumbo." But her second film, "Yes, 
  Madam" where she was cast "correctly" as a tough police officer, high kicking 
  and fist-slugging like one of the boys, catapulted her into the Hong Kong movie 
  stardom by 1985. Retiring after only a few years to marry Dickson Poon, a Hong 
  Kong business magnate and multimillionaire, she eventually returned with the 
  insurance-company-rankling "Supercop."</p>

  Jackie Chan’s co-star, Michelle performed a series of incredible stunts herself 
  – at one point Michelle, entirely unfamiliar with motorcycles, jumped one onto 
  a moving train. The script also called for other outrageous stunts, including 
  one where the hero leaps through space from a building rooftop, averting death 
  only by snatching at a rope ladder dangling from a helicopter. "Yeah yeah yeah 
  – I’ll do that!" said Michelle, when told of the helicopter stunt. "No no, I 
  don’t think so," replied director Stanley Tong. "If you do that, what’s Jackie 
  going to do?" Apparently Michelle was content clinging to the side of a speeding 
  van! </p>
<p><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="header"><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body"><img src="images/michelleyeoh/michelleyeoh_tnd.jpg" width="125" height="89" align="left"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>A 
  few years after its initial Hong Kong release, the rights for "Supercop" – which 
  was previously available in the States only in a handful of Chinatown video 
  stores – were purchased by Miramax, which launched a worldwide re-release. Suddenly, 
  Michelle Yeoh was in the global spotlight, working publicity for the movie on 
  three continents. The attention was well-deserved and led her directly to her 
  next project – the 007 franchise, "Tomorrow Never Dies." </p>
<p>Stealing scenes from Brosnan and every other character on the screen, Michelle 
  was cast as a Chinese special intelligence agent and redefined the image of 
  the prototypical Bond girl - destroying all stereotypes associated to it. "The 
  director and the producers were looking for a woman of the 90s, a woman who 
  was on a par with James Bond." she says. "It was time to take the Bond series 
  into the 21st century, and the roles for women now are a lot stronger; not necessarily 
  more butch, but able to maintain that balance of being feminine and being able 
  to take care of themselves at the same time." </p>
<p><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="header"><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body"><span class="body"><img src="images/michelleyeoh/michelleyeoh_silvergun.jpg" width="125" height="88" align="right"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>What's 
  great was Michelle won the role not originally scripted for an Asian, something 
  uncommon in Hollywood for a lead character. "There was no definition of where 
  [Bond’s co-star] came from. She could have been Russian, she could have been 
  Chinese, she could have been anyone," Michelle points out, drawing attention 
  to the fact that "they were not looking specifically for an Asian. [Cross-cultural 
  casting] is acceptable, and people are more and more aware of that." But, she 
  concedes, "changes like this always take time." </p>
<p>As for her next project with Media Asia, group managing director Thomas Chung 
  is "delighted to be entering this agreement with Michelle ... It gives us the 
  chance to draw upon not only her talents as a performer, but also her invaluable 
  experience in the international film industry. </p>
<p>Today, Terence Chang is her manager and represents only two actors --Yeoh and 
  Chow Yun-Fat. "This business is so crazy," says Chang, who has successfully 
  shepherded the career of John Woo in Hollywood, "that I only want to work with 
  nice people, and Michelle's one of the nicest." </p>

  the release of <a href="anglee.html">Ang Lee's</a> "Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
  Dragon," Michelle is currently keeping up with a frantic publicity schedule. 
  Also considering another film, "Mint Condition" with John Woo and Terence Chang 
  as the producers, one thing is for sure: Whatever project she picks, Michelle 
  has many more death-defying stunts and fight scenes to go.</p>
<p> Just one of the many questions in the interview: </p>
<p><b>ASTYLE</b>: Well what about performing your own stunts. You have as many 
  injuries on your body as Jackie Chan. Does it ever worry you? </p>
<p><b>Michelle Yeoh</b>: You know for me, when I am doing a film, that character 
  is me. The things that are being shown on film are supposed to be me and I truly 
  enjoy doing that, because outside of that situation you can't do it in real 
  life. You can't just go running up the wall and jump off it, or whatever it 
  is. It is very challenging physically and mentally as well. To be able to tell 
  yourself, to be able to train to a certain level where you can start performing 
  these kinds of sometimes off-beat crazy stunts. I do them and you have to be 
  very honest and careful about what you do. There is no absolute guarantee that 
  you are going to be completely safe. You've seen in many instances, anytime 
  you have a stunt, there is ALWAYS that risk factor. You know a lot of the time 
  you find that with the bigger stunts, people generally don't get hurt. It is 
  always the easier ones, the ones you know you've already done a gazillion times 
  before that things happen. We're all human, things happen that we don't want 
  to, because all we want is to complete the movie. Even in "Crouching Tiger, 
  Hidden Dragon" I was badly injured and I had knee surgery. (She was doing a 
  jumping kick that tore her ACL) But I'm recovering from that and moving on...&quot;</p>
