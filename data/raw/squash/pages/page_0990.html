<b>Harvesting and Storing Pumpkin and Winter Squash</b><br><br><img src="images/pumpkins.jpg" alt="Pumpkins" width="250" height="188" border="0" align="left"> 
Harvest all types of winter squash (butternut, acorn, and spaghetti) and pumpkin before frost.  Squash are ready for harvest when the rind is hard enough to resist fingernail scratches.  Cut the stem 2 to 4 inches from the fruit.  Pumpkins and squash without stems do not store well.  Handle fruit carefully to keep them in good condition.  Slightly immature squash and pumpkin can be used if they are cured properly.  Curing helps toughen the skins of immature fruit and helps heal cuts and scratches. <br><br>
Cure squash and pumpkin for 10 days at temperatures of 80 to 85 degrees F. and a relative humidity of 80 to 85%.  Use a space heater with a large pan of water for humidity similare to curing a thermostatically controlled electric heater or use a corner of the garage partitioned off with a sheet of plastic to make your curing chamber.  A small fan will maintain good air circulation and uniform distribution of heat.
<br><br>
Squash and pumpkin deteriorate rapidly if stored at temperatures below 50 degrees F.  The best storage temperature is between 50 and 55 degrees F.  Fruit that has been exposed to freezing before harvest also will deteriorate rapidly.  A relative humidity of 75% is satisfactory.  Keep the surface of the fruit dry to prevent or retard growth of decay fungi and bacteria.  Air circulation helps to prevent moisture from forming on surfaces of the fruit.<br><br>

Provide shelves for storage of pumpkin and squash.  Do not store fruit on cold concrete floors.  Promptly discard any fruit that show signs of decay.  Some of the more durable squash may be stacked on top of each other if adequate room is provided for air circulation.  Do not store pumpkin or squash near apples, pears, or other ripening fruite that release ethylene gas.  This will cause yellowing of the squash and will shorten storage life. <br><br>

The length of storage life varies according to the variety and type of squash or pumpkin.  At 50-55 degrees F., acorn and butternut squash can have a storage life between 1-3 months.  Hubbard, banana, buttercup, and cushaw squash will last between 3-6 months.  Jack O'Lantern pumpkins will last 2-3 months. <br><br>

<b>Harveting and Storing Sweetpotatoes:</b><br><br>

When jack frost is about to announce its presence, you know it's time to harvest sweetpotatoes.  When frost warnings are predicted, go out to the garden and first cut away all the vines where they enter the soil and remove them to make digging easier.  Then use a stone fork to loosen up; the soil as you dig.  If you use a shovel, be careful not to slice into any roots as they will spoil faster in storage. <br><br>

Gently dig up the roots and let the soil dry on the tubers.  Then brush off any loose soil and bring them inside to cure.   Curing is a process whereby high temperatures and humidity are maintained for about a week.<br><br>

Place an electric space heater in a closet and maintain a temperature of 85-90 degrees and place a large pan of water to maintain high humidity.  Turn on a fan for good air circulation.  Curing will heal cuts and bruises made on the roots during harvesting and will reduce decay and shrinkage in long term storage because it allows the periderm tissue to thicken and re-form.  Curing also converts some starches to sugars, enhancing flavor and making them sweeter than non-cured roots.<br><br>

Curing should be started within 1-2 hours after digging and continued for 4-& days.  When roots are dug early in the season when soil and air temperatures are warm, the roots will cure in a shorter time than later in the season when the roots start out cooler.  When is curing complete?  When you can take your thumb and gently rub the sweetpotatoe and the outer skin no longer peels off easily.  If it does peel, then dure for a few more days and test them again.<br><br>

After curing, store sweetpotatoes at 55-60 degrees F. with 85-90% humidity and plenty of air circulation if possible.  At temperatures above 60 degrees F., internal breakdown, shrinking, and sprouting can occur.  Temperatures below 55 degrees F. may cause hardcore, a disorder where a whitish, hard area appears in the cooked sweetpotato.  Properly cured and stored sweetpotatoes can be held up to 10 months with little reduction in quality.  Shrinkage occurs at 1-2% per month if cured, as compared to 2-5% if uncured.  In some varieties, pithiness (woodiness) increases with length of storage.
