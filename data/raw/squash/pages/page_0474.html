Kerri took me out on a date last night to <a href=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/nytoday/rst.html?st=rst&rid=1002207992047>Pearl Oyster Bar</a> and it was scrumptious.  We shared a dozen oysters and I had a lobster roll that was huge.  Also we had a praline butterscotch parfait for dessert.  I had such a full belly at the end that I entered a state of ecstasy and I totally let her get fresh with me.  Yes, I can be bought.
<p>
I have absolutely no plans (or recommendations) for the weekend because I have to spend the next four days learning how to write for the kind of man who might enjoy reading things like the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue.  I figure it should really only take me a day because they don't actually know how to read, right?  Don't they just look at the pictures?
<P>
I will, of course, be watching the Oscars on Sunday night.  Doesn't it seem really quiet this year?  Like there's just not a lot of Oscar fever going on, but I'm not sure why.  For the record, my picks:
<p>
<b>Best Picture</b><br>
"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" <br>Yes.  Yes yes yes.<p>

<b>Leading Actor</b><br>
Bill Murray in "Lost in Translation"
<br>  I didn't really like the movie so much but I love him.<p>

<b>Leading Actress</b><br>
Samantha Morton in "In America" 
<br>
I know she won't win.  It's going to be Charlize and she will look beautiful and she gained weight and blah blah blah.  But Samantha Morton was sublime in this role.<p>


<b>Directing</b><br>
"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" - Peter Jackson <br>They might give it to Clint because everyone loooves Clint since he is nine million years old yet still hot but Jesus, Peter Jackson created three amazing films for us all, let's show him a little appreciation.<p>

 	
<b>Actor in a supporting role</b><br>
Djimon Hounsou in "In America" <br>He probably won't win it but he was awesome.  It'll be Tim Robbins I think.  <p>

<b>Actress in a supporting role</b><br>
Renée Zellweger in "Cold Mountain" <br>Oh my god this woman totally wants it.  Just give it to her already.  She was probably the girl who put up posters of herself for prom queen.  I didn't see any of these movies except for "Pieces of April" which was a piece of crap but Patricia Clarkson still made me cry at the end because that's how good she is.  It should have been Hope Davis for "American Splendor" anyway, but since they didn't nominate her I say just give it to the girl who would cry the most.  I love to see people lose their dignity in front of 100 million people.<p>


<b> Documentary feature</b><br>
"Capturing the Friedmans" -  Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling <br>This movie completely freaked everyone out and people like to be freaked out.<p>

<b>Adapted Screenplay</b><br>
"American Splendor" -  Robert Pulcini & Shari Springer Berman <br>This was one of my favorite movies last year.  Why did this not get more nominations?<p> 

<b>Original Screenplay</b><br>
"In America" -  Jim Sheridan & Naomi Sheridan & Kirsten Sheridan <br>It would be so great if they won and they brought those cute little girls from the film up on stage with them.  Did you see this movie yet?  No?  Go see it. The cute little girls are amazing.  I fear stupid Sofia Coppola with her stupid flat shoes and uncombed hair and trust fund may win this instead and I will throw things at my television set if she does.  <p>

<b>Music (original song)</b><br>
"A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" from "A Mighty Wind" - Michael McKean and Annette O'Toole <br>Yes.  Lenny gets an Oscar.  It must happen.<p>




Have a great weekend!  Get out there and enjoy that sunshine!  Spring, it's just thirty days away.    <i>(2/26/04)</i><br><br>

Fucking A, I'm going to see this next year.  From <a href=http://nytimes.com/2004/02/27/arts/design/27INSI.html>"A $20 Million Bilbao Project for Serra"</a>:
<p>
<i>The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has given the sculptor Richard Serra what its officials describe as not only one of the grandest but also one of the most expensive contemporary art commissions of any museum in the world.
<p>
For its branch in Bilbao, Spain, the Guggenheim has asked Mr. Serra to create a room-size installation of monumental steel sculptures, including seven new ones...When the new sculptures join "Snake," Mr. Serra's first commission for Bilbao, there will be 1,208 tons of his steel sculptures in one room...The new works will all be made of Cor-Ten steel, which changes color as it ages. Their surfaces will go from gray to orange to a deeper orange and end up amber, the artist said. As the steel changes color over 8 to 10 years, its surface becomes smoother and more even in texture.</i>

June, 2005.  Who wants to go with me?  <i>(2/26/04)</i><br><br>

Please do not miss <a href=http://www.howtokickpeople.com>How To Kick People</a> tonight, Wednesday, 2.25.  Todd and Bob are funny and all, but Jesus, Jen Kirwin is reading.  She's the best! <i>(2/25/04)</i><br><br>	
		<b>We all make mistakes.  </b>Once I went out with a guy - we'll call him Wally -   who was a complete piece of shit.  I dated him so much longer than I should have, but I guess I got caught up in his lies.  He borrowed money from me and said he was helping his mom pay her rent, and then (of course) never paid me back. He got into fights all the time with people who were weaker and smaller than him and made up stories about wrongs they had supposedly done to him.  And he never acted like he was responsible for anything!   I guess I believed him because he was such a good liar, and also because all of his friends, who were loud and articulate, backed up his stories.       Deep down I knew Wally was dishonest and stupid, but there wasn't anyone else around that was available so I stuck with him.  It was not a proud moment in my life.  My best friend at the time was this gay guy, Ethan, who used to say, "Sweetheart, you can do so much better than him!  Now let's go dancing!" And when I realized Wally wasn't going to pay me back, and that he was picking on helpless people, and that his only gift was his fast tongue, I decided to break up with him.  As I listed all his wrongs and called him on all his bullshit he turned to me and said, "Well at least I'm not friends with a fag.  What the fuck is wrong with you?"
		<p>
		Do not for a second think that <a href=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/24/elec04.marriage.reacts/index.html>George W. Bush's proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage</a> is anything more than a distraction from the fact that he has been a crappy president for the last three and a half years.  Please vote against him and all of his evil plans. <i>(2/25/04)</i><br><br>

<b>I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am when people search my site for "straight men kissing."  I'm #10 on Google for that shit.  Life goals I didn't even know existed are being achieved daily because of people, just like you, who are obsessed with closeted men who kiss each other.  Thanks!</b>
<p>
I woke up this morning insanely happy.  Right before I went to sleep I had a bunch of ideas about how to fix some pieces I'm working on, and I kept having to run down the stairs of the loft to write them down so that I wouldn't forget them overnight, which sometimes I tend to do.   When I woke I was so invigorated by the idea that I would be able to make significant edits tonight that I felt a special kind of high, the kind you can only get from being creative.  It was a very tasty feeling, and I thought for sure I was going to have a great day.
<p>
Then I had to walk a mile in the snow to get to the subway, and then I went into work and they didn't have a computer for me, and the workspace they had set up for me is right outside the HR Director's office which is sort of like sitting outside the principal's office, and then they didn't have a creative brief for me in our big meeting so I left early, so early, in fact,  it was actually only lunch time.  (Let's pray for an easier tomorrow for my employers, shall we?)  Anyway Kerri and I were both in a funny mood and it was snowing outside and we were kind of lost in our own thoughts, so much to contemplate on a Tuesday, yes, yes, yes,  and then we walked into Grand Central Station and we saw the gentlemen pictured above playing in some sort of squash championship and then we both brightened considerably because at least we weren't playing <a href=http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/newspage.asp?Key=69>fucking squash in a fucking train station</a>.  
<p>
After that I walked in the snow some more to go see my accountant Marty and it doesn't look good this year, kids, it doesn't look good at all.  I hate the idea that I am going to have to pay someone $300 to tell me I owe money, especially when I barely have the money to pay that person in the first place.
<p>
Then I took the subway forever and walked some more in the snow, stupid pissy rainy snow, through the LES, finally landing at Lotus, where I was supposed to meet <a href=http://ww.krucoff.com>Krucoff</a> later to give him his keys back.  (Don't ask me why I have his keys.  I just do.)  I sat by myself and then eventually a group of men, all friends,  all Bohemians (I know I'm the only person left on the planet who uses that word.  Fuck you.  When you can think of a better word for it you let me know.  And please don't let it be anything <A href=http://www.lowculture.com/archives/000562.html>you read in like, Wired</a>.  Because I will cut you.), all from the neighborhood I guess, sat at tables surrounding me, until one of them eventually said, "It's almost like you're in our party," and they introduced themselves to me, and I smiled and carried on doodling in my notebook and reading <i><a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0802139612/qid=1077669829/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-8293859-1868906?v=glance&s=books>Dumped</a></i> and eavesdropping on their conversation.  Their chatter was nothing extraordinary, but two really hilarious things did happen. 
<p>
The first was my introduction to that cat pictured up there.  His owner walks him around on a leash which was the cutest, but beyond that, and I so wish I had pictures of it, was the little babushka he had on his head to protect him from the rain.   Just this little plaid piece of cloth tied around his cute little head -- like if there had been an all kitty version of <a href=http://www.broadwaymasterworks.com/bway/FiddlerOnTheRoof.html>Fiddler on the Roof</a> this cat would totally have played the matchmaker.   Which sort of reminds me of the end of <a href=http://bestinshowonline.warnerbros.com/flash/intro.html>Best in Show</a> where the gay couple make a calendar of pictures of their dogs dressed up like characters from classic old films, but in a far, far less elaborate (and gay) way.  (By the way, if you've never checked out that site and were a fan of the film, there are some great outtakes on there.  Click on "Toy Group."  You know you want to.)  Cat's name was "Coochie" by the way.
<p>
And the second thing was this crazy stinky old lady wearing a housedress and combat boots  who came in and started bumming cigarettes and talking to the guys.   At one point she left her coffee and excused herself to take a "pit stop."   When she came back she told us she was sad that her cats had been taken away, presumably by the city, and she whined about how she wanted to go see them.  "My daughter says don't do it, you'll only hurt them because you'll only walk out on them again, and you'll hurt yourself because you can't take them with you."  And then one of the guys in the group said, "That reminds me of something Malcom X said: <a href=http://www.proudblackbuddhist.org/Malcolm_X__vs/Page_6x.html>'You can't put kittens in the oven and call them biscuits.'</a>" 
<p>
 Now wouldn't it be cute if the kittens were wearing little aprons and chef's hats? <i>(2/24/04)</i><br><br>

Drove to Jersey in a van today, and I wasn't even bound and gagged in the back seat like usual.   Why?  Because IKEA and Target waited for me across the border, they waited for a sucker like me with open, brightly lit and reasonably priced arms.   Do I need a new toothbrush holder?  Who cares - it's only two dollars!   Also there are the candles and the candle holders and the multiple instances of cleaning fluids that I already own, but someday I will obviously run out of.  Also I bought <i>four</i> rugs.  But they were only five dollars each!  I couldn't control myself.  There must be a name for this syndrome, when a hardened New Yorker goes bargain shopping in New Jersey and loses her freaking mind.  Or was I simply IKEA'd?

<p>
Last night I dreamed about the residents of nursing homes taking pictures of themselves with lions and tigers on loan from the city zoo.  The whole dream took place in Seattle.  Lions are a good omen, says the dream book.  A symbol of social distinction and business leadership.  Let's hope so.
<p>
Back to work at the agency tomorrow plus I think I have a new client I'll be working on at night.  Postings may or may not be sporadic over the next month, but recognize it is not because I don't love you, it's just because I love myself more.   <i>(2/23/04)</i><br><br>

The party was good this weekend, thanks for asking.  So much good champagne, so little time, mostly because I kicked everyone out at 2:30 because I was tired because my insane neighbor had a nervous breakdown in the hallway on Saturday morning at 3 AM because she couldn't find her keys because she was drunk because she is very, very young.  I could keep going with this but I will stop.  Let this be a lesson to you, though.  Don't drink and...uh, try to get in your front door.   
<p>
Anyway, I'm off to IKEA for the day with Jules and Will as they try to furnish their new home together and I try for once and all to find a bathroom cabinet that I like (and that someone else will put together for me).  <i>(2/23/04)</i><br><br>

<a href=http://www.madorangefools.com>Jules</a> and I went shopping for her wedding dress all day yesterday.  Whee!  I made her go to the all expensive stores and look at five thousand dollar dresses because this is America and even if we can't afford expensive things we are still allowed to stare at them on display.  I have to admit, it was kind of nice to be in a store not crowded with racks of clothes and blaring lights and bad European techno music for once in my life, which seems to be the level of shopping I can afford as of late.  Then we went to Tiffany's, and though I know (and am constantly reminded by everyone around me) that there's a lot of blood associated with diamonds, oh my goodness did they sparkle!  All of a sudden I was like, where is that rich doctor my grandmother told me to marry?  I want something pretty!  I want something shiny!
<p>
And then Jules slapped me in front of H&M and reminded me of the contract I signed in order to get into my first punk rock show, wherein I will always be attracted to starving artists for the rest of my life.  Thanks, Jules.  Thanks for bringing me back to reality.
<p>
Also we went to Central Park and I took some pictures and you can look at them if you like.  But only if you're a starving artist.  View <a href="javascript:launchwin('022104.html','newwindow','height=410,width=1040,

I had a job interview today where all we did was talk about breasts.  For an hour. Swear to god.  
<p>
Later on I met Mac at Cafe Pick Me Up and we took a slow walk through the park and around the East Village.  Did you know there's a library on 10th between A and B?  I had never noticed it before.  Apparently the joint used to be filled with cockroaches.  Don't know if it is anymore.  (If you've been there recently, <a href=mailto:jami@whatever-whenever.net>let me know</a>.)

There's this dude that lives down the hall from that I don't like that much.  (I know: shocking.)  I have greeted him, I have made eye contact with him, I have held the door open for him (both downstairs and upstairs), I have left the mailbox open for him.   Like, I have tried, I really have.   And he's kind of this dirty hipster boy, so whatever, but he's got a great dog so I guess I wanted to be able to pet his dog.  He just shuffles along, though, not acknowledging my existence.  And I want to think, maybe he is shy.  But I kind of just think he's this dirty, snotty hipster, and he is too cool to talk to the girl down the hall.  And then I saw him once at Enid's, where he was having brunch with his friends and he was laughing and smiling, so that confirmed it, he is capable of joy.  He simply hates me.  So no new friend for me.  Fine.  
<p>
Anyway I was reading <i>Vice</i> at the cafe the other day and there was <a href=http://www.viceland.com/issues/v11n1/htdocs/homo.php>a picture of him and his band</a> in there and then I was like, now I really don't like him.  Because you're supposed to not like people in <i>Vice</i>, right?  Or is it you're supposed to not like yourself for reading <i>Vice</i>?  Goddammit, I'm so confused now. <i>(2/19/04)</i><br><br>

Once again <a href=http://www.thestranger.com>The Stranger</a> is turning me on with their annual <a href=http://www.thestranger.com/current/feature.html>hottest Seattle people who work in bars and shit</a> issue.  (That's just what I'm calling it.  I think it's called something else.)  Check out those clear Pacific Northwest complexions!  Not a line on their faces, not a care in the world, 'cause they live in a pretty place and smoke a shitload of pot!  My pick:  <a href=http://www.thestranger.com/current/ex2.html>Baristas</a>!  I'd get with any of them except for the clearly gay guy at the bottom.  (Of course: bottom.)  Oh who am I kidding?  It's Seattle.  They're all gay!   Bonus points for the following quote: <a href=http://www.thestranger.com/current/ex8.html>"I'd like to lick Alfredo sauce off his ass-crack." </a>   <i>(2/11/04)</i><br><br>

When I take pictures of people in New York, they often primp: adjust their hair, move to better lighting, give me art direction ("Not too close, and shoot from the right."), generally behaving as if their picture could end up on "Page Six."  Which I guess it could.  Stranger things have happened.
<p>
  When I take pictures of people in San Francisco, all they do is mug.  They're all about the <b>wacky</b> faces.  They don't give a shit who is going to see the picture, and, in fact, feel that the picture will be better if they stick out their tongue or jut out their lower lip.  And indeed, the pictures are more fun to look at - I mean, they make me laugh - although sometimes I just would like them to stop mugging and look pretty.  
  <p>
  And that, my friends, is the divide between the East Coast and the West Coast for me.  I guess they're both equally self-aware, but in a very different way.  Which one suits me best?  I can't wait to see what happens. 
  <p>
   In the meantime, take a look at what happened when I tried to get a bunch of San Franciscans to smile nice for the camera.  They literally could not <i>not</i> mug.  
Like I would say, "Please don't make a funny face," and they would try and then they would start laughing and stick their finger up their nose or something.  They're all totally high and lovely on the West Coast.

<i>Dirty Faces</i>
<p>
I think I took pictures for only about a minute last night at the Oakley Hall/Dirty Faces show at Lit last night.  Why?  Because I was drunk, that's why.  Which apparently I kept announcing to everyone.  Why?  Because I am an idiot, that's why.  Because I am 32 years old and I still think it's funny and/or amazing when I'm drunk.  Actually, now that I think about it, if I started to take it for granted I might be a little worried.  Like if it stopped being fun <s>or special</s> why would I even want to do it anymore?  <i>(2/11/04)</i><br><br>

Waiting in line outside of the <a href=http://www.dresdendolls.com>Dresden Dolls</a> show at Joe's Pub, <a href=http://www.maura.com>Maura</a> and I caught up last night:
<p>
<b>Me:</b> I got my bike fixed today, that money pit.  Forty bucks for new chains.   I guess I shouldn't have ridden it in the snow though, it was totally rusted out.  Or the rain either...<br>
<b>Maura:</b> Or the sleet.<br>
<b>Me:</b> Or peed on it.<br>
<b>Maura:</b> Or let other people pee on it.<br>
<b>Me:</b> I guess I shouldn't have had that pee party.
<p>
And then we looked around and realized we were in public and that maybe normal people don't talk about things like that and promptly changed topics. 
<p>
Dresden Dolls were pretty great, though.  They have this <i>Cabaret</i> look and feel but then the immensely talented lead singer - she was a great singer, but man, can she write - talks about fucking and backstabbing and things like that.  I don't hear a hit single, but I don't think they're aiming for airplay anyway.   Also any show at Joe's Pub is going to be awesome.  All the way in the back I felt like they were right next to me.

Do you think me posting these pictures is like: I had a vacation and you didn't - ha!  Or do you think me posting these pictures is like: Oh my god thank god I  had a vacation so that I didn't end up on a killing spree on the LES and here is the evidence that I did so, just in case anyone else goes insane.  Or do you think it's just me showing you dreamy pictures of vineyards and children and trees because I just think it's awful pretty?

I pick "C" too.
