              &quot;So how about giving me a lesson on variety then&quot; I quipped. 
              This lesson messed with my head/twisted my mellow/pickled my brain/destroyed 
              my squash karma etc etc. </font></font> <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
                a methodical scientist, I knew that my game was a touch predictable, 
                not something that I was particularly proud of, as I'd thought 
                that I could sell a dummy or wee shimmy with the best of them. 
                I had myself convinced that this coach chap was just lucky to 
                be standing in the right place every time that I had really played 
                what was really a masterfully deceptive stroke. With his usual, 
                if somewhat ironically, predictability, the coach successfully 
                shattered my illusions and allowed me to prove to him just how 
                predictable my squash game really was.</font></p></td>

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                Always playing into space. This fault struck me as a bit of an 
                oddball, given that I had always been taught to hit the ball to 
                where the opposition wasn't. </font></p>

                Don't always play into the space. Consider the sequence where 
                the opponent has played crosscourt from front right&#133; the 
                sensible shot is to play the straight drive to back left thereby 
                moving him across the diagonal. But if he knows you're always 
                going to play to back left, then he knows where he has to run 
                to recover the ball - it's predictable. <br>

                occasionally playing the boast to move the ball back to front 
                right the opponent will be totally wrong footed. More importantly 
                is that he will now have to wait and see if you will play the 
                boast the next time, this time making the original straight drive 
                an even more effective shot. </font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                Dodgy footwork limiting choice of shot. At the front right I was 
                playing every shot off the right foot, my only options were either 
                a difficult to control drop or very predictable crosscourt. (Most 
                of the lesson highlighted how difficult I found it not to play 
                the crosscourt in this scenario - and even when I felt I'd disguised 
                it well the coach was always standing waiting ready to slam it 
                to the left back corner or wrong foot me back to front right!)</font></p>

                As detailed in the dropshot lesson&#133; make the effort to get 
                footwork right. In the front right corner play off the left foot; 
                this allows you to choose straight drop/straight drive/crosscourt 
                lob&#133; or even a crosscourt drive. If you are able to choose 
                to play a different shot from the same position, you have then 
                got a little more variety in your game and have become less predictable.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                coach did pick out other things I was doing in the game to be 
                totally honest my head just got too puddled to remember the rest.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[After 
                this lesson, I really wondered if I had actually learnt anything! 
                But with a few weeks of trying to apply the points above, rather 
                than just doing the headless chicken thing, I have started to 
                see what the coach was getting at.]</font></p></td>
