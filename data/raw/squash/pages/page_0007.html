<ul>
<li><a href="nose.jpeg">Grazed face</a>
[  17k].

<small>
<p>
I moved to Berkeley, from Nottingham, in March.
Cleverly, I managed to fall off
my bicycle just before going, turning my face into even less of a pretty
sight than usual. [Photo taken in Fred's flat.]</p>

<li><a href="fred1.jpeg">Fred and me in San Francisco</a>
[  45k] |
<a href="fred2.jpeg">At Lake Tahoe</a>
[  75k].

<small>
<p>Fred came to visit me at the end of June. In the first photo,
we are wearing Wimbledon hats in San Francisco. In the second, we are
sitting on the shore of Lake Tahoe [looking a bit regal].</p>
</small>

<li><a href="sequoia.jpeg">Sequoia national park</a>
[  71k].

<small>
<p>In August, I went on a three-day hiking trip in Sequoia national park, with
[standing from the top left in the photo] Angelika, Michael, me, Tanja, Andy,
and [sitting from the left] Alan and Roberto. This is us at the end of the
trip, feeling very tired.</p>
</small>

<li><a href="tony.jpeg">Tony's 50th</a>
[  23k].

<small>
<p>My good friend Tony from Winnipeg was having a "surprise" 50th birthday
party on 30 August. Here he is being silly [as usual].</p>
</small>

<li><a href="mum.jpeg">Mum and me</a> [  34k]
| <a href="botanical.jpeg">Me at the Botanical gardens</a>
[  51k].

<small>
<p>I got back from Winnipeg on 1 September, and my Mum arrived in Berkeley
on 2 September! The first photo is of us having a drink in Santa Cruz, the
second is of me at the Botanical gardens near the Lawrence Berkeley Labs,
which we visited together.</p> 
</small>

<li><a href="santacruz.jpeg">Thanksgiving at Seth's Grandma's</a>
[  34k].

<small>
<p>Seth in the lab invited some guys [including me] to his Grandma's
in Santa Cruz for Thanksgiving [27 November]. Here we are trying to walk
off some of the turkey dinner. From the left: me, Ryan [in my department],
Fred [in the lab], and Seth.</p>
</small>

<li><a href="birthday.jpeg">My birthday at Claudia's in Winnipeg</a>
[  58k].

<small>
<p>Tragically, Tony died on 25 August. It was completely unexpected. I
was very glad I managed to see him on his 50th birthday [see above]. I
spent my birthday [12 December] with his family. On the left of the table
are [from the left]
Kathy [his daughter], Marjorie [a family friend], me, and Claudia [his wife].
On the right are [from the right] Cheryl, Ben [a not-too-bad squash player!],
and Cheryl's two children.

<li><a href="squash.jpeg">Marc and me playing squash</a>
[  26k]
| <a href="badminton.jpeg">Badminton partners</a>
[  16k].

<small>
<p>Marc was visiting Berkeley for one semester from the London Business
School. Here he is demonstrating a perfect squash forehand. [Thanks, Mike, for
bravely taking the photo.] The second photo is of [from the left]
Roberto [from the lab], Keith [a friend of Michel's], and
Michel [from the lab] after a game of badminton.</p>
