The Scottish papers had crowed in full page spreads this morning that Martin Heath was on his way to an all-Scottish British Open finals. Whether Jonathon read the papers or not, he showed full focus and concentration for this match.</font></b></p>
			<p><font color="black" size="2"><b>Jonathon's touch game and phenomenal anticipation and reflexes gave&nbsp;Martin fits from the outset. </b></font></p>
			<p><font color="black" size="2"><b>There were a number of great rallies in the first two games, but Heath occasionally gave up the points easily with loose shots that Power converted to winners or strokes.</b></font></p>
			<p><font color="black" size="2"><b>It was in the third game that Heath upped the stakes by ramming Power into the corner of the court well after the point was concluded. Power was losing 10-3 at that point in the third, but that action fired him up. From there on, the match was punctuated by get after surprising get by Power matched only by his touch into the front corners. <a href="britishopen99b8.htm">[read Martin Bronstein's account]</a></b></font></p>
