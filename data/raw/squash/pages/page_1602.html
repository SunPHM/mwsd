    <b>NICOL MAKES HIS MARK</b><br>
    As most of my other predictions have bitten the dust, I might as well make 
    another one: Peter Nicol will win this British Open and </font><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><img src="../photos/debranew/peternicol/MChalonerPNicolI49.jpg" width="250" height="339" align="left" alt="Peter Nicol and Mark Chaloner at 2001 Irish Open" vspace="3"></font></font></font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">go 
    back to world number one. </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I 
    watched him closely in his match against 11th seeded Mark Chaloner and he 
    was effortless. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even 
    after 71 minutes of fairly continuous activity Nicol appeared not to be even 
    breathing heavily. This never promised to be a thriller; Chaloner has got 
    more of a reputation as an athlete than a scintillating squash player and 
    his thighs are those of a footballer compared to the skinny things that Nicol 
    moves around on. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>BUTTING 
    HORNS</b> <br>
    The nature of the first game revealed itself inside the first two points – 
    after 5 ½ minutes the score was 1-all. It promised to be a long evening as 
    the two players thrashed the ball to the back in 30- or 40 shot rallies, the 
    squash equivalent of deer clashing horns. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
    interesting thing was that Chaloner kept the ball on the left side, Nicol’s 
    forehand. Right handers tend to do this out of instinct, sending the ball 
    to the opponent’s backhand. According to a top ten player sitting next to 
    me, it was entirely the wrong thing to do. “With Peter you throw everything 
    on to his backhand; he has trouble turning on that whole side of the court,” 
    he said. And after the first game had past the 20 minute mark, he said with 
    ill-concealed contempt: “This is like watching paint dry.”</font></font></p>

    A LOT OF DIFFERENCE </b><br>
    Playing this sort of ‘length’ squash, there was not a lot to choose between 
    the two players as the ball spent most of the time in the back court with 
    just the odd trip to front. It was tight and well controlled squash but not 
    the sort of stuff that makes you hold your breath. Nicol’s consistency finally 
    told and he pulled ahead to win 15-7 after 27 minutes. Chaloner came back 
    for the second, still determined and took the upper hand to lead 10-6 with 
    the help of some fine winners and some dying length. But then Nicol started 
    working Chaloner front and back, drop and lob and side to side, to pull back 
    to 10-all and, when Chaloner was denied some lets, to 14-10 – a run of eight 
    points without reply. Chaloner got one more point with a forehand straight 
    nick before Nicol completed the game with a forehand drop to win 15-11 after 
    24 minutes. The gas tank were beginning to run dry and the third game was 
    over in 14 minutes , 15-9 in Nicol’s favour. </font></font></p>

    CONFIDENCE BUILDER</b><br>
    Nicol keeps looking better as he gets used to the very special qualities of 
    this dazzling glass court. With each match his confidence improves, and with 
    Power out of the way, he must feel, quite rightly, that a second British Open 
    title is a real possibility, to add to the historic title he won in 1998 when 
    he beat Jansher Khan.</font></font></p>

    <b>OWENS: THREE WINS AND A HICCUP</b><br>
    Second seed Carol Owens looks better than she has looked all year and her 
    controlled, unhurried accuracy and placement is a joy to behold. I could not 
    see the possibility of Fiona Geaves unseating her despite her vast experience 
    on the circuit. And so it proved with Owens exuding confidence and rarely 
    putting a foot or ball wrong. Geaves was not overwhelmed but Owens seemed 
    in control, using her precision rail shots on the backhand and finishing off 
    with backhand volley kills. After 15 minutes of good squash Owens had the 
    first game 9-4, and then ran like a train through the second game in five 
    minutes, 9-0. And then for no apparent reason, one of her cogs stopped meshing 
    and she was asking for lets and not getting them and Geaves was getting strokes 
    and somehow she could not get that control back and Geaves had the game 9-5. 
    After the break, Owens was on song again, running to a 6-0 lead in one hand, 
    and then to match ball before Geaves could earn a point. And then it was all 
    over 9-1 and we can only hope that Owens can take that confidence into the 
    final to give the other finalist - Joyce? Fitz-Gerald? – a real challenge. 
    </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>THE 
    ONE AND ONLY BATTLE</b><br>
    The final second round match in the woman’s tournament provided the only real 
    battle as Rebecca Macree and 8th seeded Rachael Grinham fought for 79 minutes 
    before Macree upset the seedings by hitting a backhand volley drive that nicked 
    to give her a 3/2 decision and he first ever appearance in a British Open 
    quarter-final. Seeded 13th Macree should really be in the top ten and if she 
    continues her comeback with her new mental outlook, she will make it. She 
    faces Owens in the quarters and will make a dogged opponent. </font></font></p>
