<!-- Opening Statement -->
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="2"><B>WELCOME BACK: </B>&nbsp; This week's newsletter is going to be a little different than what you are use to seeing. We've been gone on a short vacation for the past week and thought we'd share our travelogue with you. 
Also because we've been on vacation we didn't have time to get our usual projects together. The following is an abbreviated review and the pictures are shrunk down to save you some download time. You can see the complete travelogue with more pictures and text online at www.runnerduck.com/07-25-03_travelogue.<P> 

This vacation was a little different for us because it included Ken's band, The Tempos, playing for a fundraiser at the McAllister Flight Museum in Yakima, Washington. It's a great old museum founded in 1926 by Charles McAllister. He passed away a few years ago at age 90 but the museum continues in his memory.<p>

We left for Yakima last Friday, July 25th, at 10:00 in the morning. It was a hot sunny day with nothing but hot sunny weather forecasted for the entire trip. Our first stop was at the Indian John Hill rest stop where you have a great view of the Stuart Mountains, part of the Cascade range. They are often called the Washington Alps because of their jagged peeks.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com//images/7-03_washington_alps-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="134"></center><br>
The next stop was for lunch in Ellensburg. While looking for a place to eat we took a wrong turn, which ended up being a fun mistake. We stumbled upon Dick and Jane's place. Apparently they are couple of artists that have been turning their home into a work of art over the past 20 years.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_dickandjane1-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="130"></center><br>
After lunch it was on to Yakima. The road to Yakima from Ellensburg goes across the Yakima Firing Range and looks a lot like what I would imagine Iraq looks like. It must be a great place for our troops to train. We got to the Sportsman Park around 2:00 in the afternoon. The grounds are nicely maintained and lots of deciduous trees.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_sportsman-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></center><br>
It was about 95 degrees and very dry although there were sprinklers going all over the place. We got out and started to set up the trailer and were immediately attacked by mosquitoes. They were on us like flies on rotting meat. Fortunately we had some bug spray that kept them off.<P>

The next day the sun came up with vengeance and we were looking at another high 90+ degree day. We went through the travel brochures we got at the park office and about the only two things to do in the area were the Yakima Valley Museum and the Wine tours. Since it was way too hot to be drinking wine and driving we opted for the museum. It's a very nice museum with lots of local artifacts and collections from people in the area that have traveled around the world.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_yakima_museum2-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></center><br>
We thought it was a little disorganized with no real flow to the exhibits. I guess for the locals it's nice to see stuff from other parts of the world but for us travelers new to Yakima it would have been nice to see more stuff from the local area.<P>

From there it's off to find some arts and crafts stores but there are virtually none to be found. There is one cute little strip of shops called Track 29 that were all made from railroad cars but there was nothing there to really look at and it was too darn hot!<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_yakima_stores-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="127"></center><br>
We headed back to the air conditioning of our trailer and started getting ready for the performance at the air museum.<P>

The people putting on the dance had asked us to wear our formal outfits, which consists of pleated white shirts, black vests and black slacks. Wouldn't you know that Ken went off and forgot his black slacks? Oh darn, I guess he'll just have to wear shorts :-)<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_tempos1-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="182"></center><br>
They opened up the hanger doors which exposed us to the runway and mountains beyond, very pretty. All in all it was a very nice evening. The museum is already talking about having us back next year.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_tempos5-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></center><br>
We were going to stay at Sportsman Park through Sunday night but decided that there was nothing else to see or do in Yakima plus it was getting hotter. The weather forecast was for temperatures to reach 110 early in the week so off we headed for the mountains.<P>

We decided to go to a Thousand Trails park about 130 miles east and higher up in the mountains. It's a beautiful drive over White Pass at 4,500 feet high. Paradise campground is northwest of Mount St. Helens and southwest of Mount Rainier. When we arrived it was closer to the mid 80's, which was a little more tolerable. We picked out our campsite and set things up.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_paradise_park1-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></center><P>

Monday we thought it would be fun to check out Mount St. Helens. It has been 23 years since it had erupted and wanted to see the recovery of the area. The day was hot but then it's hot everywhere in Washington right now. If you've never been to Mt. St. Helens it's really quite a site. 
The lateral blast from the eruption traveled an average of 450 miles per hour with top speeds of 730. This created the blow down area that is still quite evident although there are signs of the area regenerating.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_st-helens1-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></center><br>
Spirit Lake has almost doubled in size but is about half full of blown down trees. The National Forest Service is leaving the area for nature to recover rather than trying to go in can clean everything up.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_st-helens3-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="464" height="112" alt=""></center><br>
The mountain its self is 1,300 feet shorter than before the eruption. Approximately 2/3's of a cubic mile of material was blown out from the mountain when it exploded. The reason all the trees are stripped bare is because the lateral blast saw temperatures as high as 750 degrees.<br>
<center><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_st-helens2-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></center><br>
If you ever have a chance to visit the area Mt. St. Helens is a "must see". There is nothing else like it in the entire United States.<P>

Tuesday it was back home. We went from Morton to Kirkland which goes through the tiny town of Elbe. It's most known for it's cute little church but it's also big on trains. There is a mule train you can take up into the mountains which looked like fun but the timing was off for us this time. We did check out their unique motel of old railroad cars.<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/7-03_elbe_hoboinn-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="320" height="240"></CENTER><br>
Each car is a different motel room. It's called the Hobo Inn and looks like a fun place to stay. They also have a restaurant that is an old railroad Pullman car. <P>
Like we said it was a short vacation planned around the band playing in Yakima. I think the next vacation we take on land will be either later in the year or earlier when the weather isn't so darn hot.<P>

We hope you enjoyed our little travelogue. Next week we should be back to our normal broadcasting. You can see our complete travelogue of this trip on line with more pictures and text. Just go to www.runnerduck.com/07-25-03_travelogue.

<B>What's New This Week?</B> This weekend is the big Seafair hydroplane races on Lake Washington. The Blue Angles are in town along with the Seafair Pirates. The weather is supposed to cool down into the 70's by the weekend and should be a great time on the shores of Lake Washington.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Batteries are the nemesis of all things portable and electric. If your batteries go dead while you are traveling it's pretty tough to take pictures, videos or make cell phone calls. There's nothing worse then getting to this great remote area and getting ready to take that once in a lifetime photo and see that flashing dead battery sign.<br>
To prevent this plan ahead! Take battery chargers with you. If it's a 110v charger plug it in overnight. If it's a 12v charger plug it into your cars accessory port while you drive. Take a spare set of batteries and keep one set always charged. Wrap the charged set with a green rubber band and the used set with a red rubber band. This way you can tell at a glance which batteries are good and those that need to be charged. Now get out there and enjoy some great vacation times.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever noticed how easy it is to recognize something by its logo? The Nike swoosh, the white on red Coca Cola script and just about any car ever manufactured. These symbols help make these products immediately recognizable.<br>
There is a web site that is dedicated to logos. While they don't have hundreds of logos yet they are growing all the time. Goodlogo shows you the progression of some logos along with a history of each. It's sort of fun to check them out to see where they came from.<br>
Just go to <a href="http://www.goodlogo.com/">www.goodlogo.com</a> and snoop around. You can even submit your own suggestion for a logo and vote on your favorite.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's that time of year when you take a trip to the ol' fishing hole and drop your line in the water. It doesn't matter if you catch anything because it's just so great to be out doors. If you should catch something that's the bonus. One thing that's no fun when fishing is having your gear all tangled up. This weeks project will help solve that problem.<P>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/fishing_gg_closed.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="110"></CENTER><br>
Here's what you'll need:</FONT>
<UL>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="2">
<LI>Nylon Rip Stop material</li>
<LI>1/2" Velcro</LI>
<LI>Thread</LI>
<li>Pinking scissors</li>
</FONT>
</UL>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="2">
Cut the material into a rectangle large enough to enclose your fishing gear. I cut ours to 5 1/2" X 8 1/4".<br>
Fold the edges over 1/2".<br>
Cut the Velcro so the hook side will go around the outside to within 1/2" of the center.<br>
Cut the other half, fuzzy side of the Velcro, so it fits the same way.<br>
Sew the Velcro and folded over nylon with stitching around the outside and inside of the Velcro strip.<p>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/fishing_pattern.jpg" border="0" width="290" height="202"></CENTER><p>
That's all there is to it. Now place your gear into the pouch.<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/fishing_gg_open.jpg" border="0" width="290" height="206"></CENTER><br>
Fold the pouch around the pole with the fishing gear inside.<P>
Now go fishing and have a great time.

The McAllister gig is over and on to the next. On Friday August 8th The Tempos are playing at the Bothell Landing in Bothell, Washington. They will be performing from 6:30 to 8:00. It's a great venue and you can bring your picnic and lawn chairs with you. Just follow the signs in Bothell to Bothell Landing.<br>
On Sunday August 10th we will be performing at the Ballard Locks. If you've never been to the Locks you are really missing out. It is one of the biggest tourist visits in the Seattle area. With The Tempos playing it's even better! We'll be playing from 2:00 until 4:00. Again, bring your picnic lunch and blanket, it's a great family outing.
<P>

You can check out our summer schedule at the Tempos web site <A HREF="http://www.thetempos.com/jobs.htm">www.thetempos.com/jobs.htm</A>. If you are making plans to visit Seattle this summer try to fit in one of our fun free concerts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you believe that every week for the past five weeks we've talked about someone famous that has passed away? Well this week is no different. Bob Hope passed away earlier this week at age 100. While he's not known for his great musical abilities he did produce an album that has gotten some pretty good reviews. It features many of his friends including Bing Crosby, Jimmy Durante and others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is absolutely unbelievable what we see people do to burn fuel while traveling. While we are sure you are none of these people we thought we'd mention one of the biggest wastes we saw.<br>
While climbing our way up to the Windy Ridge viewing area at Mt. St. Helens, at 4,170 feet above sea level, we saw huge motor homes towing small cars going up the hills. 
Some were gas motor homes and some were diesel. Either way they had to be getting about 4 miles per gallon. It seems to us that if they were to park their motor home somewhere near the bottom of the mountain and drive their tow vehicle up to the top they would save a ton of fuel not to mention wear and tear on the motor home. It takes a little bit of time to unhook and re-hook the tow vehicle but the savings has to be well worth the effort.

"The Taste of Summer : Inspired Recipes for Casual Entertaining" by Diane Rossen Worthington<P>
With the bounties of summer starting to come in this cookbook is a must have on how to prepare all that great food. Carrie Hampton from Columbus, Ohio wrote the following review of this cookbook. <br>
"This book is full of delicious and appealing recipes for summer. It's wonderfully put together, and so easy to follow. The recipes are easy enough that anyone (even those with little experience) could create wonderful and tasty meals. The photography is beautiful and it's enjoyably constructed. Highlights are the "Cold Lobster Salad" and the "Summer Squash Gratin" ...but, there are so many more that I can't wait to try. I recommend it to any cook out there!"

Understanding Engineers<P>
An architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was better to spend time with the wife or a mistress. The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship.<P>
The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because the passion and mystery he found there.<P>
The engineer said, "I like both."<P>
Both?"<P>
Engineer: "Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and get some work done."

            <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial"></center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marilyn thought it would be nice to have a little folding table for when we are camping. A place to sit our frosty mochas when we wind down from the days activities. Not only did the table need to fold up but it also need to be light. I think this simple design accomplished both.<P>

Here's what you'll need:<br>
<ul type="square">
  <li>1/2" X 4" X 24" Poplar (true 1/2" thick)</li>
  <li>1/2" X 6" X 72" Poplar (true 1/2" thick)</li>
  <li>1/4" X 6" X 36" Poplar (true 1/4" thick)</li>
  <LI>1" Dowel 12 1/4" long</LI>
  <LI>3/16" Dowel 6" long</LI>
  <LI>(2) 1/4" 20 X 1 1/2" Carriage head bolt</LI>
  <LI>(2) 1/4" 20 X 2" Carriage head bolt</LI>
  <LI>(6) 1/4" flat washers</LI>
  <LI>(6) 1/4" 20 Ny-Lock nuts</LI>
</ul>

Here are the dimensions and larger pictures of this project. Just click on the picture below.<br>
<CENTER><a href="http://www.runnerduck.com/folding_table_pictures.htm"></a><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/ft_dimensions-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="280"></a>

I used Poplar on this project to keep the weight down. You can use any type of wood you like. We also made ours out of 1/2" and 1/4" wood again for weight. You could use 3/4" and 1/2" to make it a little more stable.<br>
Cut four legs 2" X 28".<br>
Drill a 1" hole in the center of each leg. I double back taped two legs together to help with alignment.<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/ft_drill-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="290" height="218"></CENTER>
Leave the legs taped together and cut a full radius on each end.<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/ft_cut-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="290" height="218"></CENTER><br>
On one set of legs drill a 1/4" hole centered on the radius for one end. Counter sink a 3/8" hole for the head of the Carriage bolt.<br>
On the other set of legs cut a notch using this pattern.<br>
<CENTER><a href="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/ft_slot.jpg"><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/ft_slot-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="130" height="240"></a><br>(CLICK)</CENTER><br>
It's easiest if you drill a 3/4" hole and then cut the slot.<br>
Cut two table supports 1 1/2" X 27" X 1/2".<br>
Drill a 1/4" hole in each end. On one end of each piece drill the hole 1" in and 3/4" down. On the other end drill the holes 1" down and 1" in.<br>
Cut six top pieces 2 1/2" X 12" X 1/4". Depending on the exact length of our piece of wood you may have to adjust the length of the top pieces to account for the saw cut width.<br>
Lay out the top pieces with a 1/4" space between each piece. Align and glue the table supports centered 1 1/4" in from the edges with the offset hole farthest away from the top.<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://www.runnerduck.com/images/ft_top-thmb.jpg" border="0" width="290" height="218"></CENTER><br>
Cut the 1" dowel 1 1/4" long.<br>
Cut four 3/16" dowel pieces 1 1/2" long.<br>
Assemble the non notched legs to the table support on the end with the hole 1" X 1" using the 1 1/2" bolts.<br>
Put the dowel through the leg holes and peg them with the 3/16" dowels.<br>
Install the 2" Carriage bolts using a nut, washer, table support, washer and nut.<br>
Space the head of the bolt just far enough away from the table support to capture and hold the notch in the legs.<br>
Snug up all the nuts but not too tight. The tighter you make them the more stable the table will be but the harder it will be to fold it up.<P>
Now go find an easy chair, set your new table up next to it and enjoy your favorite beverage.
