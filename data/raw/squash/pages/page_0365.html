He could barely keep up with us.  We admonished Ian that, while we don't run fast, you need to do more than a walk.  Ian promised to improve his training and see if he can do better the next time he is in from Seattle.  The rest of us had a good run as we dragged Ian through the park.  There are a few <a href="album2000/index.htm">pictures in the photo album</a> including a couple of the tunnel that we use to start the run.</p>

He will get the real cool prize when I figure out what it is.  I will not disclose the actual milage.  Let that be the secret to get in the inner sanctum of the VHTRC.  You gotta go out and find it out for yourself.  And no fair writing it down. If I can remember it without writing it down, you can.  (It is made easier by the fact that some digits repeat themselves.)</p>

It's "Furbutt" by a landslide.  (Well, it's a landslide compared to a certain other election that isn't finished yet.)  The name "Furbutt" was suggested by Mike Weber who wins the coveted prize.  The prize is one of the cool scarfs that Ed Schultze brought to Andiamo.  The results are below. Thank you to all who voted!</p>

<p>NOTE: We recieved 7 votes from Palm Beach County, Banana Republic of Florida, for Pat Buchanan.  We are assuming that these voters wanted to name the bear "Al Gore."  "Furbutt" beat both "Al Gore" and "Pat Buchanan" so we don't need a hand recount.</p><br clear="left">

The weather was nearly perfect.  The two-week earlier date and the late fall foilage made for some green trees and a different look to the race.  Many VHTRC members particpated.  <a href="http://lib.allconet.org/jfk/2000/JFK00RES.TXT">Results</a> are on the <a href="http://lib.allconet.org/jfk/">JFK Web Site</a>.

Ian Torrence, who placed third overall, was on the winning Montrail team.  Prassad Gerard, Keith Moore, and Mike Campbell's team placed second. Russ Evans was on one of the many Reston teams.  His team got sixth. Meanwhile, Mike Weber was on Team Marine that won the Kennedy Cup (for the top military team).  None of these people, however, ran for a team with "VHTRC" in the name!  :-(&nbsp;  Not that we care, do we?  One other interesting item.  There were no all female teams that finished the minimum three members.  Ladies?

<p><strong>The Double:</strong> Bob Coyne, Kevin Sayers, Chris Scott, Carolyn Gernand, and Ed Schultze ran the <a href="http://www.marathonintheparks.com/">Marathon in the Parks</a> <em>after</em> running JFK the day before.  A picture of Chris Scott and Colleen Dulin (who did not do JFK) is in the <A href="index.htm">photo album</a>. (As usual, I am sure that someone else did this. Let me know if you did.</p>

<p><strong>Bill VanAntwerp Wins Age Group at Triathalon:</strong> Bill VanAntwerp won his age group in course record time at the <a href="http://www.greatfloridian.com/">Great Floridian Triathalon</a> on October 21.

Congratulations Bill!  <A href="javascript:makeNewWindow('album2000/work00-25.jpg',591,474,'Bill at Bottom Right')">...See Bill in training.</a></p>

<p><strong>Horton's Race:</strong> It was a great day for the Mountain Masochists 50 Mile Trail Run. On just looking through the <a href="http://davidhorton.simplenet.com/2000_mountain_masochist_overall.htm">results</a> the first time, saw that several club members finished including Ian Torrence (3rd overall), Rebecca Trittipoe (2nd woman), Colleen Dulin (3rd woman), Bill Gentry, Ben Clark, the Knipling boys (Gary and Keith), Gyula Kiss, Rollin Stanton, Chris Scott, Ed Schultze, Bob Coyne, and Bill Turrentine.  (As usual, I am sure I left someone out!)

<p><strong>Frank Probst Leads VHTRC Field at Arkansas Traveller 100:</strong> Frank came in 16th and set the course record for his age, 22:36, at the Arkansas Traveller 100 mile, October&nbsp;7-8. John Weitzel and Ed Demoney also finished.  Both Margie Schlundt and the Ancient Brit, Lou Myers, were cut off at the 85 mile aid station.  <a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~dblaikie/n09oc00f.html">The results</a> are on David Blaikie's <a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~dblaikie/">Ultramarathon World</a>.

The team, composed of the Knipling father-son duo (Gary and Keith) and President Joe Clapper, was the first all-male team and the first master team.  (That means that three teams with girls beat them.  Also, there must not have been any drug testing.)  Team VHTRC had the largest rooting section since Gary's close family came in numbers that Joe conservatively put at 120.    The picture above is used by permission of Venture Quest. For more pictures, go to the <a href="http://hemlock.gmu.edu/adventure/quest/raceday/">Results and pictures</a> are on the <a href="http://hemlock.gmu.edu/adventure/quest/main.htm">Venture Quest website.</a>  You will note that Keith has a cool bike shirt on while Gary and Joe just have cheezy t-shirts.

He was first in his age group and ninth overall.  (Excuse me, how can they take this out to four decimal places?  That's about six inches.  Only the USATF would do that.)  MMT veteran John Geesler won the event.  VHTRC member Charlie Wojic finished in 145th.  As usual, I am sure I missed others.  <a href="http://www.americanultra.org/olander/olanderframeset.htm">...Results</a></p>

He says that the elevation profile was like a bad EKG and the trails were steep, slippery, and bee-infested. "Many times during the race," says Karsten, "I heard, 'Aah! Bees! Bees! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!,' echoing through the woods." Selena finished as second woman overall in 2:08:45 (a week after tying for second at the VHTRC Women's Half-Marathon); Karsten ended up with a 2:49:40 and one bee sting; and Kathy was the top woman 50-59 in 4:11:28.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Torrence Wins Superior Trail 100:</strong> On September 9, Ian Torrence ran a 18:59:58 to win the Superior Trail 100.  <a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~dblaikie/n13se00a.html">His report on David Blaikie's Ultramarathon World site</a>.  Wasatch was the same day.  I saw some familiar names in the finishers list (Sue Johnson, Tom Green, Bert Meyer) but no VHTRC members.  I am sure I missed someone again.   On the next weekend, Patti Harden was the first master woman at the Garden State 50 Mile in a good, sub-9 hour time. (<a href="http://www.gardenstate50-50.org/pages.htm/results.htm">Results</a>)  This event received good reviews, which is what you would expect from race director Robin Rossow.   <a href="http://www.superiortrail100.com/">Superior Trail Web Site</a> | <a href="http://www.xmission.com/~cwgjr/wasatch.htm">Wasatch Front 100 Web Site</a></p>

<p><strong>Team Booz Allen gets 29th at the Eco Challenge:</strong> VHTRC member Maureen Moslow-Benway and her team from Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton finished in 29th place, out of over 70 teams, at the Eco-Challenge in Borneo.  Full information is available at <a href="http://www.ecochallenge.com">www.ecochallenge.com</a>.

The rain held off and the course was flat, interesting, and pretty.  We sort of got lost, however. We did a lot of running across fields with poison ivy and ticks.  Douglas Durham and I saw a Copperhead.  It was small.  This is a great place for a run, especially if you don't want hills.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:makeNewWindow('album/lt99-4.jpg',166,306,'King Jordan at the 1999 Leadville 100')"><img src="album/lt99-4sm.jpg" width="65" height="120" alt="King Jordan" align="left" hspace="5" border="0"></a><strong>Leadville:</strong> VHTRC member King Jordan finished his umpteenth Leadville Trail 100 miler on August 20.  Mike Walsh also finished.  (Appologies to Mike for missing him the first time around.)  Chad Ricklefs won the event.  He had finished second at MMT.  Other MMT finishers whom I saw were Monica Scholz and Hans-Dieter Weisshaar who are doing them all.  <a href="http://www.leadvilletrail100.com/2000runr.html">...Results from the LT100 Site</a></p>

<p><strong>Catoctin 50km:</strong> The weather was beautiful but the trail still sucks!  Many of the usual VHTRC suspects showed up for the Catoctin 50km.  RD Kevin Sayers put on a great event.  The trail is rocky and slow.  But it's all trail and it's beautiful!  At least one participant earned a "<a href="general/mills-awds.htm">Scotty</a>."  (There may be others. If you earned one, let me know.)  A few pictures are in the <a href="album2000/index.htm">VHTRC photo album</a>.

<p><strong>Marge Schlundt Finishes Seventh at the Badwater Ultramarathon!</strong> On July 29, Marge was the seventh woman in this grueling run from the lowest point in Death Valley to the base of Mt. Whitney--135 miles.  The <a href="http://www.badwaterultra.com/web2000/2000results.html">results</a> are on the <a href="http://www.badwaterultra.com/">Badwater web site</a>.  There is probably a picture of our heroine there some place too. Other East Coast people did well.  Tim Hewitt was the first American to finish and Bill Koppenheffer also finished in a good time.</p>

<p><strong>Vermont 100:</strong> Prasad Gerard led the VHTRC contingent at the Vermont 100 miler on July 15-16.  Prasad was 20th place, followed by John Dodds in 40th, Frank Probst in 48th, Susan Briars in 109th, Ed Schultze in 122nd, John Prohira in 133rd, and Phil Hesser in 157th.  Courtney Campbell won the race in 14:19.  That is off of Mike Morton's record of 14:08.  Ann Trayson won the women's division in 16:04 which is an hour under her prior course record of 17:11.  The <a href="http://www.vermontadaptive.org/vt100/vt1res00.html">results</a> are available on the <a href="http://www.vermontadaptive.org/vt100/">Vermont 100 web site</a>.

<p><strong>Horton Third, Mills Seventh at Hardrock!</strong> Kirk Apt won Hardrock in a record time of 29:35:00.  VHTRC member David Horton was third in 30:12:23 and Scott Mills, was seventh in 31:11:05.  Scott did this two weeks after finishing Western States and trashing his feet.  John DeWalt came in 44th at 44:28:00.  Unfortunately, Joe Clapper had to drop because of vision problems (an old concern that he had, we all thought, finally licked).  This is really sad. Joe was in super shape and ready to do very well.  MMT women's winner Sue Johnston won Hardrock. Other MMT finishers who finished Hardrock were Johnathon Worswick, Greg Loomis, Scott Eppelman, and Hans-Dieter Weisshaar (who is doing a billion 100s this year).  The <a href="http://www.run100s.com/HR/HRH-2000-Finishers-List.html">results</a> are now on the <a href="http://www.run100s.com/HR/">Hardrock site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mills Sets Western States-Hardrock Record:</strong> Scott Mills is one of a small handful of runners who have done both WS and Hardrock in the same year.  Of these runners, he has the fastest total time--by far.  He is one of only two people who have done this twice.  What did our hero say upon crossing the finish line at Hardrock this year?  It's reported to be: "I am never going to run 100 miles again!"  Don't worry, he says that every time!

<p><strong>AT Run in Shenandoah National Park:</strong> Bill Sublett and Russ Evans have reported on their 100+ mile run of the Appalachian Trail in the Park over June 23-25.  Bill, Stan, and Margie finished the whole thing. Several others participated during parts of the run.  The logistics and car shuttles were a big problem.  Bill reports, "We had several neat animal sightings including 3 bears and a rattlesnake."  Guess Gary Knipling wasn't there!</p>

<p><strong>Western States:</strong> Ed Demoney helped daughter Lisa manage the finish line at Western States.  He reports that Scott Mills's feet were really trashed after the run.  (Joe has confirmed the same thing by e-mail.)  Ed reports, "[Scott] said...that [Hardrock] was definitely out this time.  I suspect that cold mountain air will prove sufficiently healing for him to run HH although he almost broke up at the finish line in considering HH possibilities."  I join Ed in predicting that Scotty will be on the starting line next weekend at Hardrock!  Anyone want to bet against it?</p>

<p>At least five VHTRC members finished Western States including Ian Torrence in 11th place (one behind Ann Trayson), Scott Mills in about 30th place, and at around 25 hours, Keith Moore. Mike Campbell, and Prasad Gerard.  Ed reported about the race, "It was a tough year for the runners although the weather wasn't all that bad. Apparently it was hot early, after reaching Emigrant Pass, and hot and dusty later as expected."  <a href="http://www.ws100.com/ws00.htm">...Results</a></p>

It was fun--I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Laurel Highlands:</strong> Frank Probst reports:</p> 

<p>"It was hot.  The shade and breeze helped some, but by noon I was
feeling the heat and could see a daylight finish going down the drain.
Courtney Cambell took off like a man on a mission.  When we got 100
yards out of the start, he had a 40 yard lead on us.  Although he had a
great run, the heat got him too.  His 11:15 time was awesome, but about
a half hour slower than last year.  From our area, Johnny Raney (not a
club member) had a good run and was 3rd, John Dodds was 4th, I think I
was 7th, and Eric Ivey ran in with first woman, Deb Reno, tied for 9th.
So the club had three in the top ten.  My time was 17:38 and I would
have either been last or next to last official finisher under the old
time limit.  This year the time was extended to 22 hours.  I did not
hang around after Eric finished.  They figured about a 50% of the
starters made it through the last aid station. [23 finished out of 46 starters.]
  It would have been a
disasterous finish rate with a 18 hour time limit.  There were 49
individual runners signed up, but I do not know how many actually
started.  MMT course marking partner Keith Dunn and club member John
Weitzel started, but I do not know if they finished [they did].  From a pure trail
run standpoint, that trail has to be one of the top courses around.
Looks like you guys had a nice party."  <a href="http://www.tcsinternet.net/~laurel/">...Laurel Highlands Results</a> (click on "Results")</p>

<p><strong>Double Trouble 25k and 50k:</strong> Karsten Brown went to the 
Double Trouble 25K and 50K near Reading, Pennsylvania, and I saw a couple of 
VHTRC members there.  Karsten finished the 25k in 57th place with a time of 2:38:33.
David Horton and Muffy Lanham each did the 50K.  Selena Smart finished the 25k and her mother Kathy (a member of Karsten's Shenandoah Valley Runners), won the 50k 50-59 age group award. </p>

<p><strong>Derrick Carr Third at OD:</strong> Derrick Carr placed third at the Old Dominion 100 Miler on June 3 (yes, he finished the same day he started). His time was 18:07.  Other VHTRC members who finished were: Jeff Holdaway, 12th in 21:37. Ben Clark, 30th in 23:20, Kevin Sayers, 38th in 25:50, Jean Heishman (fomerly "Lichtenberger" I presume), 40th in 26:04, and John DeWalt, 55th in 27:09.  Jim Garcia won in 15:50, and Jim Kirby from Seattle was second in 17:01.  Several runners, including Kevin, did both MMT and OD. <a href="http://www.wvoutside.com/Events/2000/06/1723c.html">Results, a report, and photographs</a> are now available on the <a href="http://www.wvoutside.com">WVOutside site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>VHTRC at Run for Wetlands:</strong> Bill Turrentine, Jeff Reed, Anstr Davidson, Larry DeHof, Jeanne Christie, Valerie Meyer, and Brenda Davidson finished the Run for Wetlands 5k in Arlington on June&nbsp;10.  It was warm!  The names are in their finishing order.  Had it been a 6k, Larry and Jeanne would have beaten me.

<p><img src="album2000/dick-06-sm.jpg" width="75" height="82" alt="Luna Moth" border="0" align="right"><strong>VHTRC Runners Get Back to the Trails:</strong> There were at least two groups out on the trails this weekend.  Bill Sublett, John Dodds, Mike Gholson, Arthur Wit, and Russ Evans ran about 25 miles from Black Rock Gap north to Swift Run Gap, in the southern section of the Shenandoah National Park.  Gary Knipling and Randy Snyder organized a run on the Dickey Ridge Trail in the north portion of the park. That group went up the Dickey Ridge Trail to the AT, then north on the AT to the 4-H Center, and then up Nickerson Hollow to the Dickey Ridge Trail and back down.  It was a great run and somewhat nostalgic for me as the 4-H and Nickerson bring back memories of OD in the '80s.  Gary had hoped to see a bear, but his hopes were dashed again. But we did see the Luna Moth at right. It was cool.  These are the kinds of runs that the VHTRC is all about.  There are pictures of the Dickey Ridge run in the <a href="album2000/index.htm">Photo Album</a>.</p>

Don't bother sending in information about <em>your</em> 5km.)  </p>

<p><strong>Capon Valley 50km:</strong> In the run up to Hardrock, Joe Clapper served notice on David Horton by beating him at the Capon Valley 50km.  Courtney Campbell won the event. Several VHTRC members finished.

<p><strong>24 Hour Relay for Life:</strong> On May 20-21, Carl McClure did the Relay for Life at Reston's South Lakes High School as a solo 24 hour.  The event raised money and awareness for cancer research.  Carl walked most of the way and jogged occasionally to break up the monotony, for a total of 260 laps, or 65 miles. Carl raised nearly $900 for cancer research.</p>

<p><strong>Mt. Mitchell 40 Miler:</strong> VHTRC runners performed well in a competive run over the East's highest mountain on February 26.  Scott Mills reports, "Derrick Carr ran an incredible 7th place in a very tough field in 5:45 only 52 seconds behind David Horton. VHTRC captured the top three Masters awards with Horton 1st (5:44), Scott Mills 2nd (6:08), and the amazing running machine of Joe Clapper in 3rd (6:28)!"

<p><strong>Rocky Raccoon 100 Miler:</strong> Jeff Holdaway reports: "There were at least four VHTRC members who went down to Huntsville, Texas this past weekend [Feb 5-6] to run in the Rocky Raccoon 100. This was a "no excuses" race with perfect temperatures and excellent course conditions. Approximately 140 runners started with 91 finishing under the 30 hour cutoff. Jim Garcia humbled the rest of the field with a winning time of 14:35. Janice Anderson obliterated the women's course record with a time of 16:03. She was third overall. As for the local contingent, Frank Probst turned in his usual strong performance with a time of 18:30 and 8th place. Jeff Holdaway dropped his 100 mile PR by 2 1/2 hours with a 20:32 finish and 17th place. (He was in 15th place with 1/4 mile to go, but had his flashlight go out and wandered in the woods for five minutes before finding the finish line.) Ed Demoney finished strong with a time of 27:12 and 71st place. Carolyn Germand, looking for her first 100 mile finish in six attempts was running well until the cutoff time demons caught up with her and she had to drop at mile 70. Overall, a great day (and night) for a run in the woods."
