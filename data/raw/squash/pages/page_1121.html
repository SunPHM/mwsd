							</p>
							<p>Located in the pine grove on the hillside above the main building, the cemetery is the site of the stupa of the first Abbot of ZMM, Taizan Maezumi, Roshi, and the burial site for all monastics and lay students who wish to have their ashes interred there. The outdoor Chapel next to the cemetery features a replica of the statue of Shakyamuni Buddha from Saranathia in a teaching pose. The cemetery&#146;s Zen Garden was designed to represent the confluence in front of a mountain of two rivers, and is maintained year-round. The Cemetery is the location of memorial services and the annual Hungry Ghost ceremony. The area around it is a perfect place for quiet sitting.<br>

							</p>
							<p>Located near the North Gate of ZMM is a traditional-style Wakoan, used for tea ceremony and for training retreat participants in this traditional formal practice. The Zen Garden which surrounds the building includes a footbridge and integrates the two streams which run nearby into the design.<br>

							</p>
							<p>This simple 8x10 cabin, three quarter of a mile up the mountainside above the main building, is set aside especially for Hermitage practice. These week-long, solitary retreats by seasoned practitioners can be taken up year-round in this wood-heated,  enclave with sweeping view of the valley.<br>

								The monastery maintains a seasonal garden which supplies produce, herbs, flowers and compost. An active honey bee hive is also nearby. The garden provides a wonderful training site for urban practitioners, as well as plenty of fresh lettuce, beans, basil, strawberries, cabbage, tomatoes, squash and flowers for the main Monastery altars.<br>

							</p>
							<p>For over twenty years, Zen Gardens have been created and maintained on the monastery grounds in a classical Japanese, adapted to the climate and the landscape of the Catskills. New gardens are added every so often, and currently there are gardens in the Cemetery, the Tea House, the north and the south sides of the main building, and at each main entrance to the monastery grounds.</p>

							<p>The Cabins and the A-Frames are residential spaces for long-term residents living and practicing at the monastery.  Located  in the hills above the main building, these residences are occupied year-round. </p>

								The nature sanctuary was established at ZMM to provide a haven for the flora and fauna of the mountains and rivers, but to also allow the human inhabitants to appreciate and study all that lives in the forests, river banks, wetlands and mountain meadows.  The Catskill ZESI site provides the workshop for retreats in birding, wilderness skills, tracking, monitoring of water quality, and for arts such as photography, painting and writing.<br>
