<h1>About the Farm </h1>
<p>We are a small family farm located in Southwest Missouri. For over thirty years we have raised hogs here on the farm. We started raising purebred Hampshire hogs and sold breeding stock. While still maintaining our original bloodlines, we now focus on selling market hogs and butcher hogs to individuals. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/index/mixedlot.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="256"></p>
<p> About ten years ago we started selling cornstalk bundles and gourds wholesale to vendors in our area. This part of our business has grown tremendously. We now grow Indian corn, pumpkins, gourds, squash, and corn for bundles and for wildlife food. This part of the farm requires all the family members and several of our extended family members to help with the harvesting. We are able to supply large orders, and we are still very glad to fill the small orders also. Some of our customers are greenhouses in the area that use our products to fill in with their own products, others are chain grocery stores that use our products for seasonal displays and sales. We have a wide range of customers, and this makes our business more interesting to us.
