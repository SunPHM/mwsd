                    appeared in the marketplace in 1994, great fanfare in the 
                    media produced little public reaction. <img src="images/image_gmf3.jpg" width="243" height="167" align="left">Now 
                    many different genetically engineered varieties of plants, 
                    mainly different types of soybeans, corn, squash, tomatoes, 
                    potatoes, radicchio and fruits, are in the food system and 
                    public reaction is no longer muted. A recent survey sponsored 
                    by the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology reported that 
                    46% of the public are undecided about the safety of GE foods 
                    while 25% believe they are unsafe and 29% believe they are 
                    safe. Other surveys, focus groups conducted with the public 
                    by FDA and FAO internet discussion groups among scientists 
                    all reveal some underlying concerns about the use of this 
                    technology in agronomic crops. What are some of the issues 
                    that are reflected in this ground swell of concern? I would 
                    propose three for the reader's consideration.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>How should the government regulate genetically 
                    engineered plants and ingredients?</b></p>
                  <p class="text">Three federal agencies, FDA, EPA and USDA, share 
                    the responsibility of evaluating the safety of GE crops and 
                    food ingredients and operate under a web of regulations largely 
                    based on monitoring chemical pesticides or residues (EPA), 
                    or adulterants or food additives (FDA). USDA monitors field-testing 
                    of GE crops and their interstate transport. In the case of 
                    Bt corn, EPA was responsible for assessing the safety of the 
                    protein product of the inserted gene for humans, animals and 
                    non-target insect populations. FDA was responsible for evaluating 
                    the rest of the Bt corn kernel's impact on humans and animals 
                    and determining if the remainder was generally recognized 
                    as safe (GRAS) based on information submitted by the developer. 
                    Both EPA and FDA regulations have come under criticism. Critics 
                    of EPA feel its scientific framework and regulations are inadequate 
                    to assess the safety of gene transfer and its possible multiple 
                    effects on both the host plant and the environment. The Monarch 
                    butterfly story highlighted the need for more in-depth analysis 
                    of the effects of GE crops on non-target organisms than initially 
                    provided by EPA. Development of pest resistance and pollen 
                    drift that contaminates non-GE crops represent some of the 
                    tough environmental problems EPA faces. </p>
                  <p class="text">FDA is criticized for using a voluntary review 
                    system and for allowing GE ingredients to enter the food system 
                    as GRAS as well as after food additive review. Companies introducing 
                    GE foods or food ingredients are anticipated to consult with 
                    FDA since it is in their best interest to do so, especially 
                    if their new product falls into one of the eight scenarios 
                    outlined by FDA to represent situations in which consultation 
                    should be done. Although both FDA and the biotechnology industry 
                    claim all products on the market have been examined to date, 
                    critics feel this voluntary system is open to abuses when 
                    companies need market advantage and because the principle 
                    of 'substantial equivalence' that often leads to GRAS status 
                    is ill-defined. FDA recently proposed to move to a mandatory 
                    pre-market notification policy in which companies must let 
                    FDA know 120 or more days ahead that a new GE food is being 
                    introduced into the food supply and provide safety data that 
                    can be posted on a federal website. However this has yet to 
                    be enacted. This proposal was based partly on public reactions 
                    to current regulations recorded in focus groups and public 
                    hearings conducted by FDA. FDA was also likely influenced 
                    by legislation introduced in Congress last year to alter the 
                    regulations under which it evaluates these foods. Critics 
                    feel this proposed policy is still not sufficient as it still 
                    relies on data provided by industry and does not require independent 
                    verification of safety data. </p>
                  <p class="text">Supporters of the current regulatory framework 
                    feel the regulatory system is working because nothing adverse 
                    has so far occurred. However, in science, the absence of negative 
                    evidence does not prove safety. The Consumer Federation of 
                    America recently published an assessment of the current regulatory 
                    process in the US comparing it to systems evolving in the 
                    European Union and Brazil. The authors, from the University 
                    of Texas School of Law, found the current patchwork quilt 
                    of US regulations leaves regulatory gaps, prevents comprehensive 
                    environmental assessment of the impact of GE plants and fails 
                    to adequately protect human health in its human health assessment. 
                    This report provides important food for thought.</p>
                  <p class="text">The sufficiency of this regulatory system is 
                    of great consequence for land grant institutions. The assurances 
                    we provide to the public about the safety of GE foods are 
                    based on our belief in the current regulatory system's adequacy. 
                    Its adequacy is crucial to resolving many concerns about GE 
                    crops and retaining public trust. Lack of public trust in 
                    this system produces a cascade of reactions throughout the 
                    food system from consumer demand for labeling, farmers' indecision 
                    about planting GE crops, food processors rejecting GE crops 
                    and ingredients and friction between conventional and GE growers. 
                    Strengthening the regulatory system is one way to resolve 
                    this issue.</p>
                  <p class="text"><b>Who should control GE plants and germ plasm?</b></p>
                  <p class="text">Since the 1980s, private companies have been 
                    spending more on agricultural research in GE and plant breeding 
                    than the land-grant institutions, partly because USDA funding 
                    for research has remained constant for a number of years. 
                    As a result many of the tools and outcomes of plant breeding 
                    research are now controlled by the private sector. Scientists 
                    who want to do research using new techniques often must reach 
                    agreements with biotechnology companies for access to these 
                    patented techniques in exchange for rights to commercial development. 
                    Now a small group of companies dominates the seed business 
                    and also hold the most agricultural biotechnology patents. 
                    These are Pharmacia (by acquisition of Monsanto, Asgrow, Calgene, 
                    DeKalb), Dupont, Syngenta, Dow Chemical and Aventis which 
                    together hold over a thousand patents. Of course, patents 
                    and grower agreements insure a viable market for these companies. 
                    But this raises questions of control of the food system and 
                    the ability of new enterprise in seeds and plant breeding 
                    to emerge. The land grant system used to be an incubator of 
                    such enterprise by providing free distribution of its research 
                    discoveries. In fact this is what spurred the Green Revolution 
                    in the late 1960s. Now universities also own patents in agricultural 
                    biotechnology with the University of California holding the 
                    most (48). The vertical integration seen in animal production 
                    is occurring in plant production as these five large corporations 
                    contract with farmers to produce their patented seeds which 
                    are processed in corporation owned mills. Such concentration 
                    of ownership has implications for consumers (what does this 
                    mean for availability, selection and price?), for farmers, 
                    food processors (whose choices and ability to control costs 
                    may be compromised), for retailers who work with slim profit 
                    margins and for local economic development.</p>

                  <p class="text">The European Union, Australia, New Zealand, 
                    Japan and South Korea have instituted regulations that require 
                    the labeling of foods with GE ingredients. Other countries 
                    like China, Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand are considering 
                    labeling regulations or bans on GE crops. Even Canada has 
                    been debating mandatory labeling. These decisions outside 
                    the United States are fueling a great debate among US agribusiness 
                    groups and government officials about the need to segregate 
                    GE from non-GE crops. The StarLink experience has demonstrated 
                    that the current US system of growing, shipping and milling 
                    crops cannot easily segregate GE from non-GE material. Pollen 
                    drift from GE to non-GE crops contributes uncertainty about 
                    our ability to do this even with new regulations. In April 
                    2001, USDA reported on a survey of seed companies to determine 
                    the degree of StarLink contamination of their seed. That survey 
                    of 282 companies revealed that 78 seed companies have found 
                    some degree of contamination of their seed corn with the Cry9C 
                    protein derived from the StarLink gene while 143 companies 
                    have indicated they have no StarLink contamination. The other 
                    61companies were still testing. In response to what some view 
                    as wide spread, low level contamination of conventional corn 
                    and soybeans by GE varieties, an USDA advisory board has urged 
                    to development of 'de minimis' or threshold levels of allowable 
                    amounts of GE protein in conventional crops. At the same time, 
                    US food trade associations are currently reviewing draft traceability 
                    regulations from the European Commission that apply to all 
                    levels of marketing and are designed to provide a safety net 
                    in case adverse effects occur. The US faces developing a grain 
                    handling system that includes testing at every point where 
                    commingling could occur with appropriate record keeping. On 
                    the positive side, some have confidently predicted the rapid 
                    growth of companies perfecting methods of detecting proteins 
                    derived from genetic engineering in foods. Congressional leaders, 
                    business and producer interest groups will be struggling with 
                    the issue in the immediate future. Its solution may require 
                    resolving the larger issue listed first in this article.</p>
