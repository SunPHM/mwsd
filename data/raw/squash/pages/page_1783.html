						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><b>Qualifier, round 2:</b></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><b>Cairns can't crash through...</b></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Chris Walker def Mark Cairns 10-15, 15-14, 15-8, 15-13</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">In front of an appreciative but quiet crowd of 250, at the Harvard Hall of the Boston Harvard Club, the 1999 US&nbsp;Open kicked off on the PSA&nbsp;exhibition court. Chris Walker and Mark Cairns immediately put the afternoon's schedule an hour and a half behind schedule with a hard-fought and very scrappy match between two players who know each other's game's fine points. </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">This was a match that could easily have gone to the rebounding Mark Cairns. He didn't have the finishing touches, though, to capitalize on Chris Walker's occasional loose play. &nbsp;Walker closed the match out in four games. <a href="http://adex3.flycast.com/server/socket/127.0.0.1:2800/click/EZineSquashTalk/currentnewsandresultsforwwsquashcompetition/123" target="_top"><img height="201"  src="../../photos/usopen/walker2.jpg" align="right"></a></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">The match started steadily, with many rallies topping 20 rallies and some topping 50. Cairns appeared to be ready enough for Chris Walker's game, parrying each of Walker's attacking shots. At first the game started cleanly, with Cairns just steady enough to capitalize on Walker's occasional error and with the first game at 10.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">After that the game became quite a bit scrappier, with a host of contested lets and obstructions. Cairns allowed himself to get caught up in discussion with the referee, which cost him the concentration he needed. At 12-14 Walker hit Cairns with the ball, creating a stroke, and after several more lets, when he evened the match at 14, Cairns inexplicably called &quot;no set&quot; , with Walker clearly tiring. Chris marshalled his energy and won a brief exchange to even the match.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><img height="201" src="../../photos/usopen/walkerharvey.jpg" align="left"></a></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Then in the third, at 3-1 Chris Walker's favor, Chris's racket nicked Cairn's chin, and he had to leave to court to stem the bleeding. After 15 minutes and one stitch, Cairns returned, but his concentration didn't.</font>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Walker said, &quot;We both lost our concentration after the injury time-out at the beginning of the third game. And with the referee's decision to change the balls after the third game as well, which came as a surprise, I&nbsp;wasn't sure I could re-focus.&quot; </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">&quot;Yes, I started out well after the injury break. Then towards the end of the third game, I started feeling quite dizzy. I think with the long break and then starting back up again, I ended up with a sugar imbalance. But luckily I recovered the game and match.&quot; </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><b>The ultimate attacking game:</b></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">John White def Byron Davis 15/7, 11-15, 15-6, 15-7<br>
						<img height="208" width="310" align="right" hspace="10" src="../../photos/usopen/cairns1.jpg" border="2" vspace="5"></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">After the match, John White told Master of Ceremonies Jonah Barrington, that he learned his attacking style from Brett Martin. That was when he was in Australia. He now represents Scotland, of course. &quot;I like to add the shotmaking to my game, it makes it more interesting.&quot; </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">&quot;That will keep you coming back to watch him another day.&quot;&nbsp;Barrington remarked, in his role as master of ceremonies of the tournament. Barrington added a great dimension to the day, settling naturally into the role as announcer. </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Byron Davis and John White both came out shooting in their contest. Davis perhaps too aggressively. His Drops weren't falling close enough, his cross courts too open. White capitalized time and again on some torrid exchanges of boasts, drops, lops, and boasts again. These ended too frequently for Davis with a drop or boast answered by an ungettable forehand drop by White.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Between games, with Geoff Hunt in Davis's corner, John White looked a bit all alone to think through his approach to the next game. Byron David came out shooting again, this time with enough added precision to punish White on every point. Together with some great gets on White's drops, Davis reversed the result in the second game.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><img height="201" hspace="10" src="../../photos/usopen/whitedavis1a.jpg" align="left">In the third, both players again amazingly came out shooting, attacking with the drop on every occasion. John White, with a forehand drop winner, backhand drop winner, forehand drop winner, and then forehand drive off the drop, went from 4-4 to 10-4 and then closed out the game 15-6.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">In the fourth, it looked like the momentum.had shifted back to Davis but his play immediately took on a desperate tone, as he force a variety of angle and boast shots to place himself frequently out of position. His wonderful speed and agility couldn't make up for his lack of tactics at this point and he went down 15-7 in the third game.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><b>A great contest of strategy and strength</b></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">David Evans def Paul Price 15-12, (14-15), 15-8, 15-12</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">This match took on all the characteristics of England versus Australia. In England's corner, supporting David Evans was a cast led by Simon Parke. In Australia's corner were Geoff Hunt and Byron Davis. But the Australian coaching team couldn't Price's passion enough to create a winning result. Price played at times brilliantly, at times terribly. And he couldn't quite stay calm enough to make his strong tactics and strong shotmaking pay off.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Paul Price started out the day letting David Evans dictate the flow of the game. Paul was simply retrieving and falling behind. Price regrouped, and began to dictate the pace and move the much taller Evans around the court. He pulled even at 11-all but at that juncture, a few great drops off of the forehand that hugged the wall gave the game to Evans.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">In the second, Price came out a little flat and immediately fell behind. With strong tactical play by both players, the game moved to 13-9 Evan's favor. Price then played a succession of strong points, punctuated with frequent arguments over lets. Evans, being tall and lanky, was continually bothering Price's swing. Price dangerously let Evans continually play length to the backhand corner, choosing to dig the shots out. But he evened the score at 14 all. At that point two extremely long and well played rallies both ended in lets. The second was fortunate for Price, as it was an obstruction most referees would have called a stroke, though the let call was probably correct.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Finally, on the third play of the point, Price capitalized on a front ball to drive an ungettable forehand that made the score 1-1.</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">The third game was forgettable for Price. Evans began to work the roll-corner, building up a lead to 4-1 and by that point Price lost his composure, arguing a number of lets and finally throwing away the last few points when he stood at 8-11. </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">In the fourth game Price regained his composure and touch to take a 4-1 lead. Price and Evans then both stepped up the pace and pressure, with Evans first taking a 10-8 lead, then Price playing two brilliant points to bring the score to 10-10 but at that point Evans steady play combined with some inexplicable erratic play from Price let Evans close out the match at 15-12</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial"><b>Eyles Encore</b></font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Rodney Eyles def Nick Taylor 15-9, 15-10, 15-9</font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Rodney Eyles, after his paper-thin win against Billy Haddrell (15-14 in the fifth after losing the fourth 15-1), was determined to reclaim his customary place in the main draw of a major PSA&nbsp;event.  Eyles, looking focused, strong, and not at all tired from the prior afternoon's effort, used pace and pressure to keep the less experienced Nick Taylor totally off balance.  </font></p>
						<p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS,Arial">Eyles was the aggressor throughout, taking home the 3-game win on practically errorless squash.   </font></p>
