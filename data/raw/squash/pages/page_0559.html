      <TD> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">February 22, 2000 &#151; The ball 
          didn't bounce. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It just stayed there, on 
          the floor, and slowly dribbled away. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I scratched my head and thought, 
          "Well, that's weird." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ball is round. Floor is flat. 
          Ball should bounce. Right? </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wrong. That would be too 
          easy. And, as I learned last week at the Concourse Athletic Club in 
          Atlanta, nothing is easy about squash. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My preconceived notions of 
          the sport were wrong &#151; as preconceived notions typically are. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thought squash was an elitist 
          sport, the fancy of Ivy League types with argyle socks, Saab convertibles 
          and fake British accents. I thought it was simply racquetball with a 
          smaller ball, a longer racket and a bigger ego. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True, the squash inner circle 
          is still an exclusive club, especially in the U.S., where the sport 
          has a way to go to match its popularity overseas. Outside of large metropolitan 
          areas stateside, places to play are few &#151; and often expensive. 
          My 1990 Toyota Corolla stuck out sorely among the shiny new cars &#151; 
          a few Saab convertibles among them &#151;Êparked at the pricey Concourse 
          club. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But if squash players tend 
          to be a bit on the wealthy side, they are very physically fit wealthy 
          people. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My legs ached for days after 
          my lesson. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Racquetball is a woman's 
          sport," said Concourse's squash pro Andre Maur, not one to censor his 
          thoughts. "That's what it is. The better you play racquetball, the shorter 
          your rallies are. You're waiting, waiting, waiting. You can have a pint 
          of Guinness in between rallies. That's how slow it is." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maur's Irish accent is very 
          real. He spent his formative years in Dublin before embarking on a highly 
          successful professional squash career that at times saw him ranked in 
          the top-10 in Ireland and Germany. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirty-five and retired from 
          the world circuit, Maur now focuses his energies on coaching and promoting 
          tournaments around the globe. In April, Maur is bringing to the Concourse 
          the Atlanta Open, which with more than 200 participants, is expected 
          to be the biggest squash tournament ever in the Atlanta area. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The guy can still play, too. 
          In tournaments last December, Maur won both the U.S. Masters and Irish 
          Senior titles. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In squash, you can't afford 
          to wait," Maur continued. "You're always constantly moving." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And for that you can thank 
          that darn little ball. No bigger than a Ping-Pong ball and made of a 
          soft, malleable rubber, the ball doesn't come to you. You have to come 
          to it. Quickly. Constantly. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Right-e-o. So you want to 
          have a hit?" Maur said with a crooked smile. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maur was intent on getting 
          the never-say-stop pace of his sport across to me. I had planned on 
          asking Maur to play a couple games, but after five minutes on the court 
          I realized that wouldn't have been much fun for either of us. So did 
          Maur. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You wouldn't get anything 
          out of it," Maur said matter-of-factly. "It's a terrible thing to say, 
          but you would just be picking the ball up off of the ground most of 
          the time. It's best to start off with the basics." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we did. Backhands and 
          forehands. That was it. That was enough. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since squash is a sport of 
          constant movement, Maur had me in constant motion. Running forward toward 
          the side wall to strike the ball, and back to center court to await 
          the next hit. Back and forth. Again and again. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ideally, steps in squash 
          are big and low to the ground. For right-handed players, the last step 
          before a forehand is a long lunge with the left leg. Once the ball is 
          struck, you push off with that same leg to send you back to mid-court. 
          These are actions you feel the next morning ... and the next. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ideally, the forehand stroke 
          is a sweeping one, with a long backswing and a pronounced follow-through. 
          If hit soundly enough, that squishy little ball can zip around at quite 
          a rapid pace. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ideally, I would have caught 
          on right away. Ideally. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"No chicken steps, Dan," 
          Maur would yell. My legs, he said, were "wooden." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My body was not low enough. 
          My lunges were not long enough. My backswing did not swing back far 
          enough. And often after striking the ball, my momentum sent me crashing 
          into the wall, not back toward the center of the court. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps my biggest fault &#151; especially in the eyes of Maur &#151; was my habit of resting my racket 
          in my left hand in between strokes. You don't use your off arm in squash. 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"That's your pint-of-Guinness 
          arm," said Maur, admittedly no stranger to the dark and creamy beverage. 
          "Put your left arm behind your back. You don't need your left arm." 
          </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, I was a mess, but a 
          sweaty mess. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"You see how strenuous it 
          is, Dan," Maur said as I gasped for air. "I don't know if the A/C is 
          on or if you're just breathing that hard." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the backhand part of 
          my lesson &#151; which was even less of an aesthetic success &#151; I believe 
          Maur must have felt he was inside a wind tunnel. I was breathing that 
          hard. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Squash is definitely not 
          the sport of the mollycoddled. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Look, you're sweating your 
          you-know-what off," Maur said after my 30-minute lesson. "And this was 
          basically a warm-up session. But at least you were connecting with the 
          ball. That is the main thing at the moment." </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main thing, perhaps. 
          But not the only thing. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I walked to the parking garage, 
          past the Saabs and the Benzes, and squeezed my sore legs into my Corolla. 
          I was headed home with one thing on my mind. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this talk of beer made 
          me thirsty. </font>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I needed a pint of Guinness.
