    garden is&nbsp;quite large, 60 by 160 feet. That's a lot of dirt to till, so we hired a
    big tractor to&nbsp;do the job right. With the&nbsp;soil freshly turned under, <a
    href="MisterMule.html" target="_blank">Mr. Mule</a> went to&nbsp;work laying out the rows.
    &nbsp;Row after row after row we planted. Two rows of new&nbsp;potatoes, a&nbsp;row and a
    half of peas, one&nbsp;row each of ocra, pumpkins, watermelon, </b><img WIDTH="300"
    HEIGHT="221" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Right" SRC="Image27.JPG"><b>butternut squash, zucchini
    squash, yellow crook neck squash, another row of vidalia onions, a&nbsp;dozen tomato
    plants (4&nbsp;different varieties), 8&nbsp;half-rows of silver queen corn,
    a&nbsp;half-row each of eggplant, rutabagas, carrots, spinach, romaine lettuce, bell
    peppers in red, yellow and green, pimentos, beets, three cucumbers and&nbsp; 44 sweet
    potato plants. </b><img WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="170" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Left" SRC="Image24.JPG"><b>On
    large pots on the&nbsp;back porch are two jalapenos,&nbsp;one&nbsp;tomato plant &nbsp;and
    one habanero. Collard greens are&nbsp;still growing in the flower garden in the front
    yard. Why plant so much? Why not? There's not really a&nbsp;whole lot to do up here,
    especially if you're tethered to the house like we are, and free vegetables </b><img

    incentive for&nbsp;people to visit. &nbsp;We strung up aluminum pie pans to fly in
    the&nbsp;wind to keep the birds off the tomatoes and a scarecrow mostly
    for&nbsp;&quot;ambience&quot;. &nbsp;When I&nbsp;was putting up the post and cross arms it
    looked like we&nbsp;were preparing for&nbsp;a crucifixion. &nbsp;Seeing as how we were
    deep in the&nbsp;Bible Belt and it was Good Friday, I&nbsp;took it&nbsp;back down and
    angled the arms slightly to look less religious. We dressed him up,&nbsp;put a&nbsp;hat on
    his head and named him Peabody. He's holding up a string of empty beer cans that blow
    around in the wind. </b></p>
    <p ALIGN="Justify"><b>Sure enough, just as predicted, food started popping up&nbsp;out of
    the very same holes where we put these little bits&nbsp;of stuff just a few days earlier.
    &nbsp;Amazing! &nbsp;And what was REALLY impressive is&nbsp;that the food that came
    poppin' up out of&nbsp;the ground looked exactly like the picture on the label.
    I&nbsp;don't think that's a coincidence. What I wanna know is how do those little bits of
    stuff know how to make exactly the&nbsp;right kind of food? Kind of creepy, if you ask me,
    but we ate it&nbsp;anyway.</b><img WIDTH="460" HEIGHT="288" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Left"

    <b>The garden was looking good. &nbsp;We bought a cheap little tiller made by political
    prisoners in China. (our own government says China is a &quot;most favored nation&quot;,
    so it must be OK). &nbsp;It sounded like a&nbsp;million bees loudly buzzing around and I'm
    sure it really annoys the neighbors but it gets the job done....as long as the weeds
    aren't too big. &nbsp;As luck would have it, CapmWoody had a yacht delivery to do which
    would take the whole month of May, which meant that the garden would have to go basically
    unattended for about five weeks. </b><img WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="170" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Left"
    SRC="Image42.JPG"><b>We knew that the weeds would be bad when we got back, so we tediously
    scoured the garden for even the smallest weed, figuring that the fewer weeds when we left,
    the fewer weeds when we get back. &nbsp;At least in theory it sounded good.</b> </p>
    <p ALIGN="Justify"><img WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="175" BORDER="0" ALIGN="Right"
    SRC="Image49.JPG"><b>To keep everything alive, I needed to set up an irrigation system to
    wet everything down while we were gone. It was a simple system of five sprinkler heads,
    each elevated on a pipe covering different parts of the garden. &nbsp;It's a good thing I
    did because the day after we left began a two month drought. By the time we left, the
    peppers were&nbsp;ripening and the squash was in full bloom.
    &nbsp;Another&nbsp;few&nbsp;days and the&nbsp;squash would be&nbsp;ready and the corn was
    already waist high. </b></p>
