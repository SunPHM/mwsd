<p>Squashes, pumpkins and gourds are species of summer-fruiting vines in the genus <i>Cucurbita</i>. They are related to cucumber, muskmelon and watermelon. North American squashes were originally domesticated for their tasty seeds rather than their meat.  Archaeological evidence shows that Native Americans were cultivating squash at least 8,000 years ago. </p>

<p>0ur word &quot;squash&quot; comes from the Massachusetts Indian word <i>askutasquash</i>, meaning &quot;eaten raw or uncooked.&quot; Although Native Americans may have eaten squash without cooking, today we generally think of squash as a versatile cooked vegetable. Squash can be fried, boiled, steamed, pickled, candied, dried, baked, made into pies and bread or, with a nod to historical accuracy, eaten raw in salads. The flowers are also edible, and are considered a delicacy by many chefs. The seeds can be roasted and seasoned for a great nutritious snack.</p>

<p>The terms pumpkin and squash have no precise botanical meaning and are often interchanged. Most of the varieties considered pumpkins bear orange fruit and are varieties of <i>C. pepo</i>.  The official World Pumpkin Confederation rules state that a pumpkin must be creamy-yellow to reddish-orange, regardless of species; if it is green to gray or mottled in color it must be entered in the Annual Weigh-Off as a squash. The largest &quot;pumpkins&quot; grown and bragged about (weighing up to 400 lb.) are really squashes (<i>C. maxima</i>).  Much of the &quot;pumpkin&quot; pie we eat is made from what is undisputedly squash. </p>

<p>Many varieties of squashes are known, with widely differing forms, colors and sizes.  Squash may be solid red, orange, yellow, white, green, blue, black or gray, or may boast multi-colored stripes, splotches and whorls.  Shapes may range from the ordinary round, cylindrical, conical, and pear shaped to ridged, horned, and just plain strange. Spaghetti, acorn, sugar loaf, sweet dumpling, delicata and buttercup squashes are familiar, popular varieties of winter squash prized for their flavorful flesh. Winter squash, if properly stored in a cool, dry place, will maintain their delicious flavor and succulent texture throughout the long winter months.
