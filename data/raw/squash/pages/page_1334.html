<IMG SRC="../pic/aqua/hfrm.gif" ALIGN=left>This system was developed  and popularized by General Hydroponics nearly twenty years ago as their first product.  Pictured at left is the original design known as the "Aquafarm".  In recent years it has seen new  embodiments named the "Watergarden" (a decorative version), the "Powergrower" (a revised version of the watergarden), the "Waterfarm" (a square version), and the "Megafarm" (a 20 gallon version).  A similar bucket based system is also being sold by another company under the name of the "Universal Garden".   This system will accommodate several small plants or (as best suited for) hold one large plant.  I personally have seen 12 foot tall  trees being grown in an aquafarm, as well a very large banana tree, both indoors.  The plants are grown in a chamber suspended above a reservoir (basically a bucket within a bucket) that holds the nutrient solution.  A small aquarium pump powers a simple pumping mechanism which delivers nutrients from the reservoir up to the top of the growth chamber, where it trickles back down through the root system and into the reservoir.  <B>This system is so effective it is not uncommon for tomato plants to grow over 
4 inches per day!</B>  This system gives huge yields!</B> These units are extremely reliable, easy to operate and can be constructed for less than ten dollars each! (Less if you scrounge the buckets.)  <B>This System is HIGHLY recommended for the first time hydroponic grower.</B>
