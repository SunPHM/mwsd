<P>This variety has been around for longer than most of the other unusual
squash varieties. It made a big hit when it was first introduced in the
1970s, but sales are now well below that peak and slipping. This is a semi-hard
shelled squash. It has a bright yellow colored skin and a very stringy white
flesh. After you boil this variety, the flesh can easily be removed with
a fork. These strands of squash can be used instead of pasta, or as a &quot;julienne&quot;
style of vegetable.
