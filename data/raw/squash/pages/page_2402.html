        blight caused by Phytophthora capsici is one of the most destructive pepper 
        and cucurbit diseases in North Carolina and many other regions of the 
        US. The disease was recorded in North Carolina as early as 1954, but has 
        become a serious concern over the last 10 years. The disease usually starts 
        on plants in low, poorly drained areas of the field especially after excessive 
        rains. The pathogen can be dispersed in soil, with surface water following 
        drainage patterns, and via splash dispersal from soil to foliage. During 
        conditions of heavy wind and rain, the pathogen can be <a href="vdin027_files/fields.jpg">distributed 
        over entire fields</a> and cause extensive losses within a few days</font>.

        pathogen has a wide host range including pepper, tomato, eggplant and 
        most cucurbits (e.g., cucumber, squash, pumpkins, watermelon and muskmelons). 
        Seed has been reported to be a source of inoculum, but transplants and 
        contaminated water or soil are the most common sources of initial inoculum. 
        P. capsici is heterothallic, meaning that the two mating types (e.g. &quot;A1&quot; 
        and &quot;A2&quot; strains) must be present to form persistent resting 
        structures called oospores. Around 14% of fields surveyed in North Carolina 
        harbored both mating types. If oospores form, the pathogen is likely to 
        persist for years in the soil even in the absence of host plants. The 
        pathogen can persist from one year to the next on host debris or alternative 
        hosts and soilborne oospores. Oospores can germinate in the spring to 
        form structures called sporangia that release zoospores. Zoospores are 
        single-celled spores that can swim in the soil water and lodge on host 
        roots. Once a plant is infected, more sporangia are formed and zoospores 
        released. Amount of rainfall or frequency of irrigation has a dramatic 
        influence on final disease incidence.</font></p>

      </ol>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision 
        to use fungicides can be a difficult one and depends on the history of 
        the field and personal management decisions. Grower experiences have shown 
        that under heavy disease pressure, fungicides have not proven effective 
        at limiting economic losses. This could be due to two problems: 1) the 
        fungicide was not present in sufficient concentrations during the onset 
        of disease due to soil/weather conditions or due to timing and placement 
        of application and 2) Phytophthora strains resistant to the fungicide 
        may be present in the field.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During a 
        1997 survey, infected plants were collected from 12 fields in North Carolina 
        and one field in New Jersey. Three quarters of the fields sampled contained 
        isolates that were resistant to Ridomil Gold, and insensitivity ranged 
        from 11 to 80% within the fields. A total of 161 isolates were evaluated 
        and 57% were found to be resistant to Ridomil Gold. Resistant isolates 
        grew in the presence of both metalaxyl (Ridomil) and mefenoxam (Ridomil 
        Gold). This dramatic shift in populations of P. capsici from sensitivity 
        to resistance has occurred in pepper fields in the last 3 years in North 
        Carolina. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ridomil Gold 
        EC is registered for pre-plant and early post-plant application to control 
        Phytophthora blight in peppers. Ridomil Gold EC is labeled for use on 
        cucurbits to control Pythium damping-off, but not Phytophthora blight. 
        Thus, the manufacturer makes no claim of efficacy against this disease 
        in cucurbits. Specific recommendations of rates and timing for Ridomil 
        Gold can be obtained from the label. In the case of peppers, placement 
        of Ridomil Gold in the root zone is extremely important. Ridomil Gold 
        applications should be incorporated or moved into the zone by irrigation. 
        Ridomil Gold/Copper or maneb plus copper can be used as foliar sprays 
        to limit the foliar phase of the disease. The maneb plus copper combination 
        is a protectant spray and must be applied before conditions conducive 
        to Phytophthora prevail. Growers may want to consider up to three maneb/copper 
        applications on 7-10 day intervals starting 2 to 3 weeks after the last 
        Ridomil Gold EC application. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Should a 
        fungicide program be implemented? On farms without a history of disease 
        and practicing good crop rotation, a fungicide program may not be necessary. 
        Farms that have a history of the disease, that can employ rotation, and 
        do not have a resistant population of the pathogen will likely benefit 
        from a fungicide program. If rotation is not practiced in fields with 
        a history of disease or if resistant populations are known to be present, 
        the benefit of a fungicide program is uncertain. Some research evidence 
        suggests Ridomil Gold provides benefit where resistant populations are 
        present. In all cases, the focus should be on water management, to minimize 
        conditions conducive to the initiation and spread of this destructive 
        disease.</font><br>
