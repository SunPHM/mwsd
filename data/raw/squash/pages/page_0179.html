Squash players know that no other racquet sport can give you the cardio benefits, hand-eye coordination, and intense, vigorous physical activity. Whether you are a veteran or new to the game, we can provide you with regularly scheduled matches with someone at your ability level, competition in a squash ladder, or instruction on a modern international singles court.<P>

The guest fees are $10 plus court time.  For membership fees, please see the <A href="membership_info.html">MEMBERSHIP/RATES</A> page.

***  Not sure how to get started? Visit Four Seasons and watch a video
created by the Squash Racquets Association. Or take to the court for a free
demonstration with a friendly veteran squash player. We have loaner
racquets; we have balls. You bring the enthusiasm!<BR>
*** Ask any squash player: You can't BUY a better workout!<P>
