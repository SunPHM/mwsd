<TD WIDTH="394" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial">Each year brings new surprises,
including new insect pest species or vectors of plant, animal and human
disease. Not all of these challenges directly apply to vegetable crops, but
with the increasing onslaught of insect pests in the Midwest, we have decided
to review a few with this summary issue for 2002. Over the past 5 years, a new
insect pest or pest problem has hit Minnesota each year. Although this is quite
interesting for entomologists (and great for job security), it is not always
easy for growers and the public. During the past 5 years, we have seen the
arrival and/or increasing activity of the following insect related problems:

<TD WIDTH="394" ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial">a) <B>Multi-colored Asian
Ladybeetle</B>, a great beneficial aphid predator in many crops, but also a
growing nuisance to home owners (1995-2002); b) arrival and demise of the
<B>Alfalfa blotch leafminer</B> (1997-2001); c) 1999- confirmation of the first
<B>Western bean cutworm</B> infestation in sweet and field corn, SW Minn.;
flights continued to be documented in 2002; d) 2000- arrival of the <B>Soybean
aphid</B>; although primarily a pest of soybean, even minimal feeding on snap
(green) beans allows the aphid to vector devastating viruses to snap bean pods.
For more information on soybean aphid, see the following site:

e) 2001-2002- increasing incidence of <B>Bean leaf beetle</B> on snap beans due
to mild winters; f) 2002- arrival of <B>West Nile Virus</B>, via birds
(carriers) and multiple species of mosquito vectors. For more information re:

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This is just a short list of recent changes to the
entomological landscape of Minnesota during the past 5 years. This trend is
likely to continue, and reflects a growing national trend of international
trade and travel. What will 2003 bring? Soybean aphid and WNV are likely to
stay; look for increasing activity of another recent arrival, <B>Gypsy
moth</B>, and possibly another pest found in Michigan this year (Dr. DiFonzo,
Michigan State University), the <B>Cereal stem moth</B>, a pest of winter
wheat! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This review overview reminds us that subscribing to a
pest newsletter (also via the web) is a great way to stay abreast of new insect
invasions. We hope that this newsletter, with timely pest and IPM updates will
lead to improved profits for your farming operation. As always do not hesitate
to let us know of new issues or improvements you would like to see for the
newsletter. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Back to Veggies:</B> With Figs. 1-2, we provide the
full season summary for <B>European corn borer (ECB)</B> and <B>Corn Earworm
(CEW)</B> moth flight data for several southern Minnesota locations. As in
previous &#147;warm&#148; years (2002 was one of the hottest summers in MN), we
saw continued activity by ECB and CEW into mid-September, particularly for Blue
Earth and Owatonna, respectively. The late-season (likely 3rd ECB flight;
bivoltine strain) is usually &#147;suicidal&#148; in that few if any young
larvae that are produced from the 3rd flight will have time to fully develop
(reach the 4th or 5th instar), feed, build up fat reserves, and properly
prepare for overwintering (diapause). Large late-season CEW flights have also
been observed in recent years at Owatonna. CEW is not known to be able to
overwinter in MN; larvae hatching from these flights will also face an early
demise as freezing temperatures kick in. </FONT></P>

populations were again very high this year in pumpkins and squash, attacking
seedlings early, and late-season fruit! If you have not already reviewed the

<B>soybean aphid</B> populations were lower compared to 2001, and relatively
low levels of virus (e.g., cucumber mosaic) were detected in snap bean samples
in our seed treatment studies (preliminary data). However, <B>bean leaf
beetle</B> infestations were again &#147;off the charts&#148;, particularly
early in the season. Untreated snap beans for two May planting dates at
Rosemount were 90-100% defoliated by adults, emerging from nearby overwintering
sites (e.g., field edges, leaf litter, old soybean fields). We are happy to
report that we have a new graduate student, <B>Kathleen Bennett</B>, who will
begin working on BLB in Snap Beans, beginning next year! </FONT></P>
