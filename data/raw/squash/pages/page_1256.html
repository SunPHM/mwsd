									Travellers Rest Plantation</font></b></center>
						<p><font face="Arial">At the turn of the 19th century, the foremost gardening concern was the cultivation of useful vegetables, fruits and herbs. The 19th century interpretive gardens at <a href="http://www.travellersrestplantation.org">Travellers Rest </a>exhibit plant types, gardening practices and gardening styles of the 1800s. These are based on extensive research by staff members, the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Tennessee, the Davidson County Master Gardener Association and the Cumberland Herb Society, using historic sources, such as the ledgers of Judge Overton, seed and nursery catalogs, and garden advice books. As heirloom varieties are located from seed catalogs, other museums such as Monticello, and from gardeners and seed collectorsthey are introduced into the gardens. The Master Gardeners plant and maintain the vegetable, flower, weaving and dyeing, and iris gardens.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/travrest2.jpg" width="200" height="222" align="LEFT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3" hspace="6" vspace="6">Some of the heirloom varieties of vegetables growing at Travellers Rest are &quot;Bloody Butcher&quot; corn, &quot;Brandywine&quot; tomatoes and &quot;Black-seeded Simpson&quot; letttuce. Pumpkins and squash grow around the corn while the &quot;Hyacinth Bean&quot; uses the corn stalks as a trellis.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial">The weaving and dyeing garden has cotton and flax along with tobacco. Among the flowers in the garden next to the weaving and dyeing house, you will foind the heirloom &quot;Cherokee&quot; rose, Job's Tears, Purple Cone Flower (Echinacea), Black-eyed Susans (Rudbeckia), &quot;Virginia Blue Bells&quot;, '&quot;Tiger Lily&quot;, sweet alyssum, marigolds, foxglove, pansies, and mums. Many of these plants were used by Judge Overton's wife, Mary, who was known for her &quot;healing skills&quot;. Some were also used as insect repellents, and dyeing materials. Stone markers identify the plants to help answer visitors' questions.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial">Tennessee's state flower, the &quot;Blue Flag&quot; iris, blooms just outside of the formal boxwood garden in late spring. Orris root was, and still is, used as a preservative.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/travrest3.jpg" width="250" height="169" align="RIGHT" border="0" naturalsizeflag="3">As the seasons change, so do the plantings in each of these gardens. Spring brings a showing of daffodils and early blooming perennials. Summer is highlighted with colorful annuals, vegetable and dyeing materials. In autumn, those late bloomers and cool weather vegetables accompany the cotton and tobacco. Winter interest is usually provided by the rose clamoring up the iron gate trellis, as well as a few pansies.</font></p>
