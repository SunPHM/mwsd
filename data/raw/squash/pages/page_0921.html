        - Fall Dinner Recipes</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <img src="fall.gif" width="198" height="143" align="right">No 
        doubt about it, eating the same old thing every day is boring, isn't it? 
        Maybe that's why when we're bored, we're tempted to cheat on our diet. 
        Doesn't a mango and chili pepper salsa sound good? Or that chocolate cake? 
        We don't have to cheat on our diet or even book a fall vacation in the 
        sunny tropics to break away from monotony at the dinner table. Right now 
        there's a bountiful supply of autumn vegetables in the markets... and 
        they can perk up our dinner menus as well as beautifully decorate our 
        holiday tables. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colorful squashes 
        star in hearty casseroles, aromatic soups or decadent desserts. Acorn 
        squash, pumpkins, spaghetti squashes and others are all good sources of 
        fiber and vitamins too. A single serving of any of the squash recipes 
        below will give you 70% or more of your daily requirement for vitamin 
        A. Vitamin A helps your eyes see in the dark. It's also an important antioxidant 
        that helps stave off the aging effects of free radicals. (I know I could 
        sure do with a few less wrinkles...) <b>More importantly for those of 
        us with IC, an adequate supply of dietary vitamin A protects the body 
        from infection and keeps tissues of the intestinal tract and bladder healthy. 
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Served with 
        home style breads, roasted meats, or as a stew ingredient, winter squashes 
        create unending possibilities for delicious and nutritious cold-weather 
        dinners. So without further ado, let's introduce a collection of fall 
        dinner recipes:</font></p>
      <h4 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- - Main Course 
        - - </font></h4>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here is a unique marinade 
      and glaze combination that gives ho-hum pork chops a succulent and moist 
      texture while imparting a subtle salty-sweetness. Pork chops go well with 
      winter squash. A hint of rosemary in this dish rounds out the meat's flavor. 
      Best of all though, this dish is completely lacking the bladder-burning 
      fruit acids or vinegar that keep most marinades out of our kitchens! The 
      trick is a unique chemical reaction that alters the meat protein, making 
      it absorb moisture. The chops stay juicy and flavorful during cooking. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the best flavor 
        and texture, check the label and be sure the pork chops you buy are not 
        &quot;pumped up&quot; with water and phosphates. (Fat keeps meat juicy. 
        Consumers' current preference for low-fat meats has led to cuts that are 
        drier and tougher. To offset this problem, some meat packers have resorted 
        to injecting low-fat meats like pork chops and chicken breasts with various 
        substances to make them more juicy. These substances may or may not bother 
        your bladder, but they will definitely affect the flavor and texture of 
        the meat). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="porkchop.jpg" width="139" height="170" align="right"><b>Boston 
        Glazed Pork Chops<br>
        serves 2</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>- - marinade:</i><br>
        1 Tbsp. salt<br>
        1 Tbsp. sugar<br>
        1 cup hot water<br>
        1/4 tsp. minced fresh rosemary</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>- - glaze:</i><br>
        1/3 cup dark rum or vodka<br>
        1/3 cup pure maple syrup<br>
        1/4 cup olive oil<br>
        1/4 tsp. lemon extract</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2 pork chops, medium 
        thickness, trimmed<br>
        1 Tbsp. vegetable oil</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Combine ingredients 
        for marinade in a plastic bag or a covered dish, mixing well to dissolve 
        the salt and sugar crystals. Add the two pork chops, making sure they 
        are covered with liquid. Place in refrigerator for 45 minutes- no longer. 
        Remove pork chops, rinse well under running water, and pat dry with paper 
        towels. Discard the marinade.<br>
        <br>
        Combine all of the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat to boiling, 
        then reduce heat and simmer for ten minutes. (Alcohol boils and evaporates 
        at a lower temperature than water. Simmering will remove it.)<br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, in a skillet brown the pork chops in vegetable oil. Add about 
        2 tablespoons of water to the skillet and cover. Reduce heat and cook 
        until chops are thoroughly cooked. Turn heat to high under the skillet 
        and pour the glaze into the skillet, scraping up browned bits and meat 
        juices. As the glaze turns frothy stir the liquid with a spatula and turn 
        chops in the liquid for a minute or so. Remove chops to a platter and 
        serve. NOTE: You can vary the saltiness of the meat by increasing or decreasing 
        the amount of salt in the marinade. </font></p>

        <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- - Wine - - </font> </h4>
      </div>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Ok, so you're armed 
        with your antihistamines and <a href="http://www.prelief.com">Prelief 
        </a>and you've managed to get your IC under fairly good control... so 
        now you're ready to be a bit adventurous this holiday season... perhaps 
        you feel like trying a bit of wine with this pork dish? There are some 
        excellent white wines out there that are low in sulfites. Sulfites have 
        been added to wine for centuries to increase the shelf life. Sulfites 
        (which also occur naturally in wine) can be problematic for people with 
        IC, particularly those who tend to be allergenic because they may irritate 
        the mast cells in our bladders and elsewhere. Although there's no real 
        way to know which wines are naturally lower in sulfites (many factors 
        affect sulfite levels), at least we can avoid the ones that have added 
        sulfites. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="wineglass.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left">One 
        good choice is <a href="http://www.badgermtnvineyard.com/"> <b>Badger 
        Mountain's Johannisberg Riesling</b></a> (only about $7.00 per bottle). 
        It is wonderful served with pork and winter vegetable dishes. Riesling 
        is fairly acidic as wines go, so you might want to use just a bit more 
        antacids than you'd use with a chardonmnay, for instance. And be sure 
        to check that it's okay to drink wine while using your prescribed medications. 
        One other tip-- low-sulfite wine goes bad, so be sure to buy a recent 
        vintage and drink it soon after purchase. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>- - Side 
        Dishes - - </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here are two a tasty 
        side dishes that's are wonderful accompaniments for pork or poultry. One 
        word of warning-- the first recipe is only for those who can tolerate 
        cooked onions-- which isn't absolutely everyone. (Many IC people who cannot 
        eat raw onions can get away with eating well cooked onions. Again, that 
        may be a sulfite tolerance issue.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="squashsmall.jpg" width="200" height="140" align="right">Butternut 
        Squash with Onions<br>
        serves 3</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1 Tbsp. olive oil<br>
        1 c. white or yellow bulb onion, chopped in half-inch chunks (see note)<br>
        3 large garlic cloves, sliced<br>
        2-1/2 c. butternut squash, peeled and chopped in half-inch chunks<br>
        1/3 c. hot water<br>
        1 Tbsp. brown sugar, packed<br>
        1/3 c. white wine (see note)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Place the chopped 
        onion in a colander and rinse well under running water. Drain for a moment. 
        In a large skillet over medium heat, saut&#130; the onion and garlic in 
        the olive oil until the onion begins to brown, about 6 minutes. Add the 
        squash and cook, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dissolve the brown 
        sugar in the hot water and then add the wine. Pour over the squash in 
        the skillet and cover. Simmer covered until squash is tender, about 10 
        minutes. Uncover and cook while stirring another minute or so to evaporate 
        the liquid. Spoon into a serving dish. NOTE: Rinsing the onion removes 
        some of the troublesome sulfite compounds and frying (a higher temperature 
        than boiling) removes others. You can make the recipe even more bladder-friendly 
        by using green onions instead of bulb onions. The alcohol and most of 
        the sulfites in the wine boils off during cooking. If you don't have white 
        wine on hand though, don't substitute red wine (it has a lot more bladder-irritating 
        histamine-- which doesn't boil off). You can substitute 1/4 cup light 
        rum or vodka (no histamines)for the 1/3 cup wine, in a pinch.<br>
