<p align="left">In case you've never tried to cook <b>winter squash</b>, it couldn't 
  be <b>simpler</b>: Cut in half with a big sharp knife. Remove seeds. (If you've 
  ever carved a pumpkin, these two steps should be very familiar.) Put in a baking 
  pan (I use glass, metal or ceramic would also work) cut side down, with a little 
  water in the pan. Or rub the cut side with a little oil first. Bake in a medium 
  oven (325, or 350, or 400, etc.) until it's easily pierced with a fork. Remove, 
  and eat. Possible toppings: many like maple syrup, I like salt and pepper. I've 
  also added my cut, seeded halves of winter squash to the crockpot with some 
  water, and let it cook that way for a few hours. This method works especially 
  well when all you want is the cooked flesh to puree for a soup or other dish. 
</p>
<p align="left"><b>Julia's winter squash/pumpkin preparations</b>: </p>
<p align="left">I put cut up pieces (large ones) already seeded into my crock 
  pot for 2 or so hours on high. When a fork can easily pierce the squash/pumpkin 
  pieces, I remove it and scrape the flesh into my food processor and whirl a 
  bit. Then I freeze in 1 and 2 cup increments. Soup and pie are obvious and delicious 
  choices, I also put 1 cup of this puree into nearly every batch of muffins, 
  waffles, cookies, pancakes, biscuits etc. that I make. I just take an existing 
  recipe and add my cup of squash puree. It nearly always works, and my kids are 
  none the wiser. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Winter Squash Gratin</b> </p>
<p align="left"><a href="../images/photogallery/wintersq.butternut.jpg">Click 
  here for a photo of a <b>butternut squash</b>. </a></p>
<p align="left">adapted from The Greens Cookbook by D. Madison and E. Brown </p>
<p align="left">2 tablespoons olive oil </p>
<p align="left">1 onion, finely chopped </p>
<p align="left">1 clove garlic, minced </p>
<p align="left">1/4 teaspoon thyme </p>
<p align="left">1 bay leaf </p>
<p align="left">salt </p>
<p align="left">1/2 cup dry white wine </p>
<p align="left">1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper or 1/2 teaspoon paprika </p>
<p align="left">1 pound tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped</p>
<p align="left"> sugar, if necessary </p>
<p align="left">Pepper </p>
<p align="left">1 butternut winter squash, weighing 2 1/2 to 3 pounds </p>
<p align="left">4 ounces Fontina or Gruyere cheese, sliced </p>
<p align="left">Freshly chopped parsley</p>
<p align="left">Heat the olive oil and add the onion, garlic, thyme, bay leaf 
  and a little salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the onion 
  is soft; then add the wine and let it reduce by half. Add the cayenne or paprika 
  and the tomatoes. Cook slowly for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the 
  sauce is thick. Taste, add a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes are tart, and season 
  with the salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
<p align="left">While the tomatoes are cooking, prepare the squash. Cut it open, 
  scoop our the seeds and strings, and then, with the flat cut surface resting 
  on the counter, shave off the skin. (The butternut can easily be peeled with 
  a vegetable peeler before it is cut in half. Another method is to cut the squash 
  into pieces and then remove the skin from each piece. This takes more time, 
  but you may find it easier. </p>
<p align="left">Slice the peeled squash into large pieces about 3 inches long 
  and 1/4 inch thick. Heat enough oil to generously coat the bottom of a large 
  skillet, and fry the squash on both sides, so that it is browned and just tender. 
  Remove it to some toweling to drain; then season with salt and freshly ground 
  pepper.</p>
<p align="left">Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. To form the gratin, put a few 
  spoonfuls of the tomato sauce on the bottom of individual gratin dishes, or 
  use it all to cover the bottom of one large dish. Lay the squash on top in overlapping 
  layers with slices of the cheese interspersed between th layers. Bake until 
  the cheese is melted and the gratin is hot, about 15 minutes, and serve with 
  the fresh parsley scattered over the surface. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Curried Mushroom &amp; Squash Soup</b><br>
  ala Moosewood <br>
  (p. 12 in the original Moosewood Cookbook by Molly Katzen)</p>
<p align="left">At least one and one-half hours to prepare &amp; simmer 4-5 servings<br>
  2 medium butternut or acorn squash<br>
  2-1/2 cups water or stock<br>
  1 c. orange juice<br>
  2 Tbl. butter<br>
  1/2 c. chopped onion<br>
  1 medium clove crushed garlic<br>
  6 oz. mushrooms, sliced1/2 tsp ground cumin </p>
<p align="left">1/2 tsp coriander </p>
<p align="left">1/2 tsp ground ginger </p>
<p align="left">1/2 tsp cinnamon </p>
<p align="left">1/4 tsp dry mustard </p>
<p align="left">1 tsp salt (or to taste) </p>
<p align="left">a few dashes cayenne </p>
<p align="left">optional: fresh lemon juice </p>
<p align="left">garnishes: chopped, toasted, almonds yogurt</p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Split the squash lengthwise and bake face-down in a 375s oven on an oiled tray, 
  30 minutes or until quite soft. Cook and scoop out the insides. You'll need 
  about 3 cups worth. Put it in the blender with the water or stock and puree 
  until smooth. Combine in a kettle or saucepan with the orange juice.</p>
<p align="left">Heat the butter in a skillet and add the garlic, onion, salt and 
  spices. Saute until the onion is very soft. (You may need to add a little water 
  if it sticks). Add mushrooms, cover and cook 10 minutes.</p>
<p align="left">Add the saute to the squash, scraping the skillet well to salvage 
  all the good stuff. Heat everything together very gently. Taste to correct seasoning. 
  Since this is a fairly sweet soup, you may want to spruce it up with some fresh 
  lemon juice.</p>
<p align="left">Serve topped with yogurt and chopped, toasted almonds. (Note: 
  this soup need not be served immediately. Simmer a while, and the flavors can 
  mature.)</p>
<p align="left"><br>
  TANA'S VARIATIONS<br>
  I usually make at least twice, if not three or four times the recipe in my big 
  pot, because this is a soup that my neighbors love, and I can freeze it if I 
  need to (I've never had it last more than two days).</p>
<p align="left">I saute the onions separately and puree with the squash.</p>
<p align="left">I mix the spices in a little bowl, and add half to the squash 
  puree and half to the mushrooms as they cook.</p>
<p align="left">I use half the orange juice called for, and half of that goes 
  into the mushrooms and half into the pot with the squash and onions.</p>
<p align="left">I use the chicken-flavored vegetarian bouillon powder (available 
  at New Leaf) in place of plain water. I don't measure it, I just add it to the 
  squash as I blend it, and then add more as needed at the end, after adding the 
  mushrooms. Don't bother using chicken bouillon-who needs another excuse to use 
  animal fat when it tastes so good without?</p>
<p align="left">I use lots more mushrooms than called for. Saute them in: butter, 
  fresh Meyer's lemon juice (nothing else will do, and it is not optional in my 
  recipe!), half the o.j. (or Grand Marnier, a tablespoon or so (or pale cooking 
  sherry), lots freshly ground pepper, a teeny of salt (I wait to add most of 
  the salt until the mushrooms are in the soup-tamari can be substituted), and 
  the remaining half of the spice mix. The important thing, to me, is to cook 
  the mushrooms until the flavor is seared into them, and the juice is quite diminished. 
  This concentrates the flavor, which goes right into the soup, providing, with 
  the lemon juice, the counterbalance to the sweetish spices. You can even save 
  some mushrooms aside to put on riceSyum.</p>
<p align="left">Because I saute the mushrooms separately from the onions, I suppose 
  I use more butter than is called for, but that can be remedied if you believe 
  in calories. The onions could easily be cooked in vegetable oil, saving the 
  butter for the mushrooms.</p>
<p align="left">I usually add more Meyer's lemon juice at the end. The soup is 
  too sweet without it, and even with the spices, too bland. I'd say at least 
  1/4 cup per recipe is good-some for the mushrooms and some at the end, right 
  in the soup.</p>
<p align="left">After sitting a while, I have to thin this soup with the bouillon. 
</p>
<p><b>NEW ZEALAND PUMPKIN SOUP</b> serves about 10 </p>
<p>6# Medium Rouge Vif d'etampes pumpkin </p>
<p>4 medium onions, peeled and chopped</p>
<p> 4 Tablespoons olive oil </p>
<p>4 cloves of garlic </p>
<p>4 cups Chicken broth </p>
<p>2 cups white wine</p>
<p> Salt and Pepper </p>
<p>1 cup heavy cream </p>
<p>Optional garnishes: grated nutmeg, chopped crystallized or fresh ginger, croutons, 
  or freshly popped popcorn </p>
<p>Cook Pumpkin in oven: cut in half and remove seeds and string. Bake at 350 
  until a fork easily pierces the entire squash, about 45 minutes. While the pumpkin 
  is cooling, lightly brown onions in olive oil. Add garlic and cook until it 
  softens but doesn't brown, about 1-2 minutes. Add coked pumpkin pulp, broth 
  and wine. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 30 minutes or so on medium 
  heat, then use an immersible blender to puree, or use a food processor or blender. 
  (Cool the mixture for safety if you don't have an immersible blender.) Serve 
  hot with 2-3 tablespoons heavy cream in each bowl. Garnish with: nutmeg, ginger, 
  croutons or popcorn </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gail P.s squash soup</b> </p>
<p>For the butternut squash soup, which I make a lot of, I microwave whole squashes 
  stabbed all over, then leave out on counter until cool and either use then or 
  refrig for a day or two until I'm ready to use, doesn't matter if unevenly cooked, 
  just makes it much easier to peel and seed. Then saute leeks or onions, add 
  cup of raw garlic, saute in butter and olive oil, add canned chicken stock or 
  water for vegetarians, can of coconut milk, lots of squash, chopped candied 
  ginger, curry powder, cook a few minutes, then blend in small batches, putting 
  into a soup tureen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pumpkin or Winter Squash Puree </b></p>
<p>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone Deborah Madison </p>
<p>Easy, versatile and useful, leftovers can fill ravioli, turn into a soup, or 
  be added to muffins, breads, biscuits, and waffles. Preheat oven to 375 F. Halve, 
  seed, and bake 3 pounds pumpkin or winter squash until tender, approx. 30 - 
  40 mins. Scrape the flesh away from the skin, then beat until smooth with a 
  large wooden spoon This should be easy unless the squash is stringy, in which 
  case, use a food processor or food mill. Stir in butter to taste and season 
  with salt and pepper. Makes about 2 cups. To enrich the puree, grate Gruyére 
  , Fountain, or Emmenthaler into it. Flavor with extra virgin olive oil, or dark 
  sesame oil, or mix in sautéed onions. </p>
