        Without a ball being hit there are already two seeded players who have 
        dropped out of the mens open. <br>
        <br>
        The biggest shock was the news that, number one seed, George Saunders-Singer 
        has withdrawn. This was due to an unexpected offer of a free holiday, 
        that unfortunately fell in the middle of the tournament. After a brief 
        amount of consideration there was only going to be one winner, and suffice 
        to say it wasn't the squash! <br>
        <br>
        The other seed to pull out was Jeremy Vivian (13) <a href="images/Gallery%20Pictures/Jeremy.jpg" target="_blank">[picture]</a>. 
        Although, by his own admission, he was always going to struggle against 
        the quality of the higher seeds, Jeremy would always guarantee a valiant 
        battle in his matches. However this year he has been defeated by a nagging 
        elbow injury and despite being ambidextrous, the absence of any sort of 
        backhand in his shot repertoire</font><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial"> 
        has forced his withdrawal.<br>
        <br>
        As luck would have it there were two players (Chris Law and Allan Bransby) 
        who just missed the draw deadline and I have been able to slot them straight 
        in to take the places of George and Jeremy respectively.<br>

        The prelims took place on Tuesday 20th April. They ran very smoothly with 
        all competitors turning up nice and promptly (thank-you to all concerned, 
        it makes my life a lot easier!).</font></p>

        <font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial">The top half of the draw played 
        their 1st round matches last night (Thurs 22nd April). Again the the matches 
        were well supported with the crowd cheering on the underdogs in true British 
        tradition. However there were no upsets to see and all seeds progressed 
        to the next round.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Chris Law</strong> eased his way past <strong>Julian Mann</strong> 
        winning 3-0<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Calan Horsman</strong> had a good tournament debut, especially 
        in the first game, against <strong>Damien Cannon</strong>. Damien was 
        up to the newcomer's challenge and eventually won convincingly 3-0<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Kevin Silver</strong> won a bad tempered match against <strong>Pat 
        Earl</strong> 3-1. This was always destined to be a competitive fixture 
        with these two fiery and argumentative characters! A change of marker 
        was needed half way through to prevent all out war, but Kevin held his 
        nerve to finish Pat off in four games.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Bruce Cade</strong> <a href="images/Gallery%20Pictures/Bruce.jpg" target="_blank">[picture] 
        </a>ran around a lot to beat another newcomer <strong>Michael Johnson</strong> 
        3-0. Michael is yet another promising young talent to appear out of nowhere 
        and we hope he continues to improve and force his way into one of the 
        lower teams. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Allan Bransby</strong> eventually turned up (a little more prompt 
        for the next round please Allan!) and put in a strong performance to beat 
        <strong>Bernard Roberts </strong>3-0. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Andy Veasey</strong>, despite his accurate tennis shots, was no 
        match for <strong>Faraz Khan</strong>, the number 3 seed. Andy put in 
        a spirited performance and never gave up, but Faraz was just too experienced 
        to lose this one. Faraz won in straight games 3-0<br>
        <br>
        Probably the most promising new comer to emerge so far is <strong>Mark 
        Lemon</strong>. Mark apparently plays off a golf handicap of 5 and looked 
        like giving <strong>Stuart Slater</strong> a stern challenge in the first 
        game. However Stuart used his power to smash Mark off court in the latter 
        games winning in the end 3-0.<br>
        <br>
        Finally it really did look like an upset was on the cards in the match 
        of <strong>Tim Taylor</strong> <a href="images/Gallery%20Pictures/Tim.jpg" target="_blank">[picture]</a> 
        (1st team player/captain and number 5 seed) vs <strong>Charles Hiscock</strong> 
        (3rd team player and unseeded). Charles took the first game with a powerhouse 
        display, however it seemed like it took all of his energy as he visibly 
        faded in the next few games. Tim eventually won 3-1, much to the dismay 
        of the gallery (sorry Tim!)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Thank-you to all the people who have been required to mark. Nobody

        </u>The bottom half of the draw played their 1st round matches two nights 
        ago (Tues 27th April). Sorry about the slight delay in updating this site, 
        I fell asleep last night before I remembered I had something to do!<br>
        <br>
        A disappointing turn out, not from the point of view of spectators but 
        players failing to appear (FTA). In fact 50% of the scheduled matches 
        were awarded as walkovers. These matches being:<br>
        <strong><br>
        Dave Hershman</strong> awarded a walkover against <strong>Michael Howard</strong> 
        (FTA reason unknown)<br>
        <strong>Paul Salman</strong> awarded walkover against <strong>John Cohen</strong> 
        (FTA injured)<br>
        <strong>Brendan Murphy</strong> awarded walkover against <strong>Fergus 
        Traynor</strong> (FTA got wrong date) <br>
        <strong>Mike Fitzpatrick</strong> awarded a walkover against <strong>David 
        Cohen</strong> (FTA injured)<br>
        <br>
        Still the remaining matches were hard fought and at least one was very 
        close.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Simon Cohen</strong> put on a commanding show to beat <strong>Neil 
        Collett</strong> in straight games 3-0<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Rick Prior</strong> was tested but not troubled by <strong>Anthony 
        Kearns</strong>, winning 3-0<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Monzoor Khan</strong> showed why he is #2 seed, beating <strong>Phil 
        Hyslop</strong> effortlessly 3-0<br>
        <br>
        But the game of the round was definitely <strong>Craig Rossiter</strong> 
        (2nd team player, #8 seed and last years finalist) vs <strong>Ian Baker</strong> 
        (3rd team player &amp; unseeded). Modesty isn't one of Craig's best attributes; 
        in fact he's already got his diary arranged to make sure he's available 
        to play in the final on 22nd May!! This made this match a very exciting 
        spectacle indeed, as those who know Ian and have seen him play recently, 
        know full well how much his game has come on in the last 12 months. <br>
        <br>
        Ian took the first game 10-9, before Craig leveled making it 1-1. Ian 
        then went on to take the third game, with the full support of the balcony 
        egging him on. Unfortunately for Ian, Craig got a couple of lucky nicks 
        before leveling at 2-2. By this time Ian was visibly tiring and Craig 
        asserted his fitness and experience winning the match 3-2.<br>

        10th (tomorrow night) due to Faraz being ill.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Monzoor Khan</strong> was awarded a walkover in his scheduled 
        match against <strong>Mike Fitzpatrick</strong> who failed to appear (reason 
        unknown).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Bruce Cade</strong> won a disjointed match vs <strong>Kevin Silver</strong>. 
        Bruce, who is the master of psyche, immediately employed all his tactics 
        and didn't allow Kevin to settle and get into his stride. He slowed the 
        match right down between points to such an extent the referee (Pete Hughes) 
        reminded both players that play was supposed to be continuous! Kevin never 
        really looked like pressurising Burce enough and Bruce ended up winning 
        the match in straight games 3-0.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Craig Rossiter </strong>beat <strong>Rick Prior</strong> 3-1 in 
        a hard fought battle. Rick took the first game 9-7 before Craig stormed 
        back taking the next 9-0! The next game was again close but Craig again 
        was the more consistent winning 9-6. The fourth game was very close with 
        several handouts when at 5-4 Craig brushed against Rick's arm and, with 
        a theatrical dive, apparently knocked himself out. Craig (glass jaw to 
        his friends) eventually returned on court after a 10 minute injury break. 
        Rick then took the next few points giving him a couple of game points. 
        Despite a golden opportunity to win the game and take the match to a 5th 
        game, Rick failed to play a simple drop shot and instead played it straight 
        back to Craig at the back of the court, losing the point. Craig then went 
        on to win the game and match 3-1.<br>
        <br>
        The surprise of the round was <strong>Brendan Murphy's</strong> 3-1 victory 
        against last years winner <strong>Simon Cohen</strong>. Simon took the 
        first game comfortably before Brendan found his rhythm taking the next. 
        Simon made a lot of unforced errors in the next two games, but this is 
        taking nothing away from a very assured and clinical performance by the 
        newcomer.<br>
        <br>
        The final two matches I did not witness and so can't write anything about; 
        other than <strong>Tim Taylor</strong> is into the next round having beaten 
        <strong>Stuart Slater</strong> 3-0 (never mind Stuart, at least you can 
        concentrate on your tennis now!) and Dave Hershman is also through having

        winning in straight games 3-0. Although Chris was lacking in match fitness,

        Khan</strong> put in another power-house display to beat <strong>Craig

        Craig a couple of games just to get used to how fast the ball was coming 
        back at him. Even though Craig guessed right for a number of Monzoor's 
        drives, the sheer power and accuracy was too much for him.<br>

      <p align="justify"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Tim 
        Taylor's</strong> fitness was the critical factor in his 3-2 victory against 
        <strong>Chris Law</strong>. Chris Law played some lovely squash to go 
        2-0 up. Tim appeared to have no answer to Chris's superior shots and match 
        play. However Chris started to puff noticeably in the second game and 
        by mid way through the third he was clearly flagging. Tim was spurred 
        on by this and took the next two games comfortably. Chris fought hard 
        in the 5th, but his fitness, in the end, let him down.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial">Despite a 
        valiant effort by <strong>Brendan Murphy</strong>, <strong>Monzoor Khan</strong> 
        powered to a straight games victory winning 3-0. The 1st game was very 
        close, but Monzoor contested every point and in the end demoralised Brendan 
        by chasing down even the tightest of shots.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Arial">To those 
        who have seen the majority of Monzoor's games during this tournament, 
        it was no surprise to see him put in yet another merciless performance. 
        Every point was chased by Monzoor regardless of how good a shot Tim played, 
        and the majority of the time he got them back. Tim contested the 1st game 
        well but it went downhill for him after that. In the final game Tim, uncharacteristically 
        put a series of shots in the tin or out of court. This could be explained 
        by the pressure Monzoor had exerted on Tim for the whole match, forcing 
        him to play for hopeful winners. In the end Monzoor was the rightful winner 
        of the tournament having not conceded a game in any of the previous rounds.</font></p>
