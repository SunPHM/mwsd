        <p><strong>Results from the World Masters:<br>
        </strong>Mens 55+ Dave Adams: <br>
        Won his first round match over Ernie Speed of Australia
        (9/1, 9/2, 9/2 ). He then won his second round match over
        Gerry Poulton of Canada (9/3, 9/2, 10/9). Dave lost in
        the third round to Van Es of South Africa (3/9, 7/9, 9/4,
        9/10, 9/4). </p>
        <p>Mens 60+ Paul Marley:<br>
        Paul won his first round match over Derek Ingham of
        England (9/5, 9/1, 9/0). He then lost in the second round
        to Barry Gardiner of New Zealand (9/6, 9/2, 9/4). Barry
        Gardiner went on to win the event with losing a game. </p>
        <p>Complete tournament information is available at <a
        href="http://www.squashtalk.com/">Squash Talk</a>. </p>
        <p><strong>David Yik</strong> lost to Josh McDonald in
        the finals of the Boys Under 19 in Canadian Junior
        Nationals in Toronto last April (9/6), (10/8),(9/5). Josh
        apparently trains with world champion Jonathon Power </p>

        <p>David is off to Princeton this fall. Good luck David
        !! </p>
        <p><strong>2nd Anual summer Doubles Squash Tournament</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Over 50 participants competed in the 2nd Annual Summer
        Doubles Squash Tournament, July 13th to 18th. The play
        was surprisingly good for summer (apparently Tim Kehler
        trained and peaked for this event!) and everyone had a
        great time off the courts enjoying the around-the-clock
        barbeque and basking in the sun with their souvenir lawn
        chair. </p>
        <p>A few highlights on the courts including the mens open
        finals as winners, Winston Cabell and Bob Smart, beating
        Scott Kidd and Tim Kehler after being down 4 match points
        to beat them 15/14 in the fifth! Another great effort was
        first timers from out of no where, Ben Block and Stephano
        Walker of Hollyburn C.C. winning the Men's Div 1. Also,
        the new team of Penny Wedd and Mark Heaney making their
        debut by winning the mixed event. A new dynasty in the
        making? You'll have to ask Penny's husband Bob Smart for
        the answer to that one. The women's draw was small but
        probably the fiercest competition in the event as all
        were fairly evenly matched and anyone could have won. It
        was also great to see Ruth Castilino back on the courts!
        Anyway, I would like to thank the following for their
        help: Keith Jolly / Manuever Services and Events for
        providing prizes for the winners and the silent auction;
        Don Smerch / Freybe Sausages for providing food for the
        barbeque and wine the and cheese party and getting the
        keg of bear from Bowen Island Brewery; Marv Mizinski for
        helping with the draw; and Cia Van Horne for making up
        the entry forms. Also a special thanks for Holyburn
        Country Club for the use of their court and the BC
        Doubles Squash Association for providing free entries for
        &quot;first timers&quot;. </p>
