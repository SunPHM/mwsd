            <img src="images/squash12.jpg" width="200" height="213" align="right">Squash is one of the
            popular games in the world and is also popular in various parts of India as well. Though
            very few people know about squash in Hyderabad, the game is steadily gaining popularity
            due to some squash enthusiasts like T. Ambrose, Ajay Reddy, Ram Reddy, D.Bhatia and
            Premchand. These stalwarts have played in several tournaments in the past and were quite
            enthusiastic about the development of this sport. They also evinced keen interest in
            constructing at least three more courts in and around the twin cities in localities like
            Shamirpet and Hitech City. </font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The game of squash is a
            racket game, which is played on an indoor-enclosed rectangular court. The singles court is
            6.40m wide by 9.75m. The doubles court is almost 50% longer than singles courts and 20%
            wider. In the singles game, two players take turns to hit the ball onto the front wall, in
            an area defined by an out line at the top of the court and the top of the &quot;tin&quot;
            which runs across and near the bottom of the front wall. The doubles game is similar
            except that instead of players taking turns to hit the ball, either members of each team
            hits the ball in turn.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Squash history in Hyderabad began in the seventies, when
            the game was only played among the defence establishments in Secunderabad. At that time,
            there were courts only at the Secunderabad Cantonment area namely RSI Bolarum and MCEME.
            The one that was available to the civilians was at the Secunderabad Club. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During eighties, few tournaments were conducted. Once a
            State level tournament was also conducted which was, as expected, dominated by army
            players who won all the titles. However the game wasn&#146;t popular at that time and was
            not considered as a mainstream sport. Later Country Club at Begumpet took the initiative
            and decided to revive the sport, which conducted a tournament, that attracted some of the
            top players in the State, and for the first time, many young boys and girls took up active
            participation in the sport.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Currently, the city has several players from various army
            units as well as civilians. The game is really a fast paced one and requires tremendous
            concentration and fitness. If a player desires to reach the top level in this sport, what
            is required is a good eye for judging the flight, bounce of the ball, anticipation and
            quick reflexes. But above all, the prime requirement is an even temperament and a total
            commitment to fair play and sportsmanship. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What differentiates squash with other similar sports like
            badminton or tennis is that the two rivals, are together on the same side in a small area
            with any net in between and often in close proximity to each other. This poses an
            opportunity for a player to injure his opponent with the racket, whenever he looses his
            temper in the play. But however this is a rare sight in squash and fortunately it has
            never been witnessed in any of the tournaments in Hyderabad. This only emphasizes the
            sportive spirit of the game. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However the main hurdle for promotion of this game is the
            sponsorship. In order to conduct any sports event, it involves huge expenditure and for
            this sponsorship becomes inevitable. Organisations such as Apollo Hospitals, Dr. Reddy
            Labs and Amara Raja Batteries have come forward to sponsor squash tournaments in the past.
            But that wouldn&#146;t be enough considering the long term requirements of the game and
            definitely a major sponsor is required to promote this game to bring in line with any
            mainstream sport like badminton or tennis. State Government also on its part should take
            certain initiatives in allotting some funds in promoting this wonderful game or tie up
            with some major private organisations to regularly conduct squash tournaments. Let&#146;s
            hope for the better!</font></td>
