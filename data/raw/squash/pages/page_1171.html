<h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p> Developing new kinds and types of vegetable crops is beneficial to both the 
  grower and the consumer. Diversification of vegetable crops expands a grower&#146;s 
  market and simultaneously increases a consumer&#146;s choice of vegetables. 
  New cultivars can also improve fruit nutritional components. The objective of 
  this investigation is to determine the adaptation and fruit nutritional content 
  of two spaghetti squash (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i> L.) cultivars grown in south 
  Florida.</p>
<p> The traditional &#145;Vegetable&#146; spaghetti squash originated in Mexico/Central 
  America (Maynard et al. 2001). Cultural practices can vary considerably because 
  of the wide diversity of environments which spaghetti squash are grown (Zitter 
  et al. 1998). &#145;Vegetable&#146; spaghetti squash production practices are 
  similar to watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>). Propagation begins with direct 
  seeding and plants mature 80&#150;100 days after seeding, depending on cultivar 
  and environmental conditions. The plants have a vine habit and fruit mature 
  between rows (bare soil) rather than directly on the plastic covered beds.</p>
<p> The original orange type spaghetti squash, &#145;Orangetti&#146;, was developed 
  in 1986 at the Department of Vegetable Crops, Agricultural Research Organization, 
  Newe Ya&#146;ar Experiment Station, Israel in 1986 and released in the United 
  States in the early 1990s (Paris 1993). &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; (Seedway, 
  Inc., Hall, New York) are very similar to summer squash (yellow and zucchini). 
  Direct seeding on raised, plastic covered beds produce a marketable yield in 
  approximately 80 days from seeding. The compact bush plant habit helps to keep 
  the fruit on the beds. Both cultivars are harvested once. Minimal research and 
  marketing have been conducted comparing the two cultivars.</p>
<h2> HORTICULTURE</h2>
<p> Spaghetti squash (<i>Cucurbita pepo</i> L., Cucurbitaceae) are typically grown 
  as a winter squash. Most spaghetti squash are have cylinder-shaped fruit 10&#150;13 
  cm in diameter and 20&#150;23 cm long with rounded ends. The rind is hard and 
  ivory colored at maturity.</p>
<p> The traditional &#145;Vegetable&#146; spaghetti squash cultivar (Fig. 1) has 
  a vining plant habit and matures approximately 90 days after seeding. Fruit 
  are harvested once-over and offer an off-white flesh of crisp-tender strands 
  resembling spaghetti. The flesh is very low in calories (50 per 100 g edible 
  portion), an excellent source of folic acid, high in fiber, contribute a fair 
  amount of potassium (369 mg), and small amounts of vitamin A (3700 international 
  units) to the diet, but are very low in sodium (1 mg) (Food and Nutrition Solutions 
  1993).</p>

<p> The &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; spaghetti squash cultivar (Fig. 2) features 
  a unique compact bush plant habit with small, oblong, deep orange fruit, 18&#150;20 
  cm long with a rich orange flesh (Anon. 1996). Fruit are harvested once approximately 
  85 days after seeding. The &#147;orange-type&#148; spaghetti strands are sweeter 
  and less-bland in taste than &#145;Vegetable&#146; with a higher content of 
  the provitamin A (carotene) (Beany et al. 1998).</p>

<h2> TRIALS</h2>
<p> The University of Florida&#146;s Indian River Research and Education Center 
  in Fort Pierce has been conducting traditional vs. &#147;orange type&#148; spaghetti 
  squash cultivar trials for four years. During the 1999 fall season, the cultivar 
  trial was conducted at Green Cay Farms in Boynton Beach, Florida. The experimental 
  site was cleared and tilled. Approximately 38 t/ha of a yard trimming/biosolid 
  compost was applied on Sept. 3, 1999. Fertilizer was broadcast at 71 N&#150;39 
  P&#150;44 K (kg/ha). Beds were constructed at 1.7 m centers. A center band of 
  fertilizer, 283 N&#150;0 P&#150;279 K (kg/ha), was applied and beds covered 
  with a clear polyethylene mulch. On Oct. 6, 1999, three weeks later, white polyethylene 
  mulch was applied over the clear. Squash were seeded two seed per hill on Oct. 
  28, 1999, one row per bed with a 61 cm with-in-row spacing (Hamner and Stoffella 
  1996). If both seed emerged, plants were thinned to one seedling per hill. Plant 
  population was equivalent to 7,687 plants/ha. Plots were 9.1 m long and consisted 
  of 15 plants each. A randomized complete block experimental design was used 
  with each cultivar replicated four times.</p>
<p> Throughout the growing season, subsurface irrigation maintained the water 
  level at about 35 cm below the soil surface. Applications of insecticides and 
  fungicides were used on a weekly basis for control of insects and diseases. 
  All pesticides were used according to recommended label instructions.</p>
<p> All 15 plants of each plot were harvested Jan. 16, 2000. Fruit from each plot 
  were counted and weighed. Mean fruit yield (no. and kg/ha) and mean fruit size 
  (kg/fruit) were calculated for each plot. Each variable was subjected to an 
  analysis of variance. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical 
  Analysis System (SAS) computer program (SAS Institute 2001).</p>
<p> Typically, the &#145;Vegetable&#146; cultivar matures in 100 days and the 
  &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; in 80 days (Anon. 1996). In this trial, both cultivars 
  were harvested in 80 days. Marketable fruit yields, kg/ha, were significantly 
  higher for &#145;Vegetable&#146; (15.3 t/ha) than for &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; 
  (8.6 t/ha) (Table 1). &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; marketable number of fruit/ha 
  was significantly lower than &#145;Vegetable&#146; squash. The higher marketable 
  yield for &#145;Vegetable&#146; squash was partly attributed to its vine plant 
  habit as compared with the bush plant habit of &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146;. Perhaps 
  higher plant populations for &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; would produce marketable 
  yields more equivalent to &#145;Vegetable&#146; spaghetti squash (Beany and 
  Stoffella 1997). Mean fruit size did not differ among cultivars.</p>

<p><sup>z</sup>Significant at the 5 (*) or 1% (**) level or non significant (NS), 
  respectively.<br>
  <sup>y</sup>Fruit displaying physiological defects (discolored and disfigured) 
  and size smaller than 0.68 kg, % weight basis.</p>
<p> Both cultivars exhibited damage from the melonworm [<i>Dinphania hyalinata</i> 
  (L.)], exterior fruit discoloration, and disfigured, bumpy, fruit. However, 
  percent cull fruit did not differ among varieties.</p>
<p> A nutrient and compositional sugar analysis were conducted on fruit from each 
  cultivar. Individual fruit were peeled, longitudinally cut in half, and uniformly 
  grated over the entire surface to a depth of about 5 mm. The grated tissue from 
  each of the six individual fruit replications was used for the compositional 
  analysis. Randomly selected tissue (10.0 g) were homogenized in 80% ethanol 
  for 1 min at high speed using a Virtis homogenizer. The resulting slurry was 
  immediately boiled for 15 min, cooled and filtered through Whatman #4 paper. 
  The residue and original container were washed with an additional 80% ethanol 
  and made to a final volume of 100 mL. About 5 mL were filtered through a 0.45 
  &micro;m filter membrane before HPLC analysis using a Bio-Sil Amino 55 resin 
  column (Bio-Rad Labr.) following the procedure of Picha (1985).</p>
<p> Total carotenoids are an indication of beta-carotene content (Purcell 1962) 
  which is a precursor of vitamin A (RDA 1980). The carotenoids were determined 
  using a slight modification of the procedure of Reddy and Sistrunk (1980). Exactly 
  0.100 g tissue was extracted until colorless with 10 mL hexane using a Thomas 
  E-40 tissue grinder (A.H. Thomas Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Samples were 
  filtered through Whatman #1 paper and the absorbency read at 440 nm and compared 
  to a beta-carotene standard curve. Total carotenoids were expressed on a fresh 
  weight basis (mg/100 g). Beany et al. (1998) reported that total carotenoid 
  content of &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; (1.82 mg/100 g) was significantly higher 
  than for &#145;Vegetable&#146; (0.38 mg/100 g).</p>
<p> Fruit N, Mg, S, B, Fe, Mn, and Zn content were not significantly different 
  among cultivars (Table 1). &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; had lower fruit P and 
  Ca content, but higher K and Cu content than the &#145;Vegetable&#146; cultivar. 
  &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; fruit also had lower glucose and sucrose content 
  than the &#145;Vegetable&#146; fruit. Cultivars did not differ in fruit fructose 
  content. &#145;Vegetable&#146; fruit were significantly higher in percent dry 
  weight and percent alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) as compared to the &#145;Hasta 
  La Pasta&#146;.</p>
<h2> CONSUMER PREFERENCES</h2>
<p> During a 1998 trial, a side-by-side taste test with in-store promotion of 
  special signs, labels, and microwave cooked samples for tasting was conducted. 
  Participants completed an appearance, taste, and texture survey after sampling 
  each variety of spaghetti squash and were offered recipes. Consumers indicated 
  that the appearance of the orange &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; squash was more 
  eye appealing than that of the pale yellow &#145;Vegetable&#146; squash. However, 
  consumers preferred the taste and texture of the &#145;Vegetable&#146; squash. 
  The orange type was described as &#147;less sweet&#148; and &#147;bland.&#148; 
  Of the consumers surveyed, 64.8% indicated they would purchase the &#145;Vegetable&#146; 
  squash as compared with the orange type &#145;Hasta La Pasta&#146; squash, a 
  contrast to Paris (1993) and Beany et al. (1998). Paris (1993) used the &#145;Orangetti&#146; 
  cultivar and consumers sampled only the orange type spaghetti squash. During 
  the 1998 supermarket promotion, 100% of the &#145;Vegetable&#146; spaghetti 
  squash was sold as compared to less than 50% of the orange type &#145;Hasta 
  La Pasta&#146;.</p>
