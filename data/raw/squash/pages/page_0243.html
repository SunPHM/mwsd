This is a true bug (has a triangular-shaped thorax) which is very common and potentially destructive to all members of the cucurbit family, although squash and pumpkin are preferred hosts.  The <A HREF="../graphics/large/squash_bug_adult_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalA', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalA">adults</A> have a flattened appearance; they are 5/8 inch long and brown in color, and emit an unpleasant odor when crushed.  Adults spend the winter in plant debris.  Adults mate in spring and females lay <A HREF="../graphics/large/squash_bug_eggs_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalB', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalB">masses of eggs</a>, usually on leaf undersides, that are a dark gold color.  The <A HREF="../graphics/large/squash_bug_nymphs_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalC', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalC">nymphs</a> are green with red legs and feed together in large numbers after hatching.  As they grow the legs turn black in color and bodies are gray.  Adults and nymphs suck leaf sap leaving numerous small <A HREF="../graphics/large/squash_bug_dam_leaf_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalD', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalD">white dots</a>, known as stipples.  These coalesce and leaves will yellow, wilt and turn brown.  Adults are secretive.  They prefer to rest under thick organic mulches near host plants.  There is one generation each year.</P>

<P>Large numbers of this pest can build up in a garden.  So it is critical to remove all spent plants, weeds, and debris at the end of each season.  There are resistant summer and winter squash varieties.  Plants can be covered early in the season with a floating row cover to exclude the mating adults and egg-laying females.  Handpick eggs on a regular basis.  They are rubbery and difficult to scrape off.  Try tearing out the portion of the leaf with the eggs and then destroying them underfoot or by dropping the eggs in a container of soapy water.  Rotenone, neem, horticultural oil, and insecticidal soap can be applied to control nymphs. Trap nymphs and adults with boards laid down on garden soil. The bugs will hide under them during the day.  The hiding bugs should be destroyed first thing in the morning.  If large numbers of adults are present, consider removing thick organic mulch that serves as ideal habitat.
