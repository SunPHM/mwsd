                Division A, competitive league, will play with 2 players. Players 
                register and compete individually playing with and against different 
                players every match.<br>
                If a person does not show up for their scheduled game they will 
                default that game, however a grace time of 5 minutes will be allowed. 
                They will be given a score of -2 pts for three games played. Points 
                for and agains will be 0-15 for all three games.<br>
                All leagues are open to Fitness Centre members only.<br>
                If a person has not shown up for 3 regular scheduled games without 
                notifying the Opposing players or the league coordinator, they 
                will be eliminated from the league.<br>
                Division B is our semi-competitive league that will play the first 
                round robins of a season together prior to splitting into two 
                leagues: Division B (semi-competitive) and Division C (recreational).

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Division A will play 
                45 minute matches consisting of three games to 11 or 15 points 
                as time permits.<br>
                Teams will play 3 matches during the same time period. 1 point 
                will be awarded for each match.<br>
                If during the third match one team does not reach 11 points within 
                the time limits, the team with the most points in that match will 
                be considered the winner of that match. In case of a tie, the 
                next serve will rally and the winner of that rally wins the point 
                and the last game.<br>
                The serving team receives a point when the receiving team fails 
                to return the ball in the manner allowed by the rules.<br>
                A team must win by a margin of 2 points except in the case of 
                a tie in the third game. <br>
                Top 8 players will advance to the finals in A league. <br>

                <br>
                1. Teams will volley (the ball must go over the net at least 3 
                times) to determine serve. The winner of the volley wins the serve.<br>
                2. The team serving second in the first match will serve first 
                the second match.<br>
                3. The team with the most total points (in matches 1 &amp; 2) 
                will serve. In the event of a tie, the winner of the rally at 
                the start of the matches will serve.<br>
                4. Each team will change sides after each match.<br>
                5. The service occurs in the back right hand to centre of the 
                court.<br>
                6. The server may take one step in to their serve.<br>
                7. The serve must be made by hitting the ball overhead or underhand 
                with one hand.<br>
                8. The serve is good if the ball passes over the net without touching 
                a member of the serving team, the ceiling, or any wall before 
                landing in the opponent's court.<br>
                9. Players must maintain the serving order, clockwise rotation 
                of players upon start of service.<br>
                10. No members of the serving team may block the server from the 
                opposing team.<br>
                11. A serve can only be returned over the net on the first hit 
                if it's an underhand hit. (Bump) <br>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Each team is allowed 
                up to three consecutive hits to get the ball over the net and 
                into the opponent's court.<br>
                2. A player shall not make successive contacts with the ball, 
                unless the ball is blocked at the net.<br>
                3. A ball that touches the net or rebounds off the net may be 
                played again provided it was not on the third hit.<br>
                4. An opposing player cannot block the serve from the front row.<br>
                5. The ball must cross over the net to be good.<br>
                6. A player or any part of their body cannot touch the net, unless 
                the ball was driven into the net with such force that it causes 
                the net to touch the player.<br>
                7. In returning the ball, a player may follow through over the 
                net, provided he/she first makes contact with the ball on their 
                side of the playing court. Players attempting a block may reach 
                across the net, but shall not contact the ball until an opponent 
                strikes the ball in an attempt to send it back into the opponents 
                court.<br>
                It is considered a fault and play is dead if a player contacts 
                an opposing player across the line.<br>

                <strong><font color="#007B4A">Playing the bal</font></strong>l 
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Any player that makes contact with the ball shall be considered 
                as having played the ball.<br>
                2. Players participating in a block may participate in the next 
                play; this second contact shall count as the first of three hits 
                allowed a team. <br>
                3. Any body part from the waist up can hit the ball as long as 
                the ball rebounds quickly. <br>
                4. A different member of the same team shall make each contact 
                with the ball, unless the ball has just come off a block at the 
                net. <br>
                5. Players CANNOT hold, scoop, lift, push or carry the ball. A 
                ball is good when hit cleanly from underneath with one or both 
                hands. Please note: no double overhand hits (slapping the ball 
                or carrying the ball).<br>
                6. If two players on the same team hit the ball simultaneously, 
                two contacts with the ball will be called and neither player may 
                contact the ball on the next play.<br>
                7. Climbing the wall to block is illegal.<br>
                A player can use an open hand to tip or direct the ball at the 
                net. &#8220;Dunking&quot; is considered carrying the ball and 
                is a fault.<br>
                9. A serve can only be returned directly over the net on the first 
                hit if it's an underhand bump.<br>
                Spiking is allowed. Spikes may hit only one side wall on the opponents 
                side of the court. A SPIKE will be defined as a one handed hit 
                with both feet leaving the floor upon impact. If a spike hits 
                any player on the other team, from the waist up, the ball is still 
                alive.<br>
                12. DIVISION A - overhand hits may hit three walls consecutively 
                provided the hit is not a SPIKE.<br>
