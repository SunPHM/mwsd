Clifford Mould spent a very pleasant evening at this establishment haunt</i></font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left">&nbsp;<font face="Arial">It's often the
little details that&nbsp; let you know, right from the start whether you're
going to have a good time or not at a restaurant. So when a good looking
selection of breads came out within moments of our being seated at Daphne's the
other night, I thought, good show!. But hell, this is an Italian restaurant, and
seconds later along came a saucer of vivid green virgin olive oil. Actually I
think it was extra virgin. Which made me think, is there really such a thing as
extra virgin? Surely, either one is or is not a virgin? Shouldn't it be the same
for oil? Maybe an extra virgin is merely one that's surplus to requirements.
Anyway, this oil didn't remain virgin for long: it was soon poked up the ooh la
la with the grissini - breadsticks, that bore all the hallmarks of being home
made, a world away from those perfectly regular but ghastly inedible things
wrapped in cellophane.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial">Daphne's was one of
several restaurants that were originally set up by the <i> bon viveur</i> Mogens
Tholstrup. In its early days it was a favourite of Princess Diana and had a
reputation for being a hang out for IT girls and Sloanes. Since having been
taken over by the group that owns the Ivy, the emphasis now is
more on the enjoyment of the food rather than just trying to get piccie'd in Hello
Magazine. The decor is in a simple rustic style, more Knightsbridge than
Chiantishire - terracotta and exposed brick, but with nicely dressed tables.&nbsp;</font>
 <img src="daphne1.jpg" alt="smoked tuna" align=right vspace=6 hspace=6 width="304" height="229"></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial">So back to the cooking:
the antipasti selection at Daphne's is good. These are simple dishes,
mainly&nbsp; centred around one or two good Italian staples: really good
Parmesan with rocket and a balsamic dressing, or the tricolore Caprese of
mozzarella, tomato and basil, or even just a plate of cured ham from Sardinia.
We shared the smoked tuna, <i>pictured right</i>, sliced finely like a carpaccio, with a simple salad
of fennel, equally wafer thin, enhanced by a delicately aromatic dressing. The
usual meatiness of the tuna seemed accentuated by the smoking such that if I had
tasted it blind I might not have known it was fish. It was both intriguing and
delicious.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial">Next we had risotto and
gnocchi, separately of course! The risotto was of text book quality - creamy,
with the rice still a tiny bit crunchy, and the flavour of wild mushroom gently
pervading. Gnocchi can be rather bland, but that's when the sauce they're in is
lacking definition. In this case, the gratinated Gorgonzola béchamel was so
intensely flavoured that you realised what a perfect carrier these soft little
potato dumplings can be.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial">
<img src="daphne2.jpg" alt="dressed crab" align=left vspace=6 hspace=6 width="318" height="241">There is a good selection
of meat and fish dishes, from the traditional <i>polpette brasate</i>, braised
meatballs in a tomato ragu, or rack of lamb with butternut squash to
char-grilled rib of Glen Fynne beef with roasted Italian onions. Fish eaters can
choose from bream, tuna, tiger prawns, sea bass or sole. I had the grilled squid
which for once really tasted of both fish and of chargrilling,. It came
partnered with a cured ham of pressed pork shoulder, kicked up yet another notch
by a tangy salsa. Then there was roast rabbit, a more than generous portion, the
meat wrapped in pancetta and stuffed with a herb</font><font face="Arial">
farci. The meat was tender and not dry, which can be the problem with rabbit -
I'd give it a bunny rating of nine out of ten. As I said, the portions are
already generous, but don't miss out on at least one of the contorni (vegetable
accompaniments). Roasted pumpkin with amaretti is especially good. <i>Pictured
left: dressed crab with grilled pagnotta.</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial">Some of the puds are a
little predictable - the usual crème brulée variant, the mandatory Tiramisu, but
I expect they're the most popular desserts on the menu!&nbsp; Pears poached in
Barolo retained some pleasing texture and the <i>vaniglia</i> ice cream and pistachio
biscotti were both good. The amaretti cheesecake was light and could
have been stronger on the almond flavour, but the accompanying glazed figs were
super. Next time I'll try the iced berries and hot white chocolate sauce, sounds
terrific, how the hell did I miss it?</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left"><font face="Arial">The wine list is smallish
but hits just the right note, with a nice balance between Italy and the &quot;rest of the
world&quot;. House wines start at an affordable £13.00, but in the case of the
Italian reds, there's a hefty hike to the next one up, a Cabernet from Friuli at
£22.50. Service was efficient and charming.</font></p>
