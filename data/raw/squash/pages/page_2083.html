<H2 CLASS="medium"> A Winter Warning<br>
<span class="byline">by Karla Jans</span></H2>
<p>Very soon, catalogs are going to start arriving in your mailbox &#x2013; beautiful illustrated catalogs with every seed imaginable there for the ordering. After a long winter of garden deprivation, the gardener latches onto the catalogs with an intense hunger. Out come the graphs and yard diagrams. Plotting out next yearís garden and making out seed orders becomes the primary focus of the day. At last all is readied and the orders are placed. The gardener now waits impatiently for the seeds to begin arriving. Remember the old adage about the eyes being bigger than the stomach? I think the same holds true for garden plans and reality.</p>


<p>It was easy to fall into the above trap. I plotted and schemed how to best use every inch of space in the garden. I figured out which seeds to start and when to start them. The year before, in a fit of unbridled enthusiasm, I started 24 tomato seeds in January. In May, I bought my plants from the nursery, my starts having long ago reached 24 inches in height with only two leaves and toppling over. I was not going to make that mistake again. I read the seed packets, checked the calendar and planted everything so it could go into the garden in the middle of May. I started 12 tomatoes, 4 acorn squash, 3 cucumbers and 6 zucchini. Everything came up and all went according to plan. At the proper time, I put all my starts into the garden.</p> 
<img src="../images/zucchini/transplant.jpg" alt="Photo of zucchini just transplanted" width="270" height="144" hspace="10" vspace="3" align="right">
<p>This was my first year for zucchini. I had visions of stewed zucchini, zucchini casserole, baked zucchini, zucchini bread and cookies. When I transplanted the zucchini into the garden plot, the starts were so small they looked lost. I had high hopes for my zucchini.<br clear="all"></p> 
<img src="../images/zucchini/zucchini1.jpg" alt="Photo of young zucchini plant" width="252" height="193" hspace="10" vspace="3" align="left">
<p>I watered them faithfully and they rewarded me with growth.<br clear="all"></p>

<img src="../images/zucchini/crop1.jpg" alt="Photo of first zucchini crop" width="189" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="3" align="right">
<p>When the first blossoms bloomed and turned into zucchini I was thrilled. I was successful. The zucchini were fruiting. It was so exciting and impressive.</p> 

<p>By the end of July the above picture was a typical harvest every few days. This batch of zucchini, cooked and shredded yielded to 14 bags of shredded zucchini (1 ‡ cups in each bag) and 8 quarts of stewed zucchini in the freezer. More zucchini are on the vines. My neighbors no longer answer the bell when I ring. My friends hang up when I call. To my great relief, the zucchini vines became stressed and I grabbed the opportunity to rip them out. The harvest was at a welcome end before summer really started. </p> 


<p>I relate this tale to warn others not to repeat my folly. Plant only one zucchini. In case you donít heed the warning, hereís some zucchini recipes. Youíre going to need them.</p> 


<H3>Baked Zucchini</H3>

<p>Wash and slice zucchini thinly. Cover the bottom of a casserole with layers of zucchini, then add alternate layers of sliced tomatoes, onions, and American cheese (other cheeses may be substituted).
