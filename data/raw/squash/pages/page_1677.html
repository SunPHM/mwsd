south to Christchurch to settle-in for 7 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; We needed to rush;
we'd been warned: everything comes to a standstill between
Christmas and New Years, and the week before, and the weeks after.&nbsp; It's
summer vacation, and like August in Europe, everyone disappears.&nbsp; The
rushing took us 5 driving days from Auckland (about 200 miles a day) and included a 2-hour
ferry crossing from the North to the&nbsp; South Island.&nbsp;
(Did you know there were two?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#003399"><a href="../Ximages/New%20Zealand%20Photos/NZ_rocky%20coast.JPG"><img border="1" src="../Ximages/New%20Zealand%20Photos/rocky_coast_small.JPG" alt="rocky coast.JPG (147181 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="133"></a> We
luckily found a 2 bedroom, 2 bath furnished apartment in Christchurch City, just 4 blocks
from the town Center.&nbsp; It’s simply furnished, comes with dishwasher, microwave, washer and
drier, and&nbsp; costs US$ 180 a week.&nbsp; The gym, which
we've joined, is down the block; the squash courts are 3 blocks away -- I may
try my hand at this once-favorite game of mine; <a href="../Ximages/New%20Zealand%20Photos/NZ_falls.jpg"><img border="1" src="../Ximages/New%20Zealand%20Photos/NZ_falls_small.jpg" alt="NZ_falls.jpg (195851 bytes)" width="132" height="168" align="left"></a> and we've become &quot;summer
members&quot; at one of the local golf courses, the McLeans Island Golf
Club.&nbsp; Cost?&nbsp; US$ 30 each to join for 10 weeks for unlimited
golf at a nice, but not fancy, 18-hole course.</font></p>

summer!&nbsp;
The days are long, the sun rises at 5:00 and sets well after 9:00.&nbsp; It was
a bit rainy on the North Island, but we usually got a nice half-day, so
enjoyed some of the beautiful scenery while driving south, such as these<a href="../Ximages/New%20Zealand%20Photos/NZ_spring%20flowers.jpg"><img border="1" src="../Ximages/New%20Zealand%20Photos/spring_flowers_small.jpg" alt="spring flowers.jpg (310248 bytes)" align="right" width="100" height="72"></a>
photos.&nbsp; Of course there were plenty of
sheep. (There are about 10 for every Kiwi.)&nbsp; But there were also cows and deer on the
hillsides and seals in the ocean.&nbsp; (Check closely in the view at top
right.)&nbsp; Christchurch is drier than the North Island was, with daytime temps ranging from 70 to 90.&nbsp; This is wine growing country,
and some of it looks quite a bit like northern California.&nbsp; There are just
lots fewer people here.</font></p>
