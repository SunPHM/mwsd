<h2>Upper Ottawa Valley Superleague</h2>
<P>

Leo Buckley's Deep River team captured 1st place during the regular
season portion of the 2003-2004 Upper Ottawa Valley Curling Superleague
and were awarded the Stokes memorial trophy. This is the third year the
trophy has been awarded by the league, which has been in existence for
over 20 years. The trophy was donated in memory of a great curler and
friend, Gord Stokes from Cobden. Gord had the unfortunate distinction of
having won the round robin portion of the league 5 or 6 times but never
was able to capture the League Championship trophy awarded to the winner
of the league playoffs - this has made the trophy very appropriate and
coveted by league curlers.

Buckley's team of Chris Knight (third), Martin Chisholm (2nd), Bob
Burton (Lead) and Ron Grozelle (Alternate), have now moved into the
playoffs which sees the top 4 team playdown for Championship Trophy. In
the semi-finals Buckley's team defeated their home club rival team
skipped by Chris Moore of Deep River with Malcolm James Third, Joe
Kasaboskie, Jeff Olfert and alternate Don Taylor. Moore's team finished
the regular season in fourth place and were on a roll having comeback
from an 0-5 first half to post a 5 and 5 season record. In the other
semi-final two Pembroke teams skipped by Emile Robert and Dave Trautrim
met and Robert will now move on to the final against Buckley on
Wednesday, February 25 in Pembroke. On the same night Moore's rink will
square-off against Trautrim in the Bronze medal game. Gametime is 8:30
at the Pembroke Curling Club.
