They also breed rainbow trout and the plain kind. <BR> <BR>The Cass RR has a web site, I&#39;m sure you can find it with a search. If I remember correctly our 3 mile trip up the mountain and back for 1 1/2 hours &#40;with a rest stop&#41; used about 2 tons of coal.  That would be enough to heat our house for the winter. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been out taking pictures of my few June blooms.  I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll get a web page made - probably when it rains enough to keep me inside long enough to catch up on all my projects. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/messages/67/520.jpg" ALT="feverfew"> <BR>I know Maggie likes feverfew.  It always comes back here.  Now can anyone explain how it came up in the new bed this summer.  There were no plants in bloom to reseed in it when I dug the new bed.  The compost came from way out in the barnyard.  Like I said, it always comes back! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/messages/67/521.jpg" ALT="gazing globe"> <BR>I really wanted a gazing globe, but didn&#39;t want to go with the usual round ones on a cement pedastal.  Here&#39;s what I came up with. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/messages/67/522.jpg" ALT="fawns"> <BR>2 mamas brought these 2 fawns in to visit me when I was working on the sheep pen.  The 2nd mama is just out of range of the camera. <BR> <BR>The mamas and babies were not at all bothered by me taking pictures.  They were just calmly walking down the drive to go back to the river.  Unfortunately, 1 mama decided to go by way of jumping the fence and her fawn panicked.  It tried to cross our bridge, which has the boards spaced like a cattle crossing.  It stumbled and fell, and as much as I wanted to go help it, I knew that would only make matters worse.  He finally made it to the end, and decided to jump down to mama.  That&#39;s quite a leap - I just knew he would break something.  Mama deer bleeted and blew for the babe for what seemed like forever.  Then I saw mama go across the field with the other mama and fawn, but no fawn at her side.  I went to investigate, with my heart in my throat.  I found baby safe and sound, but shivering at the riverside.  I got within 4 feet, before it moved on into the brush.  Since he was sound with no broken legs, I decided it would be best to let his mama come back and find him. I&#39;ve been watching for him but so far she&#39;s keeping him hidden.<!--/text--><p>

Just look at the framing on that deer shot. The path, fence, trees, the deers positioning - a work of art. And yes Terry, I sure would love to have those lickle guys in my garden !!! And the feverfew. I failed with it this year MK. Maddening isn&#39;t it, that one woman&#39;s self-sower is another&#39;s challenge! I&#39;ve seen it self-sow in paving cracks in cooler climates than Texas. Maybe I would have better luck getting it going in fall than spring, down here. I adore your blue glass hummer feeder Mk. Everytime I&#39;ve tried ornamental ones, the stoppers leaked constantly - which the ants highly appreciated. Hope yours fares better than my pretty ones, that are just hanging on a peg in the garage in hopes of me finding a better stopper system one day. <!--/text--><p>

It has fooled others too. <BR> <BR>I do have hummer feeders out, the other night we count 8 at the feeder.  But I think the average count must be higher with all the sugar water they are going through.   <BR> <BR>The smaller feeder does collect a few ants.  The other day I watched a lone ant start at the bottom of the pole and head upwards. He stopped at each ant coming down the pole as if to ask if he was on the right road, and was the long trek worth the effort <IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">  You can see, I like all kinds of nature.

That never happens here. One dominates each feeder by chasing off any others that come to it. Also, yours arrive earlier than ours. For the last few years, our flock arrives around July 1st, staying until Oct. Except for the scout or two we see in spring. <BR> <BR>I know just what you mean about that ant asking directions - must have been a female, huh? ;-&#41;  <BR> <BR>Boric acid under the sink &#40;or wherever they are coming in at&#41; might take of the earwigs.

Hope everyone had good holiday over the long wkend.  <BR>We mostly have green irridesent ones know as the &#34;Black Chinned&#34; hummer. The Ruby Throated ones are more prevalent in the eastern half of Texas. We occassionally spot one or two on their way to East Texas, but they do not take up summer residence to nest here, as the blk chnd ones do. So you can imagine how exciting it is to catch a ruby one in the garden!  <BR> <BR>Our summer flock usually arrives in the 1st week of July lately, and we just saw the first one of the year today! It was unusually cool and rainy in late June, which may have delayed this years arrival. Our rainy spell had been glorius until the heat came back and now we are suffering jungle level humidity. Shouldn&#39;t complain,, just a few hours south of here, San Antonio area has been having deadly floods with dams threatening to break. Terrible tragic news reports - homes and lives lost. <BR> <BR>I love hearing about your deers MK. You&#39;ll have Cutie Pie &#39;eating out of your hand&#39; in no time! The closest I&#39;ve come to that wonderful experience this year, is this baby mouse that I wretched from the clutches of our cats. They were playing with it. It was still alive, but in shock. I nurtured it for a few days. Okay, I couldn&#39;t stand to part with it for 2 wks. After I released it, it went right back to playing with the cats and still pops up in the borders when I&#39;m gardening,,, says hi, scatches its ear and trots off again. Is probably hoping I&#39;ll bring him regular meals again. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/messages/67/527.jpg" ALT="maggies mouse"><!--/text--><p>

Then after that it seems that they find enough elsewhere to eat - unless they get a hunger for sunflowers and garden veggies.  I save a few veggies for our table by covering them with row covers at night time. The fence you see is a cold line of electric fence wire - just to give my 3 big dogs a boundry to respect. Or at least that&#39;s the idea.  If they see something interesting run through the garden they forget the boundries.  But at least with the wire I can yell at them when they cross the borders without feeling guilty. <BR> <BR>I have an almost red daylily that seems to have morphed into an orange stripe this year ???

But I don’t think the directions are very clear. Gee Terry, you could’ve posted them for her <IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> In fact, I wish you had of – it is so much easier to do that to write it , isn’t it? ! Course you probably had to run out and get that passport renewed ;-&#41;   <BR> <BR>Let’s see if I can pull this off. Post as usual, with the following code in the space you want the pic to appear. <BR>I can’t actually write it out here, or the program tries to post a pic, but … <BR>Type… \image &#40;immediately followed by&#41; {title of pic in curly brackets} <BR>Then hit ’Post’, then click the ‘Browse’ button to open up your files,  <BR>click on your pic, your file name will appear in the box,  <BR>then click ‘Post’ again and it should load your message with the pic in it. We are really looking forward to having you join us Patricia! <!--/text--><p>

I told you I was sending my mom&#39;s &#34;Redskin&#34; daylilies.  But what you received may be something completely different. Or will daylilies revert back to original strains as they multiply over the years?  I have the nice &#34;Redskin&#34; lilies still, but now they seem to be mixed in with these orange striped ones. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve planted flowers that have become weeds before - hope the blue grass doesn&#39;t do that.  It&#39;s easy to get a mature garden the first year - I dug the 1/2 grown yarrow and lilies up from the established beds and moved them <IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Patricia, we&#39;re all anxious to see your gardens. Never too many flowers in the world. <!--/text--><p>

Or it may have come in with the soil of the Redskins or another plant you brought in. Day lilies are the hardest plants for me to keep labeled correctly, no matter how hard I try to keep them straight, and then surprizes like yours still manages to happen here too! <!--/text--><p>

So I went out and cut one to determine if it was squash or melon.  No wonder it&#39;s producing like crazy - it&#39;s a squash!  Could it be the white marrow?  The flesh is white and has a mild slightly sweet flavor when eaten raw.  I thought the white marrow was going to have a white outer skin, and be slightly pear shaped.  And I didn&#39;t expect it to come on a vine that is ready to take over my house <IMG SRC="http://www.maggiesgarden.com/discus/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;">  And dummy that I am - waiting for my would be melons to ripen, I missed all the wonderful young squash.  I&#39;m going to cut the large ones off and wait for more young ones!  Anyone want to tell me the best size?<!--/text--><p>

It looks an awfully lot like ours. So I guess our mixture went over well. <BR> <BR>You should see the does chase the buck away from the grain.  The deer can get quite fiesty at feed time, striking out at one another and even rearing up on their back legs to flail at each other with both front feet.
