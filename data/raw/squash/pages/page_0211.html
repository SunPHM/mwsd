<h1>C-3PO's Vegetable Vacation Photos</h1>

Since Lucasfilm Ltd. refused to let C-3PO put these up on his <a 
href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/droid/c3po/index.html">official 
site</a>, I agreed to put them up on my site.<p>

C-3PO went on a vacation to the planet of the giant vegetables. Yes, there 
really is a planet of giant vegetables. There is a planet that is all ice. 
There is a planet that is all desert. There is a planet that is all swamp. 
So there is a planet that is all giant vegetables.<p>

C-3PO's first stop was at the green peppers. He wanted to show off that 
he could climb them, but he got himself stuck, as you can see in the 
picture below. He did not want to go forwards or backwards for fear of 
falling. Moments after this picture was taken, he got distracted trying 
to converse with one of the native giant aphids, and fell anyway.<p>

C-3PO signed up for a big-game hunt. Unfortunately, he didn't catch 
anything. Here he is posing next to two giant eggplants that the guide 
caught.<p>

Moments after this picture was taken, C-3PO was arrested for lewd conduct 
with vegetables. The next three days of his vacation were taken up bribing 
various officials to drop the charges.<p>

The lettuce forests of the giant vegetable planet are difficult to pass 
through, being very dense. Luckily, C-3PO is even more dense, so it was no 
problem for him<p>

Local legend tells of the Great Onion that will rise up out of the onion 
patch on All Onions' Eve. None of the locals really believe it, but C-3PO 
waited in this onion patch for an entire day. Needless to say, the Great 
Onion did not appear.<p>

Here is C-3PO "riding the squash". The less said about this the better.<p>

Here we see C-3PO with just a few of the many varieties of giant tomatoes 
that grow on the giant vegetable planet. One of the ranch hands started 
talking about <i>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</i>, and C-3PO got out of 
there quickly.

Tired from a full day of bungee jumping, C-3PO rests among the autumn 
poem, a leafy plant from the eastern part of the giant vegetable 
planet.<p>

C-3PO was really wiped out the last couple of days of his trip. He mostly 
just switched his napping position to different vegetable patches. Here he 
is with the carrots.<p>

And here's C-3PO napping on the very last day in the shade of this giant 
zucchini. It was a fun vacation, but he can't wait to get home.<p>
