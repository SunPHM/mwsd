<H2>BY <A HREF="/contributors/jill_borra/">JILL BORRA</A></H2>

<P>Walking along Queen Street near Bathurst, I'm trying to concentrate on
dodging rivers of brown slush while bracing myself against below-zero winds,
when a homeless man in rasta-colored shorts dogs me, asking for a handout.
&quot;Spare some change?&quot; he asks. &quot;For a bowl of soup?&quot;</P>

<P>He's not the only one with soup on his mind. With the thermometer plummeting
to obscene temperatures and the snow piling up faster than Mayor Mel can
get his foot out of his mouth, this is the time of year when the steamy
comfort of a bracing bowl of homemade soup is most alluring.</P>

<P>The Vienna Home Bakery looks like it should be in a small town on the
way up to cottage country rather than a stone's throw from the ill-favored
corner of Queen and Bathurst. This simple, cozy lunch counter is all pale
pink walls and the smell of fresh bread baking. Vegan soups are homemade
every day, and the bread (it <I>is</I> a bakery) is fresh from the oven.</P>

<P>I happen to stop by when the soup du jour is black bean: simple, maybe,
but it's thick and flavorful, with just the right amount of seasoning and
a touch of fresh cilantro to dress it up. It's the stuff of comforting home-kitchen
cooking. Some of their other soup specialties are minestrone, curried lentil,
green and yellow split pea, and a grand calabasa, with butternut squash,
red peppers, Savoy cabbage, onions, garlic, carrots, tomatoes, green beans,
cumin and cinnamon. Soup and bread costs $3.95, while soup and a sandwich
is $6.50.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="photos/foodanddrink-food.jpg" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN=
"RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">For a more gourmet experience, Tiger Lily's
Noodle House, near CITY-TV, has an ambrosial spread of Thai and Chinese
soup choices. The interior is simple, almost pristine, with deep orange
walls overlaid with paler orange wooden carved palm tree silhouettes. Tiny
potted flowers sit on every table.</P>

<P>With mix-and-match soup bowls ($5.95), you can combine either vegetable
or meat homemade broth with a choice of six types of noodles, and garnish
it with barbecued pork, Shanghai chicken, vegetables, black bean beef or
fish. In the wonton soup bowls ($6.95), chicken or shrimp and pork wontons
stand in for the noodles. The soup, enough for a meal, arrives in something
more like a serving dish than a soup bowl. The vegetarian special is dense
with carrots, tofu, bean sprouts, bok choy, soy beans and coriander, and
soon I have to put down my spoon and pick up my chopsticks to dig in. The
stock is fresh and not too salty, with the soy beans giving it a hint of
sweetness. The Asian mushroom soup, flavored with green onions and a subtle
bit of heat, is savory with coconut milk and plenty of fresh shiitake, straw
and portobello mushrooms.</P>

<P>It's rich, but the small serving is just the right amount. The waitresses
are energetic and friendly, if hyper-efficient. The food comes with lightning
speed, and before I've had time to sit back and exhale a contented sigh
after my last spoonful, the dishes are whisked away. Tiger Lily's also serves
Hawaiian-style duck soup and Thai lemon grass soup served with chicken,
shrimp, calamari and rice noodles.</P>

<P>C'est What, at the corner of Church and Front, has been a dependable
area watering hole for 11 years. An abundance of suits suggests an after-work
crowd from the nearby monolithic office towers.</P>

<P>The soup changes daily and is served with a whole-grain baguette. The
ginger acorn squash soup ($4.25) is delicious -- thick, smooth and comforting.
Other specialties are borscht, broccoli and cheddar, potato and leek, and
Thai soup. After 9:30 bands play in the adjoining bar, so expect a lot of
noise late at night.</P>

<P>Swan Restaurant, at Queen and Strachan, attracts the local arty crowd
with a taste for fine food and has an exquisite roster of soup delicacies
served with Portuguese bread for $4. Some favorites are their spinach fennel
pur&eacute;e, mushroom barley, harvest vegetable, lemon grass coconut soup
and hearty root vegetable soups.</P>

<P>As you hunker down through the next few bitter months of winter, remember,
soup's not just a starter. Soup is good food.</P>
