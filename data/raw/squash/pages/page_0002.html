<b>The Story:</b><br> Things really took off in July.  The big growers were lettuce, onions, broccoli, and cauliflower.  We ate salad every night and, truth be told, we were ready for some other veggies to ripen.  Thankfully, the other plants started to bear fruit midway through the month.  Neither one of us really knew how broccoli or cauliflower looked like before it gets unpacked at the grocery store (the edible flower, located at the tip of the stock, is gradually revealed by the large leaves as it ripens).  Although both were good, broccoli and cauliflower take up a lot of valuable space with their collard-green-like leaves so we decided to forgo those two veggies next year.
