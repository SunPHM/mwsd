<p align="center"><b>Opal Glover and Shirley Rumble - “The Sisters”</b></p>

<p>When I arranged to meet the “sisters”, as they are called, little did I know I would be in for a treat. Not only was meeting them a special event, but also meeting their GardenAngel family, the Barshinger’s. The relationship between the sisters and the Barshinger family is everything that the CASA GardenAngel program stands for.</p>

<p>As I drove up to the sisters’ house late one afternoon, the Barshinger's had joined the sisters on lawn chairs under a shade tree. It is easy to call these two ladies “the sisters”, as though they were one entity, but they not only have distinctly different personalities, they complement each other as well. Shirley is the taller and quieter of the two. On this warm August afternoon, she is dressed in a long skirt and sleeveless blouse, although she claims she usually is dressed in long pants and a long sleeve shirt.  On the other hand, Opal is a live wire, and a self-described “minimalist”. Opal is tan and fit, dressed in shorts and a cotton knit shirt. “I’m probably the only great grandmother around who wears a tube top,” she laughs. Her eyes sparkle with liveliness as she banters with the Barshinger family and her sister.<p> 

<p>Observing the interaction between the sisters and their GardenAngel family led me to believe that they had all known each other for quite a while. But this is not so. The Barshinger’s, who recently moved to Huntsville, are very interested in gardening and volunteerism. One day last spring, Lana Barshinger was volunteering at the CASA Community Garden and became interested in the GardenAngel program. After CASA hooked her up with the sisters, she came out to their house to make an initial visit. She and the sisters immediately hit it off. Shortly afterwards, Lana brought her husband Keith and daughter Erin who is in the second grade. The rest is history. Both parties hugely enjoy visiting with each other, and have gone on several outings together. “We lure them with goodies,” Opal jokes, even though Lana and Keith fondly say that is not necessary.</p>

<p>The home in which the sisters reside once belonged to their parents. Their father was transferred to Huntsville during the 1950’s to work with the blossoming defense industry and told the sisters if they moved down to Huntsville, he would put them through business school. They were born in the Detroit, Michigan area, but at the time lived in the upper peninsula of Michigan. They moved to the Huntsville area between 1958 and 1960. Between them, they have six children, twenty grandchildren and one great grandchild.</p><img src="/img_03/casa_visits_01.jpg" border="1" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="statuary">  
 

<p>While sipping cool drinks, we settled into easy conversation, while Erin turned cartwheels in the side yard and collected flowers for a pretty arrangement. Since both Lana’s and Keith’s families live out of state, it seems that they have adopted the sisters as their very own extended family. The feeling was mutual. Lana and Keith asked about Opal’s trip to Orange Beach the previous weekend. Opal described that she attended the wedding of Shirley’s oldest grandson. Shirley was unfortunately unable to make the trip. Opal described how it started raining during the ceremony, which was held on the beach but that it didn’t really bother her as much as it did the other guests.</p> 

<p>Shirley later showed me pictures of one of the outings she and her sister and the Barshinger’s went on at the Concerts in the Park earlier in the summer. The picture showed them sitting at a picnic table laden with food. Lana explained she forgot the silverware so they had to eat with their hands. “It was a good bonding experience”, Opal laughed. Shirley also showed me pictures that the Barshinger’s had given them of Erin, who had been in a school play production.</p>
<p>After a time, we got up to walk around the yard, which is large and spacious with thick green grass in the front yard. Opal cuts the yard herself with a self-propelled lawn mower (no doubt wearing a tube top).</p>

<p>Opal and Shirley love the small GardenAngel vegetable garden in their backyard, which includes a little plaster angel that the Barshinger’s brought over one day. The garden is planted with tomatoes, beans and zucchini, some of which has unfortunately been stolen. “It just kills me to buy zucchini,” Opal comments, but Lana offers to buy her some next time she is at the farmer’s market. They didn’t plant any okra or squash in the garden. “We get more mileage out of zucchini,” they explained. The front of the garden is planted with marigolds and other flowers.</p>
<img src="/img_03/casa_visits_02.jpg" border="1" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="The Garden">  
<p>One interesting item in the garden is a red painted light bulb that hangs down from one of the tomato cages. The sisters explain that the birds try to peck the light bulb thinking it’s a tomato and become discouraged and don’t bother the real fruit. This seems to have worked very well!</p>

<p>The rest of the yard contains cannas, hydrangeas, a wild poinsettia, crocuses and rosebushes that were all there while their parents were still alive. Shirley explained to me, “When I moved back into the house from Hazel Green, we thought that all the rosebushes were gone, but one a year came back since I moved back.” We also gathered around a large dill plant and picked off the seeds and ate them, while Opal gave Keith a lesson in canning pickles. Lana immediately offered to get cucumbers in addition to the zucchini at the farmers market.  Keith, very interested in gardening, is taking the Master Gardener course this fall. Lana said she is trying to talk Opal into taking the class in the winter.</p>

<p>Before I know it, two hours have passed since I first met all these special people and it is time to go. In the growing twilight, Erin does cartwheels in the plush front yard and plays games with her dad as we stand around for a final chat. The sisters present me with a jar of homemade strawberry preserves with zucchini (which was delicious).  Lana promises to come back the next weekend and take Opal with her and Erin to the Animal Planet Expo. The Barshinger’s also promise to bring over a used computer to Opal and Shirley, so they can get online.</p>

<p>It is clear that the sisters and the Barshinger family indeed share a special and caring bond. There is genuine camaraderie between all of them. This is everything that a GardenAngel relationship should be!</p>
