              If you don't like what I have written (or I have got some detail

            <p><a href="denizens/dave.JPG">Dave Holness</a><br>
              AKA - The Godfather. Warden's Flat.<br>
              Warden (keeps the peace)<br>
              For those who don't know a warden in this case is not like a warden 
              in a prison, but an older person, usually an employee of Rhodes, 
              who lives in or close to the residence and whose responsibility 
              it is to keep the students on the straight and narrow. Dave lectures 
              in the Law Faculty and plays golf and also coaches the Table Tennis 
              club. <br>

            <p><a href="denizens/mop.JPG">Simon Barker</a><br>
              AKA - Mop, Chewbarker. Room 3.<br>
              A &quot;local boy&quot; (i.e. he hails from Grahamstown) in his 
              first year at Rhodes, Simon earned the moniker Mop for not cutting 
              his hair for 6 months, after which he resembled a ..., he earned 
              the nickname Chewbarker for howling like a wookie every time he 
              passes into the fluffy clouds of inebriation.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/rob.JPG">Rob Boffard</a><br>
              AKA - Spunky young intern. Room 5.<br>
              During the June vac of 2003 Rob worked for The Star and in a &quot;brilliant 
              piece of investigative journalism&quot; uncovered evidence of plagiarism 
              by a well known author. He was later described by a columnist in 
              the Mail and Gaurdian as a &quot;spunky young intern&quot;. QED.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/gimp.JPG">Mark Bowen</a><br>
              AKA - Gimp. Room 24.<br>
              A long time resident of Livingstone (this is his third year), Mark 
              has been endowed with the name Gimp by his friends for, well, if 
              you can't figure it out on your own I certainly won't tell you.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/poppet.JPG">Chris Bredin</a><br>
              AKA - Breedy, Pocket, Goose, Cave Pig, Cartman. Room 20.<br>
              House Comm - Secretary<br>
              A third year Comp Sci / IS student, Chris is well known for his 
              carefree irreverence for the finer things in this world, like feelings, 
              emotions and human life.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/richardcb.JPG">Richard Carter-Brown</a><br>
              AKA - Christopher Columbus. Room 7.<br>
              No one is sure why he does it, but Richard has refused to wear long 
              trousers all year. In the dead of winter he can be seen, blue from 
              the waist down, marching grimly down the road to lectures. He earned 
              the Christopher Columbus award at the awards evening for taking 
              the long way home to res one night. His trip was about 5 to 10 kms 
              long and involved a detour to the location, while the optimum route 
              back is about 1 km long.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/richardchan.JPG">Richard Chan</a><br>
              AKA - Jackie Chan. Room 6.<br>
              A frustrated Idols contestant, Richard was given the Celine Dion 
              award for singing better than the original. One of the few to use 
              the piano for its intended purpose his eloquent tinkling insinuates 
              the corridors on many a day.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/gavin.JPG">Gavin Chetty</a><br>
              AKA - Glowworm. Room 4.<br>
              A man of few words, Gavin has one of the funniest &quot;Where am 
              I?&quot; notices on his door in all the varsity. His door is also 
              bedecked with the limerick:<br>
              I wish I was a glowworm<br>
              For a glowworm's never glum<br>
              For how can you be glum<br>
              When the sun shines out your bum?</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/cornish.JPG">Sam Cornish</a><br>
              AKA - Corndog, Samwise. Room 1.<br>
              House Comm - Treasurer<br>
              Currently living in Nigeria Sam is an avid rower and sportsman in 
              general. He matriculated from Saint Andrews College here in Grahamstown, 
              but he has been forgiven for this and we have all moved on from 
              that unpleasant period in res life. By the by, take all you read 
              on this page with a grain of salt, it is more an exercise in creative 
              writing than a factual account.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/jl.JPG">Jean-Luc Germiquet</a><br>
              AKA - JL. Room 2.<br>
              JL spent a couple years in England with his nose to the grindstone 
              before deciding he had had enough and his consequent enrollment 
              and incarceration at Rhodes. JL, Mop and Sam are all Saint Andrews 
              College alumni and stay in adjacent rooms. It is not known whether 
              this was intentional, but the effect is the same.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/malizole.JPG">Malizole Gobe</a><br>
              AKA - Show me the money. Room 28.<br>
              In his second year in Livingstone, his third at Rhodes, Malizole 
              keeps his neighbors pious with Gospel music on a Sunday. Unfortunately, 
              since his neighbors prefer to sleep till noon on a Sunday, the opposite 
              effect is usually achieved. &quot;Mali&quot; in Xhosa is money, 
              hence the moniker. I must confess to making it up on the spur of 
              the moment, for Malizole claims to be without a nickname.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/dan.jpg">Daniel Hall</a><br>
              AKA - Veldskoen, Farmer, The Synergy. Room 25.<br>
              Daniel lives in the Northern Cape, for which he is given constant 
              grief. Despite the fact that he is not Afrikaans he has been awarded 
              the title Velkskoen and is the first person consulted when the Afrikaans 
              version of a word is wanted. He is probably not a fan of stereotypes.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/bob.jpg">Ryan Hancocks</a><br>
              AKA - Bob. Room 26.<br>
              House Comm - Food Rep<br>
              Ryan earned the nickname Bob on the first day of O-Week in his first 
              year. When asked to stand up and say where he was from, what he 
              was studying, what he would like to be called, he said something 
              like &quot;My name is Ryan, from Port Elizabeth ... and you can 
              call me anything you want, you can even call me Bob.&quot; He was 
              immediately christened Bob and has remained so.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/minim.JPG">Mark Jackson-Moss</a><br>
              AKA - M'n'M, Minim. Room 18.<br>
              Sub-warden<br>
              Senior Student in 2002, Minim can always be relied upon for an inspired 
              saying in a pinch. Example, &quot;The redness of an apple is not 
              in its colour, but in its taste.&quot; He is also the author of 
              the Livingstone Bible, a copy of which will be linked to as soon 
              as it can be transcribed. It is an invalueble introduction to University 
              life for first years. *cough*, *cough*.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/oliver.JPG">Oliver King</a><br>
              AKA - Oli, Pravda. Room 16.<br>
              House Comm - Entertainment rep and resnet rep<br>
              The author of this site, Oliver is afraid that if he mentions anything 
              incriminating the men in black suits and dark glasses will stop 
              following and start chasing. So I won't.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/brendan.JPG">Brendan Lee</a><br>
              AKA - Tree. Former resident. Defected to Graham House.<br>
              Brendan brought, and occasionally brings, a distinct aura to the 
              res. A conversation with Brendan is always fraught with the danger 
              of breaking into incredulous head shaking sessions. He is the sort 
              of person who, when he discovers that he does not have a costume 
              for the res function, will break a few branches from a tree on his 
              way over and tape them to his body, becoming Tree and creating the 
              most original, if inexplicable, costume at the function. The theme 
              for the function was West Side Vs East Side. Go figure.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/mandi.JPG">Mandilakhe Lubisi</a><br>
              AKA - Mandi, Hazard. Room 11.<br>
              Mandi is another person who brings a special aura to the res. A 
              hazard when inebriated, he continually infuriates his long-suffering 
              neighbor with aurally extroverted behavior. There is much more that 
              can be said, I leave it to the galleries to say it.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/komborero.JPG">Komborero Makoni</a><br>
              AKA - Principal Fungus Technician. Room 13.<br>
              Komborero comes from Zimbabwe, plays Table Tennis and possibly some 
              other sports I don't know about, and is studying towards a BSc IS 
              degree. His nickname is a spur of the moment creation courtesy of 
              Minim. </p>
            <p><a href="denizens/mrmamba.JPG">S'Bongiseni Mamba</a><br>
              AKA - Mr Mamba. Room 12.<br>
              S'Bongiseni is Mandi's long suffering neighbor. S'Bongiseni comes 
              from Swaziland and adds to the international favor of the res. S'Bongiseni 
              is a journalism student and is engaged in constant battle with Shawn 
              over the latter's occasional use of the ladies bathroom (situated 
              next to S'Bongiseni's room) in the odd emergency. It has not yet 
              resorted to bloodshed.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/tendayi.JPG">Tendayi Muyambi</a><br>
              AKA - Tindo. Room 22.<br>
              Sub-warden<br>
              Tendayi is another Zimbo. The Sports Rep last year he moved up to 
              the position of sub-warden this year. Tendayi is a keen basketball 
              player and not so keen IS student. Not that any IS student is very 
              keen, mind you.<br>
            </p>
            <p><a href="denizens/kutlo.jpg">Kutlo Motseta</a><br>
              AKA - Tsetse fly. Room 30.<br>
              Kutlo proved to be very elusive in my search for a photo of every 
              guy in Livingstone. Kutlo is a successful athlete. He matriculated 
              at Saint Andrews. I am losing inspiration. Writing these explanations 
              while attempting to remain creative is much more difficult than 
              you would think. </p>
            <p><a href="denizens/shawn.JPG">Shawn Miller</a><br>
              AKA - Yakuza, Bones. Room 10.<br>
              Another student who took a couple years off before coming to varisty, 
              Shawn is an avid fan of all things Japanese, be they calligraphy, 
              art or rice cakes. You can check out some of his contributions to 
              the webpage in the form of photos in the <a href="galleries.htm">image 
              gallery</a>. </p>
            <p><a href="denizens/siya.JPG">Siyabonga Mthembu</a><br>
              AKA - Siya, Whoopi. Room 9.<br>
              Siya is a drama student and participated in a play, I forget the 
              name, which ran to much public acclaim. Look at his hair in the 
              picture and see why he is referred to by some as Whoopi (as in Goldberg). 
              Siya is a Steve Biko Scholarship student.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/tom.JPG">Thomas Mukasa-Mugerwa</a><br>
              AKA - Big Tom, The Bookie. Annex 1.<br>
              House Comm - Sport rep<br>
              Awarded with the &quot;Black Shakespeare&quot; award at the res 
              function Tom continually amuses and delights the res with some of 
              the funniest sports commentary ever posted on the notice board. 
              He comes from Uganda and runs a low fee (order of 50c), nonprofit 
              betting service during world cups (be they soccer, rugby or cricket).</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/albert.JPG">Albert Ndebele</a><br>
              AKA - Holy Fish. Annex 2.<br>
              The oldest student in res Albert is Botswanan and has come back 
              to study politics, amongst other subjects. His nickname is a mystery 
              to me, and will remain so as long as the only answer I get to my 
              repeated enquiries as to its origin is &quot;That's my secret.&quot;</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/andile.JPG">Andile Ndlela</a><br>
              AKA - G-String, Gieza. Room 17.<br>
              Andile is pertinatious in his determination to really Enjoy (note 
              the capatalisation) his time here at varsity. Weekends swell alarmingly 
              in size, hours are spent blowing a plastic trumpet at sports matches, 
              a merry time is had in general. I think he studies as well. At the 
              house function he filled every silence with a cry of &quot;He's 
              spinning out of control!&quot;, in reference to Mandi. At the time 
              it had most in stitches. You had to be there to appreciate the humour.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/tinashe.JPG">Tinashe Ndoro</a><br>
              AKA - Most Improved Drinker. Room 8.<br>
              Tinashe is a quiet Zimbo with a fetish for cricket hats (the one's 
              with the wide brim). I can't recall ever seeing him without one. 
              His title (as mentioned above) is thanks to Tapiwa, though I cannot 
              vouch for its verisimilitude.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/ashes.JPG">Ashvin Ramsawhook</a><br>
              AKA - Ashes, Pooja, Hideout. Room 21.<br>
              Ashes is another long time resident of Livingstone House. He comes 
              from Zim and single handedly keeps Spar in business. Perhaps it 
              is a Zim thing, but I have only seen Ashvin's hair once, at all 
              other times it is artfully concealed under a beanie (in winter) 
              or peak cap (in summer). Perhaps someone can explain why this is?</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/adam.JPG">Adam Skikne</a><br>
              AKA - Underdog. Room 15.<br>
              Adam and his sister Cara founded and head an online web magazine 
              <a href="http://www.underdog.rucus.net">Underdog Press</a>. Check 
              it out for a taste of the creativity that Livingstone House holds.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/neels.JPG">Cornelius Strijdom</a><br>
              AKA - Neels, Sk8er Boy. Room 27.<br>
              Neels is an academic schitzophrenic. I am not sure how to classify 
              his degree, it was law, then had some science subjects thrown in, 
              and may even contain a BA subject or two. Neels brings the number 
              of Botswanan Livingstonians up to 2.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/mik.JPG">Miklos Szecsei</a><br>
              AKA - Mikit, Thanatos. Room 19.<br>
              House Comm - Head student<br>
              Some people hold the opinion that the rise of the modern feministic 
              movement in the 50's and 60's is directly related to the loss of 
              a large proportion of the male population in World War 1. As far 
              as I am aware Mik is not one of those people.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/baz.JPG">Tapiwa Taodzera</a><br>
              AKA - Taps, Baz. Room 23.<br>
              A corrigendum is a thing to be corrected. It is one of many words 
              that a great fraction of people never use. Rumour has it that Tapiwa 
              has never used it. In fact, rumour has it that it has never crossed 
              the lips of a Livingstone guy at any time. On another note, Tapiwa 
              comes from Zimbabwe, plays soccer and probably studies in his spare 
              time. <br>

            <p><a href="denizens/lincoln.jpg">Lincoln Wahl</a><br>
              AKA - Wheelie. Room 31.<br>
              Lincoln is a business science student who is of the firm opinion 
              (as are most Maths 1 students) that Math's occupation of the 6th 
              lecture slot (just before lunch) every day is as pleasant as a toad 
              moving in and opening up a Toad Spa beneath that jiggly thing at 
              the back of your mouth. He also plays tennis.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/ady.JPG">Adrian Williams</a><br>
              AKA - Ady, Maverick. Room 14<br>
              Ady has the unfortunate distinction (along with Mop) of being a 
              local boy. He has managed to overcome this bitter setback by a determined 
              effort to <a href="reslife/photos/IM000341.jpg">wipe</a> all trace 
              of it from his memory. Ady is a Geology / Chemistry student who 
              dabbles occasionally in the odd game of squash.</p>
            <p><a href="denizens/gareth.JPG">Gareth Woods</a><br>
              AKA - TheInfamousGW. Room 29.<br>
              Gareth comes from Port Elizabeth. He has managed to overcome his 
              education at Grey by making it into university, thus enabling to 
              drop all mention of the former from his CV ;). He is not a fan of 
              Botany, is an avid gamer and occasionally does strange follically 
              related stuff. See his picture.</p>
