<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The Hall is very fortunate to have a number of excellent facilities.
These facilities are well maintained and are available to all members of
the hall. Indeed, we find they are well used and very popular amongst the
students who live here.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><img border="0" src="squash1.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left" width="250" height="187">We are lucky enough to have our own
<a name="squash court"> squash court</a>,&nbsp; and during the
year a squash ladder and knockout cup are played between hall members.
We also use it for inter-hall competitions, in which we are always able
to field strong teams.&nbsp; Then there is the table-tennis table; one
table may not be anything to shout about, but on a wet Sunday afternoon
when you have an essay to write, it can be a godsend.</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><img border="0" src="snooker1.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="250" height="187">In contrast, the recently student-renovated <a name="snooker room"> snooker room</a> is a fine asset
to the Hall. It contains a full size table, with it's own rests and cues
(though many people have their own), and has a proper lighting rig above.&nbsp;
It is accessible at all times, and is well used. There is also an annual
snooker competition that draws a lot of entries.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The
<a name="gym"> gym</a> has also recently been student-renovated. It is now an up-to-date
modern facility with free weights, a punch bag, machines, other miscellaneous
items of kit, and most importantly its own stereo. The gym is open all
the time, and again is well used, whether for serious training or a more
relaxed exercise session away from the books.</font>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><img border="0" src="gym1.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="250" height="187">We are lucky in Slems to have the facilities that we do, and consequently
we try to look after them well: the two recent refurbishments bear testament
to that.&nbsp; The facilities are here for our students to take advantage
of, and large numbers of them do.
