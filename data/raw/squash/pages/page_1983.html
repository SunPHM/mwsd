As the cold winds of November bear down on us, and the first snows of the season start to fall, its time to move indoors and watch the dark clouds of winter gathering outside; while we enjoy the warmth of our home and a favorite meal.
<p align="justify">
November is a time for comfort food; and for those of us who appreciate the rich-creamy taste of hubbard squash, a repast of baked toupie ham, along with boiled potatoes and mashed squash may provide us with an opportunity to enjoy the fruits of out labour. The meal, without any extras, is fairly low in fat. a 100 gram serving of ham has only 100 calories and each cup of mashed potatoes, without anything added, comes with about 136 calories, while a cup of squash has only 70.

Hubbard squash contains a fair amount of iron and riboflavin; and because of its rather dry-dense texture, its yellowish-orange flesh is best boiled or baked, and then pureed or mashed. Besides being an excellent source of vitamin A, this type of squash is also a diverse food. Its distinctive flavour makes it able to stand on its own, while giving a person following a strict diet a chance to enjoy its rich-mellow taste and still maintain a low calorie intake. For instance, a pureed cup of hubbard squash savoured just right can readily replace the rich gravies normally used to cover mashed potatoes; and a few cups of the gourd cubed, along with other fresh vegetables and chopped ham or another favourite meat, can give a delightful replacement for dishes that otherwise come packed high in cholesterol.
<BR><Br><BR><B>The Different Types of Squash</B>
 
<p align="justify">
References tell us that the name squash originally came from a Native-American word meaning "food eaten raw", and this fleshy vegetable can conveniently be divided into summer and winter types, depending upon whether they are sued for cooking in an immature state, such as zucchini (a summer squash) or at maturity like those in the Hubbard group (the winter squash). In fact, pumpkins, gourds and squash are all species from the genus Cucurbita,a  part of the gourd family. But we're also told that gourds have a hard outer rind, with minimum or no flesh when harvested; and even more confusing, the word pumpkin comes from the French word 'poumpon' for vegetables, which designates autumn or winter squash in Europe.
<p align="justify">
At the same time, North Americans define pumpkins as the edible fruit of any Cucurbita species, harvested mature for ornamental purposes or for baking; and the reason for the confusion surrounding all these designations is best understood if we return to a natural setting, where the plants were wholly dependent on insects, such as honeybees, to carry out the pollination of their female flowers.
<p align="justify">
By 1890, the Encyclopedia Britannica observed that it was extremely difficult to define the different varieties of gourds to specific groups, because of their ability to readily hybridize; and the article finished by saying, "... <I>it is very doubtful whether any of the original forms now exist in the wild state.</I>" But although none of the squash we know today came directly from the New World centuries before Columbus arrived; and once recognized for their food value, seeds from those prolific vines spread throughout the world.<BR><Br>
<BR><B>Mrs. Hubbard's Legendary Squash</B>
<p align="justify">
But what about the history surrounding the Hubbard squash, that tasty hard-shelled fruit of the vine that gourmets often tout as being the most important ingredient for making delicious pumpkin pies?
<p align="justify">
Legend tells us that the first Hubbard squash was grown around 1840 in Marblehead, Massachusetts, from seeds brought in from the tropical America; and there isn't much written about Mrs. Hubbard, the person who first noticed the superior qualities of that elongated globe and brought it to the attention of her favorite seed merchant. But it is mentioned, that her business friend named the seed after her; and plants grown from her seeds went on to become known as the Blue Hubbard", perhaps because of a bluish-tinge that radiated from the dark green skin of their fruit.
<p align="justify">
Other hybrids followed, and a plant producing dark green globes of fruit, with light axial stripes converging on the unattached end, eventually appeared. The "Improved Hubbard Squash" are a vigorous annual, somewhat insensitive to early frost. Their handsome golden-yellow male and female flowers, with net-like veins, both grow on the same plant; and the vine's strong rope-like runners, covered with broad palmated leaves, spread randomly throughout the garden, in lengths extending up to 40 ft. The first male flowers usually emerge, three or four days ahead of the first female flowers, on long-slender stalks near the terminal ends of the runners; and the conceiving flowers appear later, on short thick peduncles, in the leaves' axils; and once fertilized, produce the succulent fruit we've become accustomed to.
<p align="justify">
The legends surrounding these highly productive plants are many, and one highlight finds Mrs. Hubbard's astute observation leaving us with a legacy to enjoy. The Hubbard Squash really requires 100 days to produce fruit weighing around four pounds. But this year, abnormally wet spring conditions in southeastern Manitoba allowed the young Hubbard plants to form a strong root system; and the hot dry summer weather that followed helped develop larger than normal fruit.
<p align="justify">
This fall, Hubbard growers in our area had record yields of thick-shelled squash, ranging in color from dark green to bright orange; and they can be stored for up to 6 months in a  dry place at room temperature.While nature has given us this bountiful harvest; perhaps we should pause for a moment and think about the person who helped make it possible. Thanks Mrs. Hubbard for a great gift!

<BR><B>Grandmother's Platchenca</B>
<p align="justify">
I spent the morning several years ago walking through the streets of downtown Langley; and as the cold November day progressed, the dull overcast skies started to drop an occasional snow flurry. The day seemed somewhat unusual for British Columbia's lower mainland at that time year, reminding me more of the prairies; and as I slowly made my way back to my mother's warm apartment, my reflections returned to the heart of Alberta.
<p align="justify">
After completing the harvest in the fall, Alberta often enjoyed a fine Indian summer; and when the cold days of November started to bear down on us, it was normal to head indoors and look for things to do. It was also a time when mother would make her German pumpkin turnovers from a  recipe brought by her grandmother from the old country; when she came , before the turn of the twentieth century.
<p align="justify">
The process often started with mother telling us kids to get a fire going, while she prepared the pastry. We would stoke up the old kitchen stove, using poplar kindling and coal purchased from the colliery on the Battle River to the south of us, and then help roll out the dough, while she mixed up a filling using pureed pumpkins or squash. We would then cut saucer sized discs from the sheets of thin pastry; and mother would place about two tablespoons of the sauce on each disc; leaving about half an inch uncovered around the perimeter. The two halves were then joined, and squeezed together with finger tips; before placing then on cookie sheets, and cutting slits on the tops of each. The turnovers were then placed in the oven, and baked for half an hour at 350 degrees F.
<p align="justify">
Within a short while, the farm house was filled with the pleasant aroma of baking platchenca; and half  way through cooking, the turnovers were basted with butter or margarine and flipped over. Once baked and removed from the oven, the pastry was allowed to cool for a short while; and the mad rush of hungry kids followed.
<p> The delightful taste of fresh baked platchenca is one of my fondest childhood memories. I hope you will enjoy trying this recipe!
