<p>TwoFarms CSA has three types of shares available. The basic share is $400 and 
should easily feed two adults. The share plus for $750 is essentially double the 
food and should easily feed a family of two adults and two children. A half 
share is $250 and subscribers pick up every other week instead of weekly. In 2005 
we had 100 subscribers (included over 125 households due to share sharing).</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="TF%20kids%20II.jpg" width="269" height="181" align="right">There 
are some CSAs that encourage subscribers to spend some amount of time actually 
working on the farm. We opted not to go this route because of administration and 
control difficulties. Instead, to give people some on farm experience, we have 
one or two &quot;farm days&quot; during the season where subscribers can tour the farm and 
relax over a picnic lunch.</p>
<p>Families pick up their produce each Wednesday between 11:00A.M. and 8:00PM.&nbsp; 
Whereas we do provide some bags, the subscribers are encouraged to bring their 
own bags or boxes. We strive to have our season go for at least 20 weeks and 
work to extend pickups even longer. All pickups are at Blackberry Meadows, which 
is located about 1.5 mi. off exit 15 (Natrona Heights) on route 28 in Fawn Twp. 
(Make a left at the end of the exit, go to the next stop sign and make a right.&nbsp; The farm is on 
the left behind a split rail fence about 1/2 mile down the road.)</p>
<p>We provide a wide variety of certified organic vegetables and herbs such as 
onions, peas, beans, lettuce, kale, collards, mustard greens, pac choi, 
tomatoes, peppers, melons, squash, blackberries, beets, garlic, eggplant 
parsley, basil and many others. Also, in most instances there are several types
<img border="0" src="TF%20tomatoes%20II.jpg" width="278" height="176" align="left">of 
each vegetable. For instance, last year we supplied 8 varieties of tomatoes and 
4 varieties of sweet peppers. Finally, a small bouquet of flowers is also included 
each week.</p>
<p>To make the weekly trip a little more convenient, we also provide some other 
items at a very nominal extra charge. Each pickup subscribers have the 
opportunity to purchase fresh baked bread.&nbsp; Subscribers can also order from Frankferd Farms during the 
week for pickup on Wednesday.&nbsp; (Frankferd Farms is the area’s largest organic dry 
goods wholesaler. You can order anything from tofu to environmentally<img border="0" src="Cov%20flowers%20II.jpg" width="219" height="162" align="right"> 
friendly dishwasher detergent.) Finally, we raise our own free range chicken 
that the subscribers can purchase as well as eggs from our egg layers.</p>
<p>Occasionally, subscribers have commented that the produce they receive is too 
much for them to use. Not only do we stress that people should only take what 
they can and will use (On this basis, they should be getting good value for 
their money.), it is important to understand that the CSA also supports the 
Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. We plant significantly more than will be 
distributed through the CSA with the excess production donated to the GPCFB. 
Most years the CSA supplies over 4,000 lbs. of produce to the Food Bank. This is our 
effort to make quality, fresh organic produce available to families regardless 
of economic circumstance</font><font FACE="Goudy Old Style">.</font></p>

  <font face="Goudy Old Style" size="5">*</font><font FACE="Goudy Old Style"><b>What 
  is a CSA?</b><p>CSA is an acronym for Community Supported Agriculture. The 
  concept began in Japan over 50 years ago and was popularized in the U.S. in 
  the 1980s, primarily through the leadership of pioneer Robyn Van En. Today, 
  there are an estimated 900+CSAs across the country.</p>
  <p>Simply put, a CSA is similar to a farm food coop. Members buy a &quot;share&quot; in 
  a farm by paying for their food in advance of the growing season when the 
  farmer has the bulk of his expenditures. By &quot;investing&quot; in a local farm, 
  members accept the risks and rewards of production.</p>
  <p>It is a model that brings together farmers who are committed to sustainable 
  farming practices and the local community who get a local, fresh, organic and 
  safe food supply.</div>
