         Feature: Swiss Chard</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>Chard is in the spinach family, and is closely related to
        beets-early Chard varieties are referred to as &quot;leaf beets&quot;,
        because way back in the Chard lineage the original plant was
        taken in two distinct directions. <BR>
<BR>
        Years ago, one plant breeder decided the root was the best part
        and developed the Beet plant, and another focused on the quality
        of the leaves and arrived at the Chard plant. <BR>
        Today there are numerous varieties of each. We grow the red-stemmed
        classic Rhubarb, the white-stemmed Fordhook Giant with huge leaves,
        and the stockier Silverado with thick, juicy white stems. Also
        look for our beautiful Golden stemmed variety with medium-green
        leaves.</P>
        <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
        <B>HOW TO CHOOSE</B>-Like other greens, Swiss Chard should look
        bright and perky if it's truly fresh. Once they're harvested
        they begin to lose their natural moisture, but harvesting them
        in the cool of the day will help them stay fresh longer. The
        color should be bright and dark and the leaves should be shiny-don't
        use Chard with dull, yellowing leaves. <BR>
        <B>HOW TO KEEP</B>-Store in the refrigerator, in a closed plastic
        bag. Make sure to keep them from drying out. You can also store
        them like cut-flowers: place the stems in a glass or pitcher
        of cool water.<BR>
        <B>HOW TO EAT</B>-Generally, it's best to remove the stems from
        the leaves and treat them separately because the stems take a
        little bit longer to cook than the leaves. I like to chop the
        leaves a bit and dip them in boiling water, just until they wilt-this
        just takes a minute or two. The stems can be chopped and tossed
        in a minute earlier to soften them a little. Chard has a very
        mild flavor and for the most part can be handled just like spinach.
        Chard makes a nice addition to soups or spaghetti sauce, or tossed
        with pasta. Try dressing it with a little balsamic vinegar and
        olive oil, or saut&eacute;eing the leaves with a little garlic
        in olive oil-it only takes about five minutes!</P>

              the excess moisture.<BR>
              3. Season at the last minute with a pinch of red pepper flakes
              according to taste, and with salt and pepper, and squeeze lemon

        <P>This week's lovely bouquets include more spikes of the blue-hued
        Delphineum, white Alliums, and perhaps a touch of pink or yellow
        Lupine, with a touch of Bachelor's Buttons to fill in the gaps.
        In the next week or two, you can expect to see Peonies, sky-blue
        Alliums, and Rocky Mountain Garland. The Zinnias and Cosmos have
        just sprouted, and the Shirley Poppies and Sweet Peas keep growing!</P>
        <H2><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660033"><HR>Fresh Oregano</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>Last fall, we set aside space near the greenhouses for several
        raised beds that we designated for perennial herb plants. The
        oregano loved our mild winter weather and the plants have put
        on lots of lush spring growth. (We also planted mint, chives,
        thyme, rosemary, sage, tarragon, and horseradish.)</P>
        <P>Use fresh oregano with cheeses, with tomatoes, summer squashes,
        or onions, and with eggs. Use it sparingly, as the flavor can
        easily overwhelm the dish it is cooked with. If you'd like to
        dry your oregano for use later, simply hang it in a dark, warm,
        well-ventilated area until dry, then store it in an airtight
        container away from bright light.</P>
        <H2><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#660033"><HR>Green Garlic</FONT></CENTER></H2>
        <P>In October, we planted rows and rows of garlic to make sure
        we had enough to satisfy everyone this year. The talks are tall
        and green, and the bulbs are <BR>
        just beginning to form underground. Now is the time to enjoy
        the garlic in it's green stage, when the immature cloves are
        just starting to form and the flavor is mild and aromatic. At
        this stage, it blends perfectly with other vegetables and is
        good in broths, soups, stews. Keep the tougher parts of the stalk
        to flavor broths and soups.</P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#ffffcc">What incredible weather! We had temperatures
      in the 80's last week-and we thought the August-like heat had
      parched the ground we've planted so far. Then the summer squash
      seedlings popped out of the ground, then the beans, then the
      sweet corn. Hot, dry weather is perfect for weeding and cultivating
      around the plants because the little (and big) weeds fry immediately.
      It's very gratifying to pull the weeds up and watch them wither
      before your eyes.</FONT></P>

      Our first rapini planting is bolting out of control now, so we'll
      have to wait for the second planting to mature for more sprouts.
      (The term &quot;bolting&quot; refers to the plants turning their
      attentions to flowering and ripening seeds.) While bolting means
      the end of crops like arugula, rapini, and broccoli, we look
      forward to the flowers forming on the fruiting crops, like peas
      and squashes. All of our pea varieties are blooming now, and
      several have begun forming pods. If the weather cooperates we
      may be picking snow peas next week! I can't wait for fresh peas
      again.<BR>
<BR>
      Phyllis (our rototiller) and I spent the better part of Sunday
      cultivating the pea rows-lifting the columns of vines to one
      side and tilling to pull up all the weeds, then gently laying
      them down in the other direction to weed and till the other side.
      Clean rows and pathways make harvesting much easier. <BR>
<BR>
      Our wild bird sightings this week include our state bird, the
      Goldfinch, a pink-headed House Finch and his mate, and a Peregrine
      Falcon. And, you may know that Crows are intelligent birds (as
      well as being annoying), and they can be very adept at mimicking
      any kind of noises, especially other birds-I've even heard one
      imitate a squeaky gate. I was watching the baby pigs, and I thought
      I heard a chicken&shy;but the chickens are far away from the
      pigs. I looked around and all I saw was a crow perched on a fence
      post. I stood watching it for a moment, and as it opened its
      mouth again, I heard the chicken voice come out. I couldn't believe
      believe my ears!<BR>
<BR>
      And you're all probably awaiting the news: Opal is the proud
      mother of seven beautiful babies, which is just enough for her
      first litter. We convinced her to move to the birthing suite
      just half an hour before she began her labor Wednesday evening,
      and she was all finished in two hours. The first few hours she
      was a little bewildered by the little wiggling babies, but she's
      an excellent, careful mother.<BR>
      So, thank you to all the farm pick-up people who accomodated
      our late pick-up on Tuesday, and to all the Seattle pick-up people
      who tolerated our late delivery on Thursday.</FONT></P>
