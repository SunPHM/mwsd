Wonderful web site! I'm researching a paper for a nutrition class on <a href="/destinations/germany/">German food,</a> and I found your site after arduous hours of sifting through disapointing websites. This is an excellent, well organized, informative site. <p>

The information I found here will help immensely with my project! <p>

What do you call the left-over pieces and flavoring that you "DEGLAZE" 
from the pan?<p>

Thank you,<p>

<i>Dear Betty,<p>

The term you are looking for is "fond" (pronounced fahn). According to Webster's New World Dictionary of Culinary Arts, fond actually has two meanings: 1) it's the French word for stock; 2) French for bottom and is used to describe the concentrated juices, drippings and bits of food left in pans after foods are roasted or sauteed; they are used to flavor sauces made directly in the pans in which they were cooked.<p>

Fondly yours,<p>

Dear Global Gourmet,<p>

I am from Canada and I have been entering the <a href="/food/guess/">Gourmet Guess</a> contest for some time now and have never won anything. In fact, there doesn't seem to be many Canadian winners - some months none at all!! Is there any chance for a Canadian to win? What is the ratio between Canadian and American respondents?<p>

I look forward to hearing from you soon. Maybe even with a prize.<p>

<i>Hi Joy,<p>

We have had over 800 winners since 1994. Less than 1% of all entries are from Canada and we have had at least a dozen Canadian winners, which indicates a higher percentage of Canadian winners than entries. Here are some recent winners of <a href="/food/guess/">Gourmet Guess</a> from Canada:<p>

0998 - Margaret Curran, New Minas NS<p>

1298 - Elaine Rucki, Hamilton ON<p>

1199 - Rachel Moir, Thunder Bay ON<p>

0200 - Susan Mendoza, Mississauga ON<p>

0600 - Patricia Rijavec, Edmonton AB<p>

0800 - Diana Lingholt , Maple Ridge BC<p>

0301 - Huguette English, Beaverbrook NB<p>

Winners are picked randomly by computer from all qualified entries that score at least seven points out of a total of eleven possible points. Qualified entries must fill out their name, address and phone number completely and only the first entry from any one email address is allowed. There are ten winners each month and we receive over 10,000 entries each month.<p>

Thanks for playing.<p>

Dear Global Gourmet,<p>

Do you have any information about the origin of hushpuppies? I have a bet with my girlfriend on how hushpuppies came about, especially what they were first used for. Any info will be appreciated. <p>

Thanks,<p>

Mike<br>
HMPelata*aol.com<p>

&nbsp;<br>

<i>Dear Mike,<p>

What exactly is the bet? And with the info below, who wins? Do you have alternative theories? According to the Morris Country Library, the general concensus is that the name DOES have something to do with keeping dogs quiet. Here are a few sources:<p>

The term appears in print for the the first time about 1915. Although unconfirmed, the common assumption regarding the hush puppy's origin is that it dates from the period of scarcity following the Civil War, when cooks would toss scraps of corn batter to hungry dogs with the words "Hush Puppies!" But the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins cites a Southern reader's account that in the South the aquatic reptile called the salamander was often known as a "water dog" or "water puppy"...These were deep-fried with cornmeal dough and formed into sticks, and, so the accout goes, they were called "hush puppies" because eating such lowly food was not something a southern wife would want known to her neighbors." ---The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink, John F. Mariani (p. 161). <p>

"Hush puppies seem to have originated in the day-long hunting and fishing expeditions popular among Southern men a few generations ago. Cooking their catch over an open fire was part of their enjoyment of the day...as a side dish they fried little cornmeal cakes in the pan they had used for the fish, and when the meal was over the leftovers went to the tied-up, yelping dogs, presumable with the cry "Hush, puppies." The name first appears in print in 1918, but probably was used much earlier." ---Rare Bits: Unusual Origins of Popular Recipes, Patricia Bunning Stevens (p. 139). <p>

"It is said that the hushpuppy got its name from the dredging of the catfish that would have been thrown out. Being thrifty, the cook from the house would send this down to the slave quarters and the women added a little milk, egg and onion and fried it up. It is said they were tossed at the dogs to keep them quiet while the food was being transferred from the pot to the table, i.e., "hush puppy! hush puppy!" ---A History of Soul Food <p>

Please let me know who wins, and what the loser believed. Perhaps we can add to this "urban legend" of folklore. <p>

Dear Global Gourmet,<p>

I happened upon your site quite by accident, but am glad I did. Perhaps you can help. I have been looking for a recipe for a ginger pickled lemon that my grandfather used to make. He was from the Punjab, and came to the US about 1902. As a young boy, I remember him making this mixture that he would put in pickle jars to ferment for about 6 months at a time...All I can remember is that he would quarter lemons, and create this brown mud with ginger, vinegar and who knows what else. After the fermentation process we would open the jars to the most punjent smell that would burn your nose, and yet when you would eat the lemons, they had this most unique taste that cannot be described...<p>

He of course died many years ago, and I never found out what the mixture was, nor do I know where to find any recipe for such. Can you help? Thank you.<p>

<i>Dear B.,<p>

I consulted several pickle recipes, mostly from South India and general Indian cookbooks. Some use mango or lime but can also be applied to lemons. In all of them, fenugreek and asafoetida were key ingredients, along with ginger. Visit a bookstore to see if the pickle recipes in these books sound right:<p>

- Hot Lemon Pickle, in "Dakshin: Vegetarian Cuisine from South India" (Periplus) - Spicy Lemon Pickle, in "Betty Crocker's Indian Home Cooking" - Hot Mango or Lime Pickle, in "Savoring the Spice Coast of India" (HarperCollins)<p>

All of these books have recipes in the Global Gourmet's "Cookbook Profiles" section, but you'll have to consult the actual books for the pickle recipes. You can also buy the books online from our site by going to the featured book in the  <a href="/food/special/specialarc.html">Cookbook Profile</a> archives.<p>

Hope this helps. Your note about the pungent aroma suggests that asafoetida, a real killer smell but valuable secret ingredient, was included. However, I ran across a recipe in an out of print cookbook that may be useful and uses only garam masala instead of other harsher flavorings:</i><p>

Lemon-Vinegar Pickles <p>

juice from 10 whole limes<br>
18 lemons with thin skins, washed and dried<br>
4 ounces sliced ginger<br>
1-1/2 cups white vingear<br>
4 T. salt<br>
1 T garam masala<p>

Mix lime juice, ginger, vinegar, salt and garam masala. Pour over lemons and coat well. Pour into jars. Cover with towels, tying around the jar necks. Do not cover with tight lids. Set in sun every other day for a few hours. In 1 month the pickles will be ready. <p>

Hello,<p>

I'm a food and travel writer. I'm looking for some demographics info on gourmet food and wine travelers. Who they are. Suggestions for how to best reach them, etc. It's for a conference I'm speaking at in NZ early Nov.<p>

Can you provide any of this info? You will, of course, by credited in the presentation, both verbal and written.<p>

Also, the wine region I'm traveling to has recently developed an 80-artisan food trail. Would make a great <a href="/food/bites/">Travel Bites</a> piece.<p>

Thanks for your help.<p>

<i>Dear Linda:<p>

The editor of the Global Gourmet passed your email on to me. The only  information I can provide is that I've heard of an organization called  International Food, Wine and Travel Association. I looked it up in  Google.com and found a website address of:<p>

If you just type in the homepage, www.ifwtwa.org, you get an under  reconstruction message, but the page above is still active. They might have some  of information you are seeking.<p>

PLEASE remove my name and email address from your  web site at once!!!!<p>

I really get enough spam; I don't need every idiot  with a modem to look up my personal e-mail address  and strafe me with unwanted junk e-mail. <p>

I would NEVER have contacted your site if I realized  you planned to display my name and contact information, and I think it is exceptionally poor cyber etiquette  to do so without my permission. <p>

Thanks, <p>

<i>Dear Beth,<p>

As noted in the preface to our Letters column, all email addresses but our own are doctored with an asterisk instead of an @ so automated spam programs cannot cull email addresses off our pages.<p>

We doubt anyone would go to the trouble of culling email addresses off our pages one by one and changing the asterisk to an @ symbol. We've been doing this since 1994 and you are our first complainant.<p>

Dear Global Gourmet,<p>

I read your disturbing comments regarding the <a href="/destinations/ireland/irelandback.html">"British Isles."</a> Two things stuck out:<p>

i) You used two British books to argue your case for using this term. Many books form Ireland and elsewhere would refute your claim that Ireland is part of that group of islands known as the "British Isles."<p>

ii) You don't seem to realise how insulting this mistake is to the vast majority of Irish people in the Republic of Ireland and I assume a sizeable minority in the North of Ireland. The term was coined when Britain had control over the whole of Ireland. Since 1922 the 26 counties of what is now the Republic of Ireland have been free from Britain and its empire. Please refrain from using this offensive term in relation to Ireland. It's the least you can do.<p>

Yours Sincerely,<p>
