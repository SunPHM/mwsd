This is the front of the yard.  Except for the bushes directly in front of the house, there's not a whole lot of landscaping going on.  We'll need to remedy that.<p>

This is the view from one corner of our lot.  Apparently, the people who live here used to have a giant garden back here.  Each year they got a little older and the garden got a little smaller.  Now they're in their 70's and the garden is just that little dirt patch in the middle of the grass -- they grow squash :)<p>

Say it with me.. "lawn service."  Ain't no way I'm mowin' all this :)<p>

I have no idea how this picture got here.  I guess it proves that we have a yard on all four sides of the house.<p>
