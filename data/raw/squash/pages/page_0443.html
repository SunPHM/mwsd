<FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE=+2>Squash Challenge Promotes<br>Major Expansion of Courts</FONT><BR><BR><IMG SRC="/lib/taftalumni/squash.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="189" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR><BR>Taft Squash has enjoyed unprecedented success over the past ten years. The construction of five softball squash courts in 1993 saw Taft lead the way as the first secondary school to move from the smaller, hardball court standard to the larger court format. At the time the new courts were built, the four existing hardball courts were left intact and have been used as practice courts.<BR><BR>An anonymous donor has now stepped forth as part of his and his family's commitment to the Campaign to offer a dollar-for-dollar matching gift challenge of up to $300,000 to help Taft move ahead with the conversion of the four existing courts to three additional softball courts. The renovation project will bring the School's number of softball courts to eight and put the squash program on an equal footing with the best prep school facilities in the nation. The glass-backed walls of the courts and the adjoining viewing area will provide great vantage points for spectators. Construction of the courts began in August, with completion slated for early fall.<BR><BR>Men's Varsity Coach Peter Frew called the challenge, which will remain in effect until the closing of the Campaign on December 31st, a "fantastic leap ahead for our entire squash program, resulting in an eight-court complex that will enable Taft to continue to attract highly talented players and reach for excellence for years to come."<BR><BR>To learn more about the Squash Challenge, please contact Clayton Spencer at 800-959-8238.
