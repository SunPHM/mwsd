<span class="orange-head">For the Cook Who Likes to Garden, and the Gardener Who 
Likes to Cook: <br>
Pumpkin with Black Beans </span> <br>
<i>R. Ohlgren-Evans, from the October 1998 Newsletter</i> 
<p>It's pumpkin time, as anyone who went to the county fair this year to witness 
  the nearly 400-pound prize-winner would know. Pumpkins resembling Cinderella's 
  coach might win blue ribbons, but would not be our first choice for cooking. 
  The 'sugar,' or 'pie' pumpkins, which are grown specifically for cooking, have 
  a smaller seed cavity, more flesh, and are less stringy. 
<p>A pumpkin stores well for up to five months if kept in a cool, dry place or 
  root cellar, and pumpkin puree freezes well. And don't forget&#151;if pumpkin 
  is not available, any winter squash will substitute in most recipes. 
<p>This unique dish has a mild south-of-the-border influence, and would be great 
  served with warm tortillas and some plain yogurt or sour cream.

<span class="orange-head">Quinoa, Corn, and Rice Pastas</span> <br>
<i>By Pamela Lee, from the October 1998 Newsletter</i> 
<p> Pasta means 'paste' or 'dough' in Italian. The mixing of flour and water to 
  form a paste (which is kneaded and cut into various shapes) is a very old culinary 
  process. It is also common to many cultures. Manuscripts and paintings from 
  a number of ancient cultures reveal that pasta was enjoyed as a staple as long 
  as 3500 years ago (during the Shang dynasty in China, the Etruscan civilization, 
  and in ancient Greece). A long history of pasta making also exists in Spain, 
  Israel, Persia, and Russia. 
<p>Several decades ago, spaghetti with a red sauce or macaroni-&amp;-cheese were 
  about the only pasta dishes familiar to most Americans. Yet now we regularly 
  consume pasta in many forms, with many sauces and presentations. In the 1960's 
  few of us called spaghetti &quot;pasta,&quot; so a few words about terminology: 
  flour-and-water pastas are strictly classified as macaroni, and egg pastas are 
  called noodles. But, we use these terms somewhat interchangeably. For instance, 
  fettuccine is called pasta even though it is, strictly speaking, a noodle, i.e. 
  made from an egg paste. 
<p>If you've browsed through the pleasing array of bulk pasta at the Coop, maybe 
  you've wondered about the &quot;macaroni&quot; in the drawers in the far right-hand 
  column: the garlic-parsley rice twists, the quinoa linguini, rotelle, curls 
  and pagodas, the corn spaghetti? Well, let me testify that they are very good! 
  The first time I bought corn spaghetti was many years ago, quite by accident. 
  I was shopping in a hurry and didn't realize what I'd purchased. I thought I'd 
  bought regular wheat spaghetti, and threw it in a big pot of boiling water. 
  The flavor was intriguing and different, but since I thought I was cooking wheat 
  spaghetti, I overcooked it. Since then, I've learned that I'm allergic to wheat; 
  so now I purposely buy the gluten-free pasta. 
<p>While I do miss wheat terribly when it comes to my daily bread, I never feel 
  deprived when I sup on gluten-free pasta dishes. They are plenty satisfying 
  in their own right. My personal favorites are the quinoa and corn varieties. 
<p>The secret to cooking gluten-free pasta is not to overcook it. Without wheat's 
  gluten, the window of time between underdone and overdone passes very quickly. 
  I also don't think the rice, corn, or quinoa varieties expand as they cook as 
  much as wheat pasta does. So you'll want to cook a little more dry pasta than 
  you would with wheat. For each 8 ounces of dry pasta, bring at least 3 or 4 
  quarts of salted water to a rapid boil. Stir the dry pasta into the water with 
  a large spoon or fork, breaking apart noodles that might clump together. Bring 
  the water back to a gently rolling boil and cook uncovered for about 4 minutes. 
  At this point, start tasting a bit of pasta every minute. As the pasta gets 
  close to done, taste more often. When it is done, act fast: immediately drain 
  it in a colander. Or, have a couple of cups of cold water handy, and throw the 
  cold water into the pasta pot as soon as the noodles are done, then carry the 
  pot to the sink and drain. (The cold water will momentarily stop the boil, and 
  give you a bit more time to get your pot and colander to the sink.) Don't rinse 
  cooked pasta under running water. Rinsing inhibits the adhesion of your sauce. 
  Adding oil to your cooking water also keeps the sauce from clinging well. 
<p>The only time I rinse cooked pasta is if I'm making a chilled pasta salad that 
  is going to spend the night in the refrigerator. Rinsing the cooked, drained 
  pasta briefly with cool tap water will help inhibit the absorption of all your 
  salad dressing, so you won't end up with dry, cold pasta the next day. 
<p>There are so many pasta recipes available these days. You can adapt most recipes 
  by substituting gluten-free pasta of various shapes and sizes. Just remember 
  that pasta with more surface area offers more space for the sauce to adhere. 
  If you like leftovers, delicate shapes, like the quinoa pagodas, do not hold 
  up to storage as well as linguini or elbows. 
<p>The following recipe is my invention. I've served it on both quinoa/corn linguini 
  and on corn spaghetti. Since mushrooms cook quickly, have all your ingredients 
  chopped and measured, and get your pasta water boiling before you start cooking 
  the mushrooms. I usually start cooking the spaghetti as the mushrooms cook. 
  I add the garlic in stages, starting when I begin saut&eacute;ing the mushrooms. 
  When company has eaten this dish, they've devoured it with kudos and raves and 
  never knew they weren't eating regular wheat pasta. 
<p><b>Shitake, Goat Cheese &amp; Corn Spaghetti</b> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Corn spaghetti <br>
    1 medium onion, chopped (about 2 cups) <br>
    1 bunch scallions, chopped<br>
    3 T. extra-virgin olive oil<br>
    1/2 t. sea salt<br>
    1/4 to 1/3 c. garlic (or less, to taste), minced<br>
    4 c. sliced Shitake mushroom caps (discard stems or save for making stock)<br>
    1/8 cup organic red wine*<br>
    1 T. balsamic vinegar<br>
    1 T. fresh squeezed lemon juice<br>
    3 to 4 oz. Chevre (goat cheese)<br>
    1/3 jar (~6oz.) Parrot brand Chipolte Salsa<br>
    1/3 cup rehydrated dried tomatoes, chopped<br>
    1/4 cup fresh basil, finely chopped<br>
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br>
    chopped parsley and chives for garnish </p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li> Caramelize the chopped onion and scallion (with salt) in olive oil using 
    a large heavy skillet, stirring occasionally. 
  <li>While the onions cook, boil a bit of water and rehydrate the dried tomatoes. 
    I prefer dried cherry tomatoes since they don't require chopping. If you are 
    using larger tomato slices, chop or cut them with kitchen scissors in the 
    hot water. 
  <li>When the onions have acquired a sweet, light brown color, turn the heat 
    up to quite high as you add the sliced mushroom caps and some of the minced 
    garlic. Stir and toss the shitakes with the onion/oil <br>
    mixture. Cook for a couple of minutes then add the wine, vinegar and lemon 
    juice, all the while stirring. When the shitakes are nearly cooked, add the 
    rest of the garlic, salsa and rehydrated tomatoes. Heat until the sauce is 
    fully warmed. Add the chopped basil. Taste and adjust the salt to your palette. 
    Add freshly ground pepper. 
  <li>Drain the cooked pasta and transfer it to a large serving dish. Dress with 
    the Shitake salsa sauce, top with crumbled Chevre, finely chopped parsley, 
    and chives. 
</ol>
<p>*If you don't have or don't wish to use red wine, save the tomato soaking water 
  and use it instead. It's full of flavor. 
<p> 
<p><b>Some Quick Pasta Sauces:</b> 
<p>Thinly julienne strips of red, green, and yellow bell peppers. Saute the peppers 
  in olive oil, with garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss with cooked pasta and, if 
  desired, finely grated cheese. 
<p>Thin some Kalamata Olive Spread with a flavorful extra virgin olive oil and 
  toss with cooked pasta. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley or chives. (If you 
  haven't discovered Kalamata Olive Spread yet, it can be found at the Co-op across 
  the aisle from the yogurt. It's delightful, with many uses: it's tasty on bread, 
  cooked grain, eggs, or vegetables.) 
<p>Saute finely chopped garlic over low heat in extra virgin olive oil. Be careful 
  not to toast the garlic or it will turn bitter. Drain a 7 oz. can of diced green 
  chiles; heat them with the garlic and toss the mixture with cooked pasta. Top 
  with grated feta cheese and freshly chopped cilantro or parsley.
