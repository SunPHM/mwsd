<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1></font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I bought Karl's Mr. Clean
because I knew I wanted to have a boat that</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>would be good for doing
cartwheels in pool this winter and generally</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>more playful than a Redline.
The bow had been modified by Karl and it</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>was not the prettiest sight
even though he won the Blowtorch award. I</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>decided to put the bow back
to normal and add some small foot bumps for</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>my size twelve foot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I first started on putting
the bow back to normal. I removed all foam</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>and the grab loop. I replaced
the grab loop with a small piece of wood</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>to prevent that area from
getting deformed.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="ken_clean1.jpg" height=429 width=445>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I used a heat gun on the
high setting and went around the perimeter of the bump</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>that was in the middle of
the bow were it was normally an indent. I had</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>trouble getting the plastic
at the right temperature. I got one spot too</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>hot and it bulged up a bit
because the plastic expands when it gets too</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>hot. I eventually got the
plastic around the bump to the right</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>temperature consistently
to where I could push on the wood were the grab</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>loop was a get the bow to
some what normal. The trick is to watch the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>plastic at just the right
angle in the light so you can see when the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>surface becomes glossy as
you are heating it. When the plastic becomes</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>glossy it looses it memory
and can be reshaped.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I had to take the boat for
a paddle after all that work but it still</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>looked kinda warped with
some small bulges and my feet were not</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>comfortable at all. I took
a second crack at the bow and learned another</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>trick in heating the plastic.
The plastic does not take its final shape</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>until it cools all the way.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I wanted to smooth the small
bulges without loosing the shape that I</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>returned the bow to. I heated
directly on the bulge until the plastic</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>got to the glossy point
and then waited for it to cool so I could push</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>directly on the bulge. I
used a glass jar to roll over the bulge until</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>it was gone.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="ken_clean3.jpg" height=455 width=520>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>It was tricky waiting right
amount of time</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>but it just took a few tries
of just waiting a little extra time, like a</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>minute and then waiting
a shorter time on the next try until I got the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>right results. I was having
a bit of trouble because the plastic was</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>stretched from being worked
to much so I put the bow under the bottom</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>of&nbsp; a door to put some
tension on the top of the bow. I adjusted the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>tension by putting a volleyball
under the middle of the boat so that the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>full weight of the boat
was not pulling down on the bow.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="ken_clean2.jpg" height=460 width=456>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I also decided to add some
small foot bumps to give my toes a little</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>extra room. All I wanted
was a quarter inch but it needed to be in just</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>the right spot so I made
a jig.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="ken_clean4.jpg" height=480 width=640>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>It took a few tries toget
the jig just right so that as I pushed it forward, it would</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>push out on the right spot.
I measured everything up and marked the top of the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>bow so I knew were to heat
it. I heated the plastic up to the glossy</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>point around the perimeter
of the marked area and then pushed forward on</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>the jig until the bumps
came out. It took a few tries of heating,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>hopping in with my booties
on, and modifying the jig because I did not</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>want to make the bumps too
big.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I now have a Mr. Clean that
I can stay in for almost an hour without</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>being in total agony. The
Unmodification was a success but I spent too</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>much time working on the
boat. I would have been better off spending a</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>little more money on a boat
in better shape except that the things I</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>learned were invaluable.
I don't think I would have had the guts to</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>modify a boat in good shape
without knowing what I know now. I hope this</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>helps out some of you out
there thinking of modifying a boat.</font></font>
