    <small>Trinidad and Tobago is the newest and most exciting Caribbean destination for
    travelers and visitors. Until recently, tourism had not been a priority in overall
    development: now that strategy has been reversed, and the country&#146;s incredible range
    of assets is steadily becoming better known. </small><img src="images\cocrico.gif" alt="Cocrico ©" align="left" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="139"></font><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#800000"><big><big><strong>Environment</strong></big></big></font><small><br>
    <br>
    &#149; With over 430 different bird species and over 600 butterflies, plus a very wide
    range of plants (2,300 species), trees and animals (100 different mammals, 70 different
    reptiles), Trinidad and Tobago has one of the richest environments to be found anywhere<br>
    <br>
    &#149; Among the major environmental sites are the world-famous Asa Wright Nature Centre,
    the Caroni and Nariva Swamps, the Pointe-a-Pierre Wild Fowl Trust, and Tobago&#146;s Main
    Ridge, the oldest forest reserve in the western hemisphere<br>
    <br>
    </small><img src="images\balata.gif" alt="Waterfall at Balata" align="left" border="0" hspace="8" vspace="5" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="216"><small>&#149; Both islands were once joined to the South American
    mainland, so there are mainland as well as island life forms crowded into a small
    geographical area. Mountainous rain forest, mangrove swamp and rivers, seashore and
    tropical savannah, all lie close to each other. The islands are a major crossroads on the
    migration paths of birds moving both north and south. The savannah lands are an extension
    of the llanos of central Venezuela; Trinidad&#146;s Northern Range is a continuation of
    one branch of the great South American cordilleras, rising to over 3,000 feet into elfin
    woodland at El Tucuche (3,072 feet) and El Cierra del Aripo (3,085 feet)<br>
    <br>
    &#149; Trinidad and Tobago ranks among the top ten countries of the world in terms of the
    number of species per square mile<br>

    into the Atlantic not far to the south of Trinidad and provide unusually nutrient-rich
    waters around Tobago, supporting a huge diversity of marine life. All the known hard
    corals and most of the soft ones can be found around Tobago, plus hundreds of different
    reef fish; turtles &#151; the endangered leatherback, and the green, loggerhead and
    hawksbill turtles &#151; all nest on beaches along Tobago&#146;s west coast and
    Trinidad&#146;s north and east coasts. </small></font></p>

    biggest active sports, and there is outstanding diving (especially around Speyside, Mount
    Irvine and Crown Point in Tobago) and sailing. There are excellent championship golf
    courses in both islands. And then there&#146;s tennis, watersports, volleyball, surfing,
    horse-racing, rugby, ocean kayaking, mountain biking, motor rallying, windsurfing,
    marathon running, cycling, volleyball, powerboat racing, badminton, boxing, martial arts,
    netball, athletics, squash, game fishing, horseback riding, hiking, fitness programs . . .<br>

    </small><img src="images\sailing.gif" alt="sailing.gif (5992 bytes)" align="left" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="2" WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="144"><small>&#149; Among the big sporting events of the year
    are the CL Financial Open Golf tournament (January/February), international Test and
    One-day cricket (February/April), the Trinidad and Tobago Open golf tournament (March),
    the Hampton and Carifta Games (May and June), the annual Marathon (Whitsun weekend), the
    Carib International Game Fishing tournament (April), the Angostura/Yachting World Regatta
    (May), and the Great Race for powerboats from Trinidad to Tobago (July/August) <br>
    <br>
    &#149; Being south of the Caribbean hurricane belt, Trinidad attracts lower insurance
    rates for yachts &#151; as thousands of sailors have discovered in recent years. Gulf
    coast anchorages are full of boats from all over the globe, and marine services and
    marinas have become big business.</small></font></p>
