DARTMOUTH -- Now in his fifth month of a one-year sentence at the Dartmouth jail, Manny Pontagarca knows he never wants to return. With horticulture skills he has honed in an inmate program, he may well be on a straighter and narrower path.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The New Bedford native, who is serving time on a probation violation, is one of a couple hundred inmates each year trained in the program aimed as much at growing self-esteem as plants.

"It keeps you busy and out of trouble in there," he said, motioning to the jail from the farm and greenhouse on Faunce Corner Road. "And I'm learning something here. When I go out on the streets, when I go to do something, this will come right back to me."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Only prisoners in pre-release or nearing release are eligible for the four- to six-month program. They work with Ludgero "Louie" Tavares, who was trained in agriculture in the Azores and has run the program for five years. He has little correctional experience.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The inmates built the greenhouse from scratch and meticulously removed rocks from the fields used to grow corn and other vegetables. In the horticulture program, inmates learn everything from seeding to feedings to when to pick.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"And most of them -- I'd say 75 percent of them -- really get into it," said Mr. Tavares.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The primary goal is to keep the forced overnight guests from coming back to stay again. It seems to be working.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"I had a special one come back after he was released. He was living on the third floor of a house and he got the permission of his landlady to put a little garden in the back," said Mr. Tavares. "He came back to me for help in planning it out. I helped him but he had the knowledge of how to do it. And he came back to tell me that it was beautiful and that he gave away stuff to all his neighbors.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"And then he thanked me and told me that I taught him something."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Aside from the flowers and plants sold to the public, the jail also grows corn, pumpkins, tomatoes, summer squash and kale -- nearly all of which is used in the Dartmouth jail or in the Ash Street facility in New Bedford.

"It really cuts back on food costs," said Sheriff David R. Nelson. "We also donated a lot of plants to nursing homes, hospitals and non-profit organizations. Last year we also donated pumpkins to schools in New Bedford."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The program costs about $60,000 a year to run, mostly covered by revenue from the sale of plants with a small amount coming out of proceeds from the inmate canteen fund, said Raymond P. Arruda, senior executive assistant to Sheriff Nelson.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"It actually costs us almost nothing to run because it's break-even," said Sheriff Nelson. "The real value in this is the educational process, to learn something other than stealing cars or breaking into homes."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Inmates seem to agree, although they are quick to note that no matter how physically difficult working on the farm is it beats hanging around behind the barbed wire.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Gabe Teixeira, a 21-year-old from Fall River now in his fifth month of a one-year sentence for driving with a revoked license, said the fresh air is great but more importantly he is learning something.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"I imagine having a house and a garden some day," he said.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Although the program is purposely low-key -- to avoid any impression that the greenhouse is in competition with area nurseries -- word is leaking out.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Faye Lannan of Fairhaven, buying marigolds last week, said she learned about the nursery from a neighbor and decided to check it out.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"I just found out about this place. I'm amazed at how nice it is," she said. "And the price is pretty good, too."
