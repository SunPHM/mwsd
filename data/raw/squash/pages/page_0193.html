<p><a NAME="familychar"></a><b><u>FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cucurbitaceae family is made up of warm season
annuals that prefer hot, humid weather.&nbsp; Most plants in this family
have spreading growth habits that produce tendrils at the leaf axils,&nbsp;
monoecious with separate male and female flowers..&nbsp; The fruit of the
Cucurbitaceae family is a pepo.&nbsp; Fruit referred to as a "pepo" means
that the ovary wall is fused with receptacle tissue, thus forming a hard
rind and hard dormant seed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild gourds were used in prehistoric
times as containers for storing and holding food items and water as well
as musical instruments. Some of the more popular vegetable crops in this
family are cucumbers, watermelon, muskmelon, squash, and pumpkin.

<br><b><u>CROP HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squash is native to North and Central America and
was used widely by settlers in New England because the fruit of winter
type squash stored well and could be eaten well into the winter.&nbsp;
In the 1500’s, squash was introduced to the Europeans by traders&nbsp;
returning from the America.&nbsp; Native Americans were eating selected
wild types of C. pepo that resembled today's squash type fruits which contained
more tissue that was not as bitter as the wild types and, contained less
fiber in the editable flesh.&nbsp; Selection of C. pepo types for eating,
as opposed to the container types used for storage, occurred long before
the arrival of the first settlers from Europe as remains of C. pepo dating
back to 8,000 B.C. have been found in Mexico.&nbsp; Wild species have bitter
flesh and are more gourd like in appearance.&nbsp; The summer squashes
that are so popular in today's garden, crooknecks and straight neck types
that were eaten in the immature stage, were selected and developed by the
native Indians of North America and were the genetic parents of the squash
types grown today.
<br><a NAME="plantchar"></a>
<br><b><u>PLANT CHARACTERISTICS</u></b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roots.</b>&nbsp; Roots of squash plants are generally
extensively branched in the top six inches of soil (fibrous root system)
with a well developed taproot.&nbsp; Some squash types have enlarged roots.&nbsp;
The fibrous root system fills the top foot of soil and spreads the same
distance as the vines of the plant extend over the soil (thirteen to nineteen
foot spread of the fibrous roots are not uncommon).&nbsp; Adventitious
roots form at stem nodes and can grow to be four to five feet long.&nbsp;
When the plant is first starting to develop and mature, the root system
grows as much as two and a half feet each day.
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaves.</b>&nbsp; Winter Squash.&nbsp; Leaves
of winter squash are large and reniform in shape.&nbsp; They either have
no lobes or have shallow rounded ones.&nbsp; Winter squash also has a cordate
base with a deep sinus.&nbsp; The leaves are serrated and occasionally
have white blotches.
<br>Summer Squash.&nbsp; The leaves of summer squash are six to twelve
inches and triangular in shape.&nbsp; They are deeply lobed and also have
a deep basal sinus.&nbsp; They have three to seven lobes and are irregularly
serrated.&nbsp; Summer squash leaves have prickly petioles and can be found
with or without white blotches.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Stem.&nbsp; </b>Squash usually develops
a running vine, though the selection for bush growth habit is the preferred
for today's summer types grown for the fresh market and home gardens.&nbsp;
The stem of winter squash is round and soft with small setae and soft hairs.&nbsp;
It is not harsh or prickly to the touch.&nbsp; This squash has branched
tendrils and roots grow from the nodes.&nbsp; Summer squash originally
developed a trailing vine, but toady's most popular types are found in
the form of a short compact bush.&nbsp; It is more common to find&nbsp;
compact bush type summer squash than winter type squash.&nbsp; The stem
of summer squash has branched tendrils and is more or less erect.&nbsp;
This stem has grooves and five angles, and it is harsh to the touch.&nbsp;
This is because it has speculate bristles, or sharp, stiff hairs.

spongy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cultivars, however, as the peduncle ages,
it becomes irregularly thickened with a soft cork.&nbsp; The calyx lobes
are short and narrow.&nbsp; The peduncle has been reported to have anywhere
from no expansion to great expansion at the fruit attachment.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The flower of summer squash is also monoecious.&nbsp;
The corolla is bright yellow to orange yellow, and goes from being narrow
at the base to enlarging closer to the outer end.&nbsp; The flower has
erect or spreading lobes that are short and narrow.&nbsp; The sepals are
short, the androecium is short, thick, and conical. The stigma is small,

85 days until harvest.&nbsp; It weighs 2 kilograms or 4 1/2 pounds.&nbsp;
It is creamy tan in color and a straight cylinder in shape.&nbsp; This
cultivar provides delicious flavor.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer squash cultivars usually take between 40
and 50 days before they are ready for harvest.&nbsp; Two common cultivars
of summer squash are&nbsp; ‘Seneca Prolific Hybrid’ and ‘Early Prolific
Straightneck’.&nbsp; The ‘Seneca Prolific Hybrid’ is mature in 44 days
and is 15 to 18 centimeters in length.&nbsp; The fruit is tapered and bright
yellow.&nbsp; This is a uniform, attractive cultivar.&nbsp; ‘Early Prolific
Straightneck’ matures in 46 days and is 13 to 18 centimeters in length.&nbsp;
This fruit is a tapered cylinder that is lemon yellow in color.&nbsp; Many

<br><b><u>PROPAGATION METHODS</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squash as F1 hybrids are mainly direct seeded for
commercial plantings and home use today. Transplants are seldom used unless
an early planting for market or home use is the objective.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Direct seeding</b>. Bush squash: 2-4 feet in
rows that are 3-5 feet apart, 2-6 pounds of seed per acre. Vining squash:
6-8 feet in rows that are 10-12 feet apart, 2-6 pounds of seed per acre.
Seed are planted about 2 cm deep in heavy soils and about 5 cm deep in
sandy soils. Many seeds per hill are planted to ensure a vigorous stand,
and some thinning is needed to obtain a final stand of 2 plants per hill.
Seeds are planted 1 inch deep. 70-95 &deg;F is the best temperature for
germination. Germination usually takes 7 days.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<b>ransplants.</b> Seeds are planted 5-7 weeks
prior to transplanting, the entire roots must be transplanted to the field.&nbsp;
Home gardens will plant 3 to 5 seeds in a four to six inch pot in a peat
based potting soil and , after germination and three to six inches of top
growth has developed, transplant the entire pot as a squash hill in the
garden.

<br><b><u>CULTURAL PRACTICES</u></b>
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soil requirements.</b> As other cucurbits, squash
require warm soils for successful germination at optimum of 75&deg;F. They
prefer a well drained, fertile soil that has a high organic matter content
for growth. Organic matter aids in growth by supplying some plant nutrients,
increasing soil structure, and increasing soil water holding capacity.
Light soil is good for early maturity due to its ease of these type soils
to be warmed by the early spring sun. Heavy soil is good for late season
squash growth due to higher water holding capacity of these type soils.
Soil pH around 5.5-7.5 is best for squash production, but squash plants
are sensitive to saline conditions (soils or water with salt or sodium
chloride).</td>

<td><img SRC="squash_field.jpg" BORDER=1 height=131 width=194>
<center><font size=-1>Squash field</font></center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Temperature and Photoperiod</b>. Squashes are warm
season annuals that do not tolerate frost. Best growth is obtained at a
soil temperature of 70-95 &deg;F. Growth stops at a soil temperature of
100 &deg;F. Hot caps, black plastic, and plastic row covers have been used
to warm the soil when cool temperatures exist in the early spring.&nbsp;
This practice accelerate the germination process and improved the number
of plants that survive and produce fruit. Photoperiod has a profound effect
on flowering and sex expression. The male flowers are present usually when
there are long hot days. Long days and warm temperatures seem to keep squash
in the staminant flowering phase and delays the pistillate phase and fruit
development.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fertility requirement.</b> Squash require a fertile
soil for best development. Fertilizer applications are usually split. Half
of the recommended fertilizer is applied as band or broadcast at seeding
while the other half is applied in one or two side dressings. Exact levels
of fertilizer used should be based on a soil test, soil type, climate,
spacing, management, etc. Addition of organic matter through use of manure
or green manuring will be beneficial. Macronutrients are usually applied
in a 1: 1:1 to 1:2:2 ratio. Typical California and Florida recommendations
for N: P: K are 121:60:24 lb/acre and 150:120:80 lb/acre respectively.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although no one micronutrient is limiting in squash
production, attention to their availability is necessary, especially on
sandy and muck soils. Muck or organic soils can restrict availability of
copper or manganese. Sandy soils may be low in boron, sulfur, or zinc.
Boron (1 lb/acre) in the fertilizer or as a foliar spray is often used
as a maintenance treatment. Sulfur (10 lb/acre) may be used in fertilizer.
If soil test zinc is low, apply 5 lb/acre of zinc. An overabundance of
nitrogen may promote vegetative growth and reduce yield, but a continuous
supply at the proper rate will help in fruit development.

<tr>
<td WIDTH="80%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Irrigation.</b> Although squashes
are adapted to dry areas and prefer well drained soils, a continuous supply
of water is needed for high quality and yield. Water should be applied
when soil water tension exceeds 300 millibars in the root zone for the
best yield. This will mean frequent irrigation. Trickle irrigation of squash
is best. especially in conjunction with plastic mulch, to reduce weed growth
and disease. Flooding is not suitable for Cucurbits because of the increased
amount of fruit rots due to surface moisture.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Weed control.</b> Squashes have extensive root system
and, if well established, can compete well for water and nutrients in the
soil with weeds. However, heavy weed growth causes competition for sun,
harvest problems, and may harbor pathogens and insects. Cultivation after
root establishment should be shallow and away from the plant due to the
concentration of shallow roots near the surface. Herbicides to reduce weed
competition is a common cultural practice before vine spreading.</td>

<a NAME="insects"></a>
<br><b><u>INSECTS</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The insects found on other cucurbits are also found
on squash. These insects include aphids, cucumber beetle, pickleworn, leafhoppers,
and spider mites. Two insects that cause substantial losses to squash are
stem borers and squash bugs.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Cucumber beetle.</b> Three distinct types-<a href="beetles.html#Banded Cucumber beetle">banded</a>
(<i>Diabrotica baltrata</i> ), <a href="beetles.html#Striped Cucumber beetle">striped</a>
(<i>Acalymma vittatum</i>), and <a href="beetles.html#Spotted CucumberBeetle">spotted</a>
(<i>D.</i> <i>Undecimpanctata</i>) cucumber beetles attack squash. Leaf
feeding by adults and root feeding by immature may stunt small plants,
but cucumber beetles are not as serious as on cucumber. In addition to
feeding damage, cucumber beetles spread virus and bacterial wilt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Pickleworm</b>. <a href="caterpillars.html#Pickleworm">Pickleworm</a>
is the larvae of <i>Diapheni nitidalis</i>, a moth. The moth lays eggs
on the plant and the hatching larvae feed on stem, flowers, leaves, or
fruit. The latter damage renders fruit unsellable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Squash bug</b>. <a href="billbugs.html#Squash or Pumpkin">Squash
bug</a> (<i>Anasa tristis</i>) is found wherever squash are. Squash bugs
are brownish-black, flat backed, and hard shelled. They lay their eggs
in rows on the undersides of leaves. These bugs cause wilting and usually
smell foul when crushed. The control recommendations are the same as for
borer.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Squash vine borer.</b> <a href="billbugs.html#Squash Vine borer">Squash
vine borer</a> (<i>Melittia cucurbitae</i>) is wasp-like with copper-green
fore wings and reddish-orange, black abdomens. The damage sign of this
insect is a hollowed out stem, with a green slimy exudate. This causes
wilt on the leaves. It can also kill entire stems or plants. the insect
over winters in the soil as a larva or pupa. When the vines begin to run,
the pupa surfaces and splits to release the small black wasp-like moth.
The moth lays eggs on the basal potion of the stem, and in 1 to 2 weeks,
borers emerge and penetrate the stem. Control is difficult, but sprays
applied during egg laying and hatching are recommended.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Other insects</b>. There are minor insects such
as <a href="scales.html#THRIPS">thrips</a>,
<a href="beetles.html#Flea beetle">flea
beetles</a>, melon leaf hopper, <a href="Earwigs.html#LEAFMINERS">leafminer</a>,
and <a href="caterpillars.html#CATERPILLARS">cutworm</a>. The melon leafhopper
transmits curly top virus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Control</b>. Sanitation and good cultural practices
will aid in insect control. Crop rotation away from cucurbits for 3 years,
destroying plant residue, and deep turning of land will prevent some problems.
Reflective mulches tend to repel aphids.

<br><b><u>DISEASES</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major diseases that affect squash include scab,
mosaic, powdery mildew, nematodes, black rot, Choanephora.
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="75%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Squash scab</b>. Squash scab caused
by the fungus <i>Cladosporium cucumerinum</i>, can destroy up to 50% of
squash crop in Georgia each year. The disease requires high moisture and
cool temperatures. Fruits are the most severely infected by scab. They
have gray sunken lesions appearing with an ooze coming from them. These
areas grow and may produce a lesion about 1/2 inch in diameter. The foliage
has a green water soaked area that grows and becomes angular shaped. The
tissue dies and falls out. This disease is common after harvest. To control
scab, use disease free seed, rotate crops, and use sanitation practices
in harvesting.</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mosaic</b>. It is caused by a virus. It usually causes
yellow-green mottling on leaves and fruits. This disease is more severe
in late summer and early fall. Using western grown seed is the best method
of control. There are no fungicides for mosaic.
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Powdery mildew</b>. Powdery mildew, caused
by the fungus, <i>Erysiphe cichoracearum</i>, is especially prevalent in
hot dry conditions. White or brown mealy growth will be found on upper
and lower surfaces and stems. Under severe infestations, the plant will
be weakened and stunted.

<td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nematode. </b>Root-knot nematode attacks squash
roots in Georgia. They enter young roots during feeding and cause a swelling.
These nematodes restrict water and nutrient uptake giving the plant a stunted,
wilted appearance. Control depends on soil fumigants. Nematode can be controlled
with rotation of a grass crop with the squash.</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Black Rot.</b> Black rot is caused by the gummy stem
blight fungus (<i>Didymella bryoniae</i>) and affect mostly winter squash
and pumpkins. It first appears as an irregular green or yellow spot that
gradually turns brown, then black as the fungus penetrates the rind. A
dry rot results, but the affected area often becomes infected with secondary
organisms that eventually spread through the entire fruit. The organisms
over winter in seed and in plant residue. Crop rotation and use of clean
seed are important control measures.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Choanephora Wet Rot</b>. The organism (<i>Choanephora
cucurbitarum</i>) attacks summer squash as the blossoms wilt and quickly
spreads down the fruit. A black mold, resembling tiny pinheads, appears
on the necrotic area. Spores are spread by insects and splashing water.
This disease is common under high moisture conditions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Other minor diseases</b>. Minor diseases include
bacterial wilt and angular leaf spot.

<td VALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squash, both winter and summer, are
harvested by hand. Winter squash is ready for harvest after the rind hardens
and surface color dulls.&nbsp; This must be done before freezing weather
occurs and damages the fruit. Mild freezes are beneficial in harvest by
not damaging mature fruits, but killing back the vines and making the fruits
more accessible. The fruit should be harvested before prolonged exposure
to 50&deg;F occurs.&nbsp; If it is left on the vine at this point, chilling
injury will occur. Two to three centimeters of the peduncle should remain
attached to the fruit when it is cut.</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer squash should be harvested 2 to 6 days after
the blossom falls off, when the fruit are 15 to 20 centimeters long.&nbsp;
At this point in development, the summer squash is more tender as well
as sweeter than at later stages.&nbsp; They should be harvested every other
day to prevent fruit from getting too large on the vine and keeping other
fruit from developing. When the squash is cut from the plant, 1 to 2 inches
of the peduncle should be left on the fruit.

<br><b><u>POST HARVEST</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, squash stored in temperatures above
60&deg;F do not have as good of quality as those stored at lower temperatures.&nbsp;
High temperatures result in high respiration rates, loss in weight results,
and loss of moisture.&nbsp; All of this leads to reduced quality in the
fruit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some cultivars of winter squash can be cured for
storage by remaining in temperatures between 20 and 30 &deg;C (80 to 85
&deg;F) at 85% relative humidity for 3 to 20 days.&nbsp; Warm temperatures
cause the fruit to heal any wounds it might have before it is put into
long term storage or shipped.&nbsp; This is not advised for ‘Table Queen’.&nbsp;
All winter squashes should be stored in cool, relatively dry conditions.&nbsp;
The best temperatures are between 10 and 20 &deg;C (50 to 59&deg; F), and
they should also be stored at 50 to 70% relative humidity.&nbsp; Winter
squashes can be stored for up to six months. ‘Table Queen’ only stores
well for two months. Summer squash can only be stored for a few weeks after
harvest.&nbsp; They should be stored between 7 and 10 &deg;C (about 50
&deg;F), and 85 to 95% relative humidity.&nbsp; These should not be stored
at lower temperatures because they will suffer from chill injury.
