Most of the region received 2-3 inches        of rain late on June 25, and southern-most counties received rain again        this week. With the rain came Japanese beetles, which were first reported        around the June 20. Their numbers are picking up, and feeding is most        noticeable on roses (especially yellow varieties), cherries, brambles,        and grapes. Feeding results in skeletonized leaves, mostly in the top        of plants where Japanese beetles prefer to feed in direct sunlight. Favored        plants in bloom can have their petals totally devoured. Target pesticide        control to the top of the canopy where Japanese beetles prefer to feed.        Stinkbugs are still low in number compared to last season at this time.</P>      <p>Early peach season has started in the southern region. Some of the varieties        coming off trees include 'Garnet Beauty', 'Flamin' Fury' PF-1', and Flamin'        Fury -5B'. Some cases of split pit, which is not unusual for early season        peach varieties, have been reported. The term &quot;split pit&quot; refers        to the opening of the pit at the stem end of the fruit. Peach fruit with        split pit generally develop rot problems much sooner than normally formed        fruit, which in turn can spread to other fruit in the packing box. For        this reason, split pits are undesirable and should be culled. It appears        that pit problems are much less in fruits possessing viable seed, but        the actual cause is unknown at this time. Possible contributions to split        pit include low temperatures and/or freeze damage during flowering and        early fruit development.</p>      <p>Renovated strawberries are already showing good signs of regrowth. Fruited        raspberry canes should be pruned out at this time to reduce disease potential.        In general, blackberry plantings look like a wall of fruit this season--yields        should be high. </p>      <p>San Jose scale crawlers are active at this time, and are visible with        the use of a hand lens. Short, stubby antennae combined with lemon-yellow        coloring help to distinguish San Jose scale crawlers from mites. In terms        of coddling moth, growers with resistance problems have gained increased        control with the rotation of Assail and Esteem. These growers have realized        the importance of tracking degree-days closely, and monitoring spray        patterns in order to maximize the value of these new products.</p>      <p>Sweet corn season has begun in the southern region. Despite cool early-season        temperatures, many growers will make the 4th of July harvest window.        The extended cool temperatures have produced a good potato crop this        season, and green beans are also setting well due to the earlier cool        temperatures and abundant rainfall. Currently, warming temperatures will        greatly benefit crops like tomatoes, watermelons, sweet corn, and pumpkins. </p>      <p align="right"><i>Elizabeth Wahle (618-692-9434; <a href="mailto:wahle@uiuc.edu">wahle@uiuc.edu</a>)</i></p>      <p> <b>In northern Illinois,</b> average day-time highs have been in the        80s and night-time lows in the 60s except on June 24 &amp; 25 when 90s        and 70s prevailed in the area. Soil moisture remains very low in most        counties, and some growers are irrigating their fields despite the fact        that the region received about 1.4 inches of rainfall on average during        the last two weeks. Orchardists are done with fruit thinning and continuing        cover spray programs, and codling moth monitoring is ongoing as well.        Some grape varieties are in full bloom and berries are sizing well in        the earlier varieties. Phylloxera attack on leaves has been reported        in some varieties. Sour cherry picking is underway.</p>      <p>Cucumber beetles are a problem in most cucurbit fields, and Colorado        potato beetle and potato leafhopper are problems in some potato fields.        Bean leaf beetles are feeding on green beans, and diamondback moth and        imported cabbageworm adults flying in fields of cabbage, broccoli and        other cole crops. Harvesting is underway for early plantings of cabbage,        beets, and greens. Pumpkin planting is done on most farms, but ground        squirrel feeding on seeds of pumpkins and other cucurbits such as squash        and cucumber has led to poor stands in some fields. Some sweet corn in        the area is now silking. </p>      <p align="right"><i>Maurice Ogutu (708-352-0109; <a href="mailto:ogutu@.uiuc.edu">ogutu@.uiuc.edu</a>) </i> </p>      <hr width="75%">      <table width="725" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">        <tr>          <td>            <h1><a name="degree"></a>Degree-Day Accumulations Since January 1,              2003</h1>            <p>Data for the table below are taken from the Midwestern Climate              Center web site (<ahref="http://mcc.sws.uiuc.edu/">http://mcc.sws.uiuc.edu/</a>).

And according to the diary, phenological developments are almost        identical with 2002. A year ago today, the record says that my first        peach and Kiowa blackberry were picked, red raspberry harvest was at        peak, and Japanese beetles were heavy. The same events have happened        this year, and the Japanese beetles required control yesterday. The phenology &quot;bible&quot; remains        the &quot;Illinois Fruit Calendar&quot;, now out of print, but originally        written by Drs. Dwight Powel, Ron Meyer, and Frank Owen. Their observations        and records are close to actual happenings like &quot;codling moth are        leaving apples for pupation, lesser peach borers should [still] be laying        eggs, Lodi harvest is ready, and second brood Oriental fruit moth are        emerging&quot;. For the record, harvest of early peach varieties is under        way, and PF 1 and 5B were being picked at the Apple Basket Farms last        week. The first commercial sweet corn is being picked this week.</P>      <p>In scouted orchards, codling moth trapping varies widely, and in some        orchards the first generation drop-off has not happened. Their presence        is indicated by everything from new entries to larval emergence from        the apple. San Jose Scale, mites and potato leafhopper have been other        apple insects of note, while Oriental fruit moth has been found in peaches.        Enough disease pressure has been present that a little scab, cedar apple        rust, mildew, bacterial spot and fire blight can be found. Fire blight        infections during storms around June 16 killed a few larger branches        and some shoots but did not reach trauma conditions. </p>      <p>The Japanese beetle populations mentioned earlier are not as high as        in previous years, as it took 14 days to collect the first quart in the        trap. Most of them were trapped on the 1st. Favorite feeding sites are        Honeycrisp apple, most of the grapes, sweet cherries, Japanese plums,        and yellow-blooming roses. </p>      <p>Abundant spring rains have apparently leached and/or speeded the decomposition        of some of the residual orchard herbicides, and weed and grass regrowth        is showing. If post-emergence chemicals are used to knock down the regrowth,        a shot of preemergence products can be added at the same time. If glyphosate        is used for postemergence treatment, contact with apple sprout or tree        foliage must be avoided to prevent absorption and translocation and resultant        injury. July 1 is the date of this traditional caution notice. </p>      <p>Apogee sprays for growth control on apples look good at this time. Some        Fuji blocks seem to respond more than Jons and Goldens, but all treated        blocks can be visually identified by reduced terminal growth and sometimes        more visible fruit. However, I thought I saw more red mites in the Apogee        trees and would like to know if this has happened elsewhere.</p>      <p>One of the hot topics of discussion at the Summer Orchard Day was the        crop damage and loss caused by deer and raccoons. The coyote urine control        mentioned a couple of months ago has now failed under heavy deer pressure,        as have most other treatments. The raccoons were reported to be consuming        whole trees of ripening peaches and bushes of blueberries. Fencing and        nuisance permits for population reduction are both needed. </p>      <p>Peach harvest means that summer's heat is near. The heat can also scorch        leaves of pear trees, especially a variety like Moonglow or Starkrimson.        (Pear psylla can also cause similar injury). And it is about time for        necrotic leaf blotch drop of apple leaves which happens after certain        hot and humid weather. </p>      <p>Acceptable pruning at this time of the year is the cutting or pruning        of water sprouts of apple and some of the interior shoot growth of peach.        The expired fruiting canes of raspberries, both black and red, should        be pruned out immediately after harvest as part of a disease sanitation        practice which gets rid of the canes and allows more aeration in the        canopy. </p>      <p align="right"><i>Chris Doll</i></p>      <hr width="75%">      <h1><a name="pesticide">Pesticide Regulatory Issues</a></h1>      <h2>Worker Protection Standards ...

WPS-specific sessions: Soon after the EPA's &quot;The Worker Protection        Standard for Agricultural Pesticides: How to Comply&quot; manual was        released in 1993, University of Illinois Extension offered numerous informational        WPS sessions across the state. These sessions continued for several years        until widespread interest waned. In recent years, University of Illinois        Extension has, upon request, conducted WPS Refresher and WPS Train-the-Trainer        sessions.</p>      <p>2. WPS Worker and Handler Training: The WPS provisions are discussed        during private and commercial Pesticide Applicator Training clinics and,        upon request, the Extension Educator or Specialist can issue a Worker        or Handler Training Verification card following training (these cards        are optional and no test is required). Since about 1995, U of I Extension        has issued 71 Worker cards and 223 Handler cards. Clearly, these cards        are requested by a small fraction of the WPS employees in Illinois.</p>      <p>3. WPS Resources: <a href="http://www.pesticidesafety.uiuc.edu/facts/facts.html">The          Pesticide Safety Education website</a> offers several simplified WPS          guides, a Resource Guide, and linkage to the EPA's WPS website. Note          that a wide range of WPS training materials and compliance publications          and supplies can be purchased through major agricultural or horticultural          supply catalogs such as Gempler's.</p>      <p><i>Future of WPS</i></p>      <p>Following full implementation in the mid-1990's, there have been a few        specific amendments to the WPS rules which provide increased flexibility.        However, the 132-page &quot;How to Comply&quot; manual published in July,        1993 remains as EPA's official compliance reference. Over the past eleven        years, the EPA has received considerable constructive and destructive        criticism about the WPS from producer groups, worker advocacy groups,        the U.S. General Accounting Office (report dated 4/13/2000), and the        Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee.</p>      <p>In response, the EPA sponsored four national stakeholder workshops over        the last three years to determine if and how the WPS provisions should        be revised. University of Illinois Extension Specialist Michelle Wiesbrook        participated in two of these workshops. The reassessment centered on        six areas: 1) Training, 2) Enforcement, 3) Complaint and Retaliation,        4) Communications, 5) Children's Health, and 6) Funding.</p>      <p> In short, the WPS is a federal program and there are diverse stakeholder        needs and opinions that must be addressed. At this time, there is little        more than speculation to offer WPS employers and employees regarding        potential changes to the rules and regulations. A draft National WPS        Reassessment Report is expected in mid-July 2003 and a draft proposal        for regulation changes is planned for September 2004.</p>      <p><i>In the meantime...</i></p>      <p>&#8226; Review the existing WPS provisions (see &quot;#3 WPS Resources&quot; above)        and make sure you are adequately protecting yourself and your employees        as well as third parties (e.g., crop advisors, commercial applicators,        etc.) that enter your fields.

This is a very difficult question to        answer. Re-entry time and worker protection information on the pesticide        label will provide guidance on when the garden, field, or orchard can        be re-entered, but it provides no information about the residue that        might be on or within the produce. To answer conclusively the question        about whether or not it is &quot;safe&quot; to harvest and consume the        produce requires knowledge of the pesticide involved, the amount of residues        within the plant, the health effects of the pesticide, how the harvested        part of the plant has changed, and laws regulating pesticides.</p>      <p></p>      <p>When herbicide drift damages your plants, it is an indication that the        herbicide has entered the plant. To legally sell the produce, there has        to have been an established tolerance for the particular herbicide causing        the injury. Some herbicides such as glyphosate (active ingredient in        Roundup, Touchdown and others) are used for spot or stale seedbed treatments        in a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops. These herbicides have established        tolerances (Table 1). Other herbicides do not have an established tolerance        for most fruit and vegetable crops. If the concentration of the herbicide        in you fruit or vegetable is above the established tolerance or there        is no tolerance, then you have a tainted crop that is illegal to sell        and is subject to seizure. The website to check for tolerances is: <a href="www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm">www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm</a>. </p>      <p>Table 1.

The U.S. EPA tolerance        levels are the best scientific information we have, but you or your customers        may not trust that information completely, and if your customers have        heard of the drift problem, selling affected produce may damage your        farm's reputation. Concentrations detected by analyzing selected plant        tissues, usually leaves, may have little relationship to the concentrations        of herbicide occurring in the harvested portion of the plant, often the        fruit. Because there are so many unknowns, I advise not consuming the        fruit or vegetable when visible herbicide injury occurs to the plant.        Herbicide drift can kill flowers and damage fruit and leaves. The damage        makes the harvested fruit or vegetable unsightly and may affect storage        life and taste. Instead of trying to use the fruit or leaves from damaged        plants, I recommend that gardeners purchase locally grown produce at        a farmers market or roadside stand.</p>      <p>If you are interested in harvesting some undamaged fruit or vegetables        from a garden or field with areas having drift damage, get as much information        as possible. What herbicide(s) drifted? Many herbicides that commonly        cause drift injury are absorbed by the leaves and translocate to the        growing points, fruit, and seed where they concentrate. Some herbicides        such as 2,4-D degrade in plants, others such as glyphosate degrade only        slightly in plant tissues. Over time the herbicide concentration in the        plant may be diluted due to plant growth and herbicide loss in dead shoot        and root tissue.</p>      <p>I feel that having the fruits or vegetables analyzed for herbicide residue        is critical to making an informed decision in herbicide drift situations.        Several private laboratories will analyze plant tissues for herbicide        residues for a fee; that fee can be several hundred dollars per herbicide        per sample. Talk to the applicator who caused the drift problem; they        may be willing to pay for the analysis. Some manufacturers will analyze        plant tissues for their products. The Illinois Department of Agriculture,        as part of a pesticide misuse investigation, will collect plant samples        and test for herbicide residues. For the Illinois Department of Agriculture        to be involved you must file a formal written complaint alleging herbicide        misapplication. Contact the Illinois Department of Agriculture as soon        as possible after discovering herbicide injury.</p>      <p>In addition, whoever collects samples for residue analysis must collect        them correctly and in a timely manner for it to be useful for you in        the decision making process. If the harvested part is present, collect        that tissue. If fruit are not present, then collect samples of recently        formed leaves and the shoot tips. Translocated herbicides will concentrate        in those tissues. Ask that fruit samples be collected later to help you        in deciding whether or not to sell or consume the fruit. Make sure that        samples are collected from the crop plants showing injury and as close        as possible to the site of herbicide application.</p>      <p>What does information herbicide residue concentrations tell you? Sometimes        it may not tell you much. Obviously the lower the herbicide concentration,        the better, and a concentration below an established tolerance is better        than one above, but there are no clear-cut answers. Low or no residues        can mean a variety of things. The herbicide may be absent from the parts        you wish to harvest and eat, or the herbicide concentration may be below        the limits of detection for the equipment or procedure being used. Another        possibility is that your sampling procedure was not careful enough to        find fruit or vegetables with residues, and the herbicide may have degraded        between the time of the drift and when you sampled (or during sampling,        handling, shipping, or storage). Be conservative in how you interpret        the residue information.</p>      <p>If herbicide residues are detected, the scientific literature suggests        that for the concentrations likely to occur from drift and subsequent        absorption into fruits and vegetables, acute poisoning effects are very        unlikely. Questions about the possible chronic effects (including cancer,        the endpoint that is always debated in questions about pesticide safety)        from multiple exposures from repeated incidents of herbicide drift along        with many other routes of exposure remain the subject of research.</p>      <p align="right"><i>John Masiunas, (217-244-4469, <a href="mailto:masiunas@uiuc.edu">masiunas@uiuc.edu</a>)</i></p>      <hr width="75%">      <h1><a name="veg">Vegetable Production and Pest Management</a></h1>      <h2>Weed Control Along the Edges of Plastic Mulch</h2>      <p>Weed control along the edges of plastic mulch is one of the most difficult        weed management problems that many vegetable farmers face.

Revised each year but similar to previous        sermons ... </p>      <p><b>First, for the corn earworm ... </b>this is of course the big worm        in the tips of sweet corn ears. Moths lay their eggs singly on silks,        and larvae move down the silk channel immediately after they hatch from        the eggs. On corn, larvae do not feed on any exposed parts of the plant        (leaves, husks, etc.), so the only way to kill them (short of having        planted BT sweet corn) is with a contact insecticide applied to the silks.        Larvae crawl across the residues on the silks, and the insecticide is        taken up through the cuticle. </p>      <p>Although this insect overwinters with at least some success in some        areas of the state in some years, it also migrates in on weather fronts.        Counts remain low at present in much of Illinois partially because overwintering        survival probably was limited by a colder winter in 2003-03 than many        other recent winters and partially because we have not yet received immigrant        moths on weather systems from the south. Moths are almost always active        in the Collinsville area by late May and early June (though this year        counts there are low too), but in much of the state the period of first        activity (and the first need to control them) can vary from June through        August. Although control may be necessary in one portion of the state        at a particular time, it may be unnecessary in many other locations.        Consequently, it really is essential to operate an earworm trap and determine        spray needs based on moth captures. </p>      <p>Use a wire Hartstack trap or a nylon version of the same general design        (not a paper sticky trap). Bait the trap with Hercon zealures, and replace        the lure with a new one every 2 weeks. See the list below for suppliers.        Earworm control is necessary when moth flight is ongoing and fresh silks        are present. If traps are catching more than a few moths (3 to 5 per        trap per night) when silking begins, sprays should be applied within        2 days after first silk--insecticide residues must be on the silks to        kill larvae immediately after they hatch from eggs and before they enter        the silk channel. </p>      <p>The pyrethroid insecticides Warrior, Capture, and Baythroid are most        effective against earworms; they are restricted-use pesticides (users        must be licensed). Pounce, Ambush, and Asana are also effective, but        not as effective as Warrior, Capture, or Baythroid. Growers who are not        licensed to apply restricted-use insecticides can reduce earworm damage        somewhat by applying SpinTor or Sevin. None of the botanical insecticides        is effective for earworm control, nor are applications of BT products,        and organic growers generally must attempt to plant early so that at        least a portion of the season's crop comes to harvest when earworm numbers        are low. </p>      <p>Spray intervals: When moth flight is heavy (greater than 50-100 moths        per trap per night) and temperatures are high (upper 60s at night, 90        and above during the day), the spray interval for Warrior, Capture, or        Baythroid should be no longer than 3 days (2 days for Pounce, Ambush,        or Asana). When moth counts are lower (5-25 per night) and the daily        average temperatures (max + min divided by 2) are in the low 70s or lower,        the interval for Warrior or Baythroid can be increased to 4 days (sometimes        5) and for Pounce, Ambush and Asana to 3 days (sometimes 4). The demands        and expectations of your customers may influence these guidelines ...        if you need 95 percent worm-free corn, keep the spray intervals on the        short end of the ranges listed above. It is NOT useful to apply insecticides        for earworm control until silking begins because significant egg-laying        in corn begins only after silks are present. </p>      <p><b>Midwest sources of pheromone traps for earworms:</b> Bob Poppe, Route        1, Box 33, Lexington, IL, 61753 (309-723-3201); Gempler's, P.O.

To monitor corn borers and make control decisions        in sweet corn, use the following guidelines: Treat late whorl-stage corn        (at &quot;row tassel&quot;) if 20 percent or more of the plants show larval feeding        or if light trap counts are greater than 50 - 100 per night. Treat from        tassel emergence until about a week before harvest at intervals of 5        to 7 days if light traps are capturing more than 10 to 25 moths per trap        per night. You can use a corn borer pheromone lure and a cone-shaped        trap (same type as for earworm moths) instead of a light trap to monitor        corn borer, but the threshold number of corn borer moths captured per        pheromone trap is still not too clear. The pyrethroids Warrior, Baythroid,        Capture, Ambush, and Pounce are effective against the European corn borer        and the corn earworm; SpinTor also is labeled and effective against both        species. </p>      <p> <i>Below: European corn borer moth and larva.</i></p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/ecb.jpg" alt="European Corn Borer Moth" width="270" height="158"> &nbsp; <img src="images/ecblarva.jpg" alt="European Corn Borer Larva" width="244" height="158"></p>      <p><b>Ground versus aerial sprays:</b> In one of Extension's winter vegetable        schools in February of 2002 I raised the hackles of an aerial applicator        when I recommended that sprays for corn earworm control in sweet corn        are more effective if applied by ground than by air. There are not a        lot of recent data on this recommendation, but it's repeated by nearly        all the vegetable entomologists in the U.S. I'll repeat in this year's        newsletter the same message I presented last year ...</p>      <p>For small scale, fresh-market sweet corn growers, the reason for ground        sprays is simple ... in most cases relatively few rows of sweet corn        that are in the stage that needs to be sprayed are surrounded by earlier        corn and by a range of other vegetable crops. Drift or overspray onto        these crops is very likely to be greater in aerial applications than        in ground sprays, at least if all the rows at the edges of the target        sweet corn are sprayed. If the insecticide used on corn results in any        spray deposit on adjacent vegetable or fruit crops and it is not registered        on those crops, it becomes an illegal residue. End of discussion.</p>      <p>But not quite the end of the discussion ... what about larger acreages?        After all, sweet corn processors routinely rely on aerial applications        of insecticides for earworm control in their contracted acreage. Although        they may &quot;get by&quot; with this because a little bit of infestation        and damage can be cleaned out in processing, there is another reason        why aerial sprays have greater merit in these situations. The pyrethroids,        especially Capture and Warrior, are generally thought to be much more        effective at killing adult moths than were the older insecticides that        preceded them (though Penncap-M also provides some adult control). In        large fields, the influx of new earworm moths into the field after resident        moths have been killed by an insecticide is relatively slow during at        least some periods. Although aerial applications do not provide as thorough        a coverage of silks as ground applications do, they do kill adult moths        in the field at the time of spraying. Brian Flood of Del Monte has suggested        that in fields of 30 acres or larger, adult control provided by aerial        sprays persists for a few days because it takes a while for new female        earworm moths to re-enter the field. (This is NOT true for corn borer        moths, but aerial sprays are more effective at killing corn borer larvae        anyway, as they feed on leaves and other exposed plant surfaces before        tunneling into the plant.) </p>      <p>In smaller plantings, however, moths move back into the bulk of a field        faster, simply because most of the field is close to an edge and to untreated        surroundings. As a result, thorough coverage of silks and repeat applications        of insecticides that put a residue on new silk growth are necessary.        Where ground applications can be made in a timely manner, better coverage        of silks is possible with ground sprayers equipped with drop nozzles.        If heavy rains prevent the use of ground rigs for a few days, however,        then a timely aerial application is FAR more effective than a ground        spray applied 1 or 2 days late, after earworms have entered the ear. </p>      <p>So ... I'll stand by my recommendation that for earworm control, ground        applications are more effective for most fresh-market sweet corn growers.        Aerial applications have their place--in larger acreages typical of contract        fields grown for processors and when rains prevent timely sprays from        ground equipment. </p>      <h2>Squash Vine Borer and Squash Bug</h2>      <p>At last week's Summer Horticulture Day I handed out some information        about squash vine borer and squash bug, as now is the time fo year to        be attentive for both. </p>      <p>Squash vine borer adults are active now in much of the state. These &quot;clearwing        moths&quot; are colored with red and black, they resemble wasps, and        they fly and lay eggs on squash during the daytime. Larvae tunnel within        vines, causing them to wilt. They most often cause damage in squash and        pumpkins. Scout as soon as vines begin to run, looking for the moths        and for entrance holes at the base of vines (from larval tunneling).        Treat when first damage is noted and again about a week later. Several        insecticides are effective for vine borer control, including Capture,        Sevin, Asana, Pounce, Ambush, and methoxychlor. At the small scale, mounding        soil around the base of vines can encourage adventitious root growth        from portions of the vine beyond the point of vine borer damage. </p>      <p><i>Below: squash vine borer larva and adult</i></p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/vineb2.jpg" alt="Squash vine borer larva" width="283" height="188"> &nbsp; <img src="images/vineb1.jpg" alt="Squash vine borer adult" width="138" height="188"></p>      <p>Squash bug adults are active now too. Like vine borers, they most often        injure squash and pumpkins. Adults lay eggs on foliage, and nymphs and        adults suck fluids from vines and leaves. Scout for egg masses, and use        a treatment threshold of 1 to 1.5 egg masses per plant. If counts of        egg masses exceed this threshold, treat as soon as nymphs begin to hatch.        Capture, Asana, Pounce, and Ambush are registered for squash bug control        ... Capture is the most effective. </p>      <p><i>Below: squash bug eggs, nymphs, and adult</i></p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/squashb1.jpg" width="189" height="128"> &nbsp; <img src="images/squashb2.jpg" width="190" height="128"> &nbsp; <img src="images/squashb3.jpg" width="188" height="128"></p>      <p align="right"><i>(Rick Weinzierl (217-333-6651; <a href="mailto:weinzier@uiuc.edu">weinzier@uiuc.edu</a>)</i></p>      <hr width="75%">      <h1>This issue's words of wisdom ...

You sell one and buy a          bull. Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and          retire on the income. </li>        <li>American Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell one, and force the          other to produce the milk of four cows. You are surprised when the          cow drops dead. </li>        <li>French Capitalism: You have two cows. You go on strike because you          want three cows. </li>        <li>British Capitalism: You have two cows. Both are mad. </li>        <li>Russian Capitalism: You have two cows. You count them and learn you          have five cows. You count them again and learn you have 42 cows. You          count them again and learn you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows          and open another bottle of vodka. </li>        <li>Canadian Capitalism: You have two cows. Let's make a hockey team,          eh? </li>        <li>Californian Capitalism: You have two cows. They are happy.          </p>        <li>Texan Capitalism: You have two cows. You teach them to fire guns. </li>        <li>Martha Stewart Capitalism: You have two cows. After decorating them,          you sell them because a farmer told you the price of milk might go          down. </li>        <li>Enron Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your          publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law          at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general          offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for          five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary          to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder          who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.          The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option          on one more. Sell one cow to buy a new president of the United States,          leaving you with nine cows. No balance sheet provided with the release.          The public buys your bull. </li>        <li>Real Capitalism: You don't have any cows.
