<p align="left">Nice, the fifth largest city in France, acts as a magnet attracting 
  people from all over the world, for a multitude of reasons, Not only renowned 
  for its grace, Nice has become a hub for research in industry, science and advanced 
  technology since the creation of such centers as Acropolis and Sophia Antipolis. 
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="nice5.jpg" width="215" height="162"></p>
<p align="left">The Palais de Congrès, a convention center, can accomodate diverse 
  functions and the international airport has a capacity that only Paris can better. 
  Both elegant and simple, Nice's charm comes from its exceptional climate as 
  well as its beauty. Even in the winter the café terraces are filled with people 
  happily drinking and contemplating the ultra famous Promenade des Anglais.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="nice2.jpg" width="162" height="204"></p>
<p align="left"> Always in flower this wonderful walk follows along the bay, looking 
  out on the Baie des Anges and the beaches on one side, and on the other such 
  luxury hotels as the Negresco. The architecture of Nice can be astonishing with 
  the wild exaggerations of the Belle Epoque style or the Baroque influenced houses 
  and marisions on the hills of Mont Boron.<br>
  Fabulous creations have been realized in the floral gardens and parks of the 
  hills of the Chateau, the Chambrun park or the Espace Masséna. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="nice1.jpg" width="215" height="163"></p>
<p align="left">The only way to get to know the real Nice is by strolling through 
  the ochre colored streets listening to the "Niçois" speaking their own language 
  (Nissart) and by tasting their savory cooking, One musn't miss the onion, anchovy 
  and olive tarts called Pissaladières, the vegetable and tuna sandwiches known 
  as Pan Bagnat, the Salade Niçoise or the famous Ratatouille (tomatoes eggplant 
  and zucchini squash stew). The main cooking ingredient is olive oil of course, 
  and many of the dishes are garnished with the succulent little black Nice olives 
  called Caillettes.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="nice4.jpg" width="163" height="215"></p>
<p align="left">Nice is also a city of art and culture and after Paris, has the 
  most museums in France. The city is animated at night as well as in the day 
  especially in the summer with the Nice Jazz Festival held in the arena, the 
  gardens of Cimiez, and the flower "war" on the Promenade des Anglais in which 
  participate the prettiest women on the Côte d'Azur (French Riviera).</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="nice6.jpg" width="162" height="215"></p>
<p align="left">Each day on the Cours Soleya there is the great flower market 
  where one can also find fruit and vegetables in the mornings. Each quarter in 
  Nice is alive with markets, boutiques and restaurants making the whole city 
  a lovely place to visit. </p>
