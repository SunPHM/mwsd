    <h3>Welcome to the ZGI Walkthrough</h3>
    <p class="noprint"><a href="slideshow.htm">ZGI Slideshow</a></p>
    <p>Frobozz propaganda presents the Grand Inquisitor. Not a nice man, he has 
      banned all magic from Zork and (as is usually in these situations) a luckless 
      adventurer (you) happens along. Armed only with a Perma-suck vacuum cleaner 
      you enter the town of Port Floozle hoping to find shelter.</p>
    <p>All you do discover is a sarcastic talking goatfish and Antharia Jack. 
      Up the road is the Steppinthraxx Monastery, once the home of Alexandria, 
      and round the corner is the entrance to the Great Underground Empire. All 
      you need is a lamp. Once down in the GUE you do a lot of running around, 
      teleporting and general puzzle solving. The results are a bunch of spells, 
      various tools and the grudging respect of the Dungeon Master.</p>
    <p>This walkthrough will get you to the end of the adventure but you should 
      really take time to explore and discover all the clues yourself. The <a href="slideshow.htm">slideshow</a> 
      presents a bunch of screenshots from the games and the links in the walkthrough 
      open the image in question.</p>
    <p>After listening to the Grand Inquisitor bleating on about the dangers of 
      magic you arrive at a junction. There are three ways to go: Port Flozzle, 
      Elsewhere and behind you the Steppinthraxx Monastery. I suggest you explore 
      all three avenues before you progress but return to Port Floozle.</p>
    <p>Check out your inventory (F5) - all you have is a Perma Suck Vacuum (which 
      is reasonable since you are a Perma Suck Regional Sales Manager).</p>

      GUE</a> | <a href="#collect">Collecting Things</a> | <a href="#house">Dungeon

    <h4> <a name="floozle"></a>PORT FLOOZLE</h4>
    <p>The <a href="images/zgi001.jpg">loudspeakers</a> remind you that there 
      is a curfew, maybe you should try to enter one of the buildings. Knocking 
      on all the doors doesn't help. Maybe a beer will smooth things along. Try 
      to pick up the six-pack from the fishmongers icebox - and set off the alarm. 
      You need something to drown out the noise. Click on the green button to 
      increase the loudspeaker volume. While this racket is going on grab the 
      can of Mead and the plastic rings. Anything could be useful in this game.</p>
    <p>Wander down the jetty, can you see a blue glow (the announcer said something 
      about this). Pull the lever on the crane and meet your new friend, <a href="images/zgi002.jpg">Marvin 
      the Magical Goatfish</a>. You can keep him talking but there is not a lot 
      of point if he keeps jumping back in the water. Try hanging the plastic 
      rings on the hook. Pull the lever, Marvin gets caught and leaves in a huff. 
      Up comes a box and inside is a lantern - hey didn't one of the buildings 
      have a sign that said 'Lanterns Wanted'? Go to the house opposite the jetty 
      and knock on the door with the lantern. Antharia Jack welcomes you indoors. 
      He offers you a cigar and disappears off for a wrench. Satisfied that the 
      lamp is safe he says goodbye and ushers you out. You can knock again but 
      he keeps the lamp. You need a distraction. Go to the <a href="images/zgi003.jpg">far 
      end of the town</a> and set light to the ZGI toy with your cigar. Quickly 
      hide in the barrel behind you and watch Antharia Jack get arrested.</p>
    <p>Jump out of the barrel and get the lamp from his shop. It turns out that 
      the Dungeon Master, Dalboz, is stuck in the lamp. Nothing more to do here 
      so go 'Elsewhere'. There is a well but no rope. Go back to the junction 
      and head off to the Steppinthraxx Monastery. Hanging on the billboard is 
      a rope so pick it up and return to the well. Hang the rope on the beam and 
      shimmy down. (CD Change here).</p>
    <p>You can try going down the well without a lamp but....</p>
    <p> Dalboz explains where you are and introduces you to Y'Gael who gives you 
      a spell book. Dalboz explains about the different types of magic, so far 
      you have VOXAM, REZROV and IGRAM. The door is locked so open the spell book 
      and click on REZROV. Click on the door and as if by magic - it opens. Before 
      you enter, take a good look around, there is something in the bucket you 
      will need later.</p>
    <p class="image">Congratulations, you are now a Luckless Adventurer</p>
    <h4> <a name="gue"></a>THE GREAT UNDERGROUND EMPIRE</h4>
    <p>Step through the door and you are carried down to the <a href="images/zgi004.jpg">Crossroad.</a> 
      Just outside the door, on the wall is a glass case. Get the sword and map 
      of the Great Underground Empire (GUE) by using the hammer to break the glass. 
      Examine the Umbrella Tree and use IGRAM to expose the scroll.</p>
    <p>Turn round and you have three choices: The Zork Underground, Dalboz's House 
      and the University.</p>
    <p>Just down the path is a Totem, pick it up and discover the fate of Griff. 
      Go forwards and turn left. Use the sword to cut down the vines to enter 
      Dalboz's garden.</p>
    <p>Take a good look round - his security system (Harry) is completely out 
      to lunch - there must be a way to to get past him. The ashtray and bowl 
      indicates he likes a smoke and a drink... There are a Quelbee hive nearby 
      - best stay away for now. Behind the house is a mushroom plant and a teleporter.</p>
    <p> Get the spade from the garden shed and go to the University entrance. 
      Use the REZROV spell to open the door and enter the <a href="images/zgi005.jpg">University 
      grounds</a>. Take care now, this is Zork remember. Click on the pillars 
      to rotate the stones. You need to match all three to proceed.</p>
    <p class="image"><img src="assets/pillar1.jpg" width="142" height="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="assets/pillar2.jpg" width="143" height="150">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="assets/pillar3.jpg" width="142" height="150"></p>
    <p> Climb through the window and into the university foyer. Read the messages 
      on the noticeboard - there are some important clues here. Examine the dispensers, 
      without money you can't get anything. Go to the corridor and look up, it's 
      Infinite. Use IGRAM to hide the 'infinite' and it becomes a corridor. At 
      the end you discover all about the lost magical artefacts:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The Coconut of Quendor - symbol of High Magic, lost at sea by the wizard 
        Y'Gael.</p>
      <p>The Cube of Foundation - symbol of Middle Magic, stolen by Grues near 
        the white house.</p>
      <p>The Skull of Yoruk - symbol of Deep Magic, last seen in the possession 
        of Antharia Jack.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is a locked door and a bunch of student's lockers as well (remember 
      the note about the lockers?).</p>
    <p>Back down the corridor and leave through the main doors. Climb the stairs 
      and use your spade to dig up another scroll. Now it's is time to visit the 
      Zork Underground. You can teleport or walk. To teleport, go to the <a href="images/zgi006.jpg">teleport 
      machine</a> on the other side of the University and insert your map into 
      the slot. Use the pointy buttons to select your destination.</p>
    <h4> <a name="collect"></a>COLLECTING THINGS</h4>
    <p>At the Zork Underground go to the turnstile and insert your token. No token? 
      Then return to the exit, climb the dragon and look in the bucket just outside 
      the door. Down in the <a href="images/zgi007.jpg">subway</a> go to the map. 
      It need simplifying - use your KENDALL spell. Go to each of the stations 
      and look around but end up at Hades. To catch a train go to the edge of 
      the platform.</p>
    <p>At Hades go to the <a href="images/zgi008.jpg">skeleton</a> and pick up 
      the Scratchcard from his hand and look at it in your Frobozz Magical Viewer. 
      To win the game scratch a path to the money. Three failures and you die 
      so take heed of Dalboz's warning. Take your winnings and examine the books. 
      Take special note of the dragon references. Stuck: <a href="assets/lottery.jpg">here 
      is a solution</a>.</p>
    <p class="image">Be proud: you have achieved the status of Junior Enchanter</p>
    <p>OK, now you have some money, head back to GUE. Change your 500 bill into 
      coins using the machine and buy a sandwich ice cream. The OBILDIL spell 
      inside needs translating, put it in your inventory for now. On the noticeboard 
      by the entrance was a warning about Zork Rocks and Cola. Do you feel like 
      experimenting?</p>
    <p> Go to the candy machine, insert a Zorkmid and press button #8. The candy 
      bar is stuck. But did you also hear a metallic clank. 12 buttons, 12 lockers? 
      Take a look. To get the candy use your perma-suck vacuum - attach it to 
      hole at the bottom and switch on. Great, now you have some Zork Rocks. Take 
      a look inside locker #11 as well, pick up the prozork tablet and read the 
      book. Note that the number 6 button is broken (like the locker door). Put 
      the bar of Zork Rocks in the drinks dispenser and buy some Slam Classic. 
      Pick up the sticky result and get round to locker number 6 fast! 45 seconds 
      later if you are still alive the <a href="images/zgi009.jpg">door blows 
      open</a> and you can retrieve Dalboz's student pass.</p>
    <p> Use the pass on card reader next to the locked door and enter. How to 
      you defeat an <a href="images/zgi010.jpg">invisible guard wielding six swords</a>? 
      You can't so just cut the bridge instead. If you have been to Flood Control 
      Dam #3 (last seen in <a href="../zork/walkthrough.htm">Zork Nemesis</a>) 
      you may have found the GOLGATEM spell. If not then go there now, there is 
      a teleporter behind you.</p>
    <p>On the way to Flood control Dam #3 you can witness Jack's introduction 
      to the Inquisition.</p>
    <p>At Flood Control Dam #3 go to the <a href="images/zgi011.jpg">window</a> 
      and pick up the GOLGATEM spell scroll from the book. You can build a bridge 
      if you want. Now open the closed gate using REZROV and close all four using 
      the red and yellow buttons. Such wanton destruction - you should be ashamed 
      of yourself. The resulting flood knocks out the power, which is good for 
      Jack. While you are here why not buy a commemorative Zork letter opener 
      - only 1 Zorkmid. And take a look at the drain pipe. Dalboz notes that there 
      is not a lot of moss. Use your THROCK spell to produce enough to pick up.</p>
    <p>Return to GUE Tech. With water flowing, cast GOLGATEM to build a <a href="images/zgi012.jpg">bridge</a> 
      and cross to the Spell Lab. Run OBIDIL through the Spell Checker. Pick up 
      a blank spell from the box near the bridge and use the clues you found in 
      the locker to produce a spell.</p>
    <p>The sequence is: Origination, Modification, Replication, Interpretation 
      and Transmogrification. To work out why this is the sequence <a href="magic.htm">click 
      here</a>.</p>
    <p>Run the spell through the Spell Checker and collect the BEBURITT spell. 
      Leave the lab and go to the Crossroads. Remember the Umbrella tree? Use 
      BEBURITT to create a storm and pick up the one-shot ZIMDOR spell.</p>
    <p class="image">Promotion to Enchanter, congratulations</p>
    <h4> <a name="house"></a>THE DUNGEON MASTER'S HOUSE</h4>
    <p>Back now to the <a href="images/zgi013.jpg">Dungeon Master's house</a>. 
      Say Hi to Harry and put your cigar in the ashtray. Pour your Mead in the 
      bowl and cast ZIMDOR. Now that Harry is completely out of it enter the house.</p>
    <p>Go to the blinds and call Hugh the walking castle using the OBIDIL spell. 
      Climb inside and grab the NARWILLE spell from his heart. Note the three 
      cushions - for three magical artefacts perhaps?</p>
    <p>Read all the books and listen to the messages on the answerphone to find 
      out about the recipe for cocoa. Looking around you will be able to collect 
      a Mug, Flatheadia Fudge, Hungus Lard and Hotbugs. You already have the Moss 
      so all that is missing is the Quelbee Honey. The lard stinks (use the Frobozz 
      Magic Viewer) so go outside and stick in the Quelbee nest. Quickly, grab 
      the lard, cut open the nest with your sword and pick up the honeycomb. Put 
      all of the ingredients on the <a href="images/zgi014.jpg">mixer</a> and 
      collect the YASTARD spell.</p>
    <p> Go into the bedroom and jump through the mirror into the mirror world. 
      There is half a spell scroll on the window ledge. The window looks out onto 
      the trampoline plant. If you take this half-scroll back through the window 
      it reverses. Put it back where you found it. You need to get the half scroll 
      from the window without going through the mirror. Remember the book with 
      the illustration of the snapdragon on the bouncy mushroom plant? Go to the 
      snapdragon plant, toss it a Prozork tablet to put it to sleep and cut it 
      free with your sword. Round the back of the house, place the snapdragon 
      on the mushroom plant, cast THROCK and hit the plant with your hammer. The 
      snapdragon collects the half-scroll. Back into the house and pick up the 
      other half of the scroll from the bedroom. The letters reversed so go to 
      the mirror room and assemble SNAVIG in the Frobozz Magic Viewer - but it 
      still needs spell checking...</p>
    <p>OK, you are just about ready to hunt down the lost magical artefacts One 
      more spell and its time to go.</p>
    <p>Open the wardrobe in Dalboz's bedroom and cast NARWILLE to open the time 
      tunnel. Cast YASTARD on the Griff totem and off you go. Remember the<a href="images/zgi015.jpg"> 
      white house</a>? Griff does.</p>
    <p align="image">By the way, you are now an Assistant Sorcerer</p>
    <p> Round the back is a spell-scroll, if you jump back into the time tunnel 
      you will lose the spell (only spirits can pass through the time tunnel remember). 
      Take the spell-scroll round the front to the mailbox, and get the envelope 
      that is inside. Look at the envelope in the Frobozz Magic Viewer - note 
      the address. Put the spell inside and bung it in the mailbox. Close the 
      door and put up the handle. Down the path are two torches - one bickering 
      and one flickering, interesting. Off to the time tunnel and back to Dalboz's 
      house. Make sure everything is <strong>spell checked</strong> (big hint 
      here).</p>
    <p class="image"><a href="assets/highmagic.jpg"><img src="assets/magicleft.jpg" width="191" height="31" border="0"></a><a href="assets/middledeep.jpg"><img src="assets/magicright.jpg" width="382" height="31" border="0"></a></p>
    <p class="image"><a href="assets/highmagic.jpg">High Magic</a> | <a href="assets/middledeep.jpg">Middle 
      and Deep Magic</a></p>
    <h4> <a name="coconut"></a>THE COCONUT OF QUENDOR</h4>
    <p>Use the teleporter to return to Hades and pick up the phone. Listen to 
      the simple and user friendly instructions! Press 2 to listen to the answers 
      (press 6 to get 2). Press 1 and answer the questions.</p>
    <p>Solution: 2, 8, 9, 5. Why? Listen to the instructions again.</p>
    <p>Pay <a href="images/zgi016.jpg">Charon</a> 2 Zorkmids and walk to the gates 
      of Hades. On the gates is a mailbox. You've got mail! It's the GLORF spell. 
      The <a href="images/zgi017.jpg">two headed monster</a> won't let you pass 
      through the gates - you need to distract him, Go to Charon and cast SNAVIG 
      (not spell checked yet? I did warn you). Now in Charon's guise go to the 
      two headed monster, when he leaves clock out using Charon's timecard.</p>
    <p class="image"> Sorcerer already!</p>
    <p> Enter Hades and pick up Brog's totem. Open the <a href="images/zgi018.jpg">Time 
      Tunnel</a> using NARWILLE. Cast YASTARD on the Griff totem and enter the 
      time tunnel. Fly to the <a href="images/zgi019.jpg">dragon's feet</a> and 
      tweak his toe to expose his stomach. There have been loads of clues as to 
      what to do but if you are still stuck, fly to his stomach and pick up the 
      inflatable boat and captain. Fly to the hand and pick up the airpump. Fly 
      to the dragon's head and stuff the inflatable in his nostrils. Pump them 
      up and he opens his mouth to breath. Climb into his mouth and hanging on 
      his uvula is the Coconut of Quendor. You cannot leave with the coconut but 
      somebody wants to make a pina colada and throws you a rope. Pick up the 
      rope, go outside and tie it to the inflatable. Back inside put the Coconut 
      in the liferaft and puncture the Captain using the <a href="images/zgi020.jpg">gold 
      tooth</a>. Leave the lost sailor behind (you rat you) and fly to the dragon's 
      stomach. Pick up the coconut and Hugh turns up to collect the artefact (how 
      did he get there?). Place the Coconut on its <a href="images/zgi021.jpg">cushion</a> 
      and leave through the time tunnel.</p>
    <p>Charon won't let you leave so cast SNAVIG on the two-headed monster and 
      climb into Charon's boat. Teleport to Dalboz's house and go inside.</p>
    <p class="image"> Executive Spell Manager - welcome to the world of the Suits</p>
    <h4> <a name="skull"></a>THE SKULL OF YORUK</h4>
    <p>Go to the time tunnel in Dalboz's wardrobe and cast YASTARD on the Brog 
      Totem. Back at the White House, pull the boards from the door and step inside. 
      Dark in here isn't it. Go back out and down the path and grab the flickering 
      torch. Inside the house again. There is a cooking pot on the floor. Go down 
      the stairs. Behind the stalactites (or is it stalagmites - I can never remember) 
      is the Skull of Yoruk. Maybe if you throw something you can break them off. 
      Brog eats the rocks and the Grue eggs smash. Maybe if you hard boil the 
      eggs they will be tough enough. Take an egg up to the cooking pot, drop 
      it in and use the torch to <a href="images/zgi022.jpg">light the fire</a>. 
      Pick up the egg when it is cooked and throw it at the stalactites/mites. 
      Sunlight illuminates a step stone so off you go. <a href="images/zgi023.jpg">Any 
      good at chess</a>? Just use your plank to smash the cage - it's a lot easier. 
      Up the ladder into Hugh, place the skull on its cushion and leave through 
      the time tunnel.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile back at the Inquisition Headquarters...</p>
    <p>Two out of three artefacts. Just about the only place you haven't been 
      is the Monastery. You could do with a rope. Leave the GUE and cast GLORF 
      on the rope you used to climb down the well with. Use the teleporter at 
      the crossroads (or the train) to go to the monastery station. Join the rope 
      and sword using the Frobozz Magic Viewer and throw it up through the hatch 
      in the ceiling.</p>
    <p class="image">Welcome to the Totemizer, Vice Wizard.</p>
    <h4> <a name="totemizer"></a>THE TOTEMIZER AND STEPPINTHRAX MONASTERY</h4>
    <p>This place has changed since you last saw it. Zoom in to the top of the 
      <a href="images/zgi024.jpg">totemizer</a> - the Perma-seal light is on. 
      Now look at the panel below and press the button for the Halls of Inquisition. 
      You can visit the other locations, but make sure you <i>SAVE HERE</i>.</p>
    <p>On the front of the Totemizer are three wheels. Turn of the Perma-seal 
      unit using the right hand wheel (the yellow light) and go to the panel that 
      Brog used. If the red light shows, turn on the panel using the centre wheel. 
      Pull the handle and grind your way through to the Halls of Inquisition. 
      Jump out of the box and play with the exhibits. One of them is very familiar 
      if you have played <a href="../zork/walkthrough.htm">Zork Nemesis</a>. Leave 
      through the far doors and examine the code sequences. Note that 'Apprehend 
      Goatfish' is very similar to 'Dismiss Guards' Go to the control panel on 
      the left and<a href="images/zgi026.jpg"> press the button</a>. Take out 
      the middle hammer and the ' Dismiss Guards' sequence is activated. Back 
      inside and go to the other set of doors. Lucy calls out from the box so 
      pick up her <a href="images/zgi025.jpg">Totem</a>. Find out what happened 
      to the resistance. Go to the time tunnel exhibit and pull the brass lever 
      down. <a href="images/zgi027.jpg">Press the button</a> and the hammer head 
      falls off. Put your hammer in its place and press the button. Another time 
      Tunnel. Cast NARWILLE and send Lucy through the rift (Oops, sorry that was 
      in <a href="../myst/walkthrough.htm">Myst</a>).</p>
    <h4> <a name="cube"></a>THE CUBE OF FOUNDATION</h4>
    <p>The only place open in <a href="images/zgi028.jpg">Port Frobozz</a> is 
      Jack's place. Knock on the door and enter. Look at the dart board - there 
      is a very annoying fly buzzing around. Pick up the cards from Alpine's Quandry 
      and slot them into the slots. None of the sequences work - the game is fixed. 
      You need a five card. Take the 4 to the dartboard and squash the fly - now 
      you have a 5. Play Alpine's Quandry again using the sum 5/1 - 2 = 3. You 
      win! Time for the high rollers.</p>
    <p> Antharia Jack is waiting to play <a href="images/zgi029.jpg">Grue, Fire, 
      Water</a>. Use you telepathic orb to guess how he will play. You can have 
      great fun here but eventually Jack loses and offers you the Cube of Foundation. 
      Hugh arrives again. Place the Cube on its cushion and leave through the 
      time tunnel to reach the exalted position of Wizard</p>
    <h4> <a name="prison"></a>PRISON</h4>
    <p>Caught by the Grand Inquisitor you are thrown in a cell with a friendly 
      <a href="images/zgi030.jpg">poster</a> on the wall. Go to the grill and 
      discover that Jack is somewhere nearby. Pull on the grill nothing happens 
      except that Jack offers you a scroll. Use your letter opener to remove the 
      grill. Look at the scroll in your Frobozz Magic Viewer. Cast the LEXDOM 
      spell on the door and guess what it does. Get the poster from the wall and 
      slide it under the door. Push the key through using the letter opener, pull 
      back the poster and unlock the door using the key. Note the numbers of the 
      cameras. Go behind the control panel and look at the CCTV. If you wait a 
      while you will see Jack waving. Set the controls to his cell number and 
      use the diagram to work out which letters open his cell door. Get it wrong 
      and you die so save your game. </p>
    <p>Solution: The cameras in your block both have the number 43. That is column 
      4 and row 3. Select 43 on the panel and the green light shows indicating 
      the open cell BA. Jack is in block 31. Column 3 and row 1. If you follow 
      the air duct on the map it goes to cell AB. So the controls need to be set 
      to 31AB.</p>
    <h4> <a name="finale"></a>THE FINALE</h4>
    <p>With Jack free he grabs your stuff and meets you at the control panel. 
      <a href="images/zgi031.jpg">Hugh</a> arrives to take you to the Tower. After 
      the meeting Y'Gael again get the artefacts from Hugh and cast the BOOKNIK 
      spell on your spell book. Go to the guard tent and cast VORZER to seal them 
      in. The electric fence is invisible. Try casting MARGI. It is still dangerous 
      so look left and pull out the plug (simple really). Cut the fence and go 
      to the base of the tower.</p>
    <p>You need to place the artefacts in their proper position (deep, middle 
      and high). And become Uber Wizard.</p>
    <p>Stick the Skull of Yoruk in the container at the bottom, The Cube of Foundation 
      halfway up and the Coconut in the balance. Dalboz suggests you put his <a href="images/zgi032.jpg">lamp 
      in the other cup</a>. To bind the magic's cast MAXOV on the disc. There 
      is too much interference - cut the antenna cable with your sword. Jack proves 
      to be no help at all at this point and the Grand Inquisitor joins you at 
      the top. Quickly cast MAXOV on the disc and....</p>
    <p>You are facing a white house. In front of the house is a mailbox...</p>
