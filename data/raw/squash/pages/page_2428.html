<p><b><i>Dr. Bryant Stamford in the kitchen with Anita Curpier, RD.,LD.</i></b>
</p>

<p><font size=2><i>Tasty, healthy food was a given, when exercise physiologist Bryant Stamford and 
registered dietitian Anita Curpier combined households.</i></font></p>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I’ve always been known and praised for knowing my way around the kitchen, but I 
was a nervous wreck preparing for the first meal I would make for Bryant. I had 
seen a picture of him posing with lovely fresh vegetables, which of course, I 
assumed would be turned into a gourmet feast by this handsome health and fitness 
expert.  I could just see and smell him doing this really knockout cooking 
demonstration, using fragrant fresh herbs and yuppy cookware to die for.&nbsp; I 
rarely use cookbooks, other than for general ideas or a starting point, but for 
this auspicious occasion, I felt the need to bring out the “big guns,” and 
settled on a light, healthy New Orleans scrod recipe.&nbsp; I lovingly assembled the 
ingredients in my trusty L.L. Bean canvas tote, and luckily, packed up a few 
important cooking utensils before heading over to prepare the meal, and to see 
if my cuisine could “measure up.”
</p>
<p>
To my surprise, I discovered a scantily clad kitchen, stocked with mountains of 
soy milk, soy powder, bananas and about ten boxes of cereal, that only a 
self-confirmed health nut would go near.
</p>
<p>
The truth was out and our “perfect” relationship was off and running.  He likes 
to learn about, educate the public and eat healthy, great tasting food; I know 
about good food and like to cook it.
</p>

<p>
We try to live a simple, healthy lifestyle, with eating and cooking styles to 
match.  The key to making this work is three fold:  a desire to eat healthy; a 
refrigerator and cupboard stocked with healthy options; and the willingness to 
cook and eat creatively.&nbsp; In other words—a break from the “meat and potatoes” 
syndrome---is a must! 
 </p>
<p>
So go, and enjoy our <b><i>Recipe,</i></b> with our promise that it 
will be quick, easy, and healthy.  Eating and preparing good food is one of 
life’s greatest pleasures.  Our hope is that you’ll enjoy these pleasurable 
flavors as much as we do, without a lot of exhausting preparation and clean 
up.

<h2>It’s A Wrap!</h2>
</center>
<br>

Always on hand at our house are organic flour tortillas. The tortillas come in a 
variety of flavors, ranging from sun-dried tomato basil to white and wheat. They 
are low in fat (1 gram) and are loaded with taste and convenience. I keep 
several varieties on hand, and they stay fresh for several weeks in the 
refrigerator. These wonderful tortillas are like those wardrobe basics we’re 
always reading about-<br>
--you can dress them up several different ways. <br>
<br>
Now for the fun part! You’re limited only by the type of food you keep on hand, 
so here goes. <br>
<br>
Staple Ingredients for Wraps and Burritos---to Keep on Hand:<br>
<img border="0" src="images/wrapfinal.jpg" alt="picture of wrap" align="right" hspace="70" width="227" height="170"><br>
Fresh red, green, yellow bell peppers<br>
Onions<br>
Baby eggplants and summer squash<br>
Fresh tomatoes<br>
Lettuce, deep green leafy variety<br>
Fat free, canned refried beans<br>
Canned black, kidney or garbanzo beans, <br>
Fat free and/or reduced fat shredded cheese<br>
Shredded soy cheese<br>
Herbs and spices: chili Powder, ground cumin, fresh or dried cilantro 
(coriander),<br>
dried rosemary, salt free herb blends, garlic powder and/or fresh cloves, any 
other favorite herbs.<br>
Olive oil, plain or with herb blends<br>
Pesto sauce<br>
Lean chicken, turkey, tuna, tofu and hummus for cold sandwich type wraps<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<h2>Veggie Burrito</h2>
</center>
<br>
I prepare this easy, 20-minute meal in the microwave. It’s loaded with taste and packed with nutrients. Try it instead of fast food when you are on the run. Serves 2-4, depending on appetite. <br>
<img border="0" src="images/burritofinal.jpg" alt="picture of burrito" align="right" hspace="70" width="227" height="170"><br>
4 Organic Flour Tortillas (any flavor)<br>
1 tablespoon Chili Powder<br>
½ teaspoon dried cilantro <br>
1 teaspoon Ground Cumin<br>
¼ teaspoon Garlic Powder<br>
4 teaspoons Olive Oil<br>
1 cup of Cubed Eggplant<br>
1 cup of coarsely chopped onion<br>
1 cup of coarsely chopped sweet peppers (any color)<br>
1 16 oz. Can of black beans, drained and rinsed or fat free refried beans 
(higher in sodium)<br>
8 oz. Bag of fat free cheddar cheese (could substitute reduced fat cheese, or 
shredded soy cheese<br>
with higher fat content if desired)<br>
Fat free sour cream (if desired)<br>
<br>
Wash and cut vegetables. Place them in a large microwave safe 
bowl. Dribble olive oil and sprinkle herb powders over vegetables. If desired, 
additional seasoning can be added, including dried pepper blends. Fresh minced 
garlic and chopped cilantro also add zest!<br>
Cover with microwave safe, vented wrap and microwave vegetables to a crunchy 
doneness.<br>
Assemble tortillas in a microwave safe pan. Add either 1/4 can whole beans or 
fat free refried beans to bottom of tortilla. Divide drained vegetables between 
tortillas. If using fresh chopped cilantro, add now. Sprinkle each burrito with 
a ½ cup cheese.<br>
Microwave on medium power until cheese is melted. Serve with salsa and/or fat 
free sour cream. Makes 4 servings.<br>

<br>
Other ideas for wraps:<br>
<br>
*Fill a pesto and garlic tortilla with soy or low fat cheese, a handful of fresh 
spinach and a <br>
teaspoon of pesto sauce. Microwave until the cheese is melted.<br>
<br>
*For the less adventuresome eater, fill a white tortilla with fat free refried 
beans, low fat cheese, and<br>
a little salsa. Microwave until cheese is melted. <br>
<br>
*Quesadillas are easy fare. Top a tortilla of choice with low fat jack cheese or 
soy pepper cheese , <br>
jalapenos, and cooked onion and peppers. Cook in hot skillet or in oven until 
cheese is melted.<br>
<br>
*Use your favorite cold sandwich fillings (even tofu) and simply roll up!
