Cook the pumpkin in enough boiling water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes, until tender. Drain and reserve the cooking liquid. Mash the pumpkin and set aside. In a large pot, melt the butter over moderate heat and saute the tomato, onion, carrot, and ham for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the flour and stir to combine well. Add the reserved pumpkin stock, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer covered for 45 minutes. Add the mashed pumpkin, salt, pepper, and milk and bring to a boil. Remove the bay leaf and thyme sprig. Serves 4 to 6.
