        court built outside England</b></font> was built at St. Paul's School 
        (SPS) , in Concord, New Hampshire. The date: November 1884.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <img src="../../photos/history/zug/sps_shield.gif" width="41" height="48" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">It 
        was the work of one man, James Potter Conover. The oldest of nine children, 
        Jay Conover graduated from St. Paul's in 1876 and after going to Columbia, 
        he returned to teach at St. Paul's until 1915. With his steel-blue eyes 
        and infectiously upbeat manner, Conover was a SPS institution. He married 
        Mary Coit, the daughter of Henry Coit , the first rector of St. Paul's, 
        became an ordained Episcopalan priest and wrote two books.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> But his greatest influence was in sports. 
        Conover was one of the most celebrated athletes of his era in the U.S. 
        As a high jumper he was the first man to ever jump higher than his height; 
        he led Columbia to notable football victories; a great fencer, he ran 
        the fencing club at SPS; he was the top cricket player at SPS when the 
        sport was the most popular game in New England and batted three-a critical 
        spot-for the school when it played touring sides.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> History, though, remembers Conover for 
        a visit he made to Montreal during the Christmas holidays in 1880-1881. 
        A skating enthusiast, Conover saw an early version of ice hockey and brought 
        back to St. Paul's rules and standards, hockey sticks and a wooden block 
        an inch thick covered with leather, soon to be called pucks. Ice hockey 
        was unknown in the U.S., so St. Paul's is rightfully regarded at the birthplace 
        of hockey for America. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img src="../../photos/history/zug/saintpauls2.jpg" width="275" height="206" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">While 
        in Canada, Conover also played racquets at the St. George Street court 
        in Montreal. He had played a fair amount of racquets while in New York 
        and, after 1878, was a spirited member of the Racquet Court Club, which 
        had a covered court at its clubhouse at 26th Street and Sixth Avenue (the 
        building is still there). Playing the game again in Montreal, which had 
        first built its racquets court in 1836, Conover remembered the delicious 
        pleasure of smashing a ball against four walls. He decided St. Paul's 
        should have a court.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> It took two years, but in January 1883, 
        St. Paul's finished a racquets building. Conover went back to Canada in 
        the autumn of 1881 and hired a contractor from Montreal to build his racquets 
        courts. Placed on the edge of the woods near a pond, the barn-like building, 
        as Conover wrote, "has no pretensions to beauty and grace of outline." 
        Made entirely of maple and birch and painted dark red, it was about sixty 
        by fifty feet, with a steeply-pitched roof of seventy feet, "so as not 
        to allow snow to accumulate upon it" and block the sun. It had four large 
        windows on the front and one giant skylight. Inside were a large vestibule 
        heated by a stove, with a carpeted dressing room partitioned off on one 
        side and a small gallery above and two racquets courts painted white. 
        </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The building cost three thousand dollars 
        and Conover formed a Racquet Club to pay for it. Thirty-five students 
        paid fifty dollars to join, and Conover secured donations totalling over 
        a thousand dollars from a number of Racquet Court Club members in New 
        York. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Getting going took a while. Conover ordered 
        two hundred dollars worth of racquets and balls from Arthur Pearson in 
        London, but they were detained for months at the customs house in New 
        York (did the customs officials think they were dangerous weapons?). The 
        court was awkwardkly lit, by windows just on one side and by one skylight 
        and the white walls were too bright in full sunlight. And it was annoying 
        to laboriously slap black paint on all the racquet balls. Conover painted 
        the inside walls black, which "proved to be a great improvement." Then, 
        over the summer of 1883, the walls and floor warped and had to be replaced. 
        The building found itself being used by non-racquets players. In 1884 
        the fencing club moved their boxes of equipment into the racquet building, 
        "so that the members can fence while awaiting their turns to play" racquets, 
        and in 1887 the school newspaper reported that Mr. Morley, the cricket 
        coach, kept his stock of cricket, base-ball and tennis good for sale in 
        the racquet building. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">But they soldiered on and played. They had 
        a series of tournaments each winter and began in the<img src="../../photos/history/zug/saintpauls1.jpg" width="200" height="267" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"> 
        spring of 1883 to crown champions (Conover's son Dick won the championship 
        in 1889). One of the tournaments was "The Lenten Tournament" which ran 
        throughout Lent, with one round each week, with a prize going to the boy 
        who won the most games. Other tournaments were handicapped acording to 
        ability, and they also had a draw for younger boy. Each Christmas holiday, 
        the school held a tournament at the Racquet Court Club in New York, with 
        sometimes fifteen boys participating.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> Was it actually racquets? Not really. A 
        racquets court was, and still is, made out of slate or concrete, something 
        hard, not wood. And one single regulation-size racquets court was about 
        the size of the entire racquets building, so their two courts were much 
        smaller. "The larger court and faster walls and floor give a great advantage 
        to the large boys," recorded the SPS monthly newspaper after the 1885 
        SPS tournament in New York.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> But it was not squash, because that came 
        separately. In November 1884, the school newspaper reported that "the 
        'Squash-ball' courts are ready for play. They are open to all who pay 
        the dues of $1 a year." They are bona fide squash courts because they 
        were designed by a Harrow old boy</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> In 1930, just after Allison Danzig published 
        his definitive The Racquet Game, a history of tennis, racquets and squash 
        in the U.S., a row developed because Danzig had all but ignored the history 
        of racquets and squash at St. Paul's. This was problematic especially 
        because the SPS racquets courts were the first in the U.S. built outside 
        New York and that the school had the first squash courts in the nation. 
        Conover, then seventy-three, retired and living in Rhode Island, wrote 
        a long letter to a fellow St. Paul's alum who was helping give Danzig 
        a proper account of SPS athletic history. "I got the proper dimensions 
        from Hyde Clark of Cooperstown, NY," wrote Conover of the squash courts. 
        "Hyde had been educated at Harrow in England where they had such courts, 
        and he and I were at Columbia together and both members of the N.Y. Racquet 
        Club and both enthusiastic for racquets and cricket." There is the missing 
        link-Hyde Clark had played squash in the Rugby fives courts at Harrow. 
        Via his friendship with Jay Conover, squash crossed the Atlantic. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Harrow was indeed the model for the four 
        courts. They were badly lit, with no skylights and the back walls were 
        missing. "It is proposed," wrote Conover in the school newspaper, "if 
        the players are incommoded with snow, to inclose the ends with wired glass." 
        The ball was a dark grey rubber ball with a hole in it. And racquets were 
        still considered the proper senior sport. The winner of the spring Lenten 
        tournment in squash was automatically enrolled in the Racquet Club, but 
        other boys had to prove themselves skilled enough in squash to graduate 
        to playing racquets. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Still Conover recommended squash as a sport 
        for schoolboys. "In such a court, the game is not quite so enticing as 
        where the walls are of brick and the ball solid, like a small base-ball," 
        he wrote in the school newspaper. "But the so-called 'squash-ball court' 
        recommended itself to the club for many reasons;-such courts are largely 
        used in English public schools; cost of contruction is much less; fewer 
        raquette bats are broken and fewer balls destroyed; fewer heads are cracked 
        and fewer knees and elbows barked; the danger from being hit by the ball 
        (quite an item among young players) is cancelled." </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">In 1915 St. Paul's, with a generous donation 
        from Maurice Roche, class of 1905 and grandfather of Lady Diana Spencer, 
        built a new squash facility. It had eight squash courts, all, interestingly 
        enough thirty by twenty-one feet, a size more common then in England that 
        the U.S.-but the reason was simply that the courts were designed and built 
        by the London firm H. M. Rootham, which had built the famous courts at 
        the Royal Artillery Mess in Woolwich. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">With its unmatched tradition in squash, 
        it was no surprise that a flood of champions flashed from St. Pauls. The 
        brothers Pool, Larry and Beek, and Bert Rawlins took two national championships 
        in the 1920s and 30s. And more illustrious names followed: John Humes, 
        Seymour and Nordy Knox, Pete Bostwick, Larry Terrell, Charlie Stewart, 
        Jamie Barrett, Robbie MacKay, John Musto and Mac Carbonell. </font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">And the 1884 courts? St. Paul's tore them 
        down in 1915 and today at the spot is an unmarked carpet of thick green 
        grass. </font>
