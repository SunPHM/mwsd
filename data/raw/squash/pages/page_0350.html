Squash - the Vegetable, not the Game<BR><BR>

Many people do not like squash.  What a treat they are missing.  Squash is a winner on all counts - taste, nutrition, cost and versatility.<BR><BR>  

Squash is native to the Western Hemisphere and is a member of the gourd family.  There is evidence of squash being eaten in Mexico as far back as 5500 BC and in South America over 2000 years ago.  Squash varies greatly in size, shape and color.  There are two categories of squash - summer squash and winter squash.<BR><BR>

Summer squash have thin, edible skins and soft seeds.  This tender vegetable has a high water content, mild flavor and can be eaten raw or cooked.  Crookneck, pattypan and zucchini are widely available varieties of summer squash.    Winter squash have hard, thick skins and seeds.  The flesh is deep yellow to orange and is firmer than that of summer squash.  Winter squash varieties include acorn, buttercup, butternut, hubbard, spaghetti and pepper. <BR><BR> 

Though most varieties are available year round, summer squash is best in the summer and winter squash is best from early fall through the winter.  Choose squash that are free of blemishes or moldy spots.  The hard skin of the winter squash protects the flesh and allows it to be stored longer than summer squash.  It does not require refrigeration and can be kept in a cool, dark place for several months, depending on the variety and the storage conditions.<BR><BR>

In the garden, squash are easy to grow.  They love heat and need lots of space.  They like well drained soil with plenty of manure or compost.  They also need lots of moisture, so put a good layer of mulch around them.  If you composted last year's squash seeds, you may get some rogue plants growing so it's a good idea to grow a different variety in the garden.<BR><BR>  

Nutritionally, squash are excellent sources of vitamin A and fibre.  Squash and pumpkin's bright orange color signals the presence of plenty of carotenoids which have been shown to help fight cancer, colds, immune diseases and night blindness.  Squash also contains calcium and potassium.<BR><BR>  

In the kitchen, winter squash can be cooked by various methods but probably the easiest is to cut them in half, scoop out the seeds, put a little butter and some brown sugar or maple syrup in the hollow and bake them.  Consult a cookbook for specific instructions.  Once baked, the flesh can be scooped out, mashed and used in a variety of ways.   You can serve it as is or it can be combined with mashed potatoes in a casserole, sprinkled with grated cheese and put under the broiler for a few minutes.  Squash can also be used in baking for muffins or quick breads.  You can freeze leftovers for another meal. Squash can sometimes be stringy and my favourite recipe for using stringy squash is the following Squash and Apple Soup.  To make this soup even more healthful, I put in a container of soft tofu.  The tofu is optional and leaving it out will not affect the texture or flavor of the soup but I would strongly urge you to include it as it is an excellent way to introduce tofu into your diet.  You could also substitute onions for the leeks.<BR><BR>

2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	medium winter squash (cooked)<BR>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	potato peeled and diced<BR>
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	cups chicken stock<BR>

<BR><BR>
In a large saucepan, heat oil and cook leeks until tender.  Add remaining ingredients except squash, tofu and cheese.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer gently until vegetables are cooked.  Remove from heat.  Add squash and tofu.  Allow mixture to cool slightly and then purée.  If soup is too thick, add additional stock or water.  Reheat gently.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle each serving with cheese.  Makes 6 to 8 servings.
