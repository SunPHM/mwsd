<h3> <b>Introduction</b> </h3>
<p align="left">If you have poor garden soil, limited space, not enough sun in
   the garden area, or impaired mobility, you may want to grow 
vegetables in containers.
   Containers allow you to have a movable garden with the opportunity 
for a limited
   vegetable supply, or a supplemental source of vegetables that are difficult
   to locate for purchase. Container gardening also affords better 
pest management
   and a chance to have color in areas where you want it. Container 
vegetable gardening
   is also a great way to introduce children to gardening.
<p align="left">The downside of container gardening is that 
containers need frequent
   watering. Since the root system is restricted by the size of the container,
   some plants may produce smaller fruit, and some vegetables don't grow well in
   containers. Vegetables that grow well in containers are those with a confined
   habit of growth, such as salad greens, spinach, eggplant, Swiss chard, beets,
   radish, carrots, peppers, bush beans, determinate tomatoes, bush varieties of
   summer squash and cucumbers, green onions, and many herbs. It isn't 
that other
   vegetables can't be grown, but that they may not be as suitable for container
   culture.
<h3> <b>Types of Containers</b> </h3><img src="images/1647_1.jpg" 
width="238" height="162" align="right" border=1>
<p align="left">There are two main types of container materials, non-porous and
   porous. Examples of non-porous containers are glazed pots and those made of
   plastic, metal, and glass. Clay is the primary type of porous material. Wood
   and pressed fiber pots are considered semi-porous. When determining the type
   of container you want to use, consider the frequency of watering 
required, weight,
   and cost. Incidentally, decorative pots without drainage holes are unsuitable
   for container gardening.
<p align="left">There are a number of different container shapes, 
including half
   barrels, whiskey barrels, tubs, boxes, pots, and 5-gallon pails. 
Wooden containers
   are often lined with plastic to slow the deterioration of the wood. At least
   four drainage holes are recommended in the bottom of each container. You may
   drill them yourself if a purchased container doesn't have an adequate size or
   number of drainage holes.
<p align="left">In terms of the correct container size for the 
vegetable you are
   growing, the general rule of thumb is, &quot;the bigger the 
better.&quot; Plant
   roots need plenty of room in order to produce the kind of results 
you want from
   your container garden. Many vegetables don't do well if their roots 
are restricted,
   and plants won't be as vigorous nor as productive. This is 
especially true for
   cucumbers and squashes. When gardeners have trouble with their 
container-grown
   vegetable plants, even if they've fertilized, watered and done 
everything else
   correctly, the problem can usually be traced to the fact that the 
plant's roots
   had a restricted root environment for optimal growth and production. In the
   vegetable variety list at the end of this fact sheet, suggested pot sizes are
   included for each vegetable.
<p align="left">Tomatoes produce best in containers of at least 
20&quot; or 22&quot;
   diameter, peppers grow best in 16&quot; diameter pots, and vining 
crops require
   a 20&quot; or larger container. Greens, such as lettuce and 
spinach, have shallow
   roots and thus do well in broader, flatter containers. Another way 
to approach
   this is to think in terms of one to two gallon container capacities 
for peppers,
   chard and dwarf tomatoes, while four to five gallons per plant is 
best for tomatoes,
   cucumbers, squash, and eggplants.
<h3> <b>Potting Mixes</b> </h3>
<p align="left">A container potting mix needs to provide water, nutrients, and
   support for the plant(s), and should be well-aerated, well-drained, 
and lightweight.
   Do not use 100% garden soil (often clay soil), which is too heavy, dense, and
   compact. It dries out rapidly, may be too acid or too alkaline, and 
may contain
   fungal pathogens, weed seeds, or disease organisms.
<p align="left">Use either a soilless mix or soil mix for your 
container.<b> Soilless
   mixes</b> are readily available commercially, and include Jiffy 
Mix<sup>&#174;</sup>,
   Bacto<sup>&#174;</sup>, Promix<sup>&#174;</sup> and Jiffy 
Pro<sup>&#174;</sup>.
   These mixes are made up of peat moss, vermiculite, and either coarse sand or
   wood products. Vermiculite holds several times its weight in water 
and nutrients,
   and keeps container mixes moist. The soilless mixes are lightweight and may
   be the best choice if the container is to be moved frequently. A<b> 
soil mix</b>
   is often made up of one part sphagnum peat moss or compost, one 
part pasteurized
   soil, one part vermiculite or perlite, and some composted cow 
manure. Soil mixes
   tend to hold water better than soilless mixes.
<p align="left">The size of the container you chose will depend on the mature
   size of the plant it will contain. A plant will stop growing and 
become stunted
   if it is growing in too small a container. Examples of plants and recommended
   container volumes are:

<p align="left">&nbsp;
<h3 align="left"> <b>Planting</b> </h3>
<p align="left">Plant vegetable transplants or seeds as you would 
plant normally
   in a ground bed. Tomato plants can be placed deeper in the pot (one-third to
   one-half deeper) and the stem covered with soil to stimulate root development
   along the stem.
<p align="left">Your container vegetables will likely need support. 
Tomato cages
   can be used for smaller tomato plants, peppers, and cucumbers. Cone 
or pyramid-shaped
   trellises usually work better than flat types. You can make a cage 
from concrete
   reinforcing wire or lighter weight fencing material. All types of stakes work
   well to give vegetable plants support. A few stakes can be placed around the
   perimeter of the pot to form a teepee.
<p align="left">Before you plant, put landscape cloth or screen in the bottom
   of the pot to retain the soil mix. Some gardeners like to use foam peanuts or
   crushed aluminum cans in the bottom third of a pot. This reduces 
the pot's weight,
   however, the downside is that there is less soil available to the roots, and
   end of season clean-up is somewhat more complicated. After planting, no more
   than one inch of mulch can be added to the soil surface to retain 
moisture and
   moderate high summer temperatures.
<p align="left">If you plan to move large, heavy containers around, 
rolling platforms
   can be placed under them to aid in moving them. These may be 
purchased or made
   at home.
<h3 align="left"> <b>Fertilizer</b> </h3>
<p align="left">There are two types of fertilizers: timed-release and 
water soluble.
   Both are needed for container vegetable growing success. Slow or 
timed-release
   is added at planting time, and should be thoroughly incorporated 
into the soil
   mix. Look for a complete, balanced type such as a 10-10-10, 
13-13-13 or 14-14-14
   formulation. Osmocote<sup>&#174;</sup> in a 14-14-14 formulation is just one
   example of a slow-release fertilizer that can be used. The ratio of 
this fertilizer
   to soil mix is 1/2 tablespoon of fertilizer to one gallon of soil mix. Thus,
   a 3 gallon container would need 1 1/2 tablespoons of fertilizer, a 5 gallon
   would need 2 1/2 tablespoons, and so on.
<p align="left">Water soluble fertilizers are added about mid-season when the
   plants begin to produce. This additional fertilizer is needed 
because most potting
   mixes don't retain nutrients very well, the plant's roots are restricted and
   thus somewhat stressed, and watering leaches nitrogen out of the 
soil. Peters<sup>&#174;</sup>
   20-20-20 or Miracle Gro<sup>&#174;</sup> 15-30-15 are just a couple 
of the water
   soluble types that work well for container gardening. Some 
experienced container
   vegetable gardeners have success with a &quot;super bloom&quot; 
type of fertilizer,
   one with a high phosphorus content to stimulate blooms and subsequent fruits.
   If you want to experiment with this type of fertilizer, look for a 10-50-10
   or 19-59-9 analysis. These water soluble fertilizers should be 
mixed at a slightly
   weaker rate than the label recommends and added once every week or two.
<h3 align="left"> <b>Watering</b> </h3>
<p align="left">Container plants are exposed to the extremes of weather more so
   than plants in ground beds. Wind and scorching sun will increase the need for
   watering. Water-holding gels (starch-based gels that retain water, 
called &quot;hydrogels&quot;)
   can be incorporated in the soil mix before it is put in the container. They
   swell with moisture and release it when needed; they could perhaps prevent a
   second watering on a hot day. Even with hydrogels or other organic amendments
   designed to hold water, containers may need daily watering on a very hot day,
   and some may need water twice a day.
<p align="left">If a plant is allowed to become too dry, the feeder roots are
   damaged. When finally watered, the plant's energy is used to grow new feeder
   roots and not for flowering or fruit growth, resulting in a stressed plant.
<p align="left">If watered too heavily or too frequently during the 
summer, most
   of the soil nutrients can be washed out the bottom of the 
container. Gauge the
   moisture need of the soil mix by sticking your finger or a Popsicle 
stick into
   the soil; if the soil sticks to your finger or the Popsicle stick, 
water isn't
   needed. You can also lift the container to determine if it needs water; after
   planting, gauge the weight of the container dry. Then water, and 
gauge the weight
   of the container when wet.
<p align="left">Mulches can be placed on top of the soil mix to reduce moisture
   loss. Compost, straw, pine needles, grass clippings, shredded bark, and leaf
   mold are examples of acceptable mulches. Move containers to shady areas for
   part of the day to reduce moisture loss. Drip irrigation can be 
used for watering,
   and tenting the plant with a row-covering type of fabric can shade the plant
   from the hot sun.
<h3 align="left"> <b>Additional Maintenance</b> </h3>
<p align="left">Maintenance can be reduced by good siting of 
containers, choosing
   plants suitable for container culture, choosing plants with known 
pest resistance,
   and proper and timely maintenance. Container vegetables need to be 
checked daily,
   and will probably require more maintenance than vegetables grown in 
the ground.
   Check daily for insects, mites, and signs of disease, and implement 
integrated
   pest management practices if needed.
<h3 align="left"> <b>End of the Season Clean Up</b> </h3>
<p align="left">At the end of the season, discard the entire contents of each
   pot; don't even add debris and potting mix to the compost pile. Do not reuse
   the mix the following season; you do not want to run the risk of 
spreading diseases
   that may be present in the mix or on the plant debris. Also, the potting mix
   has been depleted of nutrients. Scrub each container and disinfect it with a
   10 percent chlorine bleach solution.
<p align="left">Most non-porous containers may be left outside over the winter,
   although you may want to store them in your garage or basement to keep them
   clean. Porous clay containers should be brought inside to prevent 
cracking due
   to freezing temperatures.
<h3 align="left"> <b>Suggested Vegetable Varieties for Container 
Growing</b> </h3>
<p align="left"> The following is a list of suggested varieties for vegetable
   container growing in the Midwest. This is not an exhaustive compilation. You
   may find other varieties that will do just as well. The important 
thing to remember
   when seeking suitable varieties is to look for those described as 
&quot;bush&quot;
   or &quot;compact&quot; in growth habit, and any varieties that have 
been especially
   bred or hybridized for container growing. </p>
