<strong>Bacterial speck and spot (tomatoes)</strong>- black specks or raised scab-like <A HREF="../graphics/large/bac_spot_tomato2_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalA', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalA">spots</A> on tomato fruits.  These diseases are seed borne and may over-winter in soil and plant debris.  Favored by wet, cool conditions.  Rogue out infected plants.  Buy clean, disease-fee seed from a reputable supplier.  If seed has not been chemically or heat-treated, soak seed for five minutes in one pint of water and add two ounces of bleach.  Rinse seeds thoroughly with clean, cool water and dry thoroughly.</p>

<p><strong>Bean and <A HREF="../graphics/large/bac_blight_peas_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalB', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalB">pea blights</a> (bacterial)</strong>- Halo blight causes small dead spots on leaves surrounded by yellow halos.  Spots on pods produce a cream colored ooze when the weather is humid.  Cool, wet weather promotes the spread of this disease.  <A HREF="../graphics/large/com_bac_blight_bean_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalC', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalC">Common bean blight</A> causes large, water-soaked light green <A HREF="../graphics/large/com_bac_blight_bean3_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalD', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalD">spots</A> on <A HREF="../graphics/large/com_bac_blight_bean2_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalE', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalE">leaves</A> that later turn brown.  Water soaked spots appear on pods and may produce a yellowish ooze in wet weather.   Bacterial brown spot  causes small reddish brown spots with distinct margins on leaves and pods.  Use a three-year crop rotation for beans.
</p>  
<p><strong>Other pea blights</strong> - several fungal diseases (including <A HREF="../graphics/large/anthracnose_lima_pods_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalF', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalF">anthracnose</A> and ascochyta blight) will also cause spots and sunken lesions on pea pods.
</p>
<p><strong>Gray mold (beans)</strong> - gray colored powdery mold on pods.
</p>
<p><strong>Phomopsis blight (<A HREF="../graphics/large/phomopsis_eggplant_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalC', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalC">eggplant</A>)</strong> - a common fungal disease that produces light tan circular lesions on foliage causing leaves to turn yellow and then brown.  Sunken spots that are tan to brown in color then form on fruits.  These spots enlarge under moist, warm conditions causing fruits to rot.  Remove infected fruit immediately.  Plant disease-free seed and lay a thick organic mulch under and around plants a few weeks after transplanting in the spring.
</p>
<p><strong>Scab (<A HREF="../graphics/large/scab_potato_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalD', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalD">potato</A>, beet; also carrot, parsnip, turnip, and radish)</strong> - circular, corky, raised lesions on the tuber or root surface.  Encouraged by soil pH above 5.5.  Bacterial disease that overwinters in soil and infected roots and tubers.  Spots are superficial and do not affect eating quality once they are removed.  Use resistant potato cultivars and disease-free planting stock.
</p>
<p><strong>Soft rots (<A HREF="../graphics/large/bac_rot_pepper_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalE', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalE">pepper</A>, onion, tomato, melons, cucumber)</strong> -  several different bacterial and fungal pathogens will cause soft rots.  These rots are often associated with earlier insect injury or disease problems, overly mature edible plant parts, contact between soil and edible plant part, and wet, humid weather. 
<strong>Black rot (pumpkin, winter squash, gourds) and gummy stem blight (muskmelon, cucumber, watermelon)</strong> - this is a single disease that produces two sets of symptoms depending on the affected crop.  Dark brown or black spots will appear on fruits that may be dry or wet in appearance.
</p>  
<p><strong>Viruses (bean, <A HREF="../graphics/large/virus_peas_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalF', 'width=320,height=420,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalF">pea</A>,<A HREF="../graphics/large/tomato_spot_wilt_pepper_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalG', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalG">pepper</a>, cucurbits (<A HREF="../graphics/large/virus_pumpkin_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalH', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalH">pumpkin</A>, <A HREF="../graphics/large/squash_virus_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalI', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalI">summer squash</A>), <A HREF="../graphics/large/tomato_spot_wilt_fruit_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalJ', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalJ">tomato</A></strong> - many different viruses can cause mottling or <A HREF="../graphics/large/watermelon_mosaic_squash_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalK', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalK">variegation of fruits</A> (alternate dark green and light green or yellow streaks).  Viral symptoms are usually first observed on foliage (see "Leaves").  If viral symptoms extend to edible plant parts, the entire plant needs to be removed and discarded.

<p><strong>Yeast spot or seed pitting</strong> - Various stink bugs and plant bugs feed on lima bean pods by inserting their mouthparts and removing cell contents.  The small puncture wounds are very small and may go un-noticed.  These wounds can allow entry by disease organisms, especially a yeast, Hematospora coryli.  <A HREF="../graphics/large/stinkbug_lima_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalL', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalL">Infected seeds</A> developing inside lima bean pods may discolor, shrivel and rot. These symptoms may not be observed until after seeds are blanched in preparation for freezing.  The only means of controlling this disease is to prevent insect injury.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#00FFFF">Management:</font></strong></p>
<p>Most of the diseases affecting fruits are encouraged by wet, humid, cloudy conditions, poor soil drainage, close plant spacing and poor air circulation, wind, and contact with garden implements and hands.  Here's how you can minimize disease problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>plant resistant cultivars</li>
<li>buy disease free seed and transplants</li>
<li>plant in well drained soil or on raised beds</li>
<li>lay down an organic mulch (dried grass clippings, newspaper covered with grass clippings or straw, shredded leaves) to prevent soil splashing of pathogens onto leaves and fruits and prevent soil-fruit contact</li>
<li>provide adequate space between plants</li>
<li>prevent physical injury to fruits, especially contact with soil</li>
<li>water around the base of plants</li>
<li>avoid working in the garden when plants are wet</li>
<li>harvest regularly; don't let fruits become overly mature</li>
<li>cut off and discard diseased leaves and pull up and discard entire plants that are badly infected by disease</li>
<li>pick-off and remove diseased fruits </li>
<li>clean up and disposing of all plant residues; shred and compost plant residues thoroughly at temperatures that exceed 120° F.  However, plants infected with devastating diseases like white rot of alliums, late blight of tomatoes and potatoes, fusarium of basil and tomatoes, should be bagged up and thrown out with the garbage</li>
<li>do not save seeds from infected plants</li>
</ul>
