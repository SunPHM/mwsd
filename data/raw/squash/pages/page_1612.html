                Bounces?&#8221;</p>
              <p class="bodycopy"> My best mate Matt lived next door to me in 
                Dubbo. We walked to school together (on those days that we bothered 
                to go), hung about in the afternoons, and spent most of our weekends 
                together. Each morning, Matt would jump over the fence between 
                our houses, let himself in the back door, and use my hairspray 
                (it was the &#8216;80s, after all). My dad was a pharmacist, so 
                I had an endless supply of wanky hair products.</p>
              <p class="bodycopy">My hair was dyed jet black and Matt's was bleached 
                pure white. People called us 'salt and pepper'. I remember Matt 
                had to put a little bit of the blue dye that old ladies use to 
                cover their grey in order to get his hair that whiter-than-white 
                colour. We both used to do our hair by placing a book on our heads 
                (Asterix or Tintin books were the right size) and then blow-drying 
                the hair up into the book while emptying half a can of hairspray. 
                After peeling the book off (trying not to rip out too much hair) 
                we peered through the sticky mist into the mirror and made sure 
                we'd achieved just the right amount of &#8216;80s style.</p>
              <p> <span class="bodycopy"><img src="/wilbur/asterix_in_britian.jpg" width="204" height="276"><br>
                </span><span class="smallprint">Unlikely Gallic &#8216;80s Hair 
                Care Accessory.<br>
                The lost Fall album.</span></p>
              <p class="bodycopy">Matt used to spend most of his time over at 
                my place. I could understand why. His family were&#8230; interesting. 
                I once went next door to visit him and was greeted by his Mum 
                breast-feeding her daughter. Don't get me wrong &#8211; breast-feeding 
                is perfectly natural, but it can be a bit unsettling when you're 
                fourteen and it's your best mate's Mum doing the feeding. Especially 
                if she then proceeds to take a pot-shot at you in some sort of 
                bizarre breast-milk/water pistol attack.</p>
              <p class="bodycopy">We were pretty tight, Matt and me. Most days 
                after school, we'd hang about together at my place doing the usual 
                stuff - listening to music, watching TV, and playing games. Music 
                was the Jesus and Mary Chain, The Cramps, and The Sex Pistols. 
                TV was whatever was on. The games were C64 &#8211; Paradroid, 
                Crazy Comets and a bizarre little gem called Bounces. Bounces 
                had that something extra. I suspect it was a pirate copy because 
                I remember Matt and me had to work out what you were meant to 
                do without a manual. And Bounces took some working out.</p>
              <p> <span class="bodycopy"><img src="/wilbur/kajagoogoo.jpg" width="401" height="301"><br>
                </span><span class="smallprint">Hair &#8211; big in the &#8216;80s.</span></p>
              <p class="bodycopy">The game took place in a sealed, squash-like 
                court with a side-on view of two opponents - a knight and a viking, 
                each equipped with a short sword. The game started when a ball 
                was launched into the court. The ball would start to bounce around 
                in a computery, Breakout style, and you had to avoid the ball 
                or, even better, catch it and throw it at your opponent. If the 
                ball hit you then your opponent got a point. If you managed to 
                get close enough to stab your opponent you also got a point. This 
                was made harder because you were attached to the wall by a big 
                bungee band. If you stood still for any length of time, the rubber 
                band would drag you back to the wall. I am not making this up.</p>
              <p> <span class="bodycopy"><img src="/wilbur/bounces.gif" width="250" height="165"><br>
                </span><span class="smallprint">Lest we don&#8217;t quite remember.</span></p>
              <p class="bodycopy">I can't remember if Bounces had a single-player 
                option - and if it did, I can't remember ever playing it alone. 
                It was one of those games that you absolutely had to play with 
                a friend. If you were the viking, your opponent was a chinless, 
                spoilt, upper-class git. If you were the knight, your opponent 
                was an in-bred, unwashed, uneducated peasant. You'd laugh, swear, 
                win, lose, win again, lose again, blame the joystick, slam the 
                joystick on the table, and eventually, reluctantly, put the joystick 
                down when the third and final warning to come to dinner was heard. 
                It was one of those equally infuriating and hilarious experiences 
                that has you swinging from anger to pant-wetting laughter in a 
                heartbeat. Exactly the kind of experience that brings people closer 
                together.</p>
              <p class="bodycopy">Matt and I had a falling out about fifteen years 
                ago. I can't even remember what caused it. We still bump into 
                each other through mutual friends, and we&#8217;re polite, but 
                there's nothing there any more. Or, if there is, it's that poisonous 
                simmering resentment that only exists between fallen-out friends. 
                So far, neither of us has been big enough to say: &quot;For fuck's 
                sake! Let's just get over it, already!&quot;.</p>
              <p class="bodycopy">Maybe I should take the initiative. I've thought 
                of a great opening gambit: &quot;Hey Matt, Remember Bounces?&quot;</p>
