11.30.01 : (stopgap - pizza) midnight snack - sweet potato gnocchi in sauce
(fresh tomato, canned peeled tomato, bacon, shallot, garlic, sausage, sherry,
rum, butter, half and half, sage, salt, pepper)<p>
11.29.01 : the 9 o'clock sage run - chicken saltimbocca, sauteed spinach with
prosciutto, sweet potato gnocchi in butter-parmesan-sage sauce<p>

11.28.01 : italian sausage in wine, fennel braised in turkey stock, bruschetta<p>
11.27.01 : home-made sweet potato gnocchi in butter-sage-parm sauce with
grilled chicken and spinach salad
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>sweet potato gnocchi</i><p>
4 sweet potatoes, about 2-3 c flour, 1 t salt, 1 egg, some patience

for a first try, these were pretty stinkin good.  we saved half and froze
them, so we'll see how they are when we're not so emotionally attached.
<p>
boil or bake the potatoes, the remove skins and put through a food mill.  in a
bowl or on a counter, lay out the potatoes in a mound, cover with about 5/6 of
the flour, and create a well in the middle, where you put the egg and salt.
go around the well, incorporating the potato and flour, and when it's all
kinda mixed, start kneading.  here's the maddening part: if it sticks to you,
don't worry, it won't take over your soul.  add flour.  we added flour for
days until it was somewhat dry to the touch, and we'd been kneading it for
more than the alloted 4 minutes.  role into snakes (remember 1st grade?) about
3/4 of an inch in diameter, then cut into pieces that are smaller than you
want the eventual product to be.  take each piece and, placing it on a fork,
roll it off with your thumb, creating the trademark ridges.  set aside, get
water boiling, and cook for about 7 minutes, or until they float.  try it,
you'll like it.  half of this amount stuffed us both, cuz they're filling.

11.26.01 : hot and sour soup (see the <i>joy</i>), beef and scallion rolls,
sake, "road to hell" sundae (rocky road ice cream, bailey's, hershey's hot
fudge. good intentions be damned.)<p>
<center><img src="images/beefscallionrolls.jpg" width=300 height=225></center><p>
11.25.01 : old-stuff-in-the-fridge-with-pasta soup <p>
11.24.01 : breakfast for the family - <a href="bpancakes.html">buttermilk
pancakes</a>, hashbrowns, rosti, bacon
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>rosti</i><p>
potatoes, butter, salt
</td><td>
this is one of my favorite swiss dishes - boil the potatoes until about 2/3
done, the cool and shred.  melt some butter in a pan, and add in the potatoes
with a healthy dose of salt, and mix around a bit, then flatten into a round.
fry until golden undderneath, then flip using the
plate-on-top-hold-on-tight-and-flip! method, then slide back into pan with
more butter and fry other side.

(thanksgiving elsewhere... we both made gravy.  strange.)<p>
11.19.01 : roast pork with celery root and potatoes, spinach salad
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>roast pork</i><p>
marinade:  a shot of vermouth, about 1/3 c molasses, about 1/3 of a bottle of
white wine, 1/2 c OJ, juice of a quarter of a lemon, 2 spoonfuls of tamarind,
2 garlic cloves, a few shakes of worchestershire sauce, about 1/2 t sweet
paprika, 1/2 t oregano, salt and pepper
</td><td>
it took us about a half an hour of tasting to come up with this marinade, and
it turned out darned good.<p>
marinade pork overnight, then cook at 250 degree for 2 or 3 hours (depending
on size of loin).  reduce the marinade to a sauce - this is one of the most
rewarding things about cooking meat like this.  sauce is good.
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
11.18.01 : keilbasa sausage, honey beans, bread with olive oil
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>wayne's honey beans</i><p>
2 cans drained cannellini beans, 3 strips of bacon cut into smaller pieces, an
onion, 2 cloves of garlic, some minced ginger, honey, molasses, cider vinegar,
salt and pepper
</td><td>
like baked beans, only on the stovetop, with honey.<p>
in a big frying pan, sautee bacon until crisp, then thro in onions and garlic
and ginger.  add beans and sautee for a bit.  throw in water (one can worth)
and a glug (2 tablespoons or so) each of honey, molasses, and cider vinegar,
plus salt and a healthy dose of pepper.  simmer for about 5-10 minutes.
serves 3-4.  these are especially good the next day.

11.15.01 : charred yellow theme - grilled chicken, "dirty pasta", fennel
gratin (hint: mozzarella is not a good cheese for this, tho it works alright
and it does look pretty), grilled garlic bread
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>dirty pasta</i><p>
a yellow squash, olive oil, butter, parmesan, salt and pepper, penne for two
people
</td><td>
this is so simple and so good.  first you must embrace the char, and say your
char mantra: "om charismifrend iyelikedechar".  then get the pasta water
going.  slice the squash in half and drizzle with oil, then sprinkle on salt
and pepper, and grill face down.  toss in the penne, and when it's done,
you'll want to drain it, put it back in the pot, and throw in about 2 T
butter, grate some parm in, and stir it around.  when the squash is about half
done, you'll want to flip it so that the skin can be exposed to the flame and
charred.  take it to the pasta, slice into slices, and toss in with pasta,
getting the nice charred bits all over everything.  serves, well, two.

11.14.01 : definitely-not-from-a-box pad thai.  yup, not from a box. really,
trust us...<p>
<center><img src="images/benpadthai.jpg" width=300 height=415><br>ben with pad thai</center>
<p>
11.13.01 : shrimp-kielbasa shish-kababs (wooo, alliteration!), roasted beets
and potatoes, grilled garlic bread, romaine with dijon-garlic vinaigrette,
german beer<p>
(incidentally, we did a pepsi challenge with the shrimp: the four permutations
of bbq sauce and shell. we liked sauce with shell still on best - shrinp
stayes moist, and sauce still gives some flavor)
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>roasted beets and potatoes</i><p>
small beets, baby potatoes, smallish red onions, fresh thyme, olive oil, salt
and pepper<p>
<img src="images/shrimpkabobsbeets.jpg" width=200 height=299>
</td><td>
this combo is in the <i>joy</i>, but cooked in three seperate dishes.  phooew
on that.  just take on tray, and if you don't want beet juices on the
potatoes, put down a layer of crinkled aluminum foil on one half for the
elitist spuds.  preheat the oven to 375.  peel the beets and cut into
managable pieces (i halved the small ones we had), do the same with the
potatoes, and place on their respective sides.  quarter the onion and lay down
the middle (here they will intercept some juices and get a neat colored edge).
toss over some olive oil, and sprinkle salt and pepper over everything.  on
the potatoes, place a bit of thyme (the olive oil will help it stick), and
then cover it all with tinfoil.  roast for 40 minutes, then uncover for about
20 more minutes (watch the tops for browning, and test with a fork for
tenderness.  this is about 20 minutes more than the <i>joy</i> indicated, but
it made everything really yummy). servings depend on how many ingredients you
use - 5 of each beets and potatoes was good for 2-3 people.

11.12.01 : tortellini in leftover lasagna suaces, boiled
"post-weekend" asparagus (you figure it out)<p>
11.09.01 : midnight dinner - 5-hour braised leg of lamb, mushroom-sage stuff, 
mashed potatoes, spinach
<p>
"we have the cure for the common cold: a leg of lamb and several bottles of
wine."<p>

11.08.01 : stuffed butternut squash, <a href="iraquirice.html">iraqui rice</a>, 
spinach and kohlrabi salad<p>
11.07.01 : salmon cakes, black beans and rice
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>leftover-salmon cakes</i><p>
two decent-sized salmon fillets encrusted with spices, half a red bell pepper,
about a quarter of an onion, about 2/3 c breadcrumbs, an egg, a splash of
worchestershire, salt and pepper
</td><td>
ever wonder what to do with leftover salmon?  well, now, when you do wonder,
you know what to do.  crumble it up, mix it with the above ingredients (dice
the pepper and onion really small), and form cakes out of it.  sautee first in
a pan with olive oil to brown the sides, then bake at 350 for about ten
minutes.  these were moist and good, despite my lack of hope for resurecting
leftover fish.  if your leftovers don't have spices in them, add some - we had
cumin seed and some other stuff... check out

11.06.01 : dude, lasagna?
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>dude, lasagna?</i><p>
pancetta, italian sausage, ground beef, onion, one cup red wine, one can
crushed tomatoes, oregano (fresh and dried), two smashed cloves garlic, salt
and pepper, <a href="bechamel.html">bechamel sauce</a> with nutmeg, lasagna
noodles, mozzarella, parmesean 
<p>
"we need prophylactics all over our stove."
</td><td>
so we had planned to make pasta with red sauce.  you know, simple, cheap, we
had all the stuff we needed for it.  then i started thinking about ricotta.
looking in the fridge, we didn't have any.  but we did have mozzarella.  "hey
wayne, wanna make lasagna?"  "yah... no... yah.  man, you had to go and take
it to the next level, didn't you."
<p>
start with three pots.  in one, make a red sauce by sauteeing meat and onions,
then deglaze with wine, add oregano and garlic.  when decently reduced, add
salt and pepper to taste.  in another, make bechamel.  in the last, boil
noodles.  layer in noodle, sauce, noodle, bechamel, noodle, sauce, cheeses,
and bake at 375 until it looks good.  remove from oven and let cool for a few
minutes.  makes as much as you want, depending on how many noodles you use -
the sauces can be stretched or saved.
<p>
we rushed this a bit... we could have let the sauces reduce and thicken more,
and we definitely needed more cheese.  use lots of cheese.  that's what
lasagna is: cheese.  remember that.

11.05.01 : chilli with chorizo on jasmine rice

guiness, 8 oz of small red beans (already soaked and drained), a small tomato,
cumin, a big splash of cider vinegar, about 2 T brown sugar, half a small can
of tomato paste
</td><td>
sautee onions and shallots, add chorizo and ground beef, brown, then add
guiness and a bit of water, then add beans and diced tomato.  spice with cumin and salt and
pepper.  when beans are nearly done, add cider vinegar, brown sugar, and
tomato paste, and reduce until you're happy.

11.04.01 : corn chowder<p>
11.03.01: brunch - white wine-dijon-parm omelettes with
spinach-shallot-ricotta, coffee cake, noceccino (cappuccino with nocello, a
walnut-flavored liquor); dinner - heavenly bruscheta (sourdough with honey and
gruyere), chris' "pauper", grilled pizza, grilled stickies with butter pecan 
ice cream
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>an omelette to force feed to your girlfriend</i><p>

"jesus is coming! have some eggs!" - wayne
<p>
sautee spinach in minced shallots and garlic and olive oil, and set aside.
mix eggs, wine, dijon, and parm, salt and pepper, and pour into pan.  when top
side is mostly firm, add filling down the middle and flip over one side.

<i>electra's G-rated f**ked-up coffee cake</i><p>
streusel topping: 2/3 cup flour, 2/3 cup chopped walnuts, 2/3 c brown sugar, 5
T melted butter, 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 t salt<p>
cake: 1 c flour, 2/3 c sugar, 3/4 t baking soda, 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 nutmeg,
1/4 t salt, 1 1/4 c sour cream, 1 t vanilla, 4 T butter, 2 large eggs
</td><td>
"the key is to f**k up." - electra
<p>
so, in the <i>joy</i>, there are two recipes for coffee cake next to each
other.  in the chaos of the kitchen, they got a bit jumbled.  she crossed the
proverbial streams.  you end up with less flour and more sugar, and both sour
cream and spices.  it's pretty darn good.
<p>
put rack in lower part of oven, and preheat to 350.  grease 9x9 pan.  combine
streusel ingredients, leaving large clumps, and set aside. in one bowl, mix
flour (slowly, in three parts), sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt. in
another bowl, mix sour cream, vanilla, butter, and eggs.  mix wet and dry,
pour into pan, and bake for 25-30 minutes, when a toothpick comes out clean
(ya, we finally bought toothpicks).  serve warm

11.02.01 : fried chicken of the gods, mashed potatoes, green beans<p>
11.01.01 : breakfast - crepes (recipe in the <i>joy of cooking</i>) with 
lemon butter, dinner: knockwurst in a toasted pita, asparagoi gratin,
pasta with butter and sage, pinot noir, tawny port
<blockquote><table cellpadding=5 bgcolor=ccff99 border=1><tr><td valign=top>
<i>asparagoi gratin that makes me weep</i><p>
about 30 stalks of skinny asparagus, 6 strips of prosciutto, pepper, <a
href="bechamel.html">bechamel sauce</a> (milk flavored with fennel instead
of onion variation), and three long strips of gruyere
</td><td>
to me the plural of asparagus has always been asparagoi... somehow hanging out
with wayne, a classics major, just does this to you.  "asparagoi" would be the
plural of greek "asparagos", which was later latinized to "asparagus".  as wayne
said, "this is the problem with being who we are..." - we think of this stuff.
anyway...<p>
preheat the oven to 400, and chop the asparagus so that it is just as long as
the small oven dish that you have.  the step that we missed: boil or sautee
the asparagus for a bit, until it is mostly cooked (we didn't do this, so we
had a much crunchier version, which i kinda liked... it offset the richness
of the sauce.  but that is neither here nor there...). wrap five stalks in a piece of prosiutto,
and place in the dish.  grate some black pepper over them, pour over the 
bechamel sauce, then lay strips of gruyere perpendicular to the stalks, and place in the oven with no lid. bake
for about 10 minutes, then broil until the cheese browns a bit.  serve with
tongs, and don't forget to get some of the sauce.  served two.
