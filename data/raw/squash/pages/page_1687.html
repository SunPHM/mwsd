 Hello,and welcome to my web page introducing you to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  I
  chose Albuquerque because I use to live very close to this area and enjoyed its
  atmosphere and nearby activities.  Albuquerque is a very modern city for New Mexico
  and yet it still is able to maintain its "old town" charm.
  <p>If you were to visit Albuquerque this time of the year, you would get a great
  deal on your plane ticket.  The going rate for a ticket flying out of Detroit, MI
  is only $212.00.</P>

 <p>There are two places that I would like to visit again if I got the chance to
  go back.  The first place is the Albuquerque Biological Park.  This park includes
  an aquarium, botanical garden and zoo.  The park caters to the community by offering:
  <ul><li>special lectures for teachers so that they can be better prepared for classroom
  discussions<li>animal encounters where children and adults can meet the animals up
  close and personal<li>special viewings at feeding times<li>a discovery center with
  hands on exhibits<li>much, much more</UL>
  The second place that I would like to go to is Balloon Fiesta Park.  This park is
  home to the International Balloon Fiesta held every October for 9 days.  This past
  year included 850 hot air balloons.  The sky is filled with balloons during mass
  assention.  This is a time when they release all the balloons in a matter of hours so
  that the sky becomes completely filled with color.  The fiesta draws over a million
  spectators each year.  They come to see different competitions involving special shaped
  balloons, accuracy landings and gas balloons.  One team flew their hot air balloon
  1,388 miles.  Better get up early, you wouldn't want to miss out on the fun.</p>

  Albuquerque and its surrounding areas have a lot of historical significance
  with its Anasazi ruins.  Anasazi ruins are remnents of masonry or adobe/stone dwellings
  that served as housing communities for these ancesteral indians.  The Southwest is known for its ancient indian ruins
  and New Mexico is no exception.  Within less than 100 miles there are quite a few
  Anasazi ruins.  Salmon Ruins,Aztec Ruins,and Chaco Canyon are three Pueblo dwellings
  that all involve approximately the same time line.  These ruins were inhabited by
  indian groups between 1100 and 1300 A.D.  The indians were agriculturalists and
  were able to support themselves on growing corn, beans and squash.  They did hunt
  wild game for meat.   Drought and disease were the cause of death
  and abandonment of the ruins.

  Albuquerque is a high desert area that makes it difficult to grow any vegetation
  on.  Frequent flooding conditions also hinder farmers from making this a completely
  agricultural area.  However, industry finds this area the perfect spot.
  <a href="http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</A> employs many people
  in the Albuquerque area.  They are a national security lab operated for the United
  States Department of Energy.  Sandia Labs is responsible for designing non-nuclear
  components for our nations nuclear weapons.  The wide empty spaces of the desert
  make this an ideal place to do testing on a variety of energy research and development
   projects.  Right now they are in the process of redeveloping Pentium Processors
   for satellites and space vehicles.  Sandia National Laboratories sounds like it
   would be an interesting place to work.
   <p>The weather in Albuquerque is very unique.  The valleys and mountains are only
   a short distance away from eachother but can cause temperatures to be a difference
   of 15-20 degrees at times.  For example: the valley can be 40 degrees and partly sunny,
   while the Sandia/Manzano mountains might be 25 degrees and snowing.  My weather
   report highlights the temperatures for downtown Albuquerque.<ol><li>Day 1:Saturday, 47 degrees
   <li>Day 2:Sunday, 55 degrees<li>Day 3:Monday, 53 degrees</OL></P>
