            <p align="left"><span class="red12normal">Balls were constructed of thin rubber and were quite soft. They also had a number of holes in them which caused the ball to collapse when hit hard.</span> <span class="black12bold">This 'squashy" ball along with the "Rackets" connection were probably the origins of the name of "Squash Rackets".</span><span class="blue12text"> From being a sport that was seen as a "second" sport for most of the early part of this century, it quickly spread into a game that is now played </span><span class="red12normal">world wide in over 120 countries.</span>

            <p align="left">
            <p align="left"><span class="grey12normal"><strong class="red12bold">The Court: </strong></span><span class="blue12text">The game of squash is a racket game and is played on an indoors enclosed rectangular court. The singles court is 6.40m wide by 9.75m. The doubles court is almost 50% longer than singles courts and 20% wider. Most squash courts are single courts. Because the squash court is three-dimensional the ball can be bounced off the four walls which surround the floor of the court. The entry door when closed forms part of the back wall. The floor consists of parallel hardwood planks.</span>
            <p align="center"><span class="red10bold">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
            <p align="left"><span class="grey12normal"><strong class="red12bold">The Game: </strong> </span><span class="blue12text">Squash is a game played on a four walled court using a racquet and ball. Both singles and doubles can be played with a doubles court being the same dimensions as a singles court except that it is 1.22m wider. </span>
            <p align="left"><span class="blue12text">In the singles game, two players take turns to hit the ball onto the front wall, in an area defined by an out line at the top of the court and the top of the "tin" which runs across and near the bottom of the front wall. </span>
            <p align="left"><span class="blue12text">A rally begins when the server, standing in one of the service boxes, hits the ball directly to the front wall (above the service or "cut" line and below the out line) to rebound into the opposite quarter of the court bounded by the side and back wall and two lines (the short line and the half court line). </span>
            <p align="left"><span class="blue12text">The player receiving, may choose to hit the ball before it has bounces but must hit the ball before it has bounces twice. The rally continues so long as the ball goes onto the front wall before going down or out, down being into the "tin" or into the floor, and out being on or above the "out" line which surrounds the court at the top of each of the four walls. After the serve, the ball may hit any wall before hitting the front wall so long as it does not go down or out. </span>
            <p align="left"><span class="blue12text">The doubles game is similar except that instead of players taking turns to hit the ball, either member of each team must hit the ball in turn.</span>
            <p align="center"><span class="red10bold">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
            <p align="left"><span class="grey12normal"><strong class="red12bold">Scoring: </strong> </span><span class="blue12text">Squash has two scoring systems which are being used at both the international and local level. The traditional nine point scoring system see players gaining the serve before being able to score a point. If the receiver wins a rally they win the serve, but if the server wins the rally they score a point. The first player to nine points wins the game except if the score is eight all. In that case, the player who scored eight points first can then choose whether to play to nine or ten points. A match consists of the best of five games. </span>
            <p align="left"><span class="blue12text">The point a rally scoring system is simple in that after each rally, a point is scored. But instead of going to nine, each game goes to fifteen except when it is fourteen all. In this case, the first player to reach fourteen chooses whether to go to fifteen or seventeen points. Again, a match consists of the best of five games.</span>
            <p align="left"><span class="grey12normal"><strong class="red12bold">Versions:</strong> </span><span class="blue12text">There are two versions of squash - the International version and the American version. The American version is played in the USA and some parts of Mexico and Canada and involves different court dimensions and slightly different rules. For example, servers win a point each time their opponent fails to return the ball in-court before it bounces twice in International rules, but in American rules both server and receiver can score points. In Australia the version generally used is the International version. In Australia a modified version of Squash called Mini Squash has been developed by the Australian Squash Rackets Association for juniors. Mini Squash is part of the AUSSIE SPORT program at the Australian Sports Commission. </span>
