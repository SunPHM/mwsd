<p align="justify">This page is dedicated to the Lards.net. The Lards.net is a group of (mostly) squash friends (mostly) from our days at Southampton University, some of the members of the Lards.net previously went under the name of Bevois Patrol. In those days most of us were fit and streamlined, but less time for squash and the rigors of age and work has led to the filling of a few waistlines - hence the Lards.net. It should be noted that a few of the founder members got some training in for this during the early days. Well enough for now, and remember the Lards.net motto: <i>'You can't boast until you've got a good length.' </i></p>

<h3>Rio Wedding 2004</h3>
<p><a href="roj/pics/sugarloaf.jpg">Roj and Flavia</a> got married in Rio de Janeiro, in November 2004. Many lards attended the wedding - and lots of other social get togethers, pics <a href="http://www.rojandflavia.plus.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Summer BBQ 2004</h3>
<p>The first summer BBQ for a few years was held at the J's manor in North Stoke (Nr Reading), a nice turn out even saw a flying visit from Nick and Victoria.</p>

<h3>North America Update 2004</h3>
<p>Nick and Victoria are still in Calefornia (San Diego) and now Mike has moved to join them - at least to San Fransisco, alright not that close, but I'm sure Fletch's reputation can cover the gap. How is Mike copying with the change in climate from Saskatoon? Better than you'd expect, see <a href="pics/Mikes_Porchea04.jpg">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Baby Updates 2003 / 2004<img src="images/updated.gif" alt="updated"></h3>
<p>Nick and Bia gave birth to Melissa on the 27th June 2004 to add to <a href="pics/vivian.jpg">Vivian</a> (a girl) on the 8th February 2003. The J's twins Katie and Danny were born 8 weeks prematurely on 23rd February 2003, but are now both well and at home with the J's. While Al and Gill added number 3 (Juliette) on 30th November 2003, the usual full account is <a href="text/alan4.txt">here</a>. Congrats from us all.</p>

<h3>NY 2003 / 2004</h3>
<p>A few lard met up in Finchley at Roy and Sara's and then headed into town to Whirly Gig..</p>

<h3>Round the World 2002 / 2003</h3>
<p>Roj and Flavia took off on a world trip for 3 months at the end of October, taking in SE Asia, Oz, NZ, and Brasil (for Xmas). They checked-in along the way in the lards <a href="guestbook.asp">guestbook</a> and also added some <a href="roj/trip/pics/index.html">photos</a>. An itinerary of the trip is available <a href="roj/trip/itinerary.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Skifest 2002</h3>
<p>Quite a small affair in Chatel in France for one week. Thanks to Jonnie for getting us organised enough to get it booked - the chalet was superb. The J's, Roj, Chris, Royster and Wendy were all in attendance. There were some great skiing conditions on the ground, even if we couldn't see where we were going, Jonnie in partcular missed a pile of snow and unfortunately bounced down the hill on his head, missing tha last two days skiing. Pictures in the <a href="gallery.html">image</a> gallery.</p>

<h3>Richard's Service 2001</h3>
<p>The Thanksgiving & Celebration of his Life service was held at 3.00pm on 17th November 2001 
at a church near his family in Ferndown, Poole. There were some very moving tributes at the service, a copy of these have been turned into a <a href="pdfs/tributes.pdf">pdf file</a> (its a 0.2M download). Following this there was a Party (everyone agreed that's what he would have wanted) at the HighCliff hotel which is in the centre of Bournemouth. Pretty much all the lards turned out and it was great to see everyone, but a terrible shame about the circumstances.</p>

<h3>Dutch Wedding 2001</h3>
<p>Nick W and Bia's wedding was another great event, it was in a splendid Catholic church in Delft, in the Netherlands on the 19th October 2001. The service was very impressively given by the priest in English, Dutch and Portugese, to accomodate the guests assembled from far and wide. Quite a few lards made the trip for a long weekend in Delft. Chris and Roj stayed out the whole week following the stag in Rotterdam the previous weekend, which was also attended by Stu, but none of the married lards. Congratulations from all the lards.  Pictures in the <a href="gallery.html">image</a> gallery and movies in the <a href="movies.html">movie</a> gallery.</p>

<h3>Tragedy 2001</h3>
<p>11th September 2001 was a black day for the lards, <a href="honorary.html">Richard Dawson</a> in his single handed efforts to keep the British economy running had the incredible misfortune to be in the World Trade Centre for a conference at 9.00am. He will be sorely missed, he was undoubted the glue that held the lards together, everyone will have to try a bit harder to keep in touch and enjoy life. Our thoughts are with his family.</p>
