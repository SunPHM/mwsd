Symptoms of virus infection include necrotic spots, abnormal dark green and light green mosaic and <A HREF="../graphics/large/virus_mottling_pepper_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalI', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalI">mottling</A> of leaves, <A HREF="../graphics/large/virus_pepper_distort_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalJ', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalJ">growth distortion</A>, stunting, and ring patterns or bumps on plant foliage. Plants may also be infected with more than one virus or viral strain. Plants infected with multiple viruses and can show a combination of symptoms or more severe symptoms as a result of the multiple infections.</p> 

<p>Plant viruses differ from all other plant pathogens. They are subcellular and can only be visualized with the aid of an electron microscope. Plant virus names usually refer to the first plant in which they were discovered, e.g. cucumber mosaic virus. Viruses are composed of small pieces of either DNA or RNA encapsulated inside a protein coat. Viruses reproduce inside living cells and can spread within infected plant tissues. Viruses do not divide or produce any kind of reproductive structures such as spores. Instead viruses take over the host cells replication mechanisms and cause them to manufacture more virus particles.</p>

<p>Vegetative propagation, sap, seed, pollen, insects, mites, nematodes, fungi, and parasitic plants can spread viruses. Viruses can be spread relatively long distances in insect vectors such as aphids and thrips carried on the prevailing winds. Handling infected plants spreads some viruses. Viruses present in plant sap can contaminate hands or tools and then infect healthy plants during normal handling.</p> 

<p>Most plant viruses cause systemic infections and there is no cure for infected
plants. Viruses disrupt normal cellular processes and eventually cause abnormal cellular function.  However, it is not uncommon for vegetable plants to exhibit mild viral symptoms and still produce  a normal crop.</p>


<p><strong><A HREF="../graphics/large/virus_pokeweed_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalK', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalK">Cucumber mosaic virus</A> (CMV)</strong> infects many different plants worldwide, including tomato, pepper, lettuce, cucumber and muskmelon. CMV has many strains and typically causes stunting, distortion, and a mosaic pattern on leaves and flowers. CMV is primarily spread by aphids from plant to plant and infects many weeds that serve as reservoir hosts for infection of perennials. CMV can also be spread in infected sap by people handling infected and healthy plants simultaneously.  There are other mosaic viruses (e.g. watermelon mosaic-2 vrus and squash mosaic virus) that also affect cucurbits.</p>

<p><strong>Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)</strong> is very common and also worldwide in distribution. A discussion of TMV is included because of its wide host range and high potential for spread. Peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes are common host plants. The most common symptom of TMV is a mosaic pattern of dark green and light green areas on infected plant leaves. Leaf puckering and distortion, reduced leaf size and misshapen fruit are also observed.  Infected sap, grafting, dodder and seed spread TMV. Insects do not spread TMV. The most common means of transmission is by people handling infected and healthy plants simultaneously.</p>

<p>A number of other viruses infect pepper including tobacco etch, potato virus Y, and alfalfa mosaic.  Symptoms include leaf mottling, puckering, and distortion; deformed fruit and stunted plants.</p>

<p><strong>Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) and tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) </strong>are two tospoviruses that can infect a number of vegetable crops including pepper and tomato. Symptoms can include necrotic streaks, spots, rings and lines on leaves and stems, distorted flowers, stems and leaves, general stunting and bud drop. Black, brown, reddish, or yellowish concentric rings, although not always present, are also symptoms of virus infection. Both viruses are transmitted by at least five species of thrips. Virus spread occurs by movement of infected thrips to healthy plants by crawling, jumping or on air currents within greenhouses or fields.</p> 

<p><strong><font color="#00FFFF">Management:</font></strong>
<p>There is no cure for infected plants. Always select plants with resistance to viruses that are common in your area.  Remove and discard infected plants. Weed control and sanitation are very important since weeds and plant debris can serve as sources for viral infections. People who use tobacco products should wash their hands with a phosphate detergent or soap before handling plants. Sanitation is especially important for controlling TMV since it is very heat stable and remains infective for long periods of time in sap and plant debris.
