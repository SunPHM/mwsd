              <p><i>by Karen McCarthy <br>
                </i><br>
                As winter and the holidays approach, our attention turns away 
                from just-picked, perishable vegetables of summer towards the 
                more durable fare, especially winter squash. Like tomatoes, squash 
                are actually a fruit from the same family as melons. Winter squash 
                tend to have thick, hard, inedible skins and large seeds, both 
                of which can be eaten. Their flesh, which ranges in color from 
                deep yellow to orange, is firmer than that of the summer squash 
                varieties and requires much longer cooking. Some of my favorite 
                varieties are Acorn, Buttercup, Butternut, Carnival, Hubbard, 
                Spaghetti, and Turban. <br>
                <br>
                Winter squash can be stored up to six months in a cool place, 
                but it must be cured first, especially if the fruit comes straight 
                from your garden. (Squash obtained from the green grocer have 
                already been cured.) Curing can be accomplished by holding the 
                fruit for 10 days at a temperature between 801?F - 851?F and 
                a relative humidity of 80 percent before storing. <br>
                <br>
                Although there are many varieties of winter squash, almost all 
                of them are cooked in the same way. The exception to this rule 
                is the Spaghetti squash, which requires a distinct method of cooking 
                (see recipe below). Squash can be baked whole and peeled for puree; 
                or peeled, seeded, cut into small pieces and steamed. They can 
                also be cut in half and baked with a stuffing. Squashes also make 
                wonderful containers for other foods. A pumpkin can be baked and 
                used as a tureen to hold soup or filled with stew and topped with 
                puff pastry for an unusual pot pie. The smaller squash such as 
                Acorn or Carnival, can be steamed or baked and used as individual 
                soup bowls or serving bowls. An acorn squash makes a wonderful 
                container for cranberry sauce on the Thanksgiving table. <br>
                <br>
                Squashes are very versatile and combine well with a number of 
                flavors. They can be used in either sweet or savory dishes. It 
                is believed that squash was originally cultivated in Mexico, and 
                it plays an important role in the cuisine of that country. Squash 
                combine especially well with the flavors of bacon, maple syrup, 
                sage, thyme, cinnamon, chiles, garlic and ginger. For a simple 
                side dish, fill baked Acorn squash halves with melted butter and 
                chile powder, or maple syrup and cinnamon. When using pumpkins 
                for pie (or any puree for that matter), look for the smaller types 
                called sugar pumpkins. They usually run between 3 and 5 pounds. 
                Save the large pumpkins for soup tureens and jack-o-lanterns.

                <span class="bksttitle">SMOKED GOUDA SOUP BAKED IN A PUMPKIN</span><br>
                1 8- to 10- pound pumpkin<br>
                A small amount of flavorless oil for brushing pumpkin<br>
                2 tablespoons butter<br>
                1/2 cup chopped onion<br>
                1/2 cup diced carrots<br>
                1/2 cup diced celery<br>
                2 tablespoons flour<br>
                6 cups beef, chicken or vegetable broth<br>
                1 teaspoon thyme<br>
                1 bay leaf<br>
                1/2 pound smoked gouda cheese, shredded<br>
                1 cup heavy cream<br>
                <br>
                Preheat the oven to 4001? F. Remove the top from the pumpkin 
                and scoop out the seeds. Brush the inside of the pumpkin with 
                oil, replace the top, and put it in a baking pan. Bake the pumpkin 
                for about 30 minutes. <br>
                <br>
                While the pumpkin is baking make the soup. Melt the butter in 
                a stockpot, and saute the vegetables over medium heat. When the 
                vegetables are translucent and starting to soften add the flour 
                and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the broth, thyme 
                and bay leaf. Bring the soup to a boil, turn down the heat, and 
                simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When the vegetables are soft, whisk in the cheese, and continue 
                to stir constantly until the cheese is melted. Add the cream. 
                Carefully pour the soup into the pumpkin, and continue baking 
                the pumpkin for about another 20 minutes, or until the flesh of 
                the pumpkin is soft. Serve the soup from the pumpkin, scraping 
                up a little of the flesh with every serving. <br>
                Serves 8 to 10. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="bksttitle">BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP</span><br>
                6 slices of bacon<br>
                1 large onion, chopped<br>
                1 Butternut squash, peeled and cubed<br>
                6 cups chicken stock<br>
                1 bay leaf<br>
                2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage<br>
                salt and pepper, to taste<br>
                sour cream, to taste<br>
                <br>
                In a Dutch oven, saute bacon until crisp, remove from pan and 
                reserve. Saute onion in bacon fat until tender, about 5 minutes. 
                Add squash, chicken stock, bay leaf and sage to pan. Bring the 
                stock to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes or until the squash 
                is very tender. <br>
                <br>
                Remove pan from stove and strain the solids, reserving the stock 
                in a large bowl. Remove bay leaf and put the rest of the solids 
                into the work bowl of a food processor or blender. Add one cup 
                of stock and purZ&Eacute;e until smooth. Return squash purZ&Eacute;e 
                to pan and add reserved stock. Season soup to taste with salt 
                and pepper. Keep soup warm until serving time. <br>
                <br>
                To serve, ladle soup into bowl and garnish with a dollop of sour 
                cream, crumbled reserved bacon and a fresh sage leaf. Serves 6.

                SPAGHETTI SQUASH WITH CREAM AND SAGE<br>
                <i>As the name would suggest, Spaghetti squash can be used just 
                like pasta. Prepare the squash through the &quot;combing&quot; 
                step described below and top with any of your favorite pasta sauces. 
                </i><br>
                1 Spaghetti squash<br>
                2 cups heavy cream<br>
                3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage<br>
                freshly grated nutmeg to taste<br>
                salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
                1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br>
                chopped parsley for garnish<br>
                <br>
                Preheat the oven to 3501? F. Prick the squash with a long-tined 
                fork so the skin won't burst while cooking. Bake between 40 minutes 
                and 1 1/2 hours, or until the flesh is tender. Allow the squash 
                to cool. <br>
                <br>
                When the squash is cool enough to handle, split lengthwise and 
                remove the seeds with a spoon. With a fork, &quot;comb&quot; the 
                squash flesh so that it pulls off in spaghetti-like strands. Set 
                aside. <br>
                <br>
                To prepare the sauce: in a saute pan over high heat, boil the 
                cream with the sage until it reduces by half and thickens a little 
                (about 15 minutes). Add the nutmeg, salt, pepper and Parmesan 
                cheese. Toss in the squash and heat through. Sprinkle with chopped 
                parsley. Makes 6 servings. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="bksttitle">PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE BRUL&Eacute;E</span><br>
                For the crust:<br>
                1 1/2 cups ground gingersnap cookies<br>
                1 1/2 cups toasted pecans<br>
                1/2 cup firmly-packed brown sugar<br>
                1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted<br>
                For the filling:<br>
                4 8-ounce packages cream cheese, at room temperature<br>
                1 1/2 cups sugar<br>
                1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
                1/2 teaspoon ground ginger<br>
                1 15-ounce can solid pack pumpkin<br>
                3 large eggs<br>
                1 tablespoon vanilla extract or bourbon<br>
                For the brulee topping:<br>
                1/2 cup light brown sugar<br>
                1 cup creme frache (for serving)<br>
                <br>
                To make the crust: preheat the oven to 3501? F. Finely grind 
                the cookies, pecans,and sugar in a food processor. Add the melted 
                butter and blend until the ingredients are combined. Press the 
                crust mixture onto the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9-inch 
                springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides. Bake the crust until 
                lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Cool. Wrap bottom and sides 
                of the pan in heavy-duty tin foil. <br>
                <br>
                To make the filling: using an electric mixer, beat together the 
                cream cheese, sugar, cinnamon and ginger. Add the pumpkin and 
                beat until well blended. Add the eggs and vanilla or bourbon and 
                beat until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. 
                Pour the filling into the crust. Set the pan in a roasting pan 
                and pour enough hot water into the roasting pan to come 1 inch 
                up the sides of the springform pan. <br>
                Bake the cake until the top is golden and begins to crack and 
                the center is set, about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Remove the cake 
                from the roasting pan and cool. Chill the cake overnight. <br>
                <br>
                For the brulee topping: Just before serving, preheat the broiler. 
                Sift the brown sugar through a large strainer in an even coating 
                over the cake. Place the cake under the broiler 2 to 3 inches 
                from the heat source. Broil just until the sugar melts and begins 
                to bubble. You can also do this with a propane torch. Remove the 
                sides of the pan, cut the cake into slices and serve with a dollop 
                of creme frache. Makes 10 to 12 servings.<br>

                <span class="bksttitle">ACORN SQUASH WITH A CRANBRRRY-CORNBREAD 
                STUFFING</span><br>
                <i>This is a great side dish to go with roasted Cornish game hens. 
                </i><br>
                2 small Acorn squash, cut in half<br>
                crosswise and seeds scooped out<br>
                salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>
                flavorless oil<br>
                For the stuffing:<br>
                1 tablespoon butter<br>
                1/2 onion, chopped<br>
                2 stalks celery, finely diced<br>
                2 cups cornbread, cut into 1-inch cubes<br>
                1 cup toasted pecans, coarsely chopped<br>
                1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme<br>
                1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage<br>
                1/2 to 1 cup chicken stock<br>
                1/2 cup whole berry cranberry sauce<br>
                salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>
                <br>
                Preheat the oven to 3501? F. Cut a small slice off the bottom 
                of each squash so that they will sit flat. Place the squash hollow 
                side up in a baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle 
                the oil over the top. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. <br>
                <br>
                While the squash are baking, prepare the stuffing. Melt the butter 
                in a medium sautZ&Eacute; pan, then add the onion and celery and 
                sautee until wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion mixture 
                to a bowl. Add the cornbread cubes, the pecans, thyme and sage. 
                Add enough chicken stock to moisten the mixture. Gently fold in 
                the cranberry sauce, being careful not to break up the cornbread 
                too much. Season to taste with salt and pepper. <br>
                <br>
                Remove the squash from the oven. Without removing the squash from 
                the pan, divide the stuffing among the four halves. Return the 
                pan to the oven and bake for another 30 minutes, or until the 
                stuffing is heated through. Makes 4 servings. </p>
