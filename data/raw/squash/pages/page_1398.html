<P><B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#CC00FF">In addition to his pastoral duties he works four days a week at Nice Cars
in Garberville as a used car salesman. 'Talk about an oxymoron--&quot;Pastor/used car salesman&quot;! His car selling
job is &quot;over the hill&quot;--a 21 mile (40 minute) trip over the mountain to civilization. The distance/time
ratio is not due to traffic, but a windy two-lane road.<BR>
Nancy is pretty much a full time housewife. She has gone back to work part time as the baker at a local restaurant.
 What that means is that she is getting paid for what she would probably do for free---but don't tell anybody.
 She is Sunday School superintendent and has been teaching  Sunday School for 37 years. When time allows she still
loves to cook, sew, read,&nbsp; cross-stitch, quilt--anything &quot;crafty.&quot; This Fall she canned anything
she could get her hands on --blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, tomatoes, pickles, apples (applesauce, pie
apples, apple butter).</FONT></B></P>

Other interests are an almost-daily walk of 3.1 miles around the hills of Shelter Cove, twice-weekly exercise class,
church secretary/clerk, and keeping the pastor well-fed, clothed, and his head screwed on straight!<BR>
An additional &quot;member&quot; of the family is Barney (named after Barnabus in </FONT><A HREF="http://www.penguinputnam.com/mitford/start.htm"><FONT

have any--we highly recommend them! <BR>
A closing note: You know you live in a small town when......your local postmaster calls to tell you that your tax
returns don't have enough postage, but not to worry--he will take care of it and you can just drop by to reimburse
him or stick it in the mailbox--whichever is most convenient. It happened to us!</FONT></B></P>
