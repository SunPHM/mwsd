              <p align="left"><img src="winter/skier3.jpg" width="270" height="323" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">"The woods are lovely, dark and deep". We stop along the route for hot chocolate, brewed over an open fire. An errant sunbeam slips through a lead-grey sky, onto the field ahead. The pace quickens; the horses are on the home stretch, but I have memories to keep. </p>
              <p align="left">Blue Water Acres is very much a family operation, and all the family live in the immediate area. Bill and Annette Gelder have been the owners for the past twenty years, and the whole family pitches in to run it. At dinner that evening, our waitresses, full of charm and efficiency, are the Gelder daughters. </p>
              <p align="left">The dining room, called "Billy's Camboose", is decorated in huge, poster-sized reproductions of old Algonquin Park historical photos. In grainy black-and-white, we see loggers gathered together in their 'camboose camp', proud hunters displaying a fallen timber wolf, an old locomotive rolling over a log trestle. A large fieldstone fireplace, topped with a well-antlered trophy, gives the room a cosy ambience. During dinner, Annette regales us with a medley of classics from a well-tuned piano. </p>

                  <img src="winter/skier1.jpg" alt="Cross country skiing in Ontario's near north is world class" width="300" height="210" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="left">Our first introduction to Blue Waters cuisine is a traditional turkey dinner, which we both enjoy. The introductory sun-dried tomato soup, nicely seasoned, gives us a hint of things to come. The turkey, both dark meat and white, is nicely juicy. The green beans are so crisp as to squeak, the shredded red cabbage is flavoured with cloves and cayenne pepper, the squash redolent of orange and nutmeg, the sage dressing touched up with bacon. Dessert is a deep dish apple caramel pie, with a light dash of chocolate sauce. </p>
              <p align="left">Snowmobiling in this area will prove to be as good as it gets. Many people like to rent their equipment and clothing, and at this resort, this is very convenient. You can spend days exploring the woods and frozen lakes, for miles around the Muskoka region. Lake of Bays, on which Blue Water Acres is located, is a huge collection of connected coves and inlets, often safely frozen by early winter. </p>
              <p align="left"><img src="winter/skiviewr.jpg" alt="Youre on your own here and winter nights can go forty below..." width="184" height="280" hspace="8" vspace="8" align="right">We love to go cross-country skiing, and this is the place to enjoy it, especially when more southerly areas have no snow. After a few days of skiing and falling on the resort's trails, we have built up enough courage to go further afield. Algonquin Park's ski trails begin at the West Gate. ranging from easy, to outrageous. We opt for "easy". </p>
              <p align="left">The Fen Lake ski trail spins out from under our boards, on a glorious winter morning. The sky is impossibly blue, the early sun sparkling off the fresh snow. </p>
              <p align="left">Each stump wears a high white toque. Whipped cream, flung by the wind during last night's snowstorm, coats the trunks of the hardwoods. The hands of the balsams reach out to touch us. We're both carrying rucksacks, stuffed with comfort and security: sweaters and dry socks, apples and sandwiches, soup in a thermos, fire starter, elastic tape for blisters, a spare ski tip. Not too much weight, to ensure a happy day and a safe return. You're on your own here, and winter nights can go to forty below. </p>
