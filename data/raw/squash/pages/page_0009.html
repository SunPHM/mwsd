<p>Seeds saved from hybrid cultivars will not "come true" (resemble "mom") when planted out the following season.  Seeds saved from non-hybrid (open-pollinated) cultivars of plants that normally cross-pollinate- cucumber, muskmelon, squash, pumpkin, pepper (<A HREF="../graphics/large/hybrid_pepper_fruit_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalA', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalA">cross between Thai and Serrano chiles</a>), corn, basil, etc.- may produce off-types when planted the following year.  This occurs typically because of cross-pollination between different cultivars of the same species.  For example, one may grow two or more different open-pollinated cucumber cultivars and save seed from the one that performs best.  Unless the plants were hand-pollinated or screened to exclude insects, it is very likely that pollen crossed back and forth between the cultivars.  Therefore, plants grown the following year from saved seed will express the combined traits of two different cultivars.</p> 

<p>Note also that there are several types of vegetables (yellow croockneck, zucchini and acorn squash, pumpkins) that fall into the same species- <em>Cucubita pepo</em>.  These different crops will all cross with one another.  This accounts for some of the bizarre looking <A HREF="../graphics/large/hybrid_squash_l.JPG" onClick="window.open('', 'externalB', 'width=420,height=320,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')" target="externalB">squash-like fruits</A> that grow on plants emanating from compost piles.</p>

<p>Cross-pollination occurs between neighboring gardens as well.  Your neighbor's garden may have a big effect on your plans to save vegetable seeds.  And cross-pollination can also occur between species.  For example, there may be considerable crossing between the five different cultivated species of pepper within a garden (e.g. Habanero pepper with Serrano pepper.)</p>
