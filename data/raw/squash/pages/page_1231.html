      <P>Hotel restaurants face special challenges. Their kitchens
      must accomodate the rush of conferences, wedding buffets, and
      more. They often provide room service, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
      They handle numerous special dietary needs. They must answer
      to corporate accountants who monitor for profitability.</P>

      <P>These extra duties can distract from the culinary goals of
      a chef, making it difficult to excel in the kitchen. By attempting
      to make everyone happy, many such large corporate restaurants
      merely achieve mediocrity. Thankfully, Parcel 104 is an exception
      to this pattern.</P>

      <P>Founded by restaurant impressario Bradley Ogden, Parcel 104
      furthers Ogden's goals to define high-end American cuisine with
      a focus on farmstead meats and produce, seasonal sensitivity,
      and creative cooking rooted in Western tradition.</P>

      <P>I admit that I tend to shy away from big restaurants. As a
      reviewer I usually champion smaller family businesses. I probably
      wouldn't have tried Parcel 104 had they not invited me to an
      introductory dinner, which they paid for.</P>

      <P>I accepted their invitation with some trepidation, prefering
      to review restaurants anonymously. I prepared myself to be hypercritical.
      I needn't have worried. Parcel 104 excels with flavorful food,
      attractive environment, attentive service, and clarity of concept.</P>

      <P>Concerned that we might have received special treatment, I
      noticed that other customers received the same attentive service
      that we did. Their entr&eacute;es came plated just as beautifully.</P>

      <P>Parcel 104's corporate backing has actually empowered a fine
      chef to realize his dream, offering a well-conceived selection
      of dishes with the freshest ingredients in a stylish and classy
      environment.</P>

      <P><IMG SRC="104barthosmer.jpg" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="269" ALIGN="RIGHT"
      BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Meeting the Chef</P>

      <P>Good concepts carry little weight without good implemetation,
      and Parcel 104 has excellent leadership in the hands of executive
      chef Bart Hosmer.</P>

      <P>This Bay Area native previously led kitchens at the Whitehall
      Hotel in Chicago, the Flying Fish Cafe at Disneyworld, Ogden's
      Lark Creek Inn and others. He returned to the Bay Area in 2001
      to rejoin Ogden for Parcel 104.</P>

      <P>Hosmer explained that name Parcel 104 comes from the pear
      orchard that once occupied the region now covered by the Marriott,
      Mission College and Great America. The restaurant pays homage
      to its farmland predecessor by sponsoring weekly farmers' markets
      in summertime.</P>

      <P>Chef Hosmer hopes the farmers' market will reach out to locals,
      most of whom would not consider driving to the Marriott Hotel
      for a special dinner.</P>

      <P>When I spoke with him, Hosmer listed with enthusiasm the different
      growers for free-range meats and local organic produce that supply
      his kitchen. He adjusts his menu daily as ingredients become
      available.</P>

      <P>I could taste this passion on every plate. The kitchen successfully
      expresses the ideals behind the food, with clean flavors and
      sauces that flatter fresh ingredients rather than overtake them.</P>

      <P>Tasting through Dinner</P>

      <P>To get a sense of Hosmer's broad and changing menu, we split
      plates from several different dinner courses. We could have ordered
      the chef's tasting menu, a five course sampler for $58, but we
      wanted to see how the standard dishes appeared.</P>

      <P>A tiny amuse bouche arrived first, a demitasse of Sweet Dumpling
      Squash Bisque. This subtle creamy soup showed a delicate infusion
      of nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and clove, with a wafting of fennel
      from the vegetable mirepoix. These accents never overpowered
      the sweet taste of the squash, but deepened it with a whisper.</P>

      <P><IMG SRC="104tunatartar.jpg" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="269" ALIGN="RIGHT"
      BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Having tasted the bisque, we skipped
      a soup course ($7). Instead we tried Yellowfin Tuna Tartare ($12),
      a cylinder of raw tuna topped with a tapenade of calamata olives,
      carrots, sweet red peppers, scallions and lemon oil. The olives
      had been rinsed and saut&eacute;ed to soften their flavor.</P>

      <P>Two bread crisps stood like a flag from the tuna, offering
      an edible utensil to accompany the fresh pink yellowfin.</P>

      <P>Other appetizers sounded similarly delicious: an iced shellfish
      platter with three types of oysters and a crab claw ($16); Maine
      lobster hot pot with truffled herb broth ($12); even frog legs
      with honey sauce and apple slaw ($12).</P>

      <P>Entrees</P>

      <P>We tried three different entrees from that night's menu. All
      of them showed creativity balanced with classicism, generous
      portions with artistic presentation that never seemed overworked.</P>

      <P>Dayboat Scallops with Veal Marmelade ($25) offered a marriage
      of sea and land that allowed wide oportunities for wine pairings
      (especially pinot noir.) Four large fresh scallops sat atop a
      mound of shredded veal reduced with red wine and orange zest.</P>

      <P>Topped with sweet palm hearts poached in butter, the quickly
      seared scallops retained their tender texture with an almost-raw
      interior.</P>

      <P>The veal came from Marcho Farms in Pennsylvania, a Mennonite
      farm which lets its calves walk freely, fed on whey from farmstead
      cheese. The light earthy flavors from the skirt and flank steak
      added depth to the scallops, bridged by the tart sweetness of
      citrus.</P>

      <P>An even more surprising pairing of sea and land came in the
      form of seared yellowfin tuna topped with Sonoma foie gras ($26,
      see photo at top), accompanied by a demitasse of celery foam.
      This creation arrived on a bed of saut&eacute;ed crones, tiny
      root vegetables that look a bit like shrimp and taste subtly
      sweet and nutty.</P>

      <P>The kitchen had quickly seared both tuna and foie, leaving
      the tuna delectably raw but for a thin layer top and bottom.
      A drizzle of veal stock reduced with pinot noir added richly
      flavored artwork to the sizable plate.</P>

      <P>The celery foam reminded me of David Kinch's innovations at
      Manresa (Los Gatos), combining sweet and salty flavors with surprising
      textures. It added a light but creamy contrast to this intense
      dish.</P>

      <P>We concluded our savory courses with Jameson Farm lamb T-bones
      topped with black trumpet mushrooms ($36). The lamb sat atop
      a bed of pur&eacute;ed cannellini beans, infused with rosemary
      and black truffles. The earthiness of the mushrooms and aromatic
      herbs merged with a reduction sauce made from the braising liquid.</P>

      <P>While the two chunks of lamb looked large, the center bones
      took up most of the volume. Some diners may wish for a slightly
      meatier cut, but the wild mushrooms compensated well, with truffle
      perfume infusing every bite.</P>

      <P>Artful Desserts</P>

      <P>Pastry chef Carlos Sanchez has a knack for turning simple-sounding
      desserts into artwork. He modifies the sweets menu daily. All
      desserts cost $6.</P>

      <P><IMG SRC="104desserts.jpg" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="269" ALIGN="RIGHT"
      BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The Chocolate Lover's Dream offered
      four decadent little explosions of high quality chocolate, including
      melted Valhrona brownies, Scharffenberger chocolate custard,
      an espresso cup full of Mexican hot cocoa, and a tiny ice cream
      sandwich made from fluffy meringues.</P>

      <P>Each of these chocolate tidbits showed soft finesse and lightness,
      rather than the full frontal attack of dark chocolate that one
      might infer from the description. I appreciated the light touch
      after our lingering feast.</P>

      <P>Luckily our waiter pointed out that the Chocolate Persimmon
      Napolean didn't involve chocolate at all, but used the dark fleshed
      fruit called chocolate persimmon.</P>

      <P>The Napolean arrived as an oozing stack of vanilla custard,
      thin phyllo crackers with a crust of brul&eacute;e sugar, layered
      with slices of saut&eacute;ed persimmons, in a pool of light
      rich caramel sauce. Its flavors matched the Autumn season perfectly.</P>

      <P>Carlos' Caramel Flan showed classic smoothness and a velvety
      soft mouth-feel. The small disk of egg custard came framed in
      an ultra-wide lipped bowl with just a dollop of whipped cream
      and a mint sprig.</P>

      <P>Wine List</P>

      <P>A formidable 25 page wine list offers unique and intelligent
      selections. General manager Robert Sharpe updates the list daily
      as rare stock rotates, and our waiter showed good familiarity
      with the wines.</P>

      <P>Prices range from about $30 to hundreds per bottle. Markups
      range around 200% to 250% of retail, with lower margins on premium
      bottles.</P>

      <P>The list featured some exceptional high-end wines priced very
      fairly, like Fisher's 1997 Wedding Vineyard Cabernet ($127/bottle),
      a chameleon that changes constantly in the glass as it breathes.
      At auction this wine sells for over $100.</P>

      <P>Wines by the glass range from $7 to $20, with a well-chosen
      selection covering a dozen varietals. I tasted several of these,
      and found the suggested pairings worked beautifully.</P>

      <P>Babich Riesling from New Zealand ($8) showed floral honey
      perfume with a light clean palate, adding finesse to our early
      tastes of soup and raw fish. The J. Lohr Syrah ($9) had a deep
      blueberry nose with intense tarry fruit, accenting rosemary flavors
      in the lamb. The Iron Horse Pinot Noir ($15) paired with everything
      we tasted.</P>

      <P>Diners can arrange tasting sequences to accompany different
      courses, with 2 oz. pours of different wines offering a range
      of optimal pairings.</P>

      <P>The Price of Art</P>

      <P>Some restaurants cost a lot but disappoint with heartless
      glitz. Parcel 104 is expensive, but its food delivers on the
      promise of freshness, balance and discovery. It feels worthy
      of the expense.</P>

      <P>In the jaded haut-cuisine culture where novelty wears thin,
      a chef can feel challenged to find an original creative voice
      without losing balance or tradition. Somehow Bart Hosmer has
      found a balance between European classicism and California clarity
      that feels totally natural yet fresh and creative.</P>

      <P>For special occasions Parcel 104 merits a journey to the Marriott,
      foreign though its location may seem.</P>
