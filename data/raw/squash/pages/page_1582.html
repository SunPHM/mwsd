<p><img src="mainimages/98042401.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="307"> <font face="system"><i>April 22, 1998 - MCI Center, Washington, DC</i> The Washington Capitals took to the ice yesterday evening with a vengeance that was in search of the Cup. After an up and down season, the Caps showed fans and the Bruins why they deserved home ice in the first game of a series of seven.
<p>Adam Oates would take control of the puck after the face off and only 56 seconds later, the Caps already had two quick shots on goal. The Caps drew the first penalty, charged to Joe Reekie for tripping at the 10:28 mark in the first period. This gave the Bruins the chance to jump ahead of the Caps early, but they were unable to do so, due to some great penalty killing by Mark Tinordi and Calle Johansson.
<p><img src="mainimages/98042403.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="277">Washington would later score on a short-handed goal with 3:20 remaining, by Brian Bellows assisted by Peter Bondra to take a 1-0 lead.
<p>Poor defense by the Bruins gave the Caps another opportunity to score with 1:56 remaining in the first period, as they had another power play, which was unsuccessful.  At the end of the first period the Caps led the Bruins 1-0.
First period statistics showed that the Bruins had taken more shots on goal (13), but they still did not score. The Caps had 12 shots, six of which came in the last three minutes of the first period.
Second period play started quickly for the Caps, as Sergei Gonchar scooted a shot past the Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe to take a 2-0 lead.
A few seconds later after the Gonchar goal, the Bruins scored on a deflected shot off a Capital skate to cut the lead to 2-1.
Later, the Bruins would get another shot at knotting the score, when Todd Krygier was charged with 2:00 tripping penalty to give the Bruins their second power play in five minutes. Once again, the Bruins could not take advantage of the extra man and at the end of two periods of play, the Caps led the Bruins 2-1.
<p><img src="mainimages/98042407.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="291">Second period play saw the Caps skate just about even with the Bruins taking 21 shots on goal to the Bruins 20. The Bruins also proved to be able to squash the two Caps power plays in the period as well.
After escaping a horrifying second half, where Peter Bondra went down clutching his leg, the Caps moved to the third where the referees continued to let both teams play with very few penalties called. The Caps would score one more time in the third on an empty netter by Esa Tikkanen.
<p>The Caps continued to take a commanding stand on defense and were able to hold off  the Bruins 3-2 to take a 1-0 lead in this best of seven series.
