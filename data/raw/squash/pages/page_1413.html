Kentucky has a rich and varied archaeological heritage, with archaeological sites being located
in every county of the Commonwealth.  To date, archaeologists have recorded more than
19,000 archaeological sites in Kentucky.  Prehistoric sites include seasonal camps,
villages, burials mounds, and earthworks.  Native Americans occuppied some of
these sites more than 12,000 years ago, while they occupied others less than
300 years ago.</P>

<P><H3>Paleoindian (?12,000 to 8,000 B.C.)</H3> groups are thought to have arrived in Kentucky at the end of the last ice age at least 14,000
years ago. The climate in Kentucky was much colder and wetter then.  Perhaps they came into the area on the
trail of large game such as mammoth, mastodon, or bison.  These animals not only provided meat, but skins
for shelter and clothing.  During this time period, people lived in small groups, which moved frequently. 
They often carried their belongings in skin bags and built temporary shelters poster for protection from the
elements.</P>

<P>The Paleoindian toolkit consisted of well-crafted spear points.  The size of these spear points reflect an
extensive knowledge of how to work and shape stone.  In addition to projectile points, flint knappers also
tools for scraping hides and wood.  It seems likely that Paleoindians also made tools from wood and animal
bones, but evidence for this has not survived in the archaeological record.   Little is known about the ritual or
ceremonial life of Paleoindians.</P>

By the <H4>Archaic (8,000 to 1,000 B.C.)</H4> period the climate had become more like it is today.   Climatic changes led to the extinction
of large animals, such as the mastodon and giant bison.  With the extinction of these animals Archaic hunters
turned their attention to smaller game such as deer, turkey, and rabbit.  They also collected wild plants for
food and medicine and began to grow small gardens.   Archaic groups made baskets for collecting,
transporting, and storing their food.</P>

<P> During the Archaic period people tended to live in one place for longer periods of time than they had
during the Paleoindian period.  However, they continued to have a mobile lifestyle, never staying in one place
for more than a few months.  These camps were located in areas where they could exploit a variety of
resources.  Smaller seasonal camps also were located in rockshelters.</P>

<P> Archaic hunters tipped thier spears with notched and stemmed, not fluted, stone spearpoints.  Thuse used
a spearthrower (atlatl) to improve the accuracy of their throwing.  Sandstone nutting stones found at their
camps imply that, as time based, they came to rely more on plants for food.  By 1,000 B.C., some Archaic
peoples had begun to experiment with growing their own food.  They let squash and small-seeded plants like
goosefoot grow on the trash heaps near their base camps.  Before long, Archaic women were planting seeds in
areas cleared especially for that purpose. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="larch.jpg" VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=360 ALIGN=LEFT></P>
<P> Archaic people had a rich and varied ritual and ceremonial life.  They may have performed rituals to
ensure a successful hunt and families would have gathered to pay their last respects to a deceased loved one.  
Objects made from marine shell or copper from the Great Lakes region were placed with some individuals. 
These items were obtained through exchange with other groups.  Others were interred with their favorite
spearthrower and decorated bone hair pins.</P>

<P> The <H3>Woodland (1,000 B.C. to A.D. 1000) </H3> period  is marked by the introduction of pottery.  Early pottery was anything
but portable.  It was thick, heavy and fragile.  However, pottery had definite advantages.  It could be used for
cooking, and could be made water tight.  Surplus food could be sealed into it to protect it from pests.  The use
of baskets, gourds and other containers continued.</P>

<P>During the Woodland period, more time was devoted to gardening and cultivated plants became an
important component of the diet.  Plants, such as squash, sunflower, goosefoot, and maygrass are shown
growing.  Woodland peoples also hunted a variety of animals and collect wild plants.  They also tended to
build bigger houses and to live in larger communities.</p>

<P>Woodland religious and ceremonial life is reflected by the construction of large earthen enclosures and
mounds.  Religious ceremonies were often performed within circular earthen enclosures. Burial mounds were
constructed over several decades.  Within these mounds some individuals were placed in logs tombs.  Copper
bracelets and mica cresents placed with some of these individuals reflects their status within Woodland
society.  It also indicates that Woodland peoples participated in long-distance exchange networks.  Tobacco,
which was grown by Woodland garderns was smoked at important events.  During the Woodland period
people also began to explore caves, such as Mammoth Cave.</p>

<p>Late in the Woodland period, the bow and arrow was developed.  For the first time small, true arrowheads
replaced spear points, although spears continued to be made and used.   The use of groundstone tools
continued, and was especially important in the processing of corn.  Stone celts were an improvement on the
grooved axe. </P>

</P>
By the <H3>Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1000 to 1750)</H3> period, village life revolved around the planting, growing, and harvesting of
corn and beans.  These  plants supplied the Mississippian people of western Kentucky and Fort
Ancient peoples of eastern Kentucky with as much as 60% of their diet.   Late Prehistoric peoples added the
hoe to their tool kit to work their agricultural fields.</p>
<P> New pottery vessel forms were developed during this period.  They included jars, bowls, plates, bottles,
and colanders.  Handles were added to jars and human and animal effigies were attached to some bowls and
bottles.</P>

During the Late Prehistoric period people began to construct rectangular houses.  They also began to live in
large year-round settlements, many of which were stockade.   As many as 2,000 people may have lived in
some of the large towns.  These communities were ruled by hereditary chiefs, who lived on large platform mounds near the center
of the community.</P>

<P>Late Prehistoric religious and ceremonial life is reflected in part by the figures depicted on engraved shell

<P>The arrival of Europeans on America's eastern shores brought this story to a close.  Long before the first
explorers and traders arrived, items of European manufacture filtered through the trade networks.  Diseases,
many previously unknown to the native residents, also outraced the Europeans arrival in Kentucky.  These
diseases often wiped out entire villages, and native population levels rapidly decreased.  By the mid 1700's
only a handful of native settlements survived in Kentucky.  By the early nineteenth century, the Native
American had all but disappeared from Kentucky.  Their tradition lives on in descendants who were exiled to
other states when the area was settled by Euro-americans and those who continue to live in Kentucky today. 
Their heritage survives in Kentucky's rich archaeological record.</P>
