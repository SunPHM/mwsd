The following set of coaching tips will help any player of any level to become a more effective and successful player. The following set of tips looks at the importance of the front court game.<P>

To upgrade your squash, when the basics have already been learned, it is necessary to acquire the fundamental tactics of game situations.<P> 

You can't become a top player without an effective, attacking front court game. It is an essential part of modern squash. The front court game plays a very important role in squash. In fact it is most often the essential part of the winning tactics of a player at any level: to make an opponent run, to put pressure, to attack on loose returns searching for winners etc. The idea of the front court game is naturally to hit the ball in a way that it remains in the front court area. Usually, the goal is also to make it bounce on the floor as near to the front wall as possible and/or to make the ball cling to the side wall or die in the side wall - floor junction (nick) so as to make the opponent run the maximum distance.<BR>

<img src="images/image1.gif" align="Right" alt="" border="0">
<BR>
Drop shots, straight or cross court, hit after the ball has bounced or on volley, should be executed with a good cut (back-spin) . Recently, top players have introduced another type of drop shot, sometimes also hit relatively hard, a deceptive cross-court shot. When executing this shot a player shapes for a straight drop, but changes it as the last moment into a shot which sends the ball cross-court and which would make it bounce twice before reaching the opposite side wall, if the opponent doesn't play it.<P>

<B>How to correctly hold your racket and manipulating it for best results.</B><BR>


Smooth movement in a squash court in essential for winning squash. Keep in mind that not only is the correct foot needed, but how you take that crucial step.<P>

Everyone should know a forehand shot is off a left foot and a backhand shot is off a right foot. But, did you know that most players place their feet incorrectly.<P>

What does that mean?<BR>
Let's say your opponent hits a crosscourt from the right-hand serve box area to the left-hand serve box area. You anticipate the shot and move towards the ball, striking a backhand off your right foot. Perfect! Is this all that's needed? The answer is no. This is because for most of us anticipation and correct footwork is not enough to speed us up. There is an ingredient missing.<P>

<img src="images/image2.gif" align="Left" alt="" border="0">
<BR>

When you twist to step towards a shot, never let your knee rise too high off the ground. Learn to skim the surface, without touching it, with the bottom of your sneakers. Many shots have passed me until I discovered that I didn't need to raise my knee, but that I needed to keep my feet as close to the ground as possible as I ran. This eliminated the hang time created by high stepping to balls.<P>

With your feet closer to the ground as you move, you'll discover that running this way will get you less fatigued and get you to the ball faster, especially for those hard passing shots.<P>



<B>The importance of watching the ball</B><BR>
All professionals say "watch the ball". But, did you know that there is a certain way of watching the ball. During a rally your opponent will be either in front, behind, or parallel to you. There is only one way to watch in each of these circumstances.<P>

When your opponent is in front of you, it is easy to see where and when your opponent is going to hit the ball. The secret is to stay as close to your opponent as possible, without crowding, as he or she is striking the ball. This adds mental pressure to your opponent because by doing this your opponent knows you're ready, especially for a drop. If your opponent is in front, remember the drop is the most likely shot to be executed. And this means trouble. So get close to your opponent when he or she is in front of you.<P>

When your opponent is next to you or behind you, try not to look directly at the ball. Use your peripheral vision. The reason to do this is that it may be physically impossible to follow a fast crosscourt and turn your head at the same time. Use your eyeballs instead of your head and neck. A good reference point is the serve line that runs across the floor of the court. Follow the ball with your eye to this line and then lock your eye at the serve line area and let your peripheral vision track the ball to your opponent's racquet. The only exception is if you've hit a high length shot that comes off high on the backwall. In this instance you need to watch your opponent closely. Just make sure you're watching from the front while on the "T".<P>

<B>Tactics</B><BR>
There are two types of squash strategies. One is the offensive attacking game, and the other is the patient defensive game. The offensive game is primarily all imaginable squash shots close to the floor of the court. The defensive game is primarily all imaginable squash shots that linger up high in the court. One strategy uses the lower court area while the other focuses on the upper court area. The lower court encompasses 75% of all squash shots, while the upper court utilizes only 25% of all squash shots. To build a strong overall squash game, we need to focus on the often-neglected upper court.<P>

Two things need to be kept in mind when concerning the upper court. The first is learning to utilize the upper area by hitting shots that have high contact points on the frontwall. The second is returning a shot that lingers in the upper area of the court. One is execution - the other is retrieving.<P>

The best upper court shot is the lob. Therefore, the lob must be perfected! This shot is best executed from the front of the court. Usually when retrieving a high drop or boast.<P>

When hitting a lob, make sure it makes contact with the front wall approximately one meter above the service line. Also, try to hit crosscourt lobs at first. A good lob has a significant arc. Since the purpose of upper court shots is to extend the time between an exchange, the ball should linger in the air as long as possible. The lobbed ball should deflect off the sidewall one meter from the backwall.<P>

Because the lob can die in the backcorner, the lob can become one of the most devastating shot in your arsenal. If executed correctly, the lob will get you back to the T. The lob can also break you out of any fast paced rally by abruptly changing the tempo.<P>

The difficulty regarding the lob is that it can't be practiced alone. Of course, one can try, but it should be combined in a sequence of shots using a rail, a boast and then a lob. It's important to keep the ball warm or else your touch will be off. But, practicing with two players is easy. One player boasts while the other lobs. The ball remains warm, and the rapid succession of attempts only improves your accuracy.<P>

The next shot is the crosscourt that deflects high off the sidewall into your opponent. This shot should only be attempted when your opponent is in the backcourt and close to the sidewall. If this type of crosscourt is hit when your opponent is in front, he or she can volley it before the ball reaches the deflection point. Also, if your opponent is not next to the sidewall and more in the middle, he or she can let the ball go to the backwall. If this happens, you become trapped as the path of the ball revolves into the middle of the backcourt.<P>

<img src="images/image5.gif" align="Left" alt="" border="0">
<BR>

These are just two examples of the types of shots you can use in the upper area of the court. In short, any high shot that lingers out of your opponent's reach, namely his or her sweet spot, will have the same effect.<P>

The main points are that upper court shots change the pace, get you back in position, and use less energy. In the long run, you'll confuse your opponent, add pressure by getting back to the T more efficiently, and have more stamina for the rest of the match. Although this sounds easy, upper court shots require a great deal of accuracy and timing. Practicing is the first step. The next is to make a conscious effort to use upper court shots during a match.<P>

Remember to stay cool and maintain good concentration at all times. Championship squash starts in your head. Only then can you effectively incorporate tactics.<P>

When attempting upper court shots, notice the lag time between exchanges. Observe how the rhythm is interrupted. Also, become aware of your opponent's reaction. Discover how the soft arc of a lob can add tremendous pressure during a point.<P>

Let's change scenarios. If your opponent attempts to use this strategy against you, remember that upper court shots are your opponent's way of getting back in position. You need to keep yourself out of the danger by reciprocating with an upper court shot yourself. As your opponent tries to buy time and gets you out of position, you need to buy time with a lingering upper court shot to neutralize his or her attempt for control of the rally.<P>

Although, lower court shots like a drop and a boast can slow the pace, upper court shots like the lob and high crosscourts are better ways of getting back to the T after a blistering exchange of fast shots.<P>

Winning a point using devastating power and fast exchanges can feel great. But, keep in mind that the best players can not only hit with sustained fast pace but also can lob and use the upper court to retain position. Besides, Pace falls drastically behind Position by comparison in a squash professional's rulebook. Furthermore, winning a single rally is not the goal - it's winning the match!<P>

So, don't sacrifice 25% of your squash game by neglecting the upper court area. Believe me, it will eventually come back to haunt you. My advice is to build a stronger squash game by using high upper court shots as part of your strategy starting today.<P>


<B>The Stroke</B><BR>
The most important element of your squash game is your stroke. There are several areas we need to discuss regarding a proper squash stroke.<P>

First, you need to find your particular sweet spot. This has nothing to do with the racquet. It is the specific area of contact in the motion of the swing that produces your maximum punch. Depending on your height, weight and athleticism, this point can vary. No one has the same favorite point of contact. Discovering this point will be the best thing you'll ever do for your overall squash game. But, keep in mind that it may take years to fine-tune your swing so that this point actually reveals itself. The best method in discovering your particular sweet spot is practicing alone.<P>

Second, once you discover your sweet spot, you must shorten your swing. The shortest swing that can get the same job done will undoubtedly use less time and energy for shot execution. Furthermore, this means you'll have a better attacking game when you need it. So compact your stroke by remembering to keep your elbow in and to use your wrist as much as possible. Raise your shoulders, making your head position lower between them. Keep your knees bent and stay in the crouch position. A good practice technique is to crouch and have your elbow and knee meet at the point of contact with the ball. Not all players can do this. But, with time and with good footwork, it can be done. Practicing volleys can also help shorten your swing. But, the wrist is the best mechanism in getting your swing and power to potential.<P>

<img src="images/image01.gif" align="Right" alt="" border="0">
<BR>

The third element of the squash stroke is your grip. Your hand can squeeze tightly and loosen on command. In squash, the control you have over your grip is crucial when making contact with the ball. A tight grip at the exact point of contact and then a looser grip in the follow-through are the desired goal. You must be aware of your sense of touch to attain this kind of grip coordination. Your racquet control will be at its best if you can sense when to tighten and loosen your grip during a stroke. Some players like a relatively tight grip throughout the stroke. Most pros will recommend this in the front of the court when time is restricted and when optimum control is needed or in a full power shot. But overall, a constant tight grip will weaken your arm as the match progresses. Learning to tighten your grip at the point of impact takes practice and conscious effort.<P>

The secret in practicing alone is to isolate a specific aspect of your swing. For example, practice grip control in one session, and in another try to focus on a more compact swing.<P>

Finally, keep in mind that all squash players have two types of strokes that need an equal amount of attention. You must incorporate and develop all three elements of the squash swing to both your backhand and forehand!<P>

The sweet spots, compactness and grip may vary considerably for both the backhand and forehand. Therefore, developing each side evenly over the course of your squash progression will undoubtedly be a challenge. Your test is to keep both sides balanced as you chart your course through the higher levels of play. Not an easy test! So keep in mind, a great forehand means more backhand practice to balance the sides and visa versa. Both sides must be equal in strength and shot control not only today but also a year from now. My advice is to keep everything evenly balanced at all times by practicing each of the six areas - one at a time.<P>

If an uneven backhand or forehand develops, as it most likely will, your overall squash strategy will be affected. For example, a strong forehand and weak backhand will affect the way you concentrate. Meaning that the weaker backhand will subconsciously make you look more attentively for backhand protection. Once this happens, you're immediately in the defensive by defending your backhand more so than your forehand.<P>

When both strokes are equal in strength, only then can you focus on building an effective squash strategy. The pros know this is the only way to play squash at its best!<P>


<B>Training</B><BR>
Squash is a fast sport which may last a long time without a rest break, and so athletes must have good aerobic fitness to last the distance. Because of this the emphasis for much of the year is on aerobic training. There are times in the year, however, when the emphasis will be on strength work. Planning the training year to make sure all aspects are attended in relation to the time of competition ensures maximum fitness gains. This planning or "periodisation" also builds in time for recovery and off season workouts.<P>

Although training is done mostly as a group, each athlete has an individualised program which is tailored to suit their particular needs and depends on training age, tournament commitments etc.<P>

<B>Weekly training sessions include:</B><BR>
Aerobic training, squash, running, water running, cycling, and on court "ghosting" manoeuvres or a combination of one or more. Resistance work in the gym. On court skills drills and coaching.<P>

<B>Stretching</B><BR>

How to stretch? Remember a couple of important things.<BR> 
Stretching can be a very beneficial part of your exercise program, as it assists in increasing muscle and joint flexibility, helps prevent injuries and can also help maintain good posture. Stretching is most effective when the muscles and joints are warm, so do them after you exercise. Some people also find it beneficial to do some stretching exercising after a warm shower or bath.<BR>

<UL>
<li>Move into the stretch position whilst keeping your back straight. You should feel slight tension, but never pain.</li>
<li>Hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds-do not bounce the stretch as this may cause injury.</li>
<li>Keep breathing! This may sound obvious, but you should not hold breath while performing the stretch.</li>
<li>Don't forget to cool down a little before you stop exercising. Spend a few minuets doing some slow walking whilst letting your heart rate come down.</li></UL><BR>
