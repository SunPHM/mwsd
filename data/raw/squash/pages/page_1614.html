    </font> <font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b><font size="4">It is hard to believe 
    today,</font></b>, with the U.S. junior girls' team reaching fifth in the 
    world, that the distaff side of squash in America was once ignored. Women 
    took up squash in substantial numbers after the First World War, as the sport 
    got itself organized, but they mostly stayed on the doubles court which was 
    deemed more delicate and less taxing. </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b><font color="#0000CC">ELIO SEARS</font></b><br>
    The first men's championship was held in 1907, but it wasn't until 1928 that 
    there was a ladies national singles tournament. Miss Eleo Sears, naturally, 
    won the first title. Eleonora Randolph Sears was considered one of the greatest 
    athletes of the twentieth century. She was a Boston blue blood who won the 
    U.S. national tennis doubles four times and the mixed doubles twice (her uncle, 
    Dick Sears, won the first seven national men's singles), was the first woman 
    to fly an airplane over water, was, in 1909, the first woman to ride astride 
    a horse in a major polo match and in her fifties walked in eight and a half 
    hours the forty-two miles from Fontainbleau to the Ritz Bar in Paris. May 
    I have a cosmopolitan, please? </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Most women were not Eleo Sears and needed a 
    little bit of coaching to excel at the fast and furious <img src="../../photos/history/bramhall.jpg" width="212" height="287" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">game 
    of squash. But there was no one to do the job. All teaching professionals 
    were men, and they concentrated on their livelihood, male players. All except 
    for Norm Bramall-who coached the most U.S. national champions in history. 
    </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Born in Philadelphia to a father who sold cotton 
    and fuel oil, Norman Barge (that's a tough-looking middle name) Bramall was 
    raised on the tennis court. In 1920 he led West Philadelphia High to a league 
    championship with a renowned chopstroke forehand. Skipping higher education, 
    Bramall ran a sporting goods business and started coaching the Quaker boys 
    at Haverford College (he was varsity tennis coach there for forty-one years, 
    compiling a 307-157 record, thirty-two winning seasons, and winning eight 
    league championships).</font><font size="2" face="Tahoma">He also joined in 
    1922 the Cynwyd Club in Bala Cynwyd, just over the line from Philadelphia 
    and soon started running their tennis program. His most famous pupil was Vic 
    Seixas, who won at Wimbledon and Forest Hills. </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b><font color="#0000CC">CYNWYD CLUB BEGINNINGS</font></b><br>
    In 1939 Bramall got some squash courts installed at the club and began instructing 
    pupils in the game. Somehow he revealed the right mixture of sensitivity and 
    discipline that made women comfortable and driven, and he started putting 
    out a string of national champions. He learned the trick from Cecile Bowes, 
    married to a man named LaRoche, but called by all Babe. She was the only player 
    to challenge Anne Page, the first dominant American woman, and four times, 
    in 1938, 1940, 1941 and 1948 she was able to defeat Page and take the nationals. 
    </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b><font color="#0000CC">SEVEN CHAMPIONS</font></b><br>
    Babe was already winning championships before Bramall appeared but he saw 
    how she and her unofficial coach, Frank Zook, a Cynwyd Club member, interacted. 
    Bramall's first true creation was Jane Austin who won the nationals in 1951; 
    then came Lois Dilks in 1954; Margaret Varner in 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1963; 
    Ann Wetzel in 1964; Joyce Davenport in 1965 and 1969; Carol Thesieres in 1971; 
    and Barbara Maltby in 1980 and 1981. </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Not counting Babe, that is seven different champions 
    and a title in five different decades. (You can also add Betty Meade who filled 
    out the Sixties championships with titles in 1966, 1967 and 1968; Meade was 
    a Cynwyd Club member but didn't train regularly with Bramall.) </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Consider this: a third of the women inducted 
    into the U.S. Squash Hall of Fame in its 2000 inaugural <img src="../../photos/history/cynwydwomen.jpg" width="438" height="321" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">class 
    were taught by Bramall. Cornering the market on hardware, Bramall pupils continued 
    beyond the national women's singles. A Bramall product was a part of the national 
    women's doubles championship duo twenty-two times and the same number of times 
    for the national mixed doubles. Joyce Davenport has won the 35s women's singles 
    six times, the 40s three times, the 45s twice and the national doubles nine 
    times and national mixed doubles six times, as well as run for years </font>

  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">the Berwyn Squash & Nautilus Club. Ann Wetzel 
    won four national doubles with four different partners and then coached the 
    University of Pennsylvania women's squash team for decades, where she taught 
    such famous players like Alicia McConnell and Karen Kelso. </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b><font color="#0000CC">GAIL RAMSAY</font></b><br>
        Gail Ramsay, the greatest Bramall protégé never to win a national singles, 
        won the intercollegiates a record four times (no other woman or man has 
        ever done that), took three doubles titles and seven mixed titles, six 
        with her brother Bill, and for years coached at the Park Avenue Racquet 
        & Fitness Club and now coaches at Princeton. Bramall also coached the 
        U.S. to a 3-2 victory over England in the 1959 Wolfe-Noel Cup. </font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Records and his knack for teaching great teachers 
    aside, what was Bramall like? He was five feet seven, small in stature but 
    not in presence. He kept faith with traditions---he quit Haverford in 1968 
    when his players appeared with long hair and beards---but he felt women had 
    as much right to swing a squash racquet as men. </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">He had an intuitive sense of how to motivate 
    and placate and encourage women. Five of his seven national titleholders hit, 
    or missed, their first squash ball with Bramall on the court.</font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> "The motto I remember most from Norm was 'The 
    walls are your friends,'" says Carol Thesieres, who started playing squash 
    in the early 1960s. "I met Norm in college at an intercollegiate tournament. 
    He came up to me and said, 'If you ever move to Philadelphia, please come 
    to the Cynwyd Club. I'd like to teach you squash.' I had never played before, 
    except hitting once for fun on a double court. Norm was very instrumental 
    in my growth. He was so unselfish with his time. He'd go around introducing 
    us to the male members of the club, helping us get matches. We were good friends. 
    I always took my children over to his home around Christmas."</font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> "Norm was quite old when he started training 
    me," says Barbara Maltby, a Hall of Famer who revolutionized women's squash 
    with her dedication to strength and fitness. "Yet he was incredibly supportive. 
    He was very positive and very straightforward. 'Make the walls your friend,' 
    he would always say. He was never pushy. He could watch people and see who 
    had the inner determination necessary to win. You can't give that to somebody, 
    but you can teach them the game." </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">In 1967 Bramall co-wrote, along with Margaret 
    Varner, another Hall of Famer, Squash Racquets (Dubuque, Iowa: Wm. C. Brown, 
    Co.). It was a part of a physical education activities series, over thirty 
    books on everything from archery to wrestling. Chapter Four, "Progress Can 
    Be Speeded Up," was a firecracker in the gloomy nightsky of the usual squash 
    guidebooks. Bramall recommended hours of practice alone in the court. This 
    was his secret to grooming so many national champions. One of his mottos was 
    taken from George Munger, the old football coach at Penn: "Tell 'em once, 
    make 'em practice it a thousand times."</font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> "He never raised his voice," says Varner. "He 
    always made you feel good and happy and he made winning fun. But, boy, did 
    he ever make you practice alone in the court, hours hitting the same stroke. 
    I was thirty years old when I started and twice a week I took lessons at the 
    Cynwyd Club with Norm and they were hard, lonely work, but they made me a 
    champion."</font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"> <font color="#0000CC"><b>JANE STAUFFER</b></font><br>
    Of all his "squash queens," as they were sometimes dubbed, Jane Austin Stauffer 
    was his most special. She was his first national champion and a close friend. 
    "I was taking tennis lessons from him and around 1945 he said, 'Let's go into 
    a squash court and see how you hit a squash ball.' Norm was very inspiring. 
    Everything he said was encouraging. You had to work, work hard---a lot of 
    drills, perfecting shots---but he loved helping us. It was unusual, especially 
    in that era. All the girls would say this." In 1951 Stauffer beat future Hall 
    of Famer Betty Howe Constable in the finals, 15-12 in the fifth. It was a 
    huge upset. Constable had beaten Stauffer in the finals the year before and 
    was thought to be invincible. </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">"It was very exciting for me but I think Norm 
    was even more thrilled. It was his dream to coach a woman to a national championship. 
    </font> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">In 1984 Bramall officially retired from coaching, 
    but he still came by the club most afternoons and gave a few lessons. In March 
    1990 his wife Mildred died. Three weeks later, on Easter Sunday, Norm Bramall 
    died at his home at the age of eighty-nine. "You taught us how to accept winning 
    and losing with equal grace," Stauffer eulogized at his graveside funeral. 
    "You always said, "If you lose, I expect you to shake hands. I expect you 
    to congratulate your opponent. It's her day. But for you, I see another day 
    coming.'" </font>
