<H4><EM>The Rediff Interview</EM> / Rajeev Bagga</H4>
<H3>'The game never allowed me to catch up with the books'</H3>
<P>
<font size=+2>W</font>ho should be the sportsperson of the century? There will be many
contenders 
and numerous debates over who is the best... and why. However, when it came
to select the 'Sportsman of the Century for the Deaf', the vote was unanimous: our own Rajeev Bagga.
<P>
Bagga did India proud when he was selected as the 'Deaflympian of the Century' by the Committee International des Sports des Sourds' (CISS), also known as International Deaflympic Committee. Laurels are not new to the genial athlete, who's been at the helm of the 
Indian badminton scene for over a decade, winning prestigious events 
individually, as well as helping the country reach greater heights. He is
the only deaf player to have won the Indian National Championship twice -
in 1992 and '93 respectively.
<P><IMG SRC="23bagga.jpg" ALT="Rajeev Bagga" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=165 HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2 BORDER=0 ALIGN=left>
An Arjuna award winner in 1993, the 34-year-old Mumbaite has been
consistency personified when it comes to winning gold medals, having
fetched a total of 12 golds in the four Deaf Olympic Games respectively in 1989
(New Zealand), 1993 (Bulgaria), 1997 (Denmark) and recently the 2001 Deaf Games
in Italy.
<P>
Born deaf, Rajeev was lucky to have a sports-loving family,
with almost all his folks having played sport at some level. Also, his
father being in the army served well for him, as the virtues of camaraderie,
giving a helping hand, fighting spirit and killer instinct, to name a few, have 
been reflected in his personality during his illustrious career.
<P>
"He is dedicated, always focussed on the court and has shown tremendous 
sportsman’s spirit time and again,” says Brigadier S R Bagga, Rajeev’s 
father. “Many times, against senior players during national level games,
when Rajeev was on the verge of winning matches, and the chair umpire gave a 
wrong line call, which actually was in Rajeev’s favour, he didn’t get
upset, but accepted the umpire’s decision, only to bounce back and win the
match.”
<P>
That the father has been a major force behind his success can be seen
from the fact Bagga Senior is as involved as Rajeev himself.
<P>
Curious to know more about how this gifted sportsperson fought off his 
impairment in his struggle to the top, <B>Nagraj Gollapudi</B> caught up with
the great player. Excerpts:
<P>

<B>How does it feel to be the Deaflympian of the Century?</B>
<P>
Just great! This is an honour for the country and so I
feel very proud.
<P>
<B>What does this rare honour mean to you and the other impaired 
sports persons? Also, is there anyone you would like to dedicate this award
to?</B>
<P>
It gives me great pride to be the sportsman of the century for the 
Deaf. From the messages being received, I am sure other impaired persons
are indeed inspired and sharing the pride for the country. I have no doubt
that we will have more participation in the game. I want to dedicate this award to late Shri S.K Sinha, who was the live
wire in the All-India Sports Council for the Deaf, and was responsible for 
inclusion of badminton in the sports for the deaf. I have already written
to the general secretary to have my proposal accepted by their managing 
committee.
<P>
<B>How has your family helped you through your struggle to the top?</B>
<P>
All my family members have indeed been a source of inspiration. But
my mother's contribution stands out the most.
<P>
<B>Take us back to the time when you just started hitting the 'bird'?</B>
<P><IMG SRC="23bagga1.jpg" ALT="Bagga in his early days" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=267 HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>
Looking back, I used to play all racket games - table tennis, tennis,
badminton and squash. In most of these sports, I started taking part in local tournaments, and slowly raised the level into higher competition. My initial success came in the game of squash when I won the Western India 
title and the National title, in the sub-junior category in 1981, when I
was 13 years old. But I decided to leave squash, to shift to a game where my 
eyesight would be more effective than hearing. Though I did play tennis at
the state level, I finally decided to take up badminton because I used to 
enjoy the games.
<P>
One of the important reasons why I would excel at sport was that it 
runs in my blood. My father was a fairly good sportsperson; mother a state
level player, sister was university champion and brother an all-rounder,
who took part at the National level in squash, sailing and karate. He defeated
me in the final of a badminton tournament organized for the Rajeev Trophy, 
instituted by my father in 1981, at the Pune Military Engineering College 
(CME).
<P>
<B>In the beginning, how did you feel while playing against the non-deaf? How difficult is it for an impaired person to compete in the big league?</B>
<P>
In India, we do not have exclusive clubs for the hearing impaired.
Even the discipline of badminton was included in the sports for the deaf only
in 1988. So I played all the games with hearing persons. I got used to 
playing with normal people, although in the beginning there were some 
difficulties I faced, like I could not hear the score, or shout of the 
partner in the double games, or shout of the umpire or the linesman.
During the coaching/training camps the lectures and instructions of the 
coach just went over my shoulders. I learnt more by watching top players
or through personal attention by the coach, and a lot while playing in tandem 
with the country’s top doubles players like Leroy D’Sa, Sanjay Sharma and
Uday Pawar. I even partnered the great Prakash Padukone once in Abu Dhabi.
<P>
<B>Can you think of any anecdotes or strange happenings on and off the 
court which happened with you?</B>
<P>
For the game of the deaf visual scoring system is a must, and 
exaggerated signs of the linesman and instructions in sign language are
the basic features. Once, during my match (sub-junior state level) it was
announced and a walkover given, but I was still present on the court.
Over the years, as I graduated to the national level, strange things were 
still happening with me on court. At a national level match (don’t 
remember which one), with mental counting of the score, I crossed over to 
the other side, thinking the game was over, only to be reminded by the 
surprised umpire that the score was 13 and not 15.
<P>
Then during a television interview at Malmo in Sweden, where I had gone to take
part in the Swedish Open, I was asked, 'Why do you play with hearing persons?' I replied, "I am a 
sportsman and will play with any sportsperson, may he or she be hearing or
not."
<P>
You played in the big league and were the at the top of Indian  
badminton in the early nineties. Talk us through your highs and lows, on 
both the international and national stage?
<P>
After squash, I shifted to badminton when I was still 13 years old. From sub-junior through junior to senior and then the national title, it was indeed a great struggle. A few things that come to the mind are:
a) Junior Nationals at Kota 1984: On account of the assassination of the
then prime minister Smt. Indira Gandhi, the remaining matches were curtailed to
one game of 21 and had to be completed in one day. I was taking part in three 
events; singles, doubles and mixed doubles. My match in one or the other 
event was being announced every half hour. I was getting tired as I 
progressed to the quarter-final and semi-final stages. I was advised to
give a walkover in doubles and mixed doubles, to concentrate on the singles
title. As a sportsman, I refused to sacrifice my partners, (they had come only
for the paired events) for the sake of the singles title. This gesture was
well-appreciated, but, unfortunately, I lost in all the finals.
<P>
b) Badminton versus studies: Just graduating to senior level, I could
not cope up with both, playing the competitive game and my studies for the board 
examinations. After discussing with my family, I decided to leave the
books aside for six months, which would enable me to do well at the senior
level. And I did! Five consecutive senior state level titles, leading on to an 
important victory in my life at the Nationals, during 1987. But since then 
the game never allowed me to catch up with the books.
<P>
c) International level: My first outing was in 1985, where as a junior I 
played against Waranata of Indonesia in the semi-finals. Incidentally, he, 
with an average of 100 matches per year, reached the top in the world and,
I, with not more than five to six outings per year, reached a maximum world 
ranking of 36 in 1992. Since 1985, I never looked back and was a regular 
member of the Indian team in all prestigious events - ABC, Thomas Cup, 
Commonwealth Games or the World Championships. I consider my best match to
be the third round qualification tie in the All-England Championships, against the then seasoned Korean Ahen Chang in 1990. I just about managed
to scrape through in the third game to become the first deaf player to make
the finals in the 80-year history of the championships.
<P><IMG SRC="23bagga2.jpg" ALT="Rajeev with his Idol" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=181 HSPACE=2 VSPACE=2 BORDER=1 ALIGN=left>
Without doubt, Prakash Padukone has been my idol. Besides being a great player, he is a good 
person, modest and generous. I loved to play opposite him because it used
to be a game of learning. As for the financial support, I had been lucky 
because my employer, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd., which always supported me.
<P>
<B>What's been the Badminton Association of India's support to you?</B>
<P>
The BAI, with its limitations, did provide me due support and I had been a 
member of almost all the teams. However, there was some controversy about
my 
participation in the World Deaf Games in Bulgaria in 1993, and the
selection for the World Cup, held in India in the same year. At that time the media 
had said a lot about the issue. It is not proper for me to say anything 
further. Let me add that the BAI at present is much better geared to look
after the players’ needs.
<P>
<B>Since your can be called a veteran (<I>we know you are still young</I> ) of
Indian badminton, what should be done so that our country can make an
impact in the big events, like the Thomas and Uber Cups and the All-England  
Championships?</B>
<P>
India’s inability in the past to make a mark in the big events seems
to have been well-analyzed and corrective measures taken. The administrators 
should provide proper team management, appoint international players as 
coaches, and even provide personal coaches and physiotherapists in addition
to giving more exposure to players, which goes without saying. A player 
should not be left alone to fend for himself/herself. Other aspects that
may be looked into are to gear up the required motivation, psychological
needs of individual players and create specialist double combinations.
<P>
<B>Since you have been part of many an Indian doubles combination why 
cannot we perform well in the paired  events. Any particular reason?</B>
<P>
Where are the fixed paired combinations at the lower level to throw up
serious combinations at the senior level? I have played with different 
partners (Sanjay Sharma, Leroy D’Sa, Uday Pawar, Vinod Kumar) both at 
national and international level and also mixed doubles with different 
partners. We used to have partners of convenience. But I understand that 
remedial actions have been taken. With more incentive and proper
motivation, and, of course, proper coaching, we should do well in paired events in the 
future.
<P>
<B>What do you think about the current crop of  youngsters on the
national badminton scene?</B>
<P>
Basically, all the players at the top are good material to go far; of 
course, given the right motivation, personal coaches and attention to 
individual psychological aspects, they can do a much better job.
<P>
<B>If you are appointed the coach of India how can you bring about a  
change?</B>
<P>
Indeed, a difficult question, and at the same time a bit vague. In
India, it is the federation that activates the policies. The coach can do his
best within his limits. As mentioned earlier, I would like top players to have 
personal coaches, and a physiotherapist to marry up with players from
the training stage. I feel a top player should aim at practicing one or two aspects in
different training games. Each time play the practice game with a specific purpose.
<P>
<B>What are your plans for the future?</B>
<P>
I have not yet retired from the active game; just finished playing the 
state championships. But I would like to give back to the game in any 
capacity possible. I may take part as a veteran as and when time comes. As
regards my deaf fraternity, I will keep on playing for them and, at the
same time, try and provide a base for deaf players who would ensure India’s hold
on the game at the World Games for the Deaf.
<P>
<B>What is your advice to the youngsters of Indian badminton, especially
the impaired ones?</B>
<P>
My advice to all players is to never refuse a game to your junior 
players; there is always something to learn from weaker players also.
Always set a purpose before starting a practice game.
For deaf players, we have to provide facilities for their training.
However, having said that, they should make use of the facilities at hand. And, of 
course, try to take part in tournaments, where they can compete with
normal players.
