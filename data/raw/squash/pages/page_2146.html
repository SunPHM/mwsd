Nostalgic memories linger when chestnuts appear each fall. Some of our parents and grandparents still recall past holiday seasons with street vendors selling roasted chestnuts on the sidewalks of New York and Philadelphia as well as in many smaller cities. For just a few pennies people could buy bags of hot chestnuts they ate as a warming snack while they shopped or strolled along the streets.
<P></P>
Well before the Pilgrims arrived on the Eastern shores, the American chestnut tree stood as a mighty monument, many over100 feet tall, their trunks measuring five feet or more in diameter. Members of the Fagaceae family, chestnut trees formed the forests that grew from Maine in New England all the way south to Florida and spreading westward to Michigan. There's an old saying that the chestnut forests were so thick a squirrel could jump from chestnut tree to chestnut tree from Georgia to New York without ever touching the ground. 
<P></P>
Even Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was impressed by the magnificence of the chestnut tree when he wrote his poem, The Village Blacksmith in 1842, which begins "Under the spreading chestnut, the village smithy stands."
<P></P>
Chestnut trees are often confused with the horse chestnut, the beech, and chestnut oak, none of which bear fruit. American chestnuts grow three nuts to a burr, an impressive looking fruit about the size of a baseball with a fuzzy lining surrounding the nuts.
<P></P>
American chestnut trees provided sustenance to humans and animals in numerous ways. Chestnuts were a dietary staple of the American Indians who taught the Pilgrims to cook them in stews or grind them into flour for bread. 
<P></P>
Chestnuts meant survival to many Appalachian communities. There, small animals like squirrels and birds along with bears and deer feasted on the chestnuts, some storing them for the winter. In early summer the ridge tops along the Appalachians were covered in white. Those who were familiar with the chestnut trees recognized that the copious white blooms meant a great chestnut harvest ahead. During the autumn harvest season residents of the area stored sacks full of chestnuts in their cellars as provisions for the winter.
<P></P>

Because chestnut trees grew straight, tall, and branchless for nearly 50 feet, loggers found them highly saleable. Like the sturdy redwoods they were also resistant to rot and could be used for nearly everything from telegraph poles, railroad ties, and shingles to musical instruments, fine furniture, and paneling. After the harvest the surplus ripe chestnuts were packed into railroad cars and shipped eastward to the large cities.
<P></P>
Several varieties of European chestnut trees were imported to this country in 1799. Thomas Jefferson brought some cuttings of European variety to Monticello and grafted them onto American trees. Eleuthere Irenee DuPont de Nemours brought several varieties from France which he hybridized. Later he imported more trees and did more hybridization. He is most famous for establishing a gunpowder factory in Wilmington, Delaware. His heirs built the company into the present DuPont chemical empire. By1889 there were many hybridized American-European chestnut varieties growing here. 
<P></P>

In the late1880s others were importing and grafting chestnut trees from Japan including Luther Burbank who imported 10,000 nuts for hybridizing. His trees reached many nurseries that sold the hybridized Japanese chestnut trees through catalogs. Trees were popping up all over the East, especially in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. 
<P></P>
Today two of the Japanese chestnut trees imported in1876 are still growing in Connecticut, one at the Bee and Thistle Inn in Old Lyme and one behind the Congregational Church in Cheshire. Two Chinese varieties imported in 1900 still survive, one in the Durand-Eastman Park in Rochester, New York, and the other at the Bartlett Arboretum in Stamford, Connecticut.

<P></P>
Hardy though the mighty chestnut was, it fell prey to a deadly fungus from the Asian trees. In 1904 the first infected trees were found in New York City along the avenues of the Bronx Zoo. Spreading quickly, the fungus found no resistance along its path as it destroyed all the chestnut trees of the eastern forests. By 1950, chestnut root sprouts that also became infected with the fungus were all that remained. A plant researcher found that the blight also affected the chestnut trees in Japan and China, but since they seemed resistant to the disease, it didn't destroy them. 
<P></P>
In the early 1930s researchers, in their effort to restore the chestnut forests, were offering hybrid species to New England homeowners. So far many of these trees have survived the harsh winters without suffering blight.
<P></P>
The American Chestnut Foundation , founded in 1983, hopes to restore the American chestnut to its original stature in the Eastern forests. After decades of attempting to create a blight-resistant chestnut tree, researchers are just now developing techniques that cross our American chestnut with several Asian species in the hope that new developments in genetics can bring them success. 
<P></P>
Beyond our North American border, the chestnut is considered the most revered tree-food crop in the world, feeding both the poor as well as the rich throughout history. From prehistoric times to the present, people have always looked forward to the chestnut harvest, a delightful task that involved merely gathering them up, since the ripe ones simply fall to the ground. 
<P></P>
Chestnuts were growing in China and Japan in ancient times long before the Roman armies brought them into Europe. Many chestnut varieties grew wild throughout Asia, parts of the Middle East, and Europe. By 37 BCE the Romans were actively cultivating robust chestnut trees for the flour they combined with wheat for bread. Greece and Turkey were also fortunate to enjoy the abundance of the harvest from their lusty chestnut forests. The Romans imported the best chestnuts from Kastanum, now the Asian portion of Turkey. The chestnut's genus name of Castanea is derived from Kastanum.
<P></P>

It is interesting to note that chestnuts are even mentioned in the Bible, with a tale that tells of Jacob putting peeled chestnut twigs into his water troughs to promote healthy offspring of his livestock.
<P></P>
Since the middle of the twentieth century, North America has imported most of its chestnuts from Italy where the trees grow abundantly, with the highest quality from Sicily. The clearest description of the chestnut's hardiness tells of an ancient tree growing at the base of Mt. Etna in Sicily. A mere 2,000 years old, it was destroyed when the volcano erupted.
<P></P>
Throughout history chestnuts have evoked symbolic meanings and diverse practices in different cultures. In Japan, chestnuts symbolize both success and hard times. Always served as part of the New Year menu, chestnuts symbolize mastery and strength. 
<P></P>
In Modena, Italy, chestnuts are soaked in wine before roasting and serving as a special preparation on St. Martin's Day.
<P></P>
In France, marron glace, a candied chestnut with a typically French cooking style that involves 16 different processes, is always served at Christmas and New Years time. The French claim they originated this treat in the time of Louis XIV, but apparently a candied chestnut confection was served 150 years earlier in Piedmont, a northwestern area of Italy close to the border of Switzerland and France.
<P></P>
To the early Christians chestnuts symbolized chastity.

<B><U><FONT SIZE="4">Nutrition</FONT></U></B>
<P></P>
Most people don't think of nuts as a low-fat food, but chestnuts are the exception. Low in fat--3 cooked chestnuts, or approximately 1 ounce, contain a mere .02 grams of fat compared to a handful of cashews with about 12 to15 grams of fat. You've probably guessed they're also low in calories with those same three cooked chestnuts containing between 57 and 68 calories depending on the variety.
<P></P>
Protein is not a highpoint for chestnuts that contain only minimal amounts. However, unlike their other nut counterparts, they are very starchy, making them high in carbohydrates. It's their carbohydrates that make chestnuts, once dried and ground, into an excellent, nutritious flour.
<P></P>
Of all the nuts, chestnuts are the only ones that contain vitamin C. One ounce of boiled or steamed chestnuts delivers 7 mg. of vitamin C, while the dried variety has more than double that amount with 16.6 mg. for one ounce.
<P></P>
All three varieties, the Chinese, Japanese, and European, contain B vitamins including folacin. All have small amounts of calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc but are a rich source of potassium. 

<P></P>
The chestnuts now grown in North America are mostly of the Chinese variety, but they are not readily available in markets. You'll most likely encounter those imported from Europe. The majority are from Southern Italy, but some are from Portugal, and France. The French variety, called marrons, are highly favored. These are found in gourmet shops, and as you might expect, are always a bit pricey. 
Those from Italy are most plentiful and are sold by the pound in supermarkets across the country. They're large, meaty, and richly flavored. 
<P></P>
During the fall season many Asian markets import chestnuts from Korea. These are impressive in size and rich in flavor.
<P></P>
<B>FRESH CHESTNUTS:</B> These begin appearing in the produce section of most supermarkets in October, though they receive little attention until Thanksgiving. Traditionally, they are cooked and added to stuffings. Fresh chestnuts are available through March though supermarkets will usually not carry them after Christmas. Asian markets, however, will have them throughout the winter. 
<P></P>
<B>To boil, make a crisscross cut on the flat or domed side of each chestnut with a firm, sharp paring knife. Toss them into a saucepan, cover with water by 2", and cover the pan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn heat down slightly, and boil gently for 20 minutes. Cool slightly and peel with a sharp paring knife, taking care to remove the brown inner skin as well. We've found it's easier to remove the shells when the chestnuts are quite warm and recommend working with only a few chestnuts at a time while the rest stay warm in the cooking water. 
<P></P>
To roast, make a crisscross cut on the flat or domed side of the chestnut with a sharp, firm paring knife. Place the nuts on a baking sheet and roast at 400 (Gas Mark 6) for about 20 minutes. You can test for tenderness by piercing through the cut side with a fork. Peel with a firm, sharp paring knife, taking care to remove the dark brown inside skin.
<P></P>
To eat raw, purchase the French variety (marrons) at a specialty shop and simply peel them by making a crisscross cut either on the flat side or the domed and pulling off the shell. </B>
<P></P>
Because of their starchiness, cooked chestnuts can be served as a vegetable and mashed like potatoes. Shortly after they're harvested much of their starch turns to sugar, giving them a satisfying sweetness and adding a pleasant balance to a savory meal.
<P></P>
Chestnuts can be enjoyed whole as a tasty snack. They can also be mashed, pickled, chopped, minced, or sliced. Consider adding them to sauces or soups as a thickener and flavor enhancer.
<P></P>
<B>DRIED CHESTNUTS:</B> These are available on a year round basis in almost any Asian market. They may also be found at Italian markets. In their dried form chestnuts may be stored indefinitely.
<P></P>
<B>To cook, put chestnuts in a saucepan and cover with 2" of water. Cover pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn heat down slightly and boil gently for about 45 minutes. To speed cooking time, soak the dried chestnuts in water to cover overnight. Cooking times vary depending on the variety. Fork test for tenderness. We've learned that the dried chestnuts tend to retain their firmness even after lengthy cooking. Their firm texture makes them ideal for adding to cooked vegetables, casseroles, grain dishes, fruit and vegetable salads, rice puddings, and soups. Consider them also as a unique garnish for a sweet or savory dish.
</B>
<P></P>For measuring dried chestnuts, use half the quantity required in a recipe that calls for fresh chestnuts.
<P></P>
<B>CANNED CHESTNUTS:</B> In the fall, canned and jarred whole, cooked chestnuts can be found in gourmet shops, packed in water or syrup for making desserts. Pureed cooked chestnuts, either sweetened or unsweetened, are also available in cans or jars during the holiday season. Shop for these at gourmet stores.
<P></P>
<B>CHESTNUT FLOUR:</B> It may be difficult to find chestnut flour in North America. Consider looking in health food stores and in Italian markets. Since chestnut flour does not contain gluten, it is combined with wheat flour for baking breads. In Southern Italy it is cooked much like a polenta and served with cheese. Another favorite dish of Italian origin begins with chestnut porridge cooked with pine nuts, butter, and raisins and flavored with anise. It is then baked like a pudding and served as a dessert.
<P></P>
STORAGE:  It's best to keep whole, unpeeled fresh chestnuts refrigerated until you're ready to cook them. In this form they may be stored for up to one year, keeping in mind it's always best to eat foods when they're at their freshest. 
<P></P>
We offer this unique way to enjoy chestnuts during the holiday season. The recipe will be much easier to assemble if you prepare the chestnuts the day before.
