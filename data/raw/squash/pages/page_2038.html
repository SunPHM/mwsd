									<td>Even though &quot;tailgating&quot; basically means &quot;having a picnic in a parking lot,&quot; it conjures up much more pleasant thoughts. (We&#146;re ignoring the &quot;bad driver&quot; variety of tailgating.) You don&#146;t even need an actual fold-down tailgate to have a great tailgating party. What this all-American pastime brings to mind is a sparkling day, perhaps with a certain nip in the air, good friends, a sports event (football, soccer, auto racing), and plenty of good food. 
										<p>Food writer Ken Haedrich has put a lot of thought into tailgating. With a partner, he has come up with a unique product called &quot;Let&#146;s Tailgate!&quot; It&#146;s a 12-panel, accordion-folded, laminated booklet filled with tips, reminders, and recipes to make your next tailgate party an easy winner. All of the food can be prepared ahead, packed into the car, and brought out at mealtime with a minimum of fuss. Basil Potato Salad, Mediterranean Burgers, Curried Peach Chicken Wings, Pineapple Salsa, Hot Spiced Cranberry Cider, and other recipes will get a warm reception from old and new-found friends in the parking lot outside the football stadium. You can stick the sturdy little booklet in your glove compartment to review last-minute food preparation.</p>
										<p>&quot;Let&#146;s Tailgate&quot; costs $5.95 plus shipping and can be ordered at <a href="http://www.duraguides.com">www.duraguides.com</a>. Telephone 800-216-9679 for more information; or write to Duraguides, P. O. Box 2126, Annapolis, MD 21404. (The Pineapple Salsa recipe alone is worth the price of purchase!)</p>
										<p>For more tailgating food and ideas, I typed in &quot;tailgate&quot; to search on <a href="http://www.digitalhearth.com">www.digitalhearth.com</a>, and found myself at a mother lode of recipes. It makes sense that three football-crazy places (Texas, North Carolina, and Green Bay, Wisconsin) would know enough to connect sports and food.

									<td height=18><img src="../../../../images/apples3.jpg" width=169 height=127 border=0 align=right>Before you make an apple pie, which is surely one of the finest items to come out of any kitchen, there are three considerations. First, will you use homemade pastry, and if so, what is the best recipe to follow? Second, what variety of apple will you use? Third, will you make a standard double-crust pie, or try one of the many variations on apple pie?<br>
										
										Let&#146;s tackle the questions one at a time, and try to put things in &quot;apple pie&quot; order.

										<p><b>1. The Pastry<br>
											</b>Here&#146;s a handy port in a storm: if making pie crust from scratch seems too daunting, or you just don&#146;t have the time, try Pillsbury&#146;s refrigerated pie crusts, which are made with lard and aren&#146;t half bad. Each package holds two circles of dough folded in quarters and ready to roll out to the size of your pie pan. They are not as flaky as good homemade pastry, but are tastier than some of the pre-formed frozen pie crusts. (And you can crimp the edges yourself, so it won&#146;t look as though a robot made the pie.)</p>
										<p>Old-school bakers always use lard for pie crust because it makes the flakiest, most tender crust. If you can find good-quality pure lard, it is still the optimal choice. The vegetable-shortening people have their own cheering section, touting the easy-to-handle dough made with Crisco and its equivalents. The butter people make a strong case, too, and when it comes to flavor, it&#146;s hard to beat butter. You may want to use part butter, part Crisco, or some other combination. You can even make pie crust with olive or vegetable oil, but the texture is mealy rather than flaky. The Canadian milling company Robin Hood Flour has a recipe for canola oil pastry on its Web site, <a href="http://www.robinhood.ca">www.robinhood.ca</a>.</p>
										<p>In the final analysis, having a &quot;light hand&quot; for pastry is probably more important than the exact recipe you follow. I&#146;d venture to say that the food processor, that handy kitchen machine, is responsible for a great many pie crust failures because it is so easy to over-process the ingredients. If the dough comes together into a neat ball, you&#146;ve done too much. Pastry dough should just barely hold together. A wire pastry blender or two round-bladed knives are the only tools you need to combine shortening and flour. Add only enough ice water to bring the pieces together.</p>
										<p>The most basic pie pastry consists of fat, flour, a dash of salt, and cold water. For a single crust pie, a stick of butter or 1/2 cup solid shortening, about 1-1/3 cups flour, a dash of salt, and 3 tablespoons of ice water added a spoonful at a time is a standard recipe.</p>
										<p>As a variation, here are two easy-to-handle pastry recipes.</p>
										<p><font color=black><b>Flaky Pie Crust (single crust)<br>
												</b></font><i>This is adapted from Lisa Yockelson&#146;s excellent book, </i>Fruit Desserts<i>. It is OK to replace part of the butter with solid shortening. The recipe makes a single-crust pie shell; simply double it for two pies or a double-crust pie.</i></p>
										<p>1-1/2 cups unsifted all-purpose flour<br>
											1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
											8 tablespoons cold butter, cut into chunks<br>
											1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br>
											1 cold extra-large egg yolk<br>
											2 tablespoons ice water (use more only if needed)</p>
										<p>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Using a wire pastry blender or two round-bladed knives, cut the fat into the flour until the fat is in small pieces. Using your fingers, rub and crumble the fat and flour until the mixture is like coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle with the sugar. Blend the egg yolk and ice water and pour the mixture over the flour mixture. Using your fingertips or a fork, quickly combine the ingredients to make a firm but workable dough. Add more water only a drop or two at a time. On a sheet of wax paper, shape the dough into a rough disk, wrap, and refrigerate for about 20 minutes before rolling out.</p>
										<p><b>Vinegar Crust (double crust)<br>
											</b><i>I got this recipe for a double-crust pie many years ago from Corinne Morse of Amesbury, Massachusetts. The vinegar helps tenderize the crust. </i></p>
										<p>2-1/2 cups pastry flour<br>
											1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
											1 cup lard or vegetable shortening<br>
											1/2 cup milk<br>
											1 tablespoon vinegar<br>
											Mix flour and salt, cut in shortening with two knives or a pastry blender. Mix vinegar and milk and add slowly to the flour mixture, stirring with a fork. Use only enough liquid so dough can be handled easily. Divide dough in half. Roll out to fit a 9&quot; pie pan. </p>
										<p><b>2. The Apples<br>
											</b>The earliest apples of the harvest are firm and juicy, and are great for eating out of hand. But they don&#146;t necessarily make the best pies. If you use early apples, add 2 tablespoons flour or cornstarch to the sliced apples to help thicken the juices, and bake the pie slightly longer.</p>
										<p>Which varieties are best for pie? An apple that breaks down well in applesauce, like the Cortland or McIntosh, is not necessarily the best for pies, unless you like your pie on the mushy side. Here is a short list of my favorite pie apples, varieties that balance sweet and tart flavors and hold their shape in a pie.</p>
										<p>&#149; <b>Macoun</b> (spicier than a McIntosh; a taste to treasure)<br>
											&#149; <b>Wolf River</b> (large apple; good keeper; superior for cooking)<br>
											&#149; <b>Cox&#146;s Orange Pippin</b> (said to be the richest-tasting apple there is; hard to find)<br>
											&#149; <b>Suncrisp</b> (new cross of Cox&#146;s Orange Pippin and Golden Delicious; excellent keeper; holds shape well)<br>
											&#149; <b>Jonathan and Jonagold</b> (the latter is a cross of Jonathan and Golden Delicious; both have intense flavor and hold shape well)<br>

										<p>By the time the autumnal equinox rolls around on the 22nd of September, the shortened hours of daylight have already begun to slow garden production. It&#146;s time for gardeners and cooks to go into high gear, making sure that as much of the garden as possible is tucked into the freezer or the pantry, and that the garden itself is prepared for the winter.</p>
										<p><img src=../../../../images/blueberries.gif width=200 height=109 border=0 align=right>&#149; Most berries have long since ripened, but if you are lucky enough to have a fall crop of strawberries, raspberries, currants, or other late ripeners, you can simply freeze whole berries in a single layer on a cookie sheet, then pour them into freezer bags for storage. They will be somewhat mushy when they thaw, but are perfect for pies and fruit sauces. You can also make jam and jelly from frozen berries. Large whole strawberries do somewhat better in the freezer if you sprinkle them with sugar to stop oxidation, but the smaller berries are fine without sugar.</p>
										<p>&#149; If a light frost threatens, bring in the basil and other tender herbs. Parsley, chives, and lavender will withstand a light frost, but basil will turn black and give up. Cut basil plants off at the soil line. If you have time to make pesto that very day, strip off the leaves and go for it. If you don&#146;t, plunge the stems into a bucket of water and store for a day or two in your cellar. Small-leaved herbs can be hung in bunches to dry, dried in a dehydrator, or chopped in a small amount of water or olive oil in the food processor and frozen in ice cube trays (delicious additions to soup next winter!).</p>
										<p>&#149; Pick green or partially ripe tomatoes and store them at cool room temperature in a single layer. Keep them out of direct sunlight, and never refrigerate. It&#146;s tempting to line them up on a sunny windowsill, but they will turn mushy.</p>
										<p>&#149; Pick summer squash, zucchini, and other tender vegetables before frost (or immediately after, if the veggies aren&#146;t damaged). Store as much as you can in your refrigerator (this is when having a second refrigerator in the cellar comes in handy) and give the rest to your neighbors or a local soup kitchen.</p>
										<p><img src=../../../../images/pumpkins5.jpg width=156 height=123 border=0 align=left>&#149; Frost will kill the vines of pumpkin and winter squash, but won&#146;t hurt the vegetables. Detach them from the vines and let them season outside for a few days so the shells harden. Indoors, they like a temperature range of 50&deg;F to 65&deg;F. You can put them under the bed in a cool bedroom!</p>
										<p>&#149; We usually wait until after a frost to harvest carrots &#151; the cold seems to make them taste sweeter. Cut off the tops, wash the carrots with the garden hose, let them dry off for a while, and pack into plastic bags for long-term refrigeration. The old way is to bury them in sand, but in our experience they keep better (crisp and juicy) in the refrigerator.</p>
										<p>In the garden, keep weeding so that weeds can&#146;t go to seed. Remove all garden debris so any diseases won&#146;t winter over. If you can, plant a fall cover crop (winter rye is a favorite in New England) that you can turn under next spring. If you are lucky enough to have farm animals, or know someone who does, spread composted manure and shavings on the garden after harvest. This also can be dug or tilled in next spring. For more tips on garden care, go to the USDA&#146;s Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program&#146;s Web site, <a href=http://www.sare.org>www.sare.org</a>. Links on this site will take you to many other useful sites, including State Extension Service centers. The Web site for Kitchen Garden magazine, <a href=http://www.taunton.com/kg>www.taunton.com/kg</a>, is another favorite source of ideas and tips.</p>
										<p>If you don&#146;t have your own vegetable garden, stop at a farmstand and get yourself large bags of onions, potatoes, and other root crops that will keep well in a cool, dry cellar. (Don&#146;t refrigerate potatoes or onions, and don&#146;t store potatoes and apples together; the apples give off ethylene gas that spoils the potatoes.) It&#146;s a good way to save money, support local agriculture, and eat well all fall.</p>
