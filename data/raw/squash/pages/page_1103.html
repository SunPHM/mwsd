<FONT face="Times New Roman" size=5><STRONG>Awareness is the Key to True Freedom!</strong></font><br>
<p align="center"><i>"There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that&acute;s your own self." -Aldous Huxley</i></p>

<p>Have you ever been involved with something that you enjoyed immeasurably, but there always seems to be that one person who tries to make your job difficult? Most of us have, but we put it aside and justify to ourselves that it is their problem. We continue on, but that person is still a thorn in our side. Why does this happen? The truth is it happens, because a place we may feel joy, may only be ours for a time. Each of us has a purpose. When we find that purpose, we realize that our placement into a situation may have been to make peace between others and when we have done that, it is time to move on to the next task.</p>

<p>I will share with you an example of letting go of something, for someone else&acute;s purpose. I had lunch with an amazing woman. Through the course of our lunch, she shared a situation she was in with a man who always seemed to want to be the ringleader, involving the planning of events within their organization. Although, Diane was aware that the responsibility was hers, this man didn&acute;t quite get it. After sharing a similar situation I found myself in, Diane realized that, it may be time for her to move on and release the authoritative role to this man. She felt confident that he was good at his job. What Diane had done up to this point was bring peace between two groups within this organization. She had a moment of clarity when she realized her role in this capacity, may be finished. It is hard to give up something you enjoy, but as it is important to make other&acute;s feel good about their situation, it is equally important to keep people from feeling discontent about their position. What Diane realized, was that although she was good in this position and it brought her joy, it was creating discontent in this man. When we create discontent in another person, we bring that negative emotion back on ourselves. People, especially women, assume we are supposed to be good at everything we do and that if we don&acute;t do it ourselves, it won&acute;t get done right.</p>

<p align="center"><i>"What then, is your duty?  What the day demands."<br>-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</i></p>

<p>The truth is, in the process we take on a lot of garbage and negative emotion and we aren&acute;t even aware it is happening. By recognizing our role in a situation, we can release ourselves from the burden of doing "it all." It has changed my life and equally, I hope it "Touches Another Mom&acute;s Life!"</p>

<p align="center"><i>"Relationships are a key factor in your success, not because of what other people can do for you, but rather because of who you can become by being in their presence." <br>- Laura Berman Fortgang, in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446673773/womesu/103-8804581-8234202">Take Yourself to the Top</a>"</i></P>

<p>Funny how this is one of those pearls of wisdom that you discover with more life experience (read: older). Sure, we
have friends throughout our life, but we don&acute;t necessarily choose them or think about how we feel in their presence until
later in life.</p>

<p><b>Mommies are Appendages: Why Babies Say Daddy More than Mommy</b><br>
<i>by Heather Truett</i><br><br>
Lunch is complete, and my husband is headed back to work. He stands and takes one last sip of his tea before putting
the cup in the sink, and I hand Haydn a cookie. <br><br>

As Corey is leaving, he tells his son he loves him and he&acute;ll be back after work. As usual, Haydn flaps his tiny fingers and
says, "Da-Da, Da-Da." Somewhere along the line he replaced "Bye-Bye" with "Da-Da". Then, to my surprise, he
presses his little hand to his mouth and blows his daddy a kiss. </p>

<p><b>Baby See Shell</b><br>
Sharon Abendschoen of York Township knows her lightweight baby carrier faces stiff competition from the makers of hefty car seats that double as infant carriers. But the See Shell Baby Carrier is her brainchild.  The impetus came with the 1999 birth of her first grandchild and her daughter-in-law’s struggle with the typical car seat/carrier.  And SO, Sharon developed the See Shell Baby Carrier.<br>
