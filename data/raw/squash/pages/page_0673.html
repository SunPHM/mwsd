<p>Today, we went to the market in Santiago. Things begin here
really early as people come to buy products for restaurants and
stores elesewhere, The stalls were arranged more or less by
commodity. One street had onions and garlic for example. There
was lots on interesting produce. There were stands that facussed
on herbs for medicinal puposes and a Botanica that had products
to help you win the lottery as well as fix your liver. The market
was much smaller and more confined tha the one I had seen in
Mexico City.</p>

<p>After the market we stopped at a very clean &quot;fast
food&quot; outlet that served empanadas. Pedro seeemed to know
every 10th person as we went down the street. We went to the
Santiago Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and met with the
Vice-Minister who was in charge of the Santiago District. We were
treated to fresh juice, grapes and apples and the Minister gave
Jake a box of cigars. He is also a candidate for Mayor and is
running in the PRD primary. Political posters are everywhere and
Mr.Burgos's picture turns up on nearly every corner.After this we
went to the office of the Environmental Society.</p>
