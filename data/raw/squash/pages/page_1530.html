                the average club squash player with a few years of court experience 
                under his belt this could come as a bit of a blow (as with the 
                &quot;you've got no base game&quot; statement). However, when 
                the all-seeing coach picked this one out it came as no great surprise&#133; 
                my dropshots were indeed abysmal, to be truthful a colourful selection 
                of adjectives would also have aptly described this part of my 
                game, but since it's a family site we'll just settle for the original 
                description.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lesson 
                statement made, we moved on to an exercise to allow me to show 
                just how poor my dropshots really were. We used the boast and 
                drive exercise with yours truly at the front of the court, but 
                before playing the straight drive to the back of the court I had 
                to play a straight dropshot. Needless to say, I didn't disappoint, 
                putting the ball in the middle of the tin or redline with quite 
                incredible consistency. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, 
                having clearly identified the problem the coach set about making 
                the corrections:</font></p>
              <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
                <tr> 
                  <td width="82%" valign="top" align="left"> <h1><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fault</b> 
                      <b>1 </b></font></h1>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                      Having too big a swing. My start point for the dropshot 
                      was the same as for a drive played from the back of the 
                      court. This generated the further error of needing to slow 
                      right down before striking the ball, resulting in a poke 
                      at the ball rather than a smooth stroke. Moving the racket 
                      such a large distance and needing to slow it down to achieve 
                      a good dropshot with both well controlled pace and direction 
                      was very difficult to achieve - and was even more difficult 
                      when under the pressure of a match situation. I had further 
                      complicated matters by adding a shed load of cut on the 
                      shot to further take pace off the dropshot - the pace of 
                      course coming from my huge start swing. With all these factors 
                      compounding it seems amazing that I was even able to put 
                      the ball in the tin consistently.</font></p>

                      Shorten the swing - genius, from my coach. Start the swing 
                      for the dropshot with little more than a half swing. </font></p></td>
                  <td width="18%"><img src="images/memoirs1.jpg" width="174" height="250" border="1"></td>

              <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              racket head then has much less distance to travel and becomes much 
              easier to simply nudge the ball in a controlled fashion at the desired 
              spot on the front wall. By simply shortening the swing, the pace 
              is taken off the ball by slowing the swing, throughout the now smooth 
              stroke - this removes the need to pile on the slice in the shot. 
              This may make it more obvious to an opponent that a dropshot is 
              likely, but the dropshot should be used as a working shot to move 
              the opponent rather than expecting a winner every time&#133;</font>

                Playing the shot off the wrong foot. On the forehand side I was 
                stepping into the shot with the right foot, and on the backhand 
                I was playing the shot of the left foot. Given the fact that I 
                was struggling to get the ball above the red line, I thought was 
                being a tad pernickety until I got the explanation. By playing 
                off the wrong foot the natural shot becomes the crosscourt, which, 
                if that's the only option available, allows the opposition to 
                pile on the pressure by playing the ball to the opposite back 
                corner with an easy straight drive. Additionally, approaching 
                the shot from this stance only really allows a weak push to the 
                side for the straight drop, this is significantly weaker than 
                where there is the opportunity to play a full stroke.</font></p>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Make 
                a conscious effort with footwork when moving to the front of the 
                court for dropshots. On the forehand side play off the left foot 
                and on the backhand side play of the right foot. This will allow 
                you choose the shot that you wish to play, no longer will you 
                be forced to play the easy and predictable cross court or the 
                weak drop shot, instead the straight drive can be mixed in to 
                keep the opponent guessing where the ball is going (the crosscourt 
                lob was also suggested for a bit of variety).</font> </p></td>
