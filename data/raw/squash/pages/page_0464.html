<P>
<U>Includes Recipes Below</U>
<p>

Christmas is that time year that allows us to express joy in so many ways--joy in sharing the holiday with friends and family, joy in giving and receiving gifts, joy in seeing our homes dressed with festive decorations, and joy in feasting on foods that bring us pleasure without guilt. The menu we've planned for this joyous occasion is from the plant kingdom, elegant and hearty vegan fare for a regal holiday table. 
<p>
We begin by raising our cup of rich <b>Yuletide Soy Nog</b> and toasting the holiday with friends and family in a ritual that begins the festivities with a joyful clink of glasses. 
<p>
Gathering at the table for Christmas dinner we share our joy with a lovingly prepared, delectable soup as the starter. In keeping with the colors of Christmas, our <b>Winter Rhapsody Soup</b> creates a dazzling display with its brilliant hues of intense magenta. The featured ingredients, beets and potatoes, happily join hands, their flavors heightened with a splash of lemon and dill. 
<p>
Our <b>Apple Accent Salad</b> features the deep greens of romaine and arrugula sweetly punctuated with chunks of bright red apples. Accents of purple, yellow, and orange from a variety of fresh vegetables are complemented with the addition of crunchy toasted pecans. Highlighting the salad is the <b>Oil-Free Cranberry Salad Dressing</b> quickly made in the blender from fresh cranberries.
<p>
The hearty entr&eacute;e is a delectable medley of rainbow colors with <b>Curried Christmas Timbales, Cranberry Salsa, Steamed Brussels Sprouts, Symphony in Squash,</b> and <b>Buckwheat with Savory Mushroom Sauce.</b> Abundant and satisfying, each dish is sparked with a richness of robust flavors. There's no doubt this is elegant vegan dining.
<p>
Perhaps dessert, the best part of the meal, according to dessert aficionados, is served by the fireside, ending the festive evening by the warmth of a crackling fire. Sweet, spicy, and crunchy, <b>Sugar Plum Nuts</b>, prepared several days ahead, are the perfect nut nibbles.
But the grand finale, a stunning, aromatic, spicy indulgence is <b>Quince Mince Cobbler,</b> a vegan version of mincemeat enhanced with a down-home cobbler topping. 
<p>
An exceptional Christmas meal comes to a close, but the warm, memorable images linger. Non-vegetarians dining at this table will be amazed at the copious array of foods, the savory flavors, and the lavish presentation, all from the plant kingdom. One cannot help but catch the spirit of a luxurious vegan celebration. This could become a hallowed tradition.

No one expects beet soup to possess a touch of magic. But this kettle boasts of sorcery with its rich, compelling flavors and tempting appearance. While most beet soups are a dull shade of burgundy, this one is almost alive with its brilliant magenta color. Prepare the soup a day ahead, and the flavors are even better.
<p>
For a dazzling presentation, bring the soup to the table in a tureen along with some dill weed for extra garnish, and serve it in white or ivory-colored bowls.</b>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 120%;"><b>WINTER RHAPSODY SOUP </b></span></span>

<p>
<ol>
<li> Wash beets thoroughly, cut in half, and put them into a 4-quart (4 liter) saucepan with the 3 cups (720 ml) water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn heat down to medium and simmer about 20 to 25 minutes or until fork tender. When cool enough to handle, use fingers to rub off the peels. </li>
<li> Combine potatoes, water, and salt in a 2-quart (2 liter) saucepan, cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn heat down to medium, and cook until fork tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Put onions and carrots into food processor and pulse chop until finely diced. Transfer to a large skillet or wok and add water. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, until just tender, about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

*I specify Russet potatoes because they have the perfect texture for this soup.
<p>
NOTE:  If soup is too thick, thin to desired consistency with water and adjust salt and 
              lemon seasonings.

Instead of the Triple Citrus Dressing mentioned in the recipe, we favor a dressing that employs the fruits of the season and boasts pungent flavors. The striking cranberry red color provides just the right dramatic contrast to the deep greens of romaine and arrugula.

<b>For a vegan approach to serving mincemeat, this recipe is a lusty delight with its full palette of pungent spices so typical of holiday desserts. If you make the dessert the day before and would like to serve it warm, just tuck the baking pan into a cold oven set at 350 F. (Gas Mark 4) for about 15 to 20 minutes. If the dessert has been sitting at room temperature, it could go into a preheated oven.
