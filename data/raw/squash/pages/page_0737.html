	<p>The Costa Blanca in Spain is fast becoming the sports and leisure centre of Europe. Offering a superb climate (320 days of sunshine a year) and excellent communications, two international airports, motorway access from the Channel ports etc.</p>
	<p>Albir Bowls and Squash Club is now under new ownership and offers superb facilities for both bowls and squash players.</p>
	<img src="/images/home1.jpg" width="180" height="120" alt="Albir Bowls Club - golf tours, squash tours and of course bowling tours" />
	<p>A well-known, local, bowls player - Jackie Breslin - has more than 30 years experience in the game and has held responsible positions on bowling committees in Scotland. He has travelled extensively throughout the UK and Spain suporting and promoting the game of bowls.</p>
	<p>The Albir Bowls and Squash Club features 8 rinks, (with an 8-rink Verde Mastergreen carpet laid in May 2002) as well as 3 squash courts. Groups from the UK will be welcomed alongside expats who live, most of the year, on the Costa Blanca. At the moment the club is undertaking a massive recruitment drive, to draw in bowlers of all standards. They are welcome to come along, to see the facilities - both on- and off- rink. Alongside the sports' facilities there is an excellent bar and restaurant for "après bowls". The bar also has a full Sky Sports package and BBC and ITV are also available on the screens.</p>

	<p>New members, who may or may not have played bowls before are very welcome and tuition is available.</p>
	<p>Albir Bowls Club plays in the Costa Blanca Northern League, with ladies and gentlemen forming mixed teams. There is a very active bowling section, running the Costa Blanca Bowling Association. </p>
	<p>The club also wishes to extend an invitation to squash players. The club has three courts and, once sufficient players are available, local league and cup competitions will be arranged.</p>
	<p>As well as offering the best squash and bowls facilities on the Costa Blanca, the club is also building up and supporting its social side. See details of what takes place in the <a href="/index.php?page=funcroom">function room</a>, for more information.</p>
	<p>For further information on becoming a <a href="/index.php?page=membership">member</a> of the club, playing or learning more about bowls and squash, please call into the club or call on any of the contact numbers on the right.</p>
