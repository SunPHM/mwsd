alt="Pasta, Risotto and You"> 

<p><b>By Nancy Caivano</b></p>

&nbsp;<br>

<p>
Hello!!  Welcome to the November edition of <b>Pasta, Risotto and You!</b>
 With the holidays coming up, this issue focuses on different recipes
 that you can use to shake up your holiday table.  Tired of serving
the same old things?  Why not keep some of the usual recipes, but put
 in a couple of different courses, maybe some appetizers, or first
courses, that can make the entire meal seem different.  In the Pasta
part of this column, I will show you some recipes that use seasonal
ingredients and make wonderful starters for your holiday meal.
 In the Risotto section, we will look at using some wonderful
winter purees, like butternut squash, and pumpkin, that will get your
 holiday meals off to a fantastic start.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the size of your table, and number of guests, you can
either serve your meal buffet style or with everyone sitting around
the table.  I have always had to serve all the holiday meals in my
home buffet style, simply because of lack of room.  If you have to
serve buffet style, there are a few ways to incorporate "first courses"
into the meal.  What you can do is, maybe have a few appetizers on
the table when your guests arrive, for them to begin with.  Then,
instead of bringing out the meal, why not bring out a first course,
of pasta, or maybe soup.  Let them serve themselves, and use smaller
dishes so that they won't fill up on the first course.  Then you can
bring out your main meal and all the trimmings.  Your guests might
find it a novel approach to the ordinary! 
</p>

<p>
If you have the means to serve your meal sitting at the table, consider
 doing the meal in courses, instead of placing all the food out at once.
 It brings some variety into the meal and the change of pace alone will
jazz up the day!!!
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, in many Italian-American households, pasta is served
right along with the turkey and trimmings.  It was usually a heavy
pasta too, like <i>Lasagne</i> or <i>Stuffed Shells.</i>  How we ate
all that food
I will never know!!!  But, with today's lighter look to eating, many
families have removed the pasta, and just had the turkey.  I think
that there is room for both on your table, should you wish to have it.
</p>

 src="/food/pasta/1198/lasagne.jpg">
Both the pasta and risotto recipes this month are perfect for a first
course for your holiday dinner.  They are not overly heavy, and they
are vegetarian, so that the meat of the meal is from your main course.
 For the pastas, I have included a different kind of <i>Lasagne,</i> made
with mushrooms and butternut squash, which is much lighter than the
 normal lasagne, which is full of heavy cheese and meat.  I have
also included a <i>Spinach and Pumpkin Ravioli,</i> which is simply tossed
in a <i>Sage Butter.</i>  A small serving of this would be a wonderful
first course!!  Also included is pasta with thinly sliced pumpkin,
saut&#233;ed with aromatic vegetables, and cooked with white wine.  It
is mixed with both mozzarella and Romano cheeses, and tossed with
crunchy toasted almonds at the end.

</p>
Using roasted vegetable purees is a wonderful addition to any
risotto recipe.  Risotto is normally a creamy dish on its own,
but the addition of the puree adds a wonderful dimension to the
dish.  Roasting any vegetable adds a smoky, warm flavor to it,
but it seems to work best with winter vegetables.  The roasting
brings out the natural sweetness in the vegetable, whether pumpkin,
 squash, even onion, and fennel.  It mellows the sharp flavor of
garlic, making it perfect when you want a light flavor of garlic,
 that won't overpower.  Roasted vegetable purees are also very effective
 in low-fat cooking (something we will talk about <i>after</i> the holidays).
  It can add creaminess to a dish without adding fat.  It especially
 helps in dishes like soups, casseroles, and of course, pasta and
rice dishes.

<p>
The risotto recipes in this issue all use roasted vegetable purees.
  First up is <i>Risotto with Roasted Butternut Squash.</i>  It is flavored
 with roasted garlic and sage, a perfect introduction to your
Thanksgiving turkey!  Then we have a more unusual <i>Risotto with
Roasted Fennel, Roasted Onion and Dried Tomatoes.</i>  The fennel and
onion are roasted, then pulsed in the food processor.  While it
is not technically a total puree, it is used in the same fashion.
 Last up is a dessert risotto, which would make a welcome change
from the normal pies and cakes.  <i>Pumpkin Pie Risotto</i> has Granny
Smith apples and is flavored with amaretto, cream, cinnamon and nutmeg.
 It is like a warm and creamy rice pudding.
</p>


<p>
I hope that you enjoy this month's recipes.  Have a wonderful
Thanksgiving holiday, and I will see you in December!
