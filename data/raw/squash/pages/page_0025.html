      Long time no post</a></span><br />
      A lot has happened over the last 2 weeks.  I successfully patched the broken pipes I mentioned in <em>Yippie yippie yay</em>.  I, with the help on my dad, have put a ceiling on Gabrielle's room.  I have another two coats of joint compound to apply and then it'll be painting time.  Kris want to go with a Turquoise because we don't know if baby2.0 is a girl or boy and she wants it to be appropriate for Gabrielle and baby2.0.<br /><br />I have a bunch of pics to put up, but have other things to do right now...I'll put 'em up later.<br />

      I wake up this morning, grab Kris' suite, and head downstairs to de-wrinkle in the dryer.  I'm like, "la la la, goin' down to the basement...hey...what's that spraying sound?  Oh Crap!".  It was my very first cracked pipe...awwwww.<br /><br />Anyway, I told Kris' to make her shower snappy so I could cut the water.  Soooooo, I cut the water, took Kris to the metro, went to Home Depot, and am back here now posting this and waiting for Gabrielle to take her nap so I can rip the pipe out and replace it.  The funny thing is that I am converting to copper pipe from steel which means using brass in between and then to cpvc.<br /><br />I'll let you know how it goes.<br />

      Chicken curry...there's no hurry.</a></span><br />
      <font face="tahoma" size=2>I am making a HUGE batch of curry for those lucky enough to have been invited over this Saturday night.  This recipe is really good, so <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/cda/recipe_print/0,1946,FOOD_9936_20825_PRINT-RECIPE-FULL-PAGE,00.html">Here</a> it is.  I am making between a triple and Quadruple batch right now.<br /><br />Sugestions for this recipe:<br />Add 1/2 tsp paprika<br />Add 3/4 tsp dry english mustard<br />Add 1-2 whole bay leaves.<br />Let curry simmer on super low for 1 hour.<br />Don't cook chicken as it says in recipe.  After simmering curry, let cool and then marinate raw chicken in sauce over night.  Bring to a bubble and make sure chicken is cooked before serving.<br /><br />G pics are coming soon...later this evening.<br /><br />Gabrielle is doing very well.  Kris is doing very well.  We are very close to baby2.0's due date...less than a month.

      Tuna Steaks</a></span><br />
      <font face="tahoma" size=2>Dinner last night was delicious.  I made it...all of it...from scratch.  We had Tuna steaks done orange-tuscan style with my own special sweet squash and orange slices.  Below is a visual timeline of the dinner that I prepared for Kris and myself.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/tunawithtopping.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="REALLY REALLY thick tuna steaks after marinating for 24 hours in an orange-tuscan topping."><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/tunacooking2.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="Mmmmm, smells delish!"><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/squash.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="Two cute little yellow squash waiting to be cooked and eaten."><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/squashcooked.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="This is what squash looks like when cooked to perfection."><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/tunadone.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="It all comes together!"><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/foodallgone.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="Ahhh. The satisfaction of a job well done."><br />I was afraid that I wouldn't like it because I do not like the fishy taste of, well, fish.  There was NO fishyness to this tuna at all.  This will definitely be a repeat dish at my house.<br /><a href="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/tusctuna.pdf">Here's the recipe </a>as I did it.  I substituded orange zest for lemon zest and I would suggest squeezing a slice or two into the tuscan dressing an letting it marinate over night.<br /><br />Now for the Obligatory Gabrielle pics.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/gabsleeponside.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="Gabriell has taken to sleeping with her head right up agains the sides of the crib. She is banging into the sides all night and it makes a really loud noise when she bumps the side that lowers down.  It is SO  hard to sleep when she is doing that. I feel bad sometimes that I am more worried about her keeping me up than her bumping her head all night...but not often...if I mover her back to the middle, she'll be bumping the sides again in no time."><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/gabstandingincrib.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="It's crazy how big she looks sometimes.  So serious and thoughtful."><br /><br />My movie suggestions for all of you out in intarweb land are as follows:<br /><strong>SeaBiscuit</strong>=good.<br /><strong>Underworld</strong>=ok, but needs more story even if that means sacrificing some of the hard core matrix style gunfighting.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/011104/monsturd.jpg" height=144 width=176 alt="">=WTF!!!! pick it up now at your local <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a></font><br />

      Oh, this slow sad dance we call life...</a></span><br />
      <font face="tahoma" size=2>Damn it's good to <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/010504/treebgone.html">get that tree out of my living room</a>.  If you have been lucky enough to have seen my living room in person, you know that it is not very big to begin with.  So start out with a not-too-big living room and stuff a really BIG  tree into a corner right beside a HUGE fireplace and you can't walk thru the room without feeling a little smothered.<br /><br />Well, it's gone now and everything is brighter...Sunshine has come back into my life...la la la.  Ok, I exaggerate. It wasn't really all that bad.<br /><br />I worked my second day for P.I.T. (I have abbreviated the journal name to protect the innocent...me.).  It's a medical journal on transplant surgery and the effects of said surgery.  I got this job because One of Kris' colleagues (we'll call her LO) from the office is also THE editor of this international medical journal thing.  I met LO at one of Kris' office get togethers and LO thought that being a stay at home dad was just the coolest thing, and since I had done good work for them at their 2003 conference, I was offered the position.  I, upon hearing that I would be paid a fair amount for working 15-18 hours a month at my own convenience and could bring Gabrielle with me, said OK.  I also get my name published in the journal on the inside cover right next to LO's in really big type (for a by line).<br /><br />Right now, I am still afflicted with this no $$ thing...I haven't yet gotten my first check from the aforementioned job.  I will also be signing a contract with Kris' office to manage their retail sales at their national conference in Phoenix this year.  These 2 things combined will allow me to Finish off my house, get a renter in a spare room, and pay off some major CC debt.  Ahhhh, that will feel soo good.<br /><br />Oh-yeah...Joe, call me.</font><br />

      Screwtape</a></span><br />
      <font face="tahoma" size=2>This is what you should do right now:<br /><br />Go to your library of choice and check out <strong><em>The Screwtape Letters</em></strong> by C.S. Lewis...Yes, the Narnia guy.  I would strongly suggest starting with the audio tape version as it will allow you to do all your Christmasy stuff whilst enjoying a satire of Hell and temptation.<br /><br />The book is a collection of letters written from Screwtape (a demon and head tempter) to his nephew Wormwood (a tempter who's job it is to lead one young man to hell).  Thru these letters we are given insight into the pitfalls of everyday life.  Whether you are a believer or not, this is definitely worth the read...or listen, if you heed my advise.<br /><br />Here is the abridged audio edition...all my library had.<br /><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/094499315X.01.LZZZZZZZ.gif" width=198 height=288><br /><br />You can read the first letter from uncle Screwtape at Amazon.  I've even have the link for you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0060652934/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-4169676-8638463#reader-link">here</a>.<br /><br />Merry stuff and stuff.  What can I say, it's late and I'm beat.</font><br />

      <font face=tahoma size=2>I is here today to fill in what's happened since the tree trimming party last Sat.  Let's take a look, shall we...<br>This was taken a while ago, but never got posted.  Here eye's are all glisteny because she was sick and I had to put a medicated gel into here eyes.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/gasleeponme.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><br /><a href="http://www.geocities.com/mrslickshoes">MrSlickshoes</a> gave me a dvd of a log fire because I have my TV and everything in my fireplace.  I must say I have had that DVD running continuously for the last 2 weeks.  It seems like a good experiment to see just how long DVD players last...we'll see.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/firedvd.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><br />This is how Gabrielle sleeps now.  No matter how she falls asleep, she always ends up like this.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/bellysleep01.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/bellysleep02.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/bellysleep03.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><br />After dropping Kris off at the metro yesterday, I took Gabrielle for a walk around the mall.  We went into K B Toys where I found the funniest/most inspirational toy ever and probably the worst toy ever.  Here they are in all their natural glory.<br /><br /><strong>Worst Toy EVER:</strong><br />Rodney Dangerfield toy that stands there and does, like, 10 minutes of Dangerfield's standup routine.  Complete with hand pulling on his tie.  I can see it now...Mommy Mommy I want a Rodney Dangerfield!!!! Pleeeeeeease!!!!<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/dangerfieldtoy.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><br /><strong>Funniest/most inspirational toy ever:</strong><br />G.W. Bush toy.  He is about 10 inces tall and is mounted on a round base.  On the base are two buttons.  One labeled 'Funny' and the other labeled 'inspirational'.  the buttons prompt the G.W. toy to say either an amazingly stupid G.W. quote or an incredibly inspiring one.  Swing by your local K B Toys this season and check it out.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/gwtoy.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><strong>funny qoute---</strong>"It's clearly a budget. It's got a lot of numbers in it" OR "I was raised in the West. The west of Texas. It's pretty close to California. In more ways than Washington, D.C., is close to California."<br /><strong>Inspirational Quote---</strong>"America is strong.  We won't relent.  We won't relent in the face of evil.  And we will win.  We'll win hearts and souls and minds.  This country has got a fabulous future ahead of it, because the strength of the country is not in the halls of our government, but in the hearts and souls of our citizens."<br /><br />Here I am looking very hip and cool in a hat someone left at my house after the tree trimming party.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/merasta.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><br />Cheerios are good.<br /><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/geat01.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/geat02.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/geat03.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/geat04.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/geat05.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/gwavetoy01.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/gwavetoy02.jpg" height=144 width=176><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~maxpunx/dailys/121803/megandtree.jpg" height=144 width=176><br /><br />I am going to my parents this weekend to see them in thier church's christmas production and to help my dad make these chocolate covered pecan things that are soooooooo good that I just can't stop eating them.  More on that later.</font><br />

      <font face="tahoma" size=2>It's getting cold and I have decided to completely cover over the back door...the one in my kitchen.  The door that is there is just temporary until I can afford the outward swinging french doors that I really want, soooo I am going to pull the door, put in some studs and drywall over the sucker.  I'll be going ghetto on the outside with plywood covering the opening, but, like I said...only temporary.<br /><br />All 3 of us have been sick for the last week...well, Gabrielle only since Monday.  Kris got hit the hardest being pregnant and all.  She is being a real trooper though.  She never complains.  It's all been really fun with sinus congestion, coughing up neon yellow and green globs...you know the chunky kind, and Gabrielle has crazy playdough factory looking stuff coming out of her eyes...mmmm, playdough.<br /><br />Anyway, we currently have no $$...and I mean none!  We are looking to still have a fun Christmas season, though.<br /><br />More later.</font><br />

      Hey, yall.</a></span><br />
      <font size="2" face="tahoma">Kris is 27 weeks along with baby 2.0 and everyone is doing well.<br /><br />Gabrielle is has just this week learned that there is an up.  She is now fascinated by it and looks up whenever she can.  She is also standing on her own and getting very loud and talkative.  She hasn't mastered any words but Uh-Oh yet and that doesn't count because she just says it to hear the sound...she loves hearing herself say it.<br /><br />Kris is working feverishly to get APIC (her organization) on track and making more $$...both her and them.  She loves reading to Gabrielle as often as she can...they both love their books.  Kris has just reread <em>The Rapture Of Canaan</em> for the 10th time...not because she wants to but because we are spending our $$ on other things right now...She does recommend the book, though.<br /><br />I have been a little overwhelmed with watching Gabrielle and trying to fix up the house and attempting to keep it slightly tidy.  Things are better on the weekend, though, because Kris is here, and my dad is up about once a week helping me with something or other (this week was putting the porch railings on and running water and waste lines to the kitchen sink).  Yes, I now have a kitchen sink after 2 months living here.<br /><br />The previous <em>jehovah's whosiwhatsit?</em> series is not meant to offend anyone, but if it does...it makes it just that much funnier.  If you haven't the foggiest what I am talking about, you should be checking back here more often than you are.  Just read the last couple of posts and you will be up to date.<br /><br />Later taters.<br /></font><br />

      jehovah's whosiwhatsit?--volume 2</a></span><br />
      <font size="2" face="tahoma">My JW dropped in for another visit this week.  I actually invited him inside this time...we sat on my <em>way too big sofa</em> in the comforts of my living room.  No, I did not offer him a drink or anything...let's take this one step at a time.<br /><br />He gave me a little orange book entitled <em>THE BIBLE-God's word or man's?</em> which was his follow up to our discussion on the ability of man to record god's will with 100% accuracy over a book as large as the bible*.<br /><br />This week we delved even deeper, back to the very beginning of the need for "religion".  Back to the rebellion of satan.<br /><br />Here's how the story goes...<br /><br /><strong>god></strong>I have created a wonderful angel and I will call him satan.<br /><strong>satan></strong>Wow, god, I am a wonderful angel.<br /><strong>god></strong>yes, I already said that.<br /><strong>satan></strong>sorry.<br /><strong>god></strong>I am the alpha and the omega...the beginning and the end...I am the everlasting rock.<br /><strong>satan></strong>yes, you are everything, but I would like something more.<br /><strong>god></strong>More than me?<br /><strong>satan></strong>Yes, I would like a chance to steer humanity away from you.<br /><strong>god></strong>Hmmmmmmm, tell me more.<br /><strong>satan></strong>I'll go down to the earth and tempt man and you can smite everyone I turn away from you and send them to hell!<br /><strong>god></strong>You know,  I think you are onto something there.<br /><strong>satan></strong>This is going to be fun!<br /><strong>god></strong>I'm down.  Let's go for it.<br /><br /><br />And the rest is history.  There has been much smiting and sending to hell.<br /><br />The explanation my JW gave me was that:  Satan is allowed to do his thing for the sake of the remaining angels and mankind.<br /><br />Here's how the conversation unfolded...<br /><br /><strong>Me></strong>If god is the type of god to destroy those people who don't follow him, why didn't he destroy satan and end it there?<br /><strong>My JW></strong>To prove to the other angels and man that he was right and satan was wrong.<br /><strong>Me></strong>why would <em>GOD</em> feel the need to prove himself to anyone?<br /><strong>My JW></strong>God didn't want other angels and man to think that they could do what satan was attempting (to run the world as well as god did).<br /><strong>Me></strong>Wouldn't seeing the destruction of satan prove that god was "the man", and save everyone else a lot of suffering?<br /><strong>My JW></strong>Yes, but then everyone would be staying faithful out of fear.<br /><strong>Me></strong>Are you saying that the threat of "hell" doesn't inspire fear?<br /><strong>My JW></strong>That's different.<br /><strong>Me></strong>I seeeee.<br /><strong>Me Again></strong>I don't kill people because it's wrong...not because mass murderers are executed.  How is that any different from how faithful angels and humans would react to satan's destruction?<br /><strong>My JW></strong>Look at the time!  I have to run, but we'll talk about this later.  Check out the book I left for you.<br /><br />He left, but not before I tossed him some tidbits to keep him convinced that I could "be saved".  I don't want him getting away too easily...this could go on for ever and I must say I am enjoying myself.<br /><br />I am not an atheist or an agnostic.  I am simply using what wits I have to try and divine the truth.  The bible (or holy writing of choice) and religion based upon said writing, was created (at least physically) by man which bears careful scrutiny from everyone.<br /><br />That's it for this weeks edition of <strong>jehovah's whosiwhatsit?</strong>.  See you next week.<br /><br /><br />This post was paid for by the people who don't think you are right <strong>just because </strong>a book says so.<br /><br />*See <strong>jehovah's whosiwhatsit?</strong>, posted 11.07.03.<em></em><br /></font><br />

      I'm back from my week of lack of motivation to do any blogging.  I have taken a TON of pics, but it is unlikely that they will make their way up here...well, not all of them anyway.  I will be back later today to add the second edition of <strong>jehovah's whosiwhatsit?</strong>.<br /><br />Right now it is feed the baby time...so I am going to feed the baby...OK, here I go...off to feed the baby...bye.<br />

      jehovah's whosiwhatsit?</a></span><br />
      There's a Jehovah's witness that comes around once a week to talk to me and tell me about the faith.<br /><br />I am honestly interested to hear the views of the JWs since I know none and am learning what it is that they believe that sets them apart from the damned/lost/unhappy.<br /><br />I always manage to ask the tough ?s of this guy and he keeps coming back so he must get a kick out not having answers or something.  Wednesday was like this: <br /><br />Question: "Man is fallible...yes...Man seems to screw up Gods will for us...yes...Man likes coca cola products...yes...How can you say then that the entire bible (an enormous volume of information by the way) is without error?<br /><br />Answer:  God would not let that happen.<br /><br />Question:  Why not?  God has let many people screw up many important things...just read any story in the bible.<br /><br />Answer:  Let me read you a verse (from the bible) that says that the bible is true.<br /><br />Bible:  This is God's infallible word...trust me...I am God.<br /><br />Question:  So you are saying that God took away (possessed) the writers' free will (i.e. humanity) temporarily to make sure it was done right?<br /><br />Answer:  Yes.<br /><br />Question:  Interesting.  That does not really fit the God that the rest of the bible tells us about.  Everywhere else in the bible, God has chosen messengers and leaders and let them screw up important stuff (they would of course be smited later or something) why the change just for this?<br /><br />Answer:  I've got to go.  I'll get back to you on this one next week (hopefully you will have forgotten this conversation by next week and we can talk about something else).<br /><br />Bye.<br /><br />Bye.<br /><br />*End JW encounter 3*<br /><br />This will now be a weekly special...and it was very good.<br />

      It's Friday I'm in love...</a></span><br />
      Weeeelllllllll, I am off to another assignment in DC.  Getting up early to clean the house and get my super suave threads straight so I can wow the clients and have them ask for me next time they are in the area.<br /><br />I made 5 trips to Home Depot over the last 4 days...and two to Lowes.  I was unable to salvage the cast-iron radiator I was planning on installing in the kitchen after a pipe broke off in it.  Damit!<br /><br />OK, I have a plan.  I am putting in under floor radiant heat.  I will be using about 75 feet of 1/2" copper tubing and a slew of compression fittings, adapters, and bushings.  Like I said, It'll be a ton of fun.  If...When it works I will start converting the rest of the house over to the same thing.  It looks like this room/nook (only about 6 x 6) will cost me about $75 to retrofit with radiant floor heat...but it will be soooo sweet.<br /><br />87.5 B-B-B-BILLION friggin' dollars being spent on Iraq's school rebuilding and UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE!  WTF...I mean, WTF!  If this $$ could have been squeezed out of congress, why the F**K weren't we dropping this $$ into building schools and helping the poor and needy.<br /><br />JUST THINK ABOUT IT.  REMEMBER WHEN VOTING...in your next local, state, and/or national election race.<br /><br />I am now officailly now off the soapbox.<br /><br /><br />

      Monday</a></span><br />
      I spent a bit-o-time playin' <a href="http://www.miniclip.com/trialbikepro.htm">trial bike pro </a>over at <a href="http://www.miniclip.com">miniclip</a>.<br /><br />Gabrielle had her 9 mo. check up where she got a hep B vaccination and had a little blood taken...she was fine with having her blood taken but yelled like a banshee at the vaccine.<br /><br />It was then off to see my grandma.  She went in for eye surgery not too long ago and we have been going up and hanging out once a week or so.<br /><br />Back home, I had to watch Julian...he did his homework without any trouble and I was able to straighten up Judy's house (get paid extra $$ for this) while he worked.<br /><br />Around 6, Kris and I went straight up to <a href="http://www.costco.com">Costco</a> to buy a membership and go grocery shopping.  We didn't know their dirty little secret until we got there and started filling out our membership application...THEY ONLY TAKE <a href="http://www.americanexpress.com">AMERICAN FRIGGIN' EXPRESS</a>!  Am I the only one who didn't know that?  No <a href="http://www.visa.com">Visa</a>...No <a href="http://www.mastercard.com">MasterCard</a>...No <a href="http://www.discovercard.com">Discover</a>...No debit...WTF?  They DO take checks though...go figure.<br /><br />I was like, "That's friggin' insane, see ya!" Kris was a little embarrassed with my behavior, but we left just the same and headed over to Giant.<br /><br />I should point out that they do take cash, but I am not really the type to want to go to the ATM every time I go shopping.<br /><br />Anyway, we spent $165 at <a href="http://www.giantfood.com/">Giant</a> and were able to get enough to last the next 2 weeks.<br /><br />When we got home, Kris put the groceries away and I painted out kitchen nook.  I am going to be puttin' in restaurant style booth seating in my nook...it's going to rock.<br />
