      clash everyone had been waiting for was ... well worth waiting for.&nbsp;
      This was a great match, with everything on the line. Leilani took a 2-0
      lead, and at 2-1 5-0 it looked like Sarah's run was finally over. Sarah
      wants this badly though, and she not only levelled the match but went on
      to take a good lead in the fifth. Leilani badly wanted to retain her title
      though, and she made her way back to equality at 7-7, Tension, top quality
      play, it was all here, but there had to be a winner, and in the end it was
      Sarah who prevailed. They embraced at the end as the crowd rose as one to
      applaud two great champions. Alan Thatcher reports ...</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Australia's number three seed Sarah
      Fitz-Gerald conjured up a stunning fightback from two games down to beat
      world number one Leilani Joyce in the first women's semi-final.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Fitz-Gerald has won three World
      Opens but is still searching for her first British title, having lost four
      finals to fellow Australian Michelle Martin, who has now retired. It
      looked like Fitz-Gerald had blown it for another year as she let slip a
      big lead in the first game and trailed by two games to the athletic New
      Zealander, who was bidding for a hat-trick of titles. But Fitz-Gerald, who
      had her left foot strapped because of a sore toe, produced a breathtaking
      recovery to win 8-10, 3-9, 9-2, 9-6, 9-7 in 75-minutes.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">The match was full of brilliant
      squash from the first rally to the last, beamed round the world by the
      tournament promoters, London-based TV production company The Eye Group. It
      was a wonderful advertisement for the women's game, featuring two players
      who combine speed, breathtaking movement and dazzling racket skills.
      Fitz-Gerald said: &quot;I wish that had been the final. I realise that I
      had been tense but I got my act together when I heard someone shout 'Come
      on Australia.'</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">&quot;I have spent the whole week
      trying to believe that is just another tournament, pretending that this
      the Warwickshire Open or something like that. &quot;But at 6-6 in the
      fifth, after I had let slip a 6-2 lead, I thought 'Here we go again. I'm
      going to blow another British Open.' &quot;Then I got my head together and
      finished strongly to win it. I know I have a few areas of my game to
      improve, especially at the front of the court, but I'm delighted to be in
      the final.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2"><img align="right" alt="Carol Owens" border="0" src="pict/owenswaits.jpg" width="138" height="241">Fitz-Gerald,
      31, has not lost a match since going down to fellow Australian Carol Owens
      in the World Open semi-final in Edinburgh in November. Fitz-Gerald has
      beaten Owens three times since then and meets her again in today's final.</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Owens, who came back from 2-0 down
      to beat Joyce in the World Open final, overcame a gutsy display from
      England captain Linda Charman last night to win 9-6, 2-9, 8-10, 9-2, 9-1.</font></p>
      <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">&quot;I was lucky to win from 2-1
      down&quot; said Owens. &quot;Last time we played Linda only got 8 points,
      but she played so well today, and I just couldn't get anything right.
      Getting to the final is the hardest part, so now that I've done that
      hopefully I won't have as many nerves tomorrow. I've been really nervous
      all day, and when people say you have an easy draw it just puts more
      pressure on you. It would be just brilliant to win the British open, it's
      the pinnacle of the game.&quot;</font></p>
