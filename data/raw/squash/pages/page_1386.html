<p><img src="ssveg.jpg" border=2 height=180 width=250 align=right>Here at N.C.S. we grow a lot of our own food like potatoes, lettuce, tomatoes, squash, eggplant, kale, and herbs. Along with the fact that we have to work in the garden to grow our food we are not allowed to have candy, soda, and other "junk food".
	We also grow our own meat like chickens, turkeys, and pigs which we slaughter and eat. Chicken harvest is the most fun for the seniors.</p></font>
