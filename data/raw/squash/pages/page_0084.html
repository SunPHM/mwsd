    <p>Great news: the new squash courts are Open.</p>
	<p>There was a <a href="poster.htm" target="_top">launch event </a>on the 8th April that 
	was a great success.<br>
    <br>
    As part of our commitment to this project, we have been working over the 
    last few months with representatives from the School, John Gibson from
    <a href="http://www.englandsquash.com/" target="_top">England Squash</a>, 
    and Erin O'Brien from
    <a href="http://www.sportinstockport.com/" target="_top">Stockport Sports 
    Trust</a> to set up a Young Players Development Program, and we thank them 
    for their help, expertise and dedication to this project. </p>

        courses are available on Saturdays. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minisquash.com/">
        Mini-Squash</a> is England Squash approved and has been specially 
        designed for children aged five to eleven. This exciting game fits the 
        needs of younger children and has a well-defined pathway of achievement.<br>

    </table>
    <p>Also on Saturdays coaching is available for the older children (and 
	adults, too) who would like to be able to improve.<br>
    <br>
    New monthly leagues have set up which we hope will encourage more 
    people to play. And are hoping to introduce regular social evenings and open 
    handicap competitions for all to add a bit of variety.</p>
	<p>Enjoy your squash</p>
	<p>We are very grateful to the the Head Teacher, John Peckham, and the 
    Governers of Bramhall High School for listening to the wishes of the squash 
    players, and for turning them into reality. As a result, the school will 
    have access to a splendid new space for teaching Dance and Drama, and we 
    players will have probably the best courts in the locality.</p>
