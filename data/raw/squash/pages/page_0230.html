Jack may have shinnied up a beanstalk, but even he might have had second thoughts about climbing John Rousseau's<A NAME="XINDEX1"><B>70-foot squash plant</B></A>.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Mr. Rousseau planted the mammoth vine 2½ months ago. Since then it has taken over his Hopkinton home. The vine has climbed up the side of the house, blocked the front door, and grown down two flights of stairs to the driveway.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"It choked out my eggplants and tomatoes," his wife, Flo, said. The rampaging plant wrapped its tentacles around her wind chimes hanging from the roof.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"I swear it wants to come in the house," she said.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The plant has survived efforts to control it, although Mr. Rousseau was able to trim it back to save their roses.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
With the front door blocked, a new sign on the side door instructs visitors, "Please enter here."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The seeds came from a friend in New Jersey, who used to grow squash to feed his pigs.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The Rousseaus expect the plant to produce about 40 Blue Hubbard squash by fall. One fruit is already the size of a football.

They had names like Kyla, Heidi, Justine, Kacie and Chelsea, but there can be only one <A NAME="XINDEX2"><B>"Annie"</B></A> – and her name is Joanna Pacitti, a 12-year-old from Philadelphia.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Miss Pacitti was chosen yesterday after a three-month, five-city search to play America's favorite orphan in the 20th anniversary production of the musical, which will arrive on Broadway next spring.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"It's a terrifying thing to have to break little hearts," said Martin Charnin, the show's director and lyricist, who had to console 13 other disappointed finalists, who were also present. "But when you hear Joanna sing, you will know why we chose her."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Miss Pacitti, who wants to be either a veterinarian or an actress when she grows up, then belted out a ground shaking version of "Tomorrow," the show's anthem of eternal optimism.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Also present was Andrea McCardle, the original Annie, and Zappa, a 95-pound Irish wolfhound mix who will play Sandy, Annie's faithful canine companion. The dog, who was found in a Connecticut pound on the day rock musician Frank Zappa died, posed dutifully for photographers.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The new production of "Annie," which stars Nell Carter as the evil Miss Hannigan, opens this fall in Houston and will tour before going to New York.

<A NAME="XINDEX3"><B>Eileen Fulton</B></A>, the longtime star of "As The World Turns," was in good condition at Lenox Hill Hospital yesterday after undergoing an emergency appendectomy.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"She was speaking in an optimistic voice" the day after her inflamed appendix was removed, said her publicist, David Granoff, although she was still in pain and planned to stay in the hospital an extra day.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Ms. Fulton, 62, who plays "Lisa" on the CBS soap opera, made a frantic telephone call just before midnight Tuesday to her friend Dick Barclay.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
She told him she was in excruciating pain and asked him to come over and take her to the hospital, Barclay told the New York Post. He rushed to the Park Lane Hotel and found her in the lobby doubled over in agony. He picked her up, carried her out to the street and hailed a cab.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
After hours of testing, doctors at Lenox Hill determined that her appendix was about to burst, Mr. Granoff said. She was in the operating room for a couple of hours, he said.
<HR WIDTH=5% SIZE=20>
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
<A NAME="XINDEX4"><B>Ted Turner</B></A>, empire builder, has a more modest goal these days: becoming a better fishmerman.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Mr. Turner, 57, recently bought a 5,000-acre ranch in Dillon, Mont., that includes several miles of the Red Rock River, a prime trout stream.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
On Wednesday, the cable TV mogul told about 250 people at a Western Montana College Foundation that he is "tired of working from dawn to dark. ... I'm just sick of it. I just want to go out to a trout stream and get away from it."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Since he was introduced to fly-fishing by a Wyoming rancher friend 10 years ago, Turner said, he has worked hard at mastering the sport.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
But work still beckons. Mr. Turner flew to New York later Wednesday to work on final details of the purchase of Turner Broadcasting System by Time Warner.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"I'd really rather not go to New York tonight," he said. "I'll miss the evening hatch."
<HR WIDTH=5% SIZE=20>
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
TV star<A NAME="XINDEX5"><B> Sasha Mitchell</B></A>, on probation for beating his wife, is in trouble again, this time for allegedly leaving the Los Angeles area without finishing court-ordered domestic-violence counseling.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
An arrest warrant was issued for the star of the canceled comedy "Step By Step."
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
Mr. Mitchell, released from jail in mid-June, was required to attend domestic violence counseling and stay in touch with his probation officer. But Mr. Mitchell hasn't done that, prosecutors said.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
The actor received the jail term in early May – his second stint behind bars this year – after he threatened his wife in an argument and missed domestic violence counseling sessions.
<HR WIDTH=5% SIZE=20>
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
After helping return his spacecraft to Earth in "Apollo 13," <A NAME="XINDEX6"><B>Kevin Bacon</B></A>is turning to a less death-defying role: radio disc jockey.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
To prepare for his role in "Telling Lies in America," Mr. Bacon hung out in his hometown last week with Philadelphia DJ Jerry Blavat, who calls himself "the Big Boss with the Hot Sauce." Mr. Bacon says he'll base his character on Mr. Blavat, who has been on the air since the 1960s.
<BR><IMG SRC="tab.gif">
"He's got that old machine-gun patter, that older style," said Mr. Bacon, who listed to Mr. Blavat while growing up. "Also, he doesn't play off a format and he is here in the studio spinning vinyl. He does it the old way. He's there with a stack of vinyl, and he's rockin."
