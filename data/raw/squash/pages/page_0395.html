    COLOR="#336699"><em>Dr. Joe Campbell</em></font> is among those who are disappointed to
    learn that the squash court on the B1 level of Bldg. 35 is closing at the end of summer to
    make way for a new, sorely needed Physical Biology Center for intramural scientists. The
    court and its environs will be gutted to build the new center, a joint NCI and NICHD
    venture that will include electron microscopes, lasers and x-ray crystallography labs.
    Construction begins this fall and will last 8 months to a year, said Dr. Camelia Smith,
    ORS program analyst. The possibility of a replacement court will be folded into a review
    of the adequacy of all fitness facilities at NIH, a matter overseen by the Office of
    Research Services, with input from the community and the NIH quality of worklife
    committee. R&amp;W has sponsored the court, which is reserved by signups on a sheet
    outside the door. </p>
    <p><font size="+1" COLOR="#336699"><b>Health Fair Kicks Off Study</b> </font></p>
    <p>With a community health fair, NCI intramural researchers recently kicked off a study in
    Triana, Ala., of DDT exposure and risk for breast cancer. The fair brought health
    information materials from NIH to this rural community. Women participating in the study
    receive breast cancer screening and a standard blood chemistry analysis. The Triana
    Community Health Initiative, or Project Life! Better Health for a Brighter Future (as the
    community has named it), is being conducted through NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology
    and Genetics. </p>
    <p>In the early 1970's, the Triana population had body burdens of DDT an average of 10
    times higher than the general United States population, prompting community interest in a
    risk study. </p>

    <p>Ever wonder where all those electronic forms come from? The NIH Electronic Forms Users'
    Group is busy producing forms in FileMaker Pro and PDF formats. Currently, there are
    nearly 500 forms on its Web site at <a HREF="http://mantis.dcrt.nih.gov/nihforms/">http://mantis.dcrt.nih.gov/nihforms/</a>
    and the number is growing daily. With assistance from CIT's Technical Assistance and
    Support Center and with information from official NIH forms files, the group has for the
    last 3 years been creating good quality, error-free forms that can be used by NIH'ers on
    both Windows and Macintosh computers. The group invites special requests and will make
    every attempt to create forms as soon as possible. It also welcomes comments to help
    create the most &quot;user friendly&quot; forms possible. Contact the group via email at <a
    HREF="mailto:jkraft@box-j.nih.gov">jkraft@box-j.nih.gov</a>.</p>

    <p><font size="+1" COLOR="#336699"><b>Fire Prevention Slogans Sought</b> </font></p>
    <p>Fire up your imaginations and think up a nifty slogan for NIH's observance of National
    Fire Prevention Week. If you win the contest, open to everyone (except members of the
    sponsoring Emergency Management Branch), your idea appears on next year's commemorative
    posters at NIH, along with your name. You can enter as often as you like, and entries
    should be snappy one-liners about fire prevention. Be sure to print (legibly) or type your
    slogan on a sheet of white paper. If you submit multiple candidates, rank them in order of
    preference. Entries are due by Sept. 30. Send or fax entries to the fire prevention
    section, Bldg. 15G, Rm. 2. Fax number is 402-2059. For more information call 496-0487. </p>
