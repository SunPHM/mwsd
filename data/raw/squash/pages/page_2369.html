  produce is often bigger and tastier than are intentionally cultivated crops. 
  After all, the plants have sprouted where they want to grow, as opposed to where 
  you want them to. Like wildflowers, unbidden edibles usually appear wherever 
  they'll have the best chance to survive and reproduce . . . that is, where the 
  soil has the necessary nutrients, the proper pH balance, and just the right 
  amount of drainage to satisfy the needs of the plant in question. </font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Three of the sweetest and best-flavored cantaloupes I've ever eaten, for example, 
  grew from some compost that had been spread on an area intended for a succession 
  crop of pole beans. The melon vine climbed a nearby fence, where its weighty 
  fruits-being airborne-had to be supported with small baskets to keep them from 
  tearing loose from the plant. Otherwise, the wayward waif was left to shift 
  for itself . . . yet all three melons were perfectly formed, heavily webbed, 
  and free of blemishes. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  The previous summer, a cherry tomato plant erupted spontaneously next to a walkway 
  in our ornamental garden. It sprawled its way across the path's wood chip mulch 
  and interfered with foot traffic . . . while producing well over 20 pounds of 
  firm, oval tomatoes. </FONT> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  In both cases, the volunteers were allowed to remain where they originally sprouted, 
  because the plants were obviously happy with their surroundings. There are times, 
  however, when such bonus babies cannot and should not be treated so tolerantly.

<p ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TO 
  GROW OR NOT TO GROW</font></strong></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
  instance, it's common knowledge that when garden peas and beans are grown near 
  members of the allium family (which includes onions, garlic, and shallots), 
  they won't produce as well as they should. However, since garlic readily reproduces 
  from self-sown seed, it's likely to crop up almost anywhere. </font> </p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  Now garlic does have valuable insect-repellent qualities, so I leave it in place 
  when it sprouts in most parts of the garden. If the plants come up in bean and 
  pea beds, however, I promptly nudge them out of the ground with a crabgrass 
  tool ... and transplant them to a new location before they can interfere with 
  legume production. (My favorite relocation site for the pungent herb is among 
  our fruit trees, where it will reseed itself season after season and help prevent 
  destructive borer and plum curculio infestations.) </FONT> </p>
<p ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  GIANT DECISION</font></strong></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  When large volunteer plants-such as watermelons, tomatoes, and squash-appear 
  anywhere in the garden, you may be faced with a tough decision: Are the unplanned-for 
  "guests" worth sacrificing all or part of the crop that you intended to grow 
  on that site? When trying to decide how to deal with such an unrequested vegetable, 
  you must consider the crop's potential value in dollars, its nutritional worth, 
  and your family's preferences. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Then, if the volunteer receives a vote of no confidence, evict it at once. Tomatoes 
  and very young squash plants, for instance, can often be transplanted successfully 
  if they're dug in the evening with a generous ball of soil encasing the roots. 
  Space-hogging watermelons, on the other hand, only rarely survive the shock 
  of being disturbed and therefore such flora non grata are best relegated to 
  the compost heap without further fanfare. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  On the other hand, though, I had one experience with a volunteer watermelon 
  that proved the giants can sometimes find a home without driving out all the 
  resident crops. When a vine popped up at the edge of my salad-bowl garden, I 
  draped it casually atop a sun screen which shaded the lettuce bed. Two of its 
  yellow blossoms promptly set fruit, and-uncharacteristically-the vine itself 
  never got out of hand ... it produced 27 pounds of sweet, redmeated, Dixie Queen 
  watermelons by late August. So, if you encounter a maverick that's not immediately 
  threatening a more valued crop, it sometimes pays to maintain a wait-and-see 
  attitude. </FONT> </p>
<p ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PEPPERS 
  VERSUS SUNFLOWERS</font></strong></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Volunteers 
  don't have to come from in side the garden to cause a dilemma. A few years ago, 
  seeds scattered from a nearby bird feeder sprouted several large-seeded sunflowers 
  (which resent being transplanted) in my chili pepper bed . . . and the dense 
  sunflower foliage overshadowed the shorter, light-loving chili plants, reducing 
  pepper production by half. Since I wasn't willing to forfeit either the sunflower 
  seeds or the peppers, I carefully staked the uninvited guests at a slight angle, 
  allowing some sunlight to reach the pepper plants during part of the day. In 
  this way, the latter were able to hold their own until the shorter-seasoned 
  sunflowers matured their heads. Then, when the seeds had been harvested and 
  the big stalks removed, there was still time for the chili plants to set another 
  crop of peppers before the end of the season. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  I usually make every effort to retain gratuitous sunflower plants. The ripening 
  heads attract a variety of seed-loving birds that remain to clear the garden 
  of insect pests. Then too, the bright flowers attract the prehistoric-looking 
  assassin bugs that prey on many plant-eating insects . . . including the very 
  destructive Mexican bean beetle. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  On the negative side, however, some volunteers can cause serious problems by 
  interfering with crop rotation schedules. To discourage pests and disease problems, 
  many vegetables should not be grown on the same site two years in a row. At 
  least three years should pass between tomato crops, but it's not unusual for 
  tomato volunteers to sprout in the previous year's location. When this happens, 
  it's best to pull out or transplant the interlopers at once, and-if unwanted 
  volunteers continue to grow in the bed throughout the year-to add an extra season 
  to the tomatoes' rotation schedule before returning that crop to the first area.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT</font></strong></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  If you like the idea of bonus garden produce, you can increase the likelihood 
  of such chance occurrences. The easiest method is simply to let your plants 
  sow themselves. Dillweed, garlic, and some other herbs are prolific self-seeders. 
  Even perennial asparagus, besides spreading from the roots, will seed itself 
  ... if the tops go uncut. Many such offspring survive the coldest winters and 
  can be either transplanted after sprouting or left to grow undisturbed. ("Naturalizing" 
  is, of course, the supreme form of volunteer crop growing. If plants spring 
  up in an outof-theway section of the garden or yard, self-seeding vegetables 
  can perpetuate themselves indefinitely.) </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  Most fruiting crops, however, can use a little help. Volunteer tomatoes usually 
  come from the seeds of fallen fruit, so they can be "recruited" by dropping 
  an overripe tomato or two on the ground (away from the original bed, of course) 
  and stepping on them. (A dusting of dirt will keep flies away.) If you do this 
  in midsummer, you may even be able to produce a fresh batch of volunteer tomato 
  plants for an autumn harvest. </FONT> </p>
<p ALIGN="left"><strong><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GARBAGE 
  GLORIES</font></strong></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  Melon, squash, and gourd vines will often sprout when seed-containing kitchen 
  wastes are buried in shallow trenches to help enrich the soil. Bumper crops 
  of white potatoes have also been known to grow from buried potato peels . . 
  . and kitchen trimmings of all types commonly produce volunteers in unturned 
  composting piles during the warm months. Even trees can be had from discarded 
  nuts and fruit pits ... although it may be five to ten years before such unintentional 
  plantings bear crops. (Bonus tree seedlings should be transplanted to permanent 
  locations-during the dormant season-within one or two years after sprouting.) 
  </font></p>
<p ALIGN="justify"> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000"> 
  Neatness in the garden is a virtue, of course, and is the best possible means 
  of successfully growing food organically without the use of pesticides and other 
  chemicals. But-in the rush of the growing/harvesting/canning season-it's a rare 
  gardener who doesn't miss a fallen fruit here or a scattering of seeds there. 
  With a little tolerance and encouragement, such overlooked strays may well yield 
  an unexpected harvest bounty.</FONT> </p>
