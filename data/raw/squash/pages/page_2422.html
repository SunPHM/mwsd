<p>AUSTIN, TEXAS &mdash; Intricate, colorful, linear detail and expressive, splashing, swirling colors are among the variety of art presented by Women Printmakers of Austin at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.</p><img src="images/nr_pond.jpg" width="391" height="288" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" />   
<p>  
Warm reds, yellows and greens color the lush <i>Summer Garden</i> complete with tomatoes, squash, peppers and grasshoppers. This work by Margie Crisp is a beautifully detailed linocut.</p>  
<p>  
The cool blues and grays of night and the creatures which inhabit it are presented in softer shapes by the collagraphs on handmade paper by Kristin Kavanugh and Alisan Clarke.</p>  
<p>  
In a more abstract piece, colored circles upon color go round in the prismatic swirl of <i>Magnetic Energy</i>, a monotype by Jo Lagattuta.</p>  
<p>  
These works are among the 24 pieces presenting the fine art of printmaking. The field of fine art printmaking covers a broad spectrum of techniques including: etching, relief, wood block, linocut, monotype, monoprint, intaglio, collagraph, chine colle, lithography, silkscreen, Solarplate, and other photosensitive plate making materials such as Imagon, Riston, Z*acryl, and Torelief.</p>
