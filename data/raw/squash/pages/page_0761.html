<H3>Viral Diseases of Plants</H3>

<p>Viruses are sub-microscopic, infectious particles that multiply only inside living host cells. 
Viruses are for the most part beyond the resolution capabilities of a light microscope. 
Consequently, virus structures have been determined primarily by electron microscopy and X-ray
defraction.  They vary in size from about 20 millimicrons to 1200 millimicrons.  Plant viruses
are made up of two components - a protein coat and the nucleic acid center.  The nucleic acid
is the infectious component of a virus.  Viruses are obligate parasites, meaning that they must
be within living tissue before they can reproduce themselves.  They require a wound to gain
entrance to a plant cell.  In nature, they depend primarily on biological agents such as
nematodes, insects and man for their dissemination.  Once duplication starts, the virus is
translocated from cell to cell through the plasmodesmata and to distant plant parts by the
phloem.</p>
<P>
In general, viruses are seldom lethal to plants, but do severely affect the host both in quantity,
quality and longevity.  Symptoms may often be very characteristic for a specific virus on a
specific host.  Symptoms along with other criteria are used to identify virus diseases.  An
advanced array of symptoms can be recognized today as expressions of viral diseases in plants.</P>

<P>
Viruses can be spread from plant to plant by several means.  Some of these would include
transmission from the parent plant to an offspring through the genetic structure of the plants. 
Other ways in which viruses can be transmitted are through vegetative propagation, grafting and
budding, seed transmission and mechanical spread by insects and man.</P>
<P>
At the present time, no effective chemicals will control virus diseases.  Therefore,  sanitation
and use of resistant varieties of plants has been the most effective means of controlling plant
viruses.</P>
<P>
In some instances, when the spread of the virus is slow, loss from disease can be reduced by
removing diseased plants and replacing them with healthy replants.  This method has been used
to reduce losses from peach mosaic.  Reducing the population of insect vectors by insecticides
or by other means, such as elimination of host plants for the insects, has given at least partial control of some virus diseases.</P>
