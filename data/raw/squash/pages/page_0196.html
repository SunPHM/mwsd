                first ever Services squash tour to South Africa took place recently.&nbsp; 
                Some 12 months in the planning, and drawing on the 10 best players 
                from all 3 services, the squad embarked on an ambitious schedule 
                to cover the length and breadth of the country over a 2-week period.&nbsp; 
                The RAF had 4 players in the Squad, with 2 men from the RN and 
                an Army contingent of 4.</font> 
                <p><a href="/rafactive/jpgs/squash03-ed8.jpg"><img SRC="/rafactive/jpgs/squash03-ed8.jpg" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=160 width=226 align=RIGHT></a><font face="Tahoma">The 
                  tour started in Johannesburg, playing provincial sides, before 
                  moving on to Pretoria to take on the South African National 
                  Defence Force. We were spoilt by being hosted non-stop by our 
                  sporting colleagues, but it would have been churlish to refuse.&nbsp; 
                  After being picked up from our spartan accommodation at the 
                  Holiday Inn, it was off to the Game Park for some close encounters 
                  of the wild kind. For the more cultured amongst us (both of 
                  us) there was the chance to go down one of the deepest diamond 
                  mines in the world to where the largest ever diamond was found. 
                  Now part of the Crown Jewels, there were unfortunately no free 
                  samples. Then it was off to Durban, again playing provincial 
                  sides for 3 days, interspersed by some dolphin watching.&nbsp;</font> 
                <p><font face="Tahoma">The real 'jewel in the crown' was undoubtedly Cape
Town.&nbsp; For anyone who has not been there, just go. The coast is like
the South Pacific and West Indies rolled into one. To wake up in your hotel,
gaze out to Table Mountain and beyond and be torn between so many mouth
watering excursions, is as good as it gets.&nbsp; So we would settle for
a quiet stroll down by the Waterfront to work up an appetite to do justice
to a sumptuous meal at one of the best restaurants; washed down by a bottle
of the best Cape wine, this would set you back no more than &pound;5.50.&nbsp;
Close to hand was the chance to charter a 58 foot schooner and get back
to match fitness by crewing it out to Robben Island and back.&nbsp; Stopping
to take a dip in the crystal clear waters of the Cape, we had the unforgettable
chance to swim with the ever- present dolphins that accompanied us for
most of the way.</font>
                <p><a href="/rafactive/jpgs/squash01-ed8.jpg"><img SRC="/rafactive/jpgs/squash01-ed8.jpg" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=201 width=297 align=LEFT></a><font face="Tahoma">Our 
                  trip to the Cape wine-lands gave us the chance to see unsurpassed 
                  beauty in the form of the undulating land, characterised by 
                  its steep-sided valleys. This was at an altitude that made the 
                  lush vegetation and countryside and not unlike a cross between 
                  the UK and the Austria, except that the sun shone at just the 
                  right temperature all the time. The vineyard owners could not 
                  have been more hospitable, offering their homes and their wine 
                  for all who wished to participate.&nbsp; An evening spent back 
                  on the seashore watching the spectacular rollers crashing onto 
                  deserted white sands was, by now, almost a formality.&nbsp; 
                  Oh, and I should say that we did well on the competition front. 
                  The sea air obviously did us good, winning 2 matches out of 
                  3 and squaring the series.</font> 
                <p><font face="Tahoma">Overall, the standard of squash was extremely high;
the opposition all put out strong sides with many nationally ranked players.
Some of these included the South African Champion and the South African
Over-40 Champion. This, coupled with a distinct home advantage (particularly
in Johannesburg, where the altitude factor made for a completely different
game), ensured a closely fought contest. In the event, the series resulted
in an honourable draw, the outcome resting on the very last game of the
last fixture.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The tour was a resounding success, providing an
excellent opportunity to play first class squash, and also to see so much
of this fantastic country.&nbsp; Strong sporting links were established
with both civilian and military organisation, providing (fingers crossed!)
a firm platform on which to plan future tours.</font></td>
