For instance, Dave Dyke reported an almost desperate situation in Lawrence County.  Temperatures have been in the upper 90 F and even into the low 100's one day.  They have had 26 days this year with above 90F temperatures.  It is so bad in some areas that farmers are selling off livestock because there are no pastures for grazing and EMS personnel are delivering water.    Sounds like they are competing with northeast Ohio for the driest weather title. Dave noted that they are 7.26" below normal for the year.  Joe Boggs noted that the southwest portion of the state is 4.56" below normal for the year.  The drought areas are scattered throughout Hamilton county.<br><br>On the other hand, in northwest Ohio, Amy Stone reports some decent rainfalls this past week (1" Sat., .1" Sunday and Monday both).  Amy said that some lawns are even greening up.  The showers that have fallen in Ohio have been the typical summer thunderstorms - widely scattered and sometimes delivering a lot of rain in a short period of time.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>HIRING A REPUTABLE ARBORIST</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="hiring an arborist"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/1000/1032.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.uiuc.edu/~isa/arborists/arborist.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd0953/jpeg/cd0953-24.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd0953/gif/cd0953-24.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Extension offices often field questions about trees, including maintenance practices and problems, such as split trunks, storm damage, carpenter ant infestations, girdling roots, surface roots, general decline, and more.  Maintenance and problem solving are often beyond the ability of the average homeowner to deal with, and clientele ask about how to hire a reputable arborist.  Look for arborists who are members of professional associations; though membership does not guarantee quality, lack of membership may cast doubt on the person's professionalism.  Look for companies who employ certified arborists.  <br><br>Arborists who are members of the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) have demonstrated skills and have been recognized nationally.

This bacterial disease can affect foliage and fruit.  The spots on the foliage appear first as small, irregular, water-soaked areas.  These areas often have a slight yellow ring (chlorotic halo) surrounding the infected spots.  The spots die and the whole leaf then turns yellow and drops off.  This bacterium can be spread by splashing water, implements, and people when the foliage is wet.  A measure of control is achieved by applying a fixed copper spray weekly, and waiting until the foliage is dry to work in the plants.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>EARLY BLIGHT OF TOMATOES</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="early blight on tomato"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/3000/3101.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~vegnet/tomcats/tomfrm.htm  "><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD>The crazy name doesn't help to understand this fungal disease that attacks tomatoes, not just early, but anytime.  Anywhere that tomatoes have been grown, this fungus is probably present in the soil.  Spores form on infested plant debris over a fairly wide temperature range, especially under alternating wet and dry conditions.  They are easily carried by air currents, windblown soil, splashing rain, and irrigation water.  Infection of susceptible leaf or stem tissue can occur in warm, humid weather, with heavy dews or rain.  Early blight can develop quite rapidly in mid to late season, and is more severe when plants are stressed by poor nutrition, drought, or other pests.  <br><br>What can be done to minimize problems?  Don't irrigate overhead, instead, water just the base of the plant.  Use other cultural practices like crop rotation, plant certified seeds and transplants, fall till to bury plant debris, and select cultivars that are less susceptible to early blight.  Fungicides, if used, should begin after transplanting into the field, and should be timed by the use of the blight predicting system called TOM-CAST at the VegNet website.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>ALIEN SQUASH AND PUMPKINS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="mosaic virus on cucurbit"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.oznet.ksu.edu/dp_hfrr/extensn/problems/cucmsaic.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~vegnet/reports/virus96.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD>What is going on with all of the weird growth occurring on squash and pumpkin leaves?  Leaves may appear mottled, blistered, distorted around the veins, or dwarf and misshapen.  No, it is not due to exhaust from an alien spacecraft!  However, it is possible that one of the mosaic viruses has found its way into the planting.  Some of these viruses can even mimic phenoxy (2-4,D) herbicide damage!  These viruses reside in perennial weeds, ornamental plants, other cucurbit crops, or are transmitted on the seed.  The virus is usually spread by aphids but cucumber beetles, grasshoppers, and whiteflies have been shown to move these problems around.  If these weird symptoms show up in the garden, the best thing to do is to admire the weirdness for a bit, and then pull up the plant and toss it.  An Ohio State study was done to see the extent of damage and how widespread these viruses are in Ohio.  Check it out the results on the VegNet website.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>DISGUSTING DOG VOMIT FUNGUS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="slime molds"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.cas.psu.edu/docs/CASDEPT/PLANT/ext/mulchfun.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1555/jpeg/cd1555-08.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1555/gif/cd1555-08.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>This interesting slime mold is showing up in numerous gardens across the state.  Pam Bennett noted that the occurrence of it is quite heavy in her evaluation plots, and Jane Martin has had numerous calls on her hotline.  Slime molds are fungi "feeding" on bacteria growing in the mulch.  They are an aesthetic problem; they do not damage the plants.  However, slime molds may occur on mulch surrounding bedding plants and other plants with foliage touching the mulch.  The mold can come in contact with the foliage, but it won't kill the plants.  <br><br>Dog vomit fungus, a very appropriate name for this slime mold, starts as a bright, whitish patch that is anywhere from several inches to more than a foot across.  Removing the whitish layer on a fresh specimen reveals a bright, egg yolk-colored yellow mass.  After about a day and a half, the mass turns brown and becomes dust-like.  It eventually turns into a hard white mass, which may be left in place to decompose or removed and discarded in a spot away from the existing mulch.<br><br>There are other types of slime molds and they are generally found April through October, usually following rainy weather or in places that are irrigated.  They are not harmful to landscape plants or humans, unless of course, they are consumed.

These caterpillars feed on foliage of various woody and herbaceous plants.  Most caterpillars are discovered fully grown and are wandering around on their way to pupation sites, though a few are found on host plants.  There are about 10 "giant" caterpillars common in Ohio.<br><br>A parasitized tomato hornworm was brought to Joe Boggs for identification; it was covered with small, white cocoons of a braconid parasitic wasp.  If you find a parasitized hornworm, leave it in the garden; this allows the wasps to emerge and parasitize other caterpillars.  <br><br>Tomato hornworms are green and up to 4 inches long, with eight curved, white stripes on each side of the body and a straight black horn at the rear.  Food plants include tomato, eggplant, pepper, potato, and related weeds.  Because the hornworm matches the color of tomato stems, it is difficult to detect until quite a bit of foliage is stripped from the plant.  The larval period ranges from 28 to 36 days, after which the larva burrows 3-4 inches into the soil to pupate and overwinter.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>EUROPEAN CHAFERS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90>&nbsp;</TD><TD>This insect pest was accidentally introduced into the U.S. and has a life cycle similar to that of the Japanese beetle.  The adults are about half-inch long, brick red-orange in color, and cause little noticeable damage to plants.  However, the larval white grub stage does a significant amount of root damage to ornamental plants underground in fall, winter, and early spring.  Currently, adults are emerging in the early evening hours just after dark.  They congregate on trees in large numbers, mate, and lay eggs in the areas near where they emerge.

Plant leaves were turning yellow and wilting, then becoming black between the veins, and finally turning crispy and brittle.  This damage was caused by the feeding of the squash bug (Anasa tristis).  Both nymphs and adults are sap suckers, removing fluid from stems and leaves.  If this isn't bad enough, as they feed, they also inject a toxic substance into the plant that causes it to wilt.  This wilting, known as Anasa wilt, is when most people discover there may be a problem in the pumpkin patch.  Smaller plants may be killed entirely, while larger plants may only have several runners affected.  Squash bugs scoot for cover when disturbed.  The best way to tell if this pest is trying to "quash the squash," is to look for small, copper-colored eggs on the underside of the leaves.  This zucchini zapper loves to lay its eggs, about 12-20 in a cluster, in the crotches formed by the veins.  Because of the long egg-laying period, all life stages can occur throughout the summer.  The best control is to be on the lookout early and if you see one of these bugs - squash it!</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>MIDGE FLIES GALLING CYPRESS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="baldcypress leafgall midge">   </form>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1699/jpeg/cd1699-32.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1699/gif/cd1699-32.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Joe Boggs reported that CYPRESS TWIG GALLS are now very noticeable on baldcypress in the Cincinnati area.  Sizes of the galls vary, ranging from 1/8 to 1/2 inch in length.  The galls are produced by a midge, Thecodiplosis ananassii.  In previous BYGLs, we have reported that the midge responsible for these galls was Itonidae taxodii.  That was incorrect since that species produces clusters of small galls that resemble flowers, thus the galls are called cypress flower galls.  The twig galls are cone-like, white to bluish-green, and they occur on twigs as single structures, not as clusters.  Their appearance makes them look like miniature versions of the growths produced by the Eastern spruce gall adelgid (ESGA) on Norway and other spruces.<br><br>Like the ESGA galls, the midge galls are covered with a whitish, powdery material, and they occur at or near the base of new growth.  A portion of this season's growth extends beyond the gall.  Unlike ESGA galls, the cypress galls are spongy, not "woody," and are sparsely covered with flexible needles.  Opening the galls will reveal the tiny, orangish-yellow midge larvae that are responsible for gall formation.  Usually, the galls fall apart and disappear by fall, leaving behind little evidence of their occurrence.   However, in past seasons, it has been reported that on some of the galls, the new growth extending beyond the gall will wither, turn brown and die.  Fortunately, this damage is minimal.  The life cycle of the midge is poorly documented so no controls are currently available.<br><br></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>WEE THREE FLEAS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="flea weevil"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="flea weevil">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://ctr.uvm.edu/ctr/el/EL23.HTM"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/Entomology/entfacts/veg/ef307.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk2.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1726/jpeg/cd1726-18.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1726/gif/cd1726-18.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Pam Bennett reported that during a recent visit to nurseries in the Clark County area with Dan Herms (OSU Entomology), they noticed that FLEA BEETLES had caused unusually heavy damage to a number of woody ornamental plants.  She noted that redtwig dogwood and weigela were particularly hard hit.  The report prompted a discussion of a number of insects which carry the "flea" moniker including FLEA WEEVILS, FLEAHOPPERS, and of course, flea beetles.<br><br>Flea beetles get their common name from their ability to jump...like fleas.  They belong to the beetle family, Chrysomelidae (the "leaf beetles"), and there are many species.  They are mostly small insects, ranging in size from 1/12 inch to 1/5 inch long and they have a number of body forms and colors: some are oval while others are elongate, some are black (e.g. potato flea beetle) while others are striped (e.g. striped flea beetle).  However, all are champion jumpers, capable of clearing as much as 2 to 3 feet in a single bound.  Adult flea beetles use their chewing mouthparts to produce small holes in leaves, which can collectively give the appearance that the leaf has been shot full of holes.  The larvae feed on roots, which can cause young plants to slowly decline.  Although flea beetles are mostly associated with vegetable and field crops, there are many species that are capable of moving to woody plants in landscapes and nurseries, particularly when their primary host has been exhausted or when population densities are high. <br><br>Flea weevils are also small beetles, about 1/8 inch long, with chewing mouthparts.  They have modifications to their hind legs, similar to flea beetles, which allows them to jump when disturbed.  Unlike flea beetles, the weevils are usually closely associated with woody ornamentals.  For example, the WILLOW FLEA WEEVIL, Rhynchaenus rufipes, may damage elm, aspen, oak, birch, cherry and apple trees, as well as their namesake.  Adults produce small pits in the leaves that later develop into holes.  Damage could appear similar to that produced by flea beetles; however, the weevils tend to produce much larger holes and few holes per leaf.  Larvae feed as leafminers and produce dark brown blotch mines.<br><br>Fleahoppers are sucking insects and they belong to the insect order Hemiptera.  Although they have modified hind legs that allow jumping, their efforts are usually meager and they seldom jump more than 3 or 4 inches.  Like many hemipterans, such as the 4-lined plant bug, fleahoppers inject enzyme containing saliva into the plant cells causing them to collapse.  They then feed on the "slurry."  Consequently, their damage appears not as holes, but as spots.  At first, their damage may look like yellow stippling.  Later, the spots enlarge and turn brown.  The GARDEN FLEAHOPPER is one of the most common insects in this group and is capable of feeding on vegetables, weeds, and ornamental plants.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>BURROWING SOD WEBWORM</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="burrowing sod webworm"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="burrowing sod webworm">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.aces.edu/department/ipm/Webworm.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1699/jpeg/cd1699-04.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd1699/gif/cd1699-04.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Dave Shetlar reported that the adult flight of burrowing sod webworm moths (Acrolophus popeanuellus) was unusually heavy this past weekend; over 350 moths were caught in light traps in a three day period.  The adult activity may mean that homeowners could soon see the unusual evidence of an infestation.  Unlike most sod webworm larvae, which live in silk-lined burrows oriented in a horizontal plane, burrowing sod webworm larvae live in two inch long vertical burrows that extend into the soil.  Larvae line their burrows with a paper-like, white sac made of silk.  After the larvae pupate and adults emerge, these sacs may appear resting on the surface of the grass, to be discovered by startled homeowners.  That's because the sacs look like partially smoked, hand-rolled...cigarettes.  Larval feeding damage may appear similar to that caused by cutworms; however, this insect is seldom a significant pest of Ohio turfgrass and control is usually not needed.</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>BLACK TURFGRASS ATAENIUS</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P><FORM ACTION="http://140.254.84.201:8080/Phantom.acgi$search" METHOD=POST width=98> <P><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".searchText" VALUE="white grubs"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".SessionList" VALUE="41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,75,76,77,79,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,91,92,99,100,101,102,111,112,113,119,120,121,123,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134"><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".andOr" VALUE=all><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".maxHits" VALUE=25> <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=".Details" VALUE=Details>  <INPUT TYPE=image SRC="../images/Fact.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=40 X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEWIDTH X-CLARIS-USEIMAGEHEIGHT BORDER=0 ALIGN=left> </FORM> <br clear=all><form action="http://140.254.84.203/ROFM.acgi" method=POST width=98 valign=left> <input type=hidden name="_action" value=FINDLINKS> <input type=hidden name="_database" value=PMI4> <input type=hidden name="_field" value=HTMLSummary> <input type=hidden name="_header" value=Plantdictionary> <input type=hidden name="_footer" value=Plants> <input type=hidden name="_linkField" value=HTMLRecord2> <input type=hidden name="Pest Common Name" value="black turfgrass ataenius">   </form><br clear=all>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2510.html"><IMG SRC="../images/lnk1.gif" WIDTH=96 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=bottom></A>&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd2582/jpeg/cd2582-44.jpeg"><IMG SRC="http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/images/cd2582/gif/cd2582-44.gif"width="202" height="168" vspace="0" hspace="10" align="left"></A>Dave also indicated that he is seeing heavy damage in central Ohio caused by black turfgrass ataenius grubs, and that this activity is unusually late this year.  Dave noted that although adults appeared right on schedule this spring, when Vanhoutte spirea was blooming (see BYGL 99-5), there was a 10 to 14 day lull in adult egg laying activity.  After the pause, egg laying continued.  Dave speculated that this interruption may have translated into larval activity continuing longer than normal this season.<br><br>The challenge for turf managers is to not assume that small grubs found now are first instar Japanese beetle grubs, particularly if heavy damage is also being observed.  Early instar Japanese beetle grubs should be showing up now, but their damage should not be appearing this soon.  Of course, the best way to make a positive identification of the grubs is to take a close look at the bristles (rasters) on the grubs...posterior.  Japanese beetles will have a raster pattern shaped like a "V".</TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 BGCOLOR="#FF9933"> <P><FONT SIZE=+1 ><B>BYGLOSOPHY</B></FONT> </TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P>&nbsp;</TD> <TD VALIGN=top> <P>Then seek your job with thankfulness and work till further orders, If it's only netting strawberries or killing slugs on borders;And when your back stops aching and your hands begin to harden,You will find yourself a partner in the Glory of the Garden.   - Kipling<BR></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=90><P>&nbsp;</TD><TD> <P><IMG SRC="../images/dot_red.gif" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=2 ALIGN=bottom> <P>Where trade names are used, no discrimination is intended and no endorsement by Ohio State University Extension is implied.
