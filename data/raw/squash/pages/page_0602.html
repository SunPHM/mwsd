              She reached into the bowels of her pick up truck and dragged out 
              from a huge pile, one after another, several large spiked football-shaped 
              fruits. Fitting a baseball glove over her left hand, she held one 
              up by its dried thin long stem and rested it on her glove; sniffing 
              at its base. Then carefully turning it horizontally, leaning with 
              her ear just above the spikes, she tapped at it repeatedly and lightly 
              with her fingernails. After several tries, she decided on a somewhat 
              rounded one with a slightly asymmetrical contour that had a faint 
              hollow sound resonating through its spikes. She laid it flat on 
              the edge of the truck. <br>
              <br>
              Using a very sharp long knife, she carefully cut into the surface 
              of one of the several protruded pouches, making a perfect small 
              triangle. She lifted the triangle out. Nestled deep inside the hard 
              spiky, grayish color rind laid the fruit, with its smooth, silken 
              butter-color flesh. It glowed though the open gap. She took off 
              the baseball glove and carefully inserted her finger inside, touching 
              it lightly, feeling it. The color of her long fingernails, painted 
              fire engine red, flashed and glittered in the streetlight like fireflies. 
              Satisfied, and withdrawing her hand, she then gestured my friend 
              to do as she had done. He reached in with his thick stubby finger 
              and touched the warm golden flesh. It yielded a bit, but otherwise, 
              held firm. He lifted his hand, then bending down toward it, he inhaled 
              deeply. The scent&#8212; strong, intense, pungent, and sweet, a 
              mixture of ripened cheese and heated molasses&#8212; rose up to 
              greet him. The alluring and intoxicating smell bewitched him with 
              an instant pang of feverish desire. As he lifted his head up, he 
              nodded at the woman; his face flushed with tiny beads of perspiration, 
              as his eyes seemed to glaze over.<br>
              <br>
              The woman took the knife and whacked off the stem. Fitting the baseball 
              glove back onto her hand, she turned the fruit over, propping it 
              upright where the stem was, on the bed of the truck. She made two 
              swift deep slashes over the protruding pouches, starting from the 
              top straight down toward the end. She then took off the glove, set 
              down the knife and pick up a clean rag. Covering her hands with 
              the rag, she tugged at the gashes on top, pulling hard, until the 
              fruit gave in, splitting open in halves. One side fell empty, revealing 
              the white blank indentations. Embedded on the other half of the 
              fruit, tugged snuggly inside the white casements were the golden 
              pillows, each separated into three pieces. She gently lifted the 
              small end piece and handed it to my friend. He took it, his hand 
              trembling slightly. Deeply inhaling it first, with eyes closed, 
              he then put the whole piece into his mouth. As he chewed, the inside 
              of his mouth and tongue touched and mingled with the slightly firm 
              filament and the soft warm, creamy custard-like flesh. The scent 
              of fermented-sugary fruit shot up his nostrils. He swooned with 
              ecstasy, murmuring softly. The woman, who had held a stern look 
              through the whole encounter, smiled softly. <br>
              <br>
              She proceeded to efficiently extract the rest of the fruit, lovingly 
              wrapping each segment in wax paper, and then packed it into a Styrofoam 
              box. Before my friend arrived at his home in a taxi, half an hour 
              or so later, he would have greedily torn into the box, devouring 
              half of the fruit, while the taxi driver good-naturedly watched 
              him with delighted astonishment. <br>
              <br>
              Durian (Durio zibethinus Murr) considered to be the king of fruits 
              in Asia, is the most sensuous of fruits. Believed to have originated 
              in Malaysia, durian evokes extreme feelings and opinions. You either 
              love it or hate it. While some would pay any price to acquire it, 
              others would rather be exiled to a desert island than to be trapped 
              in the same room with a durian. One thing is certain: at first sight 
              durian instantly startles and captivates your attention. You cannot 
              simply walk away, ignoring a durian. Durian commands your attention 
              like a real superstar. <br>

              While living in Ventura in the early 1970&#8217;s, my former husband 
              and I would occasionally drive to Los Angeles to treat ourselves 
              to a Thai meal. Jitrada, on Wilshire Boulevard, served very good 
              Thai meals which were enhanced by fresh herbs grown by the owner. 
              Back then, it was still rare to meet other Thai compadres, and the 
              owner took a liking to us. She invited us to visit her home, which 
              was on the same block as the restaurant. Instead of a front lawn 
              of grass and flowers, she had planted lemongrass&#8212;tall, healthy 
              clumps with their long, green blades uniformly shaved off down to 
              the hard stalks. The yard looked like a large, beige flattop haircut. 
              I was quite impressed with the sight because up until then I had 
              never seen fresh lemongrass grown in America. She gave us a couple 
              of stalks that my husband planted in a pot. In no time at all, the 
              roots bored deep into the soil, and the stalks multiplied, growing 
              by leaps and bounds. With fresh lemongrass, cooking the real thing 
              was a wish came true. <br>
              <br>
              Lemongrass is cymbopogon citrates (derived from the Greek words 
              kymbe, meaning boat, pogon meaning beard and citrates meaning resembling 
              citrus.) A more common name for it is citronella. Lemongrass looks 
              like its namesake, clusters of wild tall grass. An ancient herb 
              believed to have originated in Southeast Asia, lemongrass, because 
              of its healing properties, is used not only for cooking but also 
              as medicine and in cosmetics. Ancient homeopathic theory relies 
              upon the herb&#8217;s aroma and taste as guides in analyzing its 
              curative properties. Lemongrass, because of its citrus aroma is 
              believed to relieve stress, cure colds, and aid headaches, fever, 
              and nausea. Its sharp, citrus-like taste with a touch of pungency 
              is believed to nourish the inner fire element of one&#8217;s body, 
              which in turn controls the inner wind, and therefore, cures stomach 
              pain and the feeling of fullness, while at the same time acting 
              as both diuretic and antibiotic. It is used in meat dishes, because 
              meat is believed to be heavy with strong earthy aroma. Lemongrass 
              dissipates the heaviness with its heat and at the same time, masks 
              the meaty aroma with its light lemony fragrance. It is used together 
              with lime to heighten and accentuate the aroma and flavor of soups, 
              salads, and relishes. <br>
              <br>
              Lemongrass is often used in conjunction with other herbs and spices 
              to enhance their distinct flavor, while at the same time, rounding 
              all into one blooming bouquet. This is most evident in Thai cooking 
              when fresh herbs and dried spices are pureed together in a mortar 
              and pestle to create seasoning paste. Interestingly, the same technique, 
              perhaps initially derived from homeopathic physicians, is employed 
              to create herbal blends for tea, skin tonic, potpourri for steam 
              bath and massage compresses. <br>
              <br>
              During the past 3 to 4 years, lemongrass, once considered a common 
              ingredient for cooking and much taken for granted, has again regained 
              its rightful reputation in Thailand. This is partly due to the emergence 
              of the spa, the newest fad promoted by Thai tourist industry. Unfortunately, 
              without an in-depth understanding of its homeopathic properties, 
              some spas use it more as a popular exotic lure rather than for its 
              true potential. <br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, in the West lemongrass is the newly discovered 
              darling among chefs. During the past several years, when a dish 
              needs a Thai touch, lemongrass and chiles are often added. Today, 
              lemongrass is available in most supermarkets. But because of a lack 
              of understanding of how to care for lemongrass, it is often dried 
              and withered away in the bin with its outer hard parts and green 
              top cut off. Its essential oil has been compromised.<br>
              <br>
              Nevertheless, for the beginner who wishes to learn how to use this 
              alluring aromatic and gentle herb, making lemongrass tea or skin 
              toner is a good start. The tea, made from fresh or dried lemongrass, 
              is believed to relax and calm one&#8217;s nerves while the toner, 
              made from fresh minced lemongrass, invigorates and refreshes the 
              skin. In these times filled with uncertainty and anxiety, lemongrass 
              is a soothing balm for our body and spirit.</span><br>

              My cousin Susie, who never took vacations, decided to treat me to 
              a weekend holiday at Koh Samui. Our first night, we walked from 
              our hotel along the beach, checking out restaurants. We came upon 
              a lean-to perched by the roadside. Several men were unloading baskets 
              of fresh oysters from a small fishing boat. Instantly, we got ourselves 
              a table and I ordered several dozen of the oysters. The sweet, sea-washed, 
              jelly-like morsels slid down into my mouth, one after another, followed 
              by a couple of swigs of ice cold Singha beer. Susie ate crab-fried 
              rice. <br>
              <br>
              The next morning, while doing Tai chi on the beach, I fainted and 
              didn&#8217;t regain consciousness until hours later. Flat on my 
              back, I awoke with a pregnant Thai doctor hovering over me. She 
              had hooked me up to a bottle of something through my veins. For 
              the next two days, I lay in bed, with frequent trips to the toilet, 
              while Susie chained-smoked outside our room. <br>
              For the next month after my sickness, I tried to resume my regular 
              diet. Each time I ate seafood or meat, I would get deathly sick 
              again. So, I became a vegetarian and remained one for seven years. 
              It was then that I became re-acquainted with and developed a respect 
              for tofu, the venerable food of my ancestors, the food I hated as 
              a child. <br>
              <br>
              It is believed that the process of making tofu from soybean was 
              accidentally discovered by a Chinese ruler during the Han dynasty 
              (206 B.C. &#8211; 200 A.D.) named Liu An. Tofu is believed to have 
              originated in Eastern Asia, either in northern China or Mongolia. 
              Chinese legends bestow the honor of the earliest distribution of 
              soybeans to sages and wise rulers, valuing it as one of the oldest 
              crops grown by man. True or false, soybean was transmitted to Japan 
              via Korea sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries, and today 
              tofu, miso (soybean paste), and shoyu (soy sauce), are revered for 
              their importance in the Japanese&#8217;s diet.<br>
              <br>
              Tofu is made in the same way as dairy curd is made from cow&#8217;s 
              milk. Soymilk is curdled or solidified with either a &#8220;salt&#8221; 
              (magnesium chloride) or an acid (such as lemon juice or vinegar). 
              When these substances are stirred into hot soymilk and allowed to 
              stand undisturbed for several minutes, the milk separates into delicate, 
              white cloud-like curd floating lightly on top the pale yellow whey. 
              It is called &#8220;flowers of tofu&#8221; in Chinese, the only 
              kind of tofu I loved as a child. <br>
              <br>
              I can still recall the vendor who awakened our neighborhood at the 
              break of dawn with his cry, carrying fresh warm &#8220;flowers&#8221; 
              in a bamboo tub. Our servant, with the rest of the womenfolk would 
              hand him several bowls into which he scooped the warm sheets of 
              &#8220;flowers&#8221;, using a thin wide metal spoon, and then topped 
              it with hot sweet ginger syrup. Perhaps my liking of this fresh 
              tofu is because of its rich, delicate, and smooth custard-like texture. 
              It has a subtle and sweet flavor, unlike the firm kind, which turns 
              gritty, as well as exuding a slightly fermented musty smell. <br>

              But I wasn&#8217;t able to find the &#8220;flowers of tofu&#8221; 
              in the days following my illness. The next best thing to it was 
              the silken soft tofu which I added to soup. Desperate to eat my 
              share of protein, I sometimes also had to cook with the firm tofu. 
              After taking it out of the tub of water, I transferred it into a 
              shallow bowl and crowned the top with a plate and a heavy can, before 
              refrigerating it for several hours. This process extracted most 
              of the liquid, leaving the tofu very dried and compact. I saut&eacute;ed 
              or deep-fried the slices before mixing it with other vegetables. 
              I also made curry, salad, fried rice, noodles, and spicy stir-fried. 
              My brother Kim remembers mother&#8217;s recipe for Mah Peh Tofu, 
              a Sichuan style spicy tofu dish and shared it with me. Its main 
              seasoning ingredient, Sichuan peppercorns, besides being spicy, 
              also numbs the sensations in the tongue after a couple of bites. 
              This makes the experience of eating tofu tolerable. <br>
              <br>
              Today, although I am no longer a vegetarian, I have finally found 
              the &#8220;flowers&#8221; of tofu and eat it as often as I could. 
              Several Asian markets now sell them fresh and warm soon after their 
              stores are open. After eating the first bowlful, I refrigerate the 
              rest and heat up a portion in the microwave as needed. It is almost 
              as good as fresh. As I savor the &#8220;flowers&#8221;, I am reminded 
              of my childhood mornings on Soi Sam Phra in Bangkok when the days 
              were always warm and we the children lived in a safe cocoon, fussed 
              over and cared for by our parents. <br></td>

              The French call Chinese cabbage Pe Tsa, an adaptation of the Chinese 
              words Pei Tsai, meaning white vegetable. One of the oldest vegetables 
              originating in China, its eventual planting and cultivation over 
              the centuries in France and throughout the globe, is credited partly 
              to Chinese migrants who took the seeds with them wherever they settled. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Asides from its nutritional value, Chinese cabbage (Chinese celery 
              cabbage, Napa cabbage) is a resilient vegetable. After it is harvested, 
              it can be kept in the cool cellar to last from autumn until spring. 
              It is versatile, offering its pliable texture and bland taste to 
              accommodate other ingredients. <br>
              <br>
              My father, like millions of his countrymen before him, relied on 
              this vegetable as a staple while traveling and living as a salesman 
              overseas. Chinese cabbage was not only inexpensive and plentiful 
              all over Asia, but also somehow evoked a sense of familiarity and 
              comfort for father. It reminded him of China&#8230;of home. Instead 
              of eating strange foreign food, father would buy a head of Chinese 
              cabbage on the way back to his rooming house, set a pot of water 
              boiling on a portable kerosene stove and make himself Chinese cabbage 
              with pork soup. <br>
              <br>
              Years later, after he eventually settled down in Thailand, this 
              same soup graced our table at every single meal, breakfast, lunch 
              and dinner except on Saturday. On that day my mother would mince 
              the cabbage, mixing it with ground pork to be folded into dumplings. 
              Decades later, when my parents emigrated to America, I took them 
              grocery shopping at one of our gigantic supermarkets. To them, seeing 
              Chinese cabbage among innumerable and unrecognizable vegetables 
              was like meeting an old bosom buddy. <br>
              <br>
              For the remainder of her years, Chinese cabbage became a familiar 
              and tangible thing my mother could count on in this strange new 
              country. Cooking with it gave her a sense of continuity. Recipes 
              using the cabbage, whether to mark the turn of the season or to 
              celebrate holiday allowed her to maintain her cultural tradition, 
              learned long ago in China, which she continued to practice until 
              her death. It was a comforting expectation for us, her children, 
              that come Saturday or Chinese New Year celebration there would always 
              be Chinese cabbage and pork dumplings. When fall arrived, she would 
              buy several heads for pickling. <br>
              <br>
              I was reminded of my mother&#8217;s steadfast traditional practice 
              when some twenty years ago, I visited our ancestor&#8217;s home 
              in Shantung province on a Chinese New Year. As the men folks and 
              I huddled together against the cold on top of a toasty and warm 
              kung (a cement platform with wood burning underneath), the women 
              were busy. In the dark, cramped kitchen they were boiling mounds 
              of Chinese cabbage and pork dumplings for our breakfast. As they 
              brought out the tray with steaming plate of dumplings, among them 
              was a bowl of pickled Chinese cabbage. A flash image of my mother 
              came into my mind. I could see her as clear as day, sitting by our 
              dining table, eating her homemade pickled Chinese cabbage wrapped 
              in a piece of Chinese scallion flatbread. As she gazed into the 
              garden, savoring the chewy bread laced with spicy, sweet and sour 
              taste of the pickle, her mind seemed to float back, faraway, back 
              to the time, so long ago, of her childhood home. </span><br> <br>

              <span class="recipe">By November, the last of the monsoon rain has 
              been swept away by the steady stream of dry cool wind. It is the 
              season for pomelo. As a child growing up in Bangkok, I remember 
              my father buying, never just one or two, but always a dozen or so 
              of these grand, round, greenish citrus the size of a bowling ball. 
              Pomelo was father&#8217;s favorite fruit. These smooth green balls 
              were lined in a neat row against a wall in our small shop house, 
              ready for inspection. <br>
              <br>
              After supper, father would pick up each and every one of the pomelos, 
              bounced it lightly into the air, and then toss it back and forth 
              in his hands as if he were ready to shoot it through a hoop. Turning 
              the bottom side with its deep dimple upward, he poked into its well 
              with his fingernail. The fruit sweated, seeping tiny beads of aromatic 
              oil. Father sniffed deeply for the sweet menthol-laced fragrance 
              before pronouncing it ready to be eaten. <br>
              <br>
              Mother took the chosen one into the kitchen and proceeded to carve 
              it open. First, she sliced a thin piece off the top exposing the 
              fruit&#8217;s secret pigment: white or pink. She then scored the 
              rind lengthwise and around in four equal pieces. Inserting the blade 
              into the sliced top, she ran the knife between the hidden fruit 
              and the rind, around and deep into the thick, cushiony pith. Using 
              her hands, she tucked and pulled where the cuts were made, prying 
              loose the outer rind. The spongy pith was then torn away until the 
              inner thin filmy casement became visible. She pulled the fruit in 
              two, and then separated the individual segments and handed them 
              to each of us. We bit along the thin upper edges, pulling the casement 
              open, then pushed with our fingers at the tightly formed inner glistering 
              sacs. It bloomed like a flower. <br>
              <br>
              In America, pomelo is seldom known for what it is. Also known as 
              pummelo, citrus grandis, C. maxima, and shaddock, the fruit has 
              been successfully grown in Florida and California for decades. And 
              yet, it is continually mistaken for a giant grapefruit and treated 
              as such. Although it is a member of the grapefruit family, pomelo 
              is far superior in its taste and texture. The Chinese variety is 
              a larger oblate fruit with rough, bumpy, yellowish rind, while the 
              Thai variety is round with a smooth, bright greenish rind. Both 
              produce either white or pink pulp. Aside from similar genetic links, 
              everything is different between these two citrus fruits. The pomelo 
              has sixteen to eighteen segments while grapefruit has twelve. Pomelo 
              is less acidic with thicker rind and pith, and its juice sacs are 
              firmer, holding the sweet, tangy liquid.<br>
              <br>
              One of my earliest childhood attempts was making Som Oh Loy Keaw 
              &#8211; a Thai dessert combining sugary syrup infused with jasmine 
              blossoms. A handful of individually separated pomelo juice sacs 
              are sprinkled into the syrup with some crushed ice. As I became 
              more adept as a cook, I not only learned how to make a delicious 
              Thai pomelo and grilled shrimp salad, but also to carve its rind 
              into a decorative container. Once the salad is eaten, the rind is 
              hung to dry in the sun and saved for another day when chill air 
              threatens one with an imminent cold. A cup of hot tea combining 
              pomelo rind, ginger and a bit of honey becomes the perfect soothing 
              balm. </span><br> <br> <strong>&#8212; Su-Mei Yu</strong> </td>

                Ever since Steve described the wild turkey he cooked for Thanksgiving, 
                I&#8217;d been itching to get my hands on one of the wild turkeys 
                he shot, now lying frozen in the depths of his freezer. Steve 
                has a way with words when it comes to food. He spun his tale about 
                how his roast wild turkey was so packed with flavors, enhanced 
                by a touch of gaminess, so remarkably tender, and so juicy and 
                moist that he couldn&#8217;t imagine ever eating, just for the 
                sake of the holiday, the farm-raised version for which we ordinary 
                folks had to settle.<br>
                <br>
                As a city person, I had only been fantasizing what a wild turkey 
                tasted like. I dreamt of cooking one, having read Thai cookbooks 
                about how old-timers hunted and cooked their wild game. Having 
                heard Steve&#8217;s triumphant account, my imagination kept on 
                churning, tickling my taste buds until I could hardly stand it. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Months went by before we had a chance to chew over our favorite 
                topic&#8212;food. Immediately, the thought of his wild turkey, 
                still gnawing at my memory, popped forth. &#8220;Let&#8217;s cook 
                it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Let me do something Thai with it. How 
                about a rich Musman curry with fresh pineapple and kumquats?&#8221; 
                Brenda, Steve&#8217;s wife, wasn&#8217;t too crazy about pineapple. 
                All she could think of was Hawaiian hulas or bad Chinese sweet 
                and sour sauce. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be absolutely fabulous,&#8221; 
                I assured her. <br>
                <br>
                The problem was that on the day I was supposed to cook this long- 
                awaited dinner, my schedule went haywire. Steve had the wild turkey 
                delivered to my office bright and early, while I was stuck running 
                errands. I had hoped to cook it slow and long, as it was wild 
                game. By one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, I still hadn&#8217;t 
                laid my eyes on the prize. Desperate, I telephoned my assistant 
                to make the brine by mixing 2 cups of salt with 3 cups of water 
                and stick the turkey into it. A hour or so later, I charged into 
                my office, took the turkey out of the brine, washed it and began 
                to cook it in a sauce of fresh coconut cream and Musman curry 
                paste. The room was suddenly filled with the most heavenly fragrance 
                of rich sweet coconut cream perfumed with 16 spices. I seasoned 
                the curry with more dry-roasted cloves, bay leaves, a handful 
                of roasted whole shallots, chunks of pineapple, sliced kumquats 
                and the secret ingredient, a couple dashes of whiskey. For the 
                next couple hours, the scents from simmering pot made our stomachs 
                growl. It drove us crazy. <br>
                <br>
                I must say I was rather nervous about the outcome, but in fact 
                it far exceeded my imagination. When we opened the lid, the scents 
                of roasted spices from faraway lands burst forth, filling the 
                kitchen with mouth-watering fragrance. The sauce was gorgeous 
                &#8211; a thick rich, deep burgundy with speckles of yellow and 
                orange. It tasted indescribably creamy with savory coconut cream, 
                and a touch of spicy roasted chiles, tamed by tangy pineapple 
                and kumquat. The turkey was so tender that the meat instantly 
                fell off the bones. It was not only succulent, but each morsel 
                had taken in all the flavors of the curry paste. It was indeed 
                fabulous.<br>
                <br>
                All I could say is that we ate and ate until we were stuffed. 
                Steve and Brenda had the leftovers for a week. According to them, 
                it tasted even better with each passing day. <br>

                If Khum Phon had her wish, she would go fishing everyday. She 
                especially loves to fish for catfish. Before her son, an army 
                sergeant, moved away to Texas, he used to take her fishing just 
                about every weekend. Lake Hodges, Lake Jennings, and other lakes 
                within a day&#8217;s drive from San Diego were some of their favorite 
                fishing spots. Like other Laotians and Thai folks, fishing for 
                catfish is the ultimate. To them, catfish is king. <br>
                <br>
                Khum Phon was born in Baan Gate in the central part of Laos. Her 
                family were salt farmers. Khum Phon grew up helping the womenfolk 
                with farm and household chores. They were renowned for their pickles. 
                Using their own harvested salt, they pickled just about everything 
                from fish, to crawfish, crab, meat and vegetables. <br>
                <br>
                Khum Phon&#8217;s love of fishing grew after her marriage to a 
                Thai-Laotian who lived in a tiny border town between Thailand 
                and Laos, by the bank of the vast Mekong River. Khum Phon&#8217;s 
                husband, like most men folk, fished to put food on the table. 
                They made bamboo fishing poles, cut from the thick, wild forest 
                groves. To these country folks, a meal with freshly caught fish 
                lightened the hard day&#8217;s work. <br>

                Twenty-five years ago, Khum Phon and her family immigrated to 
                San Diego after the end of the Vietnam War. Their humble home 
                might look to outsiders as just another wooden clapboard house. 
                But to their Laotian friends, it feels like back home especially 
                their suan kroa or kitchen garden. Nestled among the sturdy bamboo 
                groves and graceful banana trees is the family&#8217;s garden 
                of seasonal vegetables and herbs. Khum Phon and her eldest daughter 
                cook for their large family and often, friends. Among their favorites 
                is a fabulous soup with Khum Phon&#8217;s freshly caught catfish. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Khum Phon&#8217;s delicious catfish soup is simple. First, a whole 
                catfish, including head and tail, is cut up and slightly saut&eacute;ed 
                with minced garlic. It is then added to a saucepan of boiling 
                water. Stalks of lemongrass, slices of galangal, ginger and a 
                handful of kaffir lime leaves are added to complement the fishy 
                aroma. Several whole chiles are added, followed by a handful of 
                tangy and sweet baby tomatoes, a pinch of salt, some sugar, and 
                a dash of tamarind juice and fish sauce. When the soup is done, 
                clumps of pakk chee farang and pakk kayang are added for their 
                aromatic scents. If the soup is made during cool season, Khum 
                Phon&#8217;s own pickled sour bamboo shoots are added. <br>
                <br>
                As it is being served, the hot steam rises, perfuming the air, 
                evoking an image of Laos on a hot, bright day&#8230;a day after 
                a rain shower, as one stands by the riverbank, watching catfish 
                jumping in the water. <br>

                During one of my annual visits home to Thailand, I made a trip 
                to the ancient city of Sukothai. Along the main highway were rows 
                of wooden stalls selling handicrafts. One in particular had several 
                beautiful bunches of golden bananas hanging in the front. I stopped 
                with the intention of buying the gorgeous bananas. Hidden behind 
                the bananas, among bamboo baskets, carved wood figurines were 
                brick charcoal braziers and terra cotta cooking pots. They brought 
                back sentimental memories of my family’s kitchen. It was an outdoor 
                cement slab behind our house with hardly any furniture or equipment. 
                Like all Thai kitchens back then, a couple of charcoal braziers 
                occupied a prominent space. I had a sudden urge to step back in 
                time and cook the way the Thai once did and bought several charcoal 
                braziers and terra cotta pots. </p>
              <p><span class="recipe">When my treasured purchase arrived at last, 
                only one pot and charcoal brazier survived the trip. I was heartsick. 
                With the sole surviving set, I set out to experiment with the 
                traditional way of Thai cooking. First, I hunted for charcoal 
                and decided to combine walnut and mesquite charcoals, hoping the 
                fire would be hot enough to cook but not to crack my one and only 
                pot. </span> </p>
              <p><span class="recipe">Among the old Thai traditional soups I love 
                best is Keang Som (Keang=soup, Som=orange or sour), a spicy-sour 
                soup. Its principle ingredients are dried red chiles, garlic and/or 
                shallots and shrimp paste, fermented fish or fermented bean paste. 
                Variations of Keang Som come from different regions by adding 
                seasonings favored in the region and vegetables and herbs commonly 
                available. No matter what, the essence of Kaeng Som must have 
                a balanced taste of spicy-salty-sweet-sour. It can be made in 
                the morning and eaten at the evening meal or the next day with 
                a handful of fresh vegetables added. When made in the traditional 
                terra cotta pot, Kaeng Som simmers slowly on the brazier allowing 
                the chile paste to brew, it is unmatched in its intense and well-blended 
                flavors. </span> </p>
              <p><span class="recipe">Keang Som is always made with seasonal greens. 
                For example, during the cool season ( November, December and January), 
                tender new shoots of okra plants are used for a distinct bitter 
                taste and fish is added to compliment it. Tender shoots and leaves 
                with a slight astringent flavor such as squash or pumpkin vines, 
                young tender sour tamarind shoots or tangy baby mango leaves are 
                other favorites. Aromatic herbs including ginger, galangal (Lao 
                ginger) and krachai (less ginger or Chinese keys) sometimes are 
                added with seafood. Blossoms such as Dok Khae ( Sesbania Grandiflora), 
                white or purple blossoms resembling pea blossoms render a delicate 
                texture and add a surprise element to the dish. </span> </p>
              <p class="recipe">In the late spring and early summer, farmer’s 
                markets in San Diego burst with fresh fruits and vegetables. I 
                bought zucchini blossoms for its sweet delicate texture, oyster 
                mushrooms for it softness, French beans for its refreshing taste, 
                and tender rapini for its slightly bitter taste. Together they 
                would make a perfect pot of Keang Som. </p>
              <p class="recipe">When I returned home, I got down to the serious 
                business of pounding my chile paste. I used my mother’s mortar 
                and pestle, my prized inheritance. I squatted on the cement floor 
                of my outdoor kitchen and pounded away on the salt, garlic, chiles, 
                galangal, krachi and shallots. To the smooth paste, I added a 
                tablespoon of shrimp paste which I bought in Thailand. It smells 
                slightly of the sea. </p>
              <p class="recipe">It has been ages since I last saw my mother start 
                the charcoal brazier. I decided to start my fire with a combination 
                of newspaper and kindling. Completely out of practice, I burned 
                up a whole issue of the New York Times and still no fire. I was 
                about to give up when I remembered mother used to fan the fire 
                gently to get it going. Starting from scratch, I lit a couple 
                of pages of newspaper with small pieces of plywood and patiently 
                fanned it with an old magazine. In 15 minutes, I had one heck 
                of fire burning in my little charcoal brazier. </p>
              <p class="recipe">The day before, I cured the terra cotta pot by 
                soaking it in cold water and drying it in the sun. A brand new 
                terra cotta will crack if you put it directly on the fire without 
                first curing it. A bit nervous and anxious, I put cool water in 
                the pot to boil hoping the pot would not crack from the heat. 
                It did not. As the water came to a rolling boil, I put in chile 
                paste and seasoned it with a small chunk of palm sugar, sea salt 
                fish sauce, several fresh chiles and pickled mustard greens. I 
                took ashes from my earlier attempt to start the fire and covered 
                the burning coals with them to lower the heat. I covered the pot 
                and let it simmer slowly for about an hour. By then, the pickled 
                mustard greens softened. The aroma was wonderful and the slightly 
                reddish color of the soup was just about perfect. I brushed the 
                charcoals from the ashes and raised the heat. When the soup began 
                to boil hard, I add the tamarind juice, and put in the vegetables. 
                In a couple of minutes the vegetables were cooked and the soup 
                was ready to eat. Squatting in front of the pot, I spooned the 
                soup directly into my bowl of rice. I ate and ate until the pot 
                of Kaeng Som was nearly empty. </p>

                SAUCE</strong> </font> </span></p>
              <p><span class="recipe">Figuring out the best brand of fish sauce, 
                the secret seasoning ingredient for Southeast Asian cooking, was 
                once left to the Asians themselves. With the explosion and popularity 
                of Asian cooking in America, everyone wants to get a bottle of 
                this magic potion. Without knowing good from bad, one whiff of 
                the bad stuff to a newcomer can instantly kill off the person&#146;s 
                love affair with Asian cooking.&nbsp; So, how can you tell the 
                difference?</span></p>
              <p> <span class="recipe">Fish sauce, like olive oil, has different 
                grades, which determine its quality. Good fish sauce is the color 
                of weak tea and smells like the sea. I have seen dark-colored 
                fish sauce, which looks like soy sauce, in the best markets. Do 
                not buy it under any circumstance- it is spoiled and putrid. The 
                brand does not guarantee the quality of the fish sauce. It is 
                the color that tells it all. </span> </p>
              <p class="recipe">Fish sauce has a short shelve life. If you are 
                not going to use fish sauce everyday, buy the smallest bottle 
                you can find. I prefer a glass container, fish sauce seems to 
                stay unspoiled longer in glass than plastic. Once open, fish sauce 
                should be refrigerated. When it becomes dark, discard and buy 
                a new bottle. </p>
              <p class="recipe">Regardless of the brand, fish sauce is very inexpensive, 
                ranging from 69 cents to $5.00. Buy a couple of brands and experiment. 
                Taste it first before using. Although fish sauce is generally 
                processed in the same method, different manufacturers add extra 
                or secret ingredients in their product. Some are very salty with 
                first contact on your taste buds, and then dissipate leaving a 
                sweet after taste. Some do not. </p>
              <p> <span class="recipe"> Use and experiment with fish sauce for 
                other cuisines besides Asian cooking. A teaspoon or so of this 
                wonderful gift from the sea can really make a difference. </span>
