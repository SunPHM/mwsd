<p>The first time I saw Saber Suwaidan was during a visit to the Kuwaiti
Air Force in 1971. He was a young pilot. I envied him for his squash playing
skills, he was seeded number one in Kuwait. Envy led me to believe that
he is nothing but a squash player. How much I was mistaken. Now I play
squash with General Saber and the only envy I have is to those who served
under him. Here is his story. The story of the commander who would not
leave his air base.
<p>On the 1st&nbsp; of August 1990, after finishing a friendly game of
squash Colonel Saber went home to have dinner and go early to sleep as
usual. At 10:30 that night he received a call from Head Quarters ordering
him to go to&nbsp;<a href="sabersuwaidan.JPG"><img SRC="sabersuwaidan.JPG" height=100 width=140 align=LEFT></a>the
air base. He was the commander of Ali Al-Salem Air Base. His wife got concerned,
but he promised to call her from the base. Mrs. Suwaidan had to endure
seven months of agony until she could hear the voice of her beloved husband.
<p>Saber arrived at the base around 11:15. He could not think of anything
other than his obligation to defend Kuwait, the protection of his men’s
lives and the preservation of the assets he had been trusted with. He forgot
to call his wife.
<p>He had a lot of things to do. The day before they had a sandstorm, the
sand had blocked the doors of the weapons stores. The bulldozer crews were
away for the weekend. So they had to shuffle the sand manually. The base
had a limited crew to arm and fuel the planes. So he asked everybody to
chip in and do jobs they usually did not do. For instance he asked the
Pakistani maintenance crew to help in arming the planes.
<p>At 3:45 AM the next day the Air Operations Center asked Ali Al-Salem
to intercept two helicopter formations totaling 70 planes. One formation
was heading to the base and the other to Kuwait City most probably to Dasman
Palace the Amir’s residence. Saber knew that he should do whatever he can
to protect the life of his Chief Commander the Amir of Kuwait.
<p>It took Saber only ten minutes to have four planes in the air. The pilots
were Captain Mohammed Al-Dossari, and Lieutenants Habis Al-Mutairi, <a href="abdullahsuwailim.html">Abdullah
Suwailim</a>, and Ali Al-Anzi. Each shot two Iraqi helicopters using their
air-to-air missiles. Twenty minutes later Colonel Saber launched two more
planes. The pilots were <a href="taheral-taher.html">Major Taher Al-Taher</a>
and Lieutenant Bassam Al-Jouaid. Al-Jouaid downed two planes using his
air-to-air missiles, but Al-Taher was not satisfied with only two so he
used his 30mm cannon to down a third one. They flew back to the base to
refuel and rearm. Then went back to face that military juggernaut. But
this time they could not come back to the base.
<p>The Iraqis were not long in retaliating. As the sky lightened, they
attacked all the KAF bases using Sukhoi bombers escorted by their own Mirages
(Planes Kuwait financed their purchase). They destroyed the runway at Ali
Al-Salem. No plane could take off from that runway with full load of fuel
and armaments.
<p>Colonel Saber knew by then that he could not have his planes back. So
he ordered them to go to Ahmed Al-Jaber Air Base to refuel and go to Saudi
Arabia. As they approached Ahmed Al-Jaber they could not land because the
runway was littered with Airdropped mines. They had two choices land on
the runway and get killed by the mines or eject and lose their planes.
They decided on a daring operation. To land on a side road that is barely
wide enough for the undercarriage of the Mirage. They refueled and left
to Saudi Arabia.
<p>While Saber was lamenting the loss of his runway he realized that there
is only one thing left to do. Send as much as possible of the planes under
his command to Saudi Arabia. So he armed two Mirages with limited weaponry
and fuel, just to take them to Ahmed Al-Jaber Air Base and be able to protect
themselves along the way. The light planes could do a short take-off and
did not need the full length of the runway. Each plane shot down an Iraqi
helicopter on their way to Ahmed Al-Jaber. Then they continued to Saudi
Arabia. By 9 AM most of the planes had left the air base.
<p>Saber never lost his humanitarian responsibilities. He asked his men
to treat the wounded Iraqis and bury the dead.
<p>Unfortunately Saber could not save all the Mirages. He was short of
pilots. I asked him why did he not fly one of those planes to Saudi Arabia,
as he was a Mirage pilot. He looked at me with astonishment and coolly
told me. I am the commander of the base and I had to be the last to leave.
A startling contrast to what the Iraqi commanders did during Dessert Storm
when they fled and left their soldiers with no leadership.
<p>Later on the air base was captured.
