        everyone is born with a green thumb. Some of us can't keep a cactus alive 
        in the family room, much less plant a vegetable garden. And even if you 
        aren't horticulturally impaired, you may be short on time and energy. 
        This is where your local farmers' markets can be the answer to your culinary 
        prayers. Besides, it doesn't make sense to buy produce shipped from overseas 
        when you can buy it only hours old from local farmers. And that's just 
        one of the many reasons you should drag yourself out of bed early on Saturday

        foods: </i>Most of the fruits and vegetables at farmers' markets have 
        been picked within the previous 24 hours, whereas supermarket produce 
        can be weeks old. Those blueberries on special this week at our Chicago 
        supermarket were shipped here from New Jersey, while the farmers' market 
        berries are driven in daily from Michigan, two hours away. Last year I 
        compared both and found the Michigan berries to be the hands-down winner, 
        with their fresh, white "bloom" and firm skins. The supermarket berries 
        had a shriveled look </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000"> 
        and didn't taste as sweet. (This is why I try to avoid jet-lagged produce.) 
        Freshness is especially critical for vegetables such as corn that need 
        to be cooked or at least refrigerated shortly after picking, before their 
        natural sugars convert to starch. Freshness means better flavor without 
        the loss of valuable nutrients. </font> </p>

        <i>Such a deal: </i>While some farmers' market items (such as blueberries) 
        will cost more in small quantities than you'd pay at the supermarket, 
        other items are quite a steal. I can buy five sweet red peppers for $1 
        and freeze them for those </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">winter 
        months when they cost $5 per pound. Buying pecks or half-bushels of peaches,

        corn and at least two kinds of peaches? My last trip to market turned 
        up purple peppers, pattypan squash and an astounding variety of herbs. 
        Another nearby market carries an array of heirloom tomatoes. Farmers' 
        markets also may carry plants, fresh-cut flowers, baked goods and unusual 
        Wisconsin cheeses like basil Brie (yum!). </font> </p>

        <i>Healthier, too: </i>Even though there are few certified organic growers 
        at the farmers' markets in the Midwest, most of the farmers try to use 
        minimal amounts of pesticides and sprays. As my favorite melon farmer 
        says, "There's not even enough [chemical residue] to make you glow in 
        the dark." At the country's largest farmers' market in Madison, Wisconsin, 
        about 60% to 70% of the farmers are using organic methods without being 
        certified organic. And, guaranteed, you'll never find wax on farmers' 
        market cucumbers or apples. </font> </p>

        Moreover, many noncommercial farmers try to preserve their soil by rotating 
        crops and feeding minerals back into the earth, which results in healthier 
        food - a benefit not to be taken lightly. According to the Center for 
        Disease Control, the increased consumption of fresh produce has contributed 
        to a rise in foodborne illness. (Perhaps you may remember reading about 
        the Michigan schoolchildren who contracted hepatitis A from Mexican strawberries 
        and another outbreak from a parasite on Guatemalan raspberries) I'll stick 
        to food grown and sold closer to home - food I can match whenever possible

        your local farmer. </i>The Illinois Department of Agriculture reports 
        that produce farms are getting scarce in northern Illinois. One farmer 
        told me that if it wasn't for the farmers' markets, he couldn't survive. 
        The reason the supermarket chains can't buy local produce such as blueberries 
        is that, as one produce manager told me, "We can't count on the volume." 
        Supermarkets plan their advertising </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000">(the 
        flyers that you get in your newspaper) months in advance, so they can't 
        take a chance on adverse weather conditions that could wipe out a crop. 
        That's why, instead of those delicious Michigan cherries, we'll see Northwest 
        cherries at our supermarket. Or we'll get those waxy, tasteless Washington 
        State apples instead of a local heirloom variety. If we don't support 
        our local farmers, we may one day find that our farmland has been transformed

        Peel and slice the peaches into two custard cups (or one small microwave-safe 
        casserole) until cups are almost full. Mix the rest of the ingredients 
        in a glass measuring cup. Microwave** on high, uncovered, until the butter 
        melts and the oats soften (60-70 seconds). Stir the topping and spoon 
        over the peaches. Microwave uncovered for about two minutes (rotating 
        the cups after one minute), until the peaches are soft. Serve warm or 
        at room temperature, topped with vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt. </font>
