Conference Centre and cricket pitch</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><small>We've all seen your
average, garden variety winery. This is far, far from it. For a start this winery which is
located in Romsey, Victoria, boasts a superb and very&nbsp; picturesque cricket pitch and
pavilion. The pitch is a private affair (and a good earner) that attracts teams from our
Prime Minister's eleven down to corporate and social clubs. If you think that's not enough
to make the property noteworthy on its own it also features a Royal (Real) Tennis Court
&#151; one of only four in Australia. If you haven't come across Royal Tennis you are not
alone but you are missing out on one of the more eccentric sports played anywhere. </small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><small>Royal Tennis is a
hangover from medieval times. The court is larger than a conventional tennis court and has
strange gabled roofs projecting from the side walls to make it look like the courtyard of
a castle (see the picture below). The game is played with an odd, bent racket that looks
like a distorted squash racket, a very hard ball and a set of rules that is as long as it
is complex. Despite its oddities the game has quite a following of dedicated players.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><small>The Cope Williams
property is more than just a country sports centre, though. It's winery happens to produce
one of our region's best sparkling wines as well as a range of quality red and white table
wines. Its accommodation and conference facilities are busy all year round and boast the
who's who of corporate clients, and its superb gardens are occasionally open to the public
for a treasured glimpse.</small></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"><small>The property is the
labour of love of Gordon and Judy Cope-Williams. Prior to creating this stunning property,
Gordon was an architect and Judy was an interior designer (and an accomplished classical
guitarist). The dedicated teamwork between them has provided us with one of the more
interesting hospitality businesses we have ever worked with. If you are in the area go and
enjoy some of their wine and their hospitality . . . and maybe bash a few balls.</small></font></p>
