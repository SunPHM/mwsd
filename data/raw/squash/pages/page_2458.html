But with a Web site and a Bay area full of well-wired citizens with sophisticated tastes, Internet farming was not only inevitable, it is also profitable.</P><P>"We found that a lot of our customers in San Francisco have e-mail, too, and it was fun," says <A HREF="walker.link.jpg">Walker</a>. "It was something different, and it's just kind of grown."</P><IMG SRC="basket.jpg" ALT="basket" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="126" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"><P>Indeed, it has. Over half of Walker's business comes to him over the Internet.</P> <P>Walker's customers sign up for anywhere from one to three months, and receive a basket of vegetables every week.</P><P>Walker posts a calendar on his Web site which lists which crops are available and when. Cucumbers and summer squash, for example, are available now. </P><h3> Farmers take requests </h3> <A HREF="http://www.eatwell.com" TARGET="NEW"><IMG SRC="eatwell.jpg" ALT="screen capture" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="174" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A><P>Tomatoes are due in a couple of months, and Walker expects to have a lot of them. He currently offers 26 different varieties of full-sized tomatoes and four kinds of cherry tomatoes. He also has a test plot with 90 other kinds in the ground.</P><P>How easy is a purchase? After the customer views the 'menu' a quick mouse click brings up another page -- an order blank. The customer chooses the vegetables and the quantity, and where they are to be delivered.</P><P>Walker downloads and fills the orders. He also asks his customers if there is something he's not growing that they'd like to have.</P><P>"We communicate in a sort of personal way with them," says Carol Gould, an Internet customer.</P><P>Internet farmers also publish recipes on their Web sites for everything from gazpacho to leftovers.   </P><P>"So if they send you some leafy green that you've never heard of," says customer Art Siegel, "you have some good ideas where to start to cook them."</P><A HREF="http://www.saturdaymarket.com" TARGET="NEW"><IMG SRC="saturdaymarket.jpg" ALT="Saturday market screen capture" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="213" HEIGHT="218" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"></A><P>Thanks to a preview on the Internet, the sugar snap beans are going fast on the Net and at the farmers markets that  Internet farmers help promote. </P> <P>"Having a Web site and having access to tools like the Web site can really help them," says Judith Redmond of the Community Alliance for Family Farmers. "It can really help them make better connections with people in urban areas that are going to support them."</P><P>In fact, some struggling farmers have taken to selling on the Internet to get higher prices than they would at wholesale.</P><P>It can be the difference between farming and folding.</P> <A NAME="links">&nbsp;</A><!-- ============================================--><!-- ================= Relateds =================--><!-- ============================================--><CENTER><IMG SRC="/images/9607/hr.gif" ALT="rule" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="3"></CENTER><H3>Related sites: </H3> <EM><FONT SIZE="2">Note:  Pages will open in a new browser window</FONT></EM><UL><LI><A HREF="http://www.eatwell.com" TARGET="NEW">eatwell farm</A><LI><A HREF="http://www.saturdaymarket.com" TARGET="NEW">Ditty's Saturday Market</A><LI><A HREF="http://www.caff.org" TARGET="NEW">Community Alliance with Family Farmers</A></UL><CENTER><P><EM>External sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive.</EM></P></CENTER><!-- ============================================--><!-- ================= Relateds =================--><!-- ============================================--><!--========================================================--><!--===============Paste story between here=================--><!--========================================================--><CENTER><IMG SRC="/images/9607/hr.gif" ALT="rule" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="3"></CENTER><CENTER><P>Watch these shows on CNN for more sci-tech stories:<BR><BR><A HREF="/CNN/Programs/CompConn/index.html">CNN Computer Connection</A> | <A HREF="/CNN/Programs/FutureWatch/index.html">Future Watch</A> | <A HREF="/CNN/Programs/Science/index.html">Science & Technology Week</A>       </P> </CENTER><CENTER><IMG SRC="/images/9607/hr.gif" ALT="rule" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="3"><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING=5><TR><TD>	<A HREF="/feedback/"><IMG SRC="/images/9607/what_you_think.gif" ALT="What You Think" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="59" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="/feedback/">Tell us what you think!</A><BR><BR><A HREF="/feedback/comments.html">You said it...</A></TD><TD>	<IMG SRC="/images/9607/dot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="96" BORDER="0"></TD><TD></TD></TR></TABLE><IMG SRC="/images/9607/hr.gif" ALT="rule" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="3"></BLOCKQUOTE><BR CLEAR=ALL><A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="/images/9607/back_to_top.gif" ALT="To the top" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="45" BORDER=0></A><P>&#169; 1997 Cable News Network, Inc.<BR>All Rights Reserved.</p><H6><A HREF="/interactive_legal.html">Terms</A> under which this     service is provided to you.</H6></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
