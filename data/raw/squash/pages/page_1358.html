BEGINNER'S GARDEN: GREEN BEANS AND SQUASH</h4>
<p class="byline">By Niki Hayden</p>
<p>If vegetable gardening is new to you, try planting green bush beans and
summer squash this year. You’ll be amazed at the high yields these easy plants
offer. Even if you don’t have room for any other edibles, a few rows of beans
and two squash plants will feed a family of four during the height of summer.
And if you’ve only room in a perennial bed, try one squash plant. With broad
wavy leaves that arch from thick stems, the plant will look like a tropical
native grown for its exotic foliage.</p>
<p>The closing of May marks the end of frosts along the Front Range and signals the time to
plant tender summer vegetables. But there’s an important caveat to both these
plants. Neither will germinate in cold, wet soil. They like days to be at
least 70 degrees and nights to dip no lower than 40 degrees. It’s worthwhile
to wait until those conditions are met. Otherwise, you’ll have spotty
germination and stunted, spindly plants. Both grow so quickly that waiting for
ideal temperatures will be worth some patience.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/greenbeansquash0995.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="294" height="222">Neither likes to be transplanted, another reason to look for warm
temperatures since you’ll be placing the seeds directly into the soil. So
unless you live at high altitude, prepare to get out a hoe and find the best
spot. Most vegetables require at least six full hours of sun each day, so plant
them away from trees and in the sunniest area you can find.</p>
<p>Green beans offer a particular boon to new gardeners. They are nitrogen
fixing, which means that you won’t have to add much in the way of fertilizer
to your first garden. If you’ve never planted beans before, it’s worthwhile
to buy seeds that state on the package they have inoculants added. This is a
bacteria that is necessary to be introduced into the soil. It will ensure
that the roots of the beans can produce their own nitrogen. After a first
season, your garden will already have the bacteria lingering for bean seasons to
come.</p>
<p>Simply digging up and turning over the soil, adding a small sack of peat moss
or aged compost, will break up heavy clay or enrich sandy soil. Colorado soil is
high in minerals but often made up of hard clay. You’ll want to add that
compost to condition the soil so that roots grow quickly. That’s all your
beans will need. For an in-depth story on soil preparation for an extensive
garden, click onto our related article—<a href="Vegetable-colorado.htm">New
Beginnings: A Vegetable Garden in Colorado</a>.</p>
<p>Squash may benefit from some weak fertilizer as it grows, but even so, the
bounty that one crookneck yellow or zucchini bush provides is legendary. Miss
one day of harvest and you’ll find zucchini the size of baseball bats. Both
green beans and squash companion easily since they require about the same amount
of water and similar soil and temperature conditions. Squash in need of water
will droop pathetically as a technique for getting attention. Green beans can
tolerate a little less, but growing habits are similar. They don’t harbor
the same pests so they’ll grow vigorously alongside each other.</p>
<p>Squash will need a great deal more space, so plan at least a three-foot
circle for each squash plant. Green beans, in contrast, will grow clustered
together in neat rows for easier picking.</p>
<p>Both vegetables offer an array of choices, from the standard green beans to
delicate, tender <i>haricot vert</i> or filet beans. Squash can be grown as
heirloom crookneck yellow, standard zucchini, or a mix of each in a yellow
squash shaped like a zucchini and with a green tip.</p>
<p>Plant their seeds one warm afternoon and you’ll be harvesting them at the
same time, usually about 55 days after planting. When they begin to fruit, check
each day because they require regular harvesting. Otherwise, you’ll end up
with oversized squash and tough, leathery green beans. Squash is harvested
daily. Green beans will arrive in waves as tiny beans mature. A harvest tip is
to cut beans with scissors: it's faster and you won't pull out the fragile plant
with a overzealous tug.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/greenbeansblossomsquash0919.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="295" height="217">From a culinary perspective, both bush beans and squash are edible when
young. This is helpful in Colorado since our season is short. The tender three-inch baby squash and slender green bean are prime
gourmet products. You need only get out to the garden early to determine the
size you like best and pick the very young, or mature, according to your
liking. And squash come with an added benefit—the blossom. Italian chefs
remove the pistils and stamens of the bloom, fill it with goat cheese, twist the
end of the blossom tightly, dip it in batter and lightly fry it for a summer
appetizer. When you can’t bear another squash, consider using the blossom as
an edible container.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/greenbeansnasturiums0881.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="294" height="220">If you’d like to add flowers to the mix,
add nasturtiums alongside squash.
Their trailing habits companion with the low spreading leaves of squash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Calendulas mix well with beans because they also grow upright at about the same
height. Each can be grown easily from seed at the same time you plant your bean
and squash seeds. Both are edible. Toss the blooms into a salad. Nasturtiums,
from the watercress family, taste akin to bitter greens in flavor. Calendula
has little flavor, but the vivid saffron flower adds intense color. Once you’ve
added flowers to your small veggie garden, you now have the equivalent of a
French <i>potager</i>, or kitchen garden, that includes vegetables, flowers and
fruit.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/greenbeanscalendula0927.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="301" height="218">Colorado State University has tested varieties of vegetables that grow well
under Colorado weather conditions. You’ll find a link to that website below.
Do consider some of the heirloom varieties of squash. Their flavor is
incomparable. A few seed companies specialize in heirloom vegetables, which are
listed below. And if you love the thin, delicate filet beans, they grow well in
Colorado. It takes more time to harvest, but they are exquisite. Typically
they're listed as filet or French green
beans.</p>
<p>Whichever you choose, it’s hard to go wrong. For the simple pleasure of an
abundant yield, trouble-free produce and fast growing success, these two
vegetables are hard to beat. After you have mastered them, consider a lettuce
and greens garden, then potatoes, beets, cucumbers and radishes. Eventually you’ll
be fretting over tomatoes and eggplant, which challenge even the most
experienced gardener. But in your first endeavor, go for success and you won’t
regret it.</p>
