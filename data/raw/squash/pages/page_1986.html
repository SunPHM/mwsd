<h1>Yard Birds and Yurt</h1>

<i>Buzz Williams</i>

<span class="photoright" style="width:284px;"><img src="content/quarterly/W2003/images/snowfamilies.jpg" alt="Playing in the snow"><br>The McWhirt and Hayler/Williams families take time to enjoy a day in the snow.</span>
<p>We didn’t have to look far to find more folks pursuing self-sufficient lifestyles. Featured here are the Williams/Hayler and McWhirt families. For those of you who may not know, the Williams is me, the Hayler is Nicole, my wife and Development Director here at the Chattooga Conservancy, and the McWhirts are our neighbors—Steve, Sarah and their two kids, Holt and Branch. Nicole and I have one child, Jasmine.
</p>

<p>In 1991 the WcWhirts and Nicole and I collectively purchased 115 acres of the old Swafford farm in Long Creek, South Carolina. The property is nestled in a cove at the headwaters of Fall Creek, which is a major tributary to the Chattooga River, and we live surrounded by the Sumter National Forest within hearing distance of the river. Both families enjoy being as self-reliant as possible, though to different degrees and interests.
</p>

<p>Nicole, Jasmine and I live completely “off the grid.” We pump our water by hand (for now), utilize a self composting toilet, filter gray water back to the earth through a small artificial wetland, and grow much of our food in a raised bed garden. We also harvest black walnuts, muscadine grapes, “cressy” salad (a wild mustard green), mountain mint and other wild herbs. I don’t have much time to hunt, but did harvest a deer last year that was browsing our small orchard of apple, peach and pear trees. We enjoy a bountiful crop of domestic blueberries and raspberries along with wild blackberries, and can about 40 quarts of garden produce in addition to putting up garlic, winter squash, and root crops such as Irish and sweet potatoes.
</p>

<span class="photoleft" style="width:217px;"><img src="content/quarterly/W2003/images/potatoes.jpg" alt="Hauling potatoes in a wheelbarrow"><br>Jasmine rides piggy-back while Nicole hauls fresh potatoes from the garden.</span>

While we are in the process of designing our “dream house,” we live comfortably (albeit at close quarters) in a home made “yurt” that is constructed of bamboo, straw, red clay, cement, and a little chicken wire for reinforcement. The yurt is 20 feet in diameter with a skylight, gravity water, and flagstone floor. We get hot water during the summer from a series of passive solar panels, and in the winter months from a copper coil that circulates water through the wood stove. For heating, we cut wood on our property and harvest dead trees locally. To the greatest extent possible we harvest our own building materials from local sources, which include timber generated from the Chattooga Conservancy’s Brown Gap Timber Sale project. High quality salvage such as old windows, doors, “recycled” timber and bricks complement our stockpile of building materials.
</p>

<span class="photoright" style="width:206px;"><img src="content/quarterly/W2003/images/buzzsnow.jpg" alt="Pumping water in the snow"><br>Buzz and Jasmine prepare to pump water for their wood-fired water heater.</span>

<p>Living in this manner certainly requires a strong dedication to simple living and other conservation values. Many may view our lifestyle as extreme, but its simplicity and self reliance offer a rejuvenating balance to an increasingly homogenous and automated world. A local logger who hauled pulp wood from our pasture area called this lifestyle “pay as you go,” and we were fortunate to find the land for this experiment.
</p>

<p>The McWhirts live across the creek at about “hollerin’” distance. Both families get together as much as possible, and our favorite excuse is to churn a batch of homemade ice cream. Thanksgivings are also a treat due to Sarah’s gourmet cooking and Steve’s pumpkin pies and home brewed beer. The McWhirts are so good at living close to the land that I am offering here a short interview to let you in on some of their best strategies.
</p>

<p>I stopped by to ask a few questions and found Sarah making chicken soup with one of her “yard birds.” Steve happened to have a day off, as well.
</p>

<p>Buzz: “What brought you here to the Chattooga River?”
</p>

<p>Sarah: “After graduating from college in the spring of 1998, we passed through the area on our way down to the Florida Keys. We had a cousin working on the river, so we stopped for a visit. We really liked the community of people, the solitude, and of course we were interested in learning how to paddle. So we came back to stay that spring.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “What do you like about the self reliant lifestyle?”
</p>

<span class="photoleft" style="width:211px;"><img src="content/quarterly/W2003/images/bandmill.jpg" alt="Peeling logs with a drawknife"><br>Steve draw-knifes the bark off of a white pine log. After the logs were peeled, they were milled into beams and boards for the McWhirt’s cabin.</span>

<p>Steve: “We really like the independence of living off our own land, and especially growing some of our own food.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “What are you getting out of your garden right now?”
</p>

<p>Steve: “Right now we are harvesting mixed greens, kale, and turnip greens. We also have some of our beds in cover crops. Raised beds are good for cutting down on erosion and use less water.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “Is your production ‘organic’?”
</p>

<p>Steve: “We don’t use pesticides or chemical fertilizer. We harvest hardwood leaves to put in the pig pen to produce good fertilizer for the garden.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “Right now you have pigs and chickens. What kind are they?”
</p>

<span class="photoright" style="width:182px;"><img src="content/quarterly/W2003/images/holtbranch.jpg" alt="Feeding chickens"><br>Holt and Branch share an apple with their chickens.</span>

<p>Sarah: “We raise Buff Orpington chickens because they are a dual purpose bird. They are good layers and they produce high quality meat. They are heavily feathered and will lay all winter.”
</p>

<p>Steve: “We have raised both Durock and Yorkshire pigs. They’re both good.”
</p>

<p>Sarah: “Pigs are the best protein converters of all farm animals. We usually buy a piglet in September at about 50 pounds, and it grows out to about 350 pounds by January or February.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “You built your log cabin from wood harvested right here, didn’t you?”
</p>

<p>Steve: “Yes, we hired a friend to cut and skid the logs from our woods with horses. We used a portable band mill to saw the timber on-site.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “Do you recommend this lifestyle for other folks?”
</p>

<p>Sarah: “This lifestyle isn’t for everybody. We make sacrifices to live here. If everybody lived this way, it would be a little crowded up here.”
</p>

<p>Buzz: “Do you think self reliance is a statement for conservation?”
</p>

<p>Steve and Sarah: “Yes.”
</p>

<p>Sarah: “People today are out of touch. They go to the grocery store in January and demand watermelons. I don’t buy them because they don’t taste good, and it costs too much both in terms of money and the environment. Also, I don’t think it’s truly sustainable.”
