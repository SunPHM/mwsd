<p><b><font color="#3366FF"><font size=+4>Pocket Charts</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+2>Pocket
charts are my favorite tool for teaching reading!&nbsp; I have 7 rolling
garment/laundry racks, with two charts hung back-to-back on each, and I
also staple sentence strips to my walls for non-interactive activities
like our monthly Good Morning song.&nbsp; Pocket charts are one of the
most popular literacy centers in my classroom, and are also great for large
and small group instruction.</font></font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="bearschoolbar1.gif" height=90 width=393>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3366FF"><font size=+2>Here
are some of the charts we're currently using:</font></font></font></b>

Happy &amp; Jack O' Happy</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The children have individual
books of these poems for their book boxes, and I've enlarged the artwork
to make a big book for each month's poem, too.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I make my Happy Poem sentence
strips in alternating colors.&nbsp; Apple Happy is <font color="#00CC00">green</font>
and <font color="#FF0000">red</font>, and Jack O' Happy is black and <font color="#FF6600">orange</font>.&nbsp;
I make a second set of strips for each poem, laminate them, then cut them
into individual words for matching activities.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I store the matching words
in a one-gallon zip-lock freezer baggie, stapled to the pocket chart.&nbsp;
The kids enjoy matching the text in the pocket chart and/or rebuilding
the sentences on the floor, and also take individual word cards to their
work area during Writer's Workshop.</font></font></b>

<p><img SRC="octchart1.jpg" BORDER=5 height=262 width=360>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>This is the top half of
our October Word Bank pocket chart.&nbsp; There are two cards for each
word -- one has a picture and one has the word only.&nbsp; The one without
the picture goes in front of the picture card.&nbsp; I use several colors
for the words, to make them easier to match.&nbsp; I have two sentence
frames at the top, with some extra high-frequency words on Post Its so
we can insert them as desired for reading.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I use this chart for whole
group, small group, and individual instruction on Concepts About Print,
language development/vocabulary, onset and rime lessons, discrete phonics,
Modeled Writing and Shared Writing, and many other activities.&nbsp; The
KinderKids use it as an interactive Pocket Chart Literacy Center during
our Reading Block.&nbsp; During Writer's Workshop, the children use the
chart for reference, and they may take the non-picture word to their work
area in order to copy it.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In these photos, 3 first
graders are doing Independent Writing during our after school tutoring
program.&nbsp; They are writing on "green bar" computer paper with colored
markers, which are much easier to write with than a pencil, and a lot more
motivating.&nbsp; You can see how involved they get in their writing --
I actually had to stop them after 30 minutes to get ready to go home.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>One of the boys was in
my kindergarten class last year, and was very excited to see the familar
words and activities again, and was proud of how much "more" he could do
now than a year ago.&nbsp; I never worry about my students using the same
materials two years in a row (if I teach a combo class or loop up with
my KinderKids), because each child does each multi-level activity at their
current ability level.</font></font></b>

my other Fall Thematic Units, including <a href="pumpkinpatch.html">Welcome

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Here are some of the pocket

Lives on a Farm?</font></font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>An original story by
Victoria Smith</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="pchart_wholives.jpg" BORDER=5 height=321 width=288>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I use this chart to teach
tracking, left to right progression, and one-to-one correspondance.&nbsp;
The barn-shaped Ellison represents the word <font color="#FF0000">farm</font>,
and I use the animal Ellisons as a Rebus for the animal words.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I also have an 8 1/2"
x 11" blackline master for this book, with the full sentence for each line
printed on the individual pages (all words, no Rebus icons).&nbsp; The
students glue the corresponding Ellison shape onto each page.&nbsp; For
Kindergarten, the sentence frame for the book is "A (animal name) lives
on a farm."&nbsp; For First Grade, the sentence frame includes color words,
so it reads "A (color) (animal name) lives on a farm."&nbsp; The cover
of the book is shown below:</font></font></b>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>An original story by
Vicki Witcher</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="givingfarm.jpg" BORDER=5 height=378 width=360>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>This is one of Vicki Witcher's
wonderful emergent reader stories for Fall.&nbsp; I have the blackline
master to make the student books, and I enlarged the artwork to make a
Big Book, which I do for almost all of the student blackline books we use.&nbsp;
I was in a hurry when I made this pocket chart set, and didn't color the
artwork.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Having many of our stories
in several forms -- small books, big books, pocket charts, song &amp; poetry
cards, poetry journals, etc. -- gives the children multiple opportunities
to work with familiar text while learning Concepts About Print and learning
high frequency words and other words.&nbsp; Research shows that multiple
readings lead to fluency and increased comprehension.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I'm working with Vicki
Witcher to make her emergent reader blackline sets available to KinderKorner
subscribers and website visitors.&nbsp; As soon as they're ready, I'll
be posting the info to the KinderKorner newsletter and will also put the
info on the website.&nbsp; I'm no longer able to answer individual notes
asking about when Vicki's books will be ready, but promise I'll let everyone
know the moment they are :o)</font></font></b>

Fall Farm Veggies</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Two
weekends ago, my family and I visited Avila Valley Barn, just outside San
Luis Obispo, California.&nbsp; We took lots of pictures and I made a new
online emergent reader called <a href="http://geocities.com/kinderkorner/farmtrip/sld001.htm">I
Went to the Farm</a> (click on the title to see this fun book your students
can read online).</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>While
we were there, I bought an assortment of Fall vegetables that we could
keep in the classroom until Thanksgiving.&nbsp; My students are having
lots of fun touching, weighing, comparing, graphing, and exploring the
veggies on our Science Table.&nbsp; Here are a few pictures of our veggies,
all of which can sit around for several weeks without spoiling:</font></font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="squash3.jpg" BORDER=5 height=316 width=288>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>These are a few of the
many hearty edible veggies and decorative gourds we've been exploring.&nbsp;
On November 1, I'll put the dried Indian corn in a pan of water, and dozens
of corn seedlings will sprout from the cob -- it's always very exciting
for the kinderkids!&nbsp; The veggies seen here include an acorn squash,
a butternut squash, a turban squash, a spaghetti squash, a miniature pumpkin,
three gourds and an ear of decorative dried corn.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="turban.jpg" BORDER=5 height=216 width=275>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>This is the bottom of
an upside down Turban squash.&nbsp; It looks best when viewed upside down
:o)&nbsp; There's a stem on the other side, so the kids were able to tell
which side was the "real" top.&nbsp; We have several families in our school
neighborhood where the men wear turbans, so the kids were very interested
in seeing this large veggie up close.&nbsp; The squash is 11 inches across
and weighs several pounds (our plastic balance scale -- the teeter totter
kind -- isn't able to support this veggie king).</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="mystery_squash.jpg" BORDER=5 height=216 width=298>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>We have no idea what kind
of squash this is, but would love to hear from anyone who knows.&nbsp;
It's big, bumpy, and sort of a greyish-blue-green color, and very unusual.&nbsp;
It's smooth and cool like a pumpkin, and we think it may be some sort of
pumpkin cousin :o)&nbsp; We'll probably cut it open when we make a Jack-o-Lantern
later this month, so we can see what's inside.&nbsp; The little pumpkin
is a candy cup, about 2 1/2 inches tall ... I put it in the picture for
size comparison.&nbsp; Please write to us if you know what this mystery
veggie is ... I got it at Avila Barn, but didn't see a sign telling me
what it was.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="hubbard1.jpg" BORDER=5 height=238 width=558>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>This is a Hubbard Squash,
and it's huge!&nbsp; It measures over 22 inches long, from the tip of the
stem to the end of the unusual (and non-characteristic) bulbous outgrowth
on the opposite end.&nbsp; The outside feels like a pumpkin on the smooth
areas, but there are many scars and scaly-feeling areas, which we think
were mostly caused by the squash lying on the dirt or against the vine
and leaves as it grew.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>My grandmother, who was
born in 1898, used to tell me about when she moved to Cambridge, Minnesota,
when she was 15 years old, to be the assistant cook in the Cambridge Hotel.&nbsp;
One day they brought her a Hubbard Squash to cook, and she had never seen
one before and was afraid to admit she didn't know what to do with it.&nbsp;
She spent more than an hour peeling it with a paring knife, and ended up
with blisters on her fingers from the pressure required to remove the shell/rind/skin
of the squash, which she then boiled.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>If I recall correctly,
you're supposed to poke holes in this and bake it, much the same way as
you'd cook an acorn squash or spaghetti squash.&nbsp; I think we're going
to keep this one around as long as it doesn't start getting squishy, unless
the cafeteria staff offers to cook it for us.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</font></font></b>
