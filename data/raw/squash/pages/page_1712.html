         Led my intramural team to the championship against all the
         ex BU football players - scored game winning touchdown on
         interception and ran it back. Won 4 Intramural Championships
         at school, 1 in football, 2 in soccer, and one in co-ed
         (gay) softball. Played varsity soccer in high school- once
         scored 5 goals in one game. Ran a 4:58 mile (proceed to
         vomit afterwards). I once joined a gym in Spain, but gave up
         on working out to just play squash (consequently I could
         kill all of you in squash right now. Badmitton is fun too. I
         think foozball is a gay fraternirty game. Overall I am a
         fucking pimp.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"

         Notes:</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="arial" COLOR="#FFFFF7"> I
         enjoy bowling - but my score is highly contingent upon how
         loaded I am. On the AAA Cruiser team (which is bullshit, I
         should be on the big league club). I also am one hell of a
         dancer. I just moved back from the East Coast and am now
         working in Mission Viejo. I am a lot younger than everyone
         else who plays in this game which should help me quite a
         bit. Although I doubt my regimen of drinking and playing
         softball has kept me in tip top shape. I like the night
         life, I like to boogie. I also enjoy gambling, mainly casino
         war, no other card game challenges your wit quite like
         casino war. I aspire to be on whichever team plans on
         winning this year. Yes I am that fucking good. I just want
         to be on Sollis' team so he wont hit me when I go over the
         middle. Actually scratch that, I'm not going over the
         middle.</FONT></B></P>

         COLOR="#FFFFF7">Too be frank, I wouldn't expect too much out
         of this guy. No I'm never seen him play, but man, HE IS ONE
         SKINNY MO-FO. I mean, COME ON?? He says he's got mad game,
         so we'll see what happens. More likely than not he will be a
         late round pick. You won't see the kid go over the middle,
         and probably won't get invovled in too many gang tackles.
         Could be a solid player, but unlikely to be one of the
         "Impact" players. We'll let the game decide
         however.</FONT></B>
