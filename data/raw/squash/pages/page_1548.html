																				</span>Squash, the preferred game of Wall Street has convenience on its side, as 30 minutes on the squash court provides an impressive cardiorespiratory workout. Extended rallies and almost constant running builds muscular strength and endurance in the lower body, while lunges, twists and turns increase flexibility in the back and abdomen. &quot;For people just getting into the game, it's almost too much to sustain, but once you get there, squash is tremendous,&quot; says Paul Assaiante, head coach of the five-time defending national intercollegiate champion men's squash team at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. Assaiante recommends a regimen of yoga, sprinting and distance running for preparation. Be wary of groin pulls, torn Achilles tendons and your opponent's racquet.</td>

Sliding seats in rowing shells and on rowing machines provide a total-body workout, building lean muscle throughout. &quot;Most good oarsmen are strong but thin,&quot; says Steve Wagner, head coach of the men's crew at Rutgers University, who notes that proper technique in the legs, backs and arms, not strapping shoulder muscles, is the most important part of rowing. While Wagner notes that most rowing injuries occur &quot;outside of the boat,&quot; those suffered inside are typically minor, such as tendonitis or overextended back muscles. Plus, it's a great argument for investing in waterfront property</td>

It's anaerobic, relying upon bursts of energy to get from one rock hold to the next. While that won't do much for your heart, it's great for strength, endurance and flexibility everywhere else. &quot;Climbers develop long, lean muscles from stretching, then contracting,&quot; says Ivan Greene, who runs the climbing program at the Chelsea Sports Center in New York. Though weight training and pull-ups are good preparation, the only way to develop grip strength is to grab a rock. Don't let the slow pace fool you. Notes Greene, &quot;At the end of a long day of climbing, I feel like I've been wrestling Mack trucks.</td>

Continuous movement works the cardiorespiratory system and melts calories, while quick anaerobic bursts of jumping, directional changes and fast-breaks build strength and endurance. Even flexibility can improve through hands-up defense and lunges for loose balls. The downside, alas, is the high rate of injury from stops, starts, twists and turns. And yet, &quot;basketball doesn't have to be high risk,&quot; says E.J. &quot;Doc&quot; Kreis, the speed-strength and conditioning coach for the UCLA Bruins. &quot;Most of what you see is knee and back problems from older athletes who've been away for a while and try to jump back in.&quot; Kreis recommends a holistic approach of preparatory conditioning work with an emphasis on weight training and &quot;a healthy mind.&quot;</td>

Funny, then, that cycling has one of the highest injury rates of any sport--accounting for more than 500,000 emergency room visits each year, according to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. While most of those are suffered by the 15-and-under set, the potential severity of tumbling off a bike shouldn't be underestimated. Nor should the hazards of unpadded bike seats. As with running, cycling won't do much for leg flexibility or upper-body strength, so plan on supplementing with some cross-training.</td>

Running provides little flexibility for the legs and nothing for the upper body, so supplementing with cross-training such as swimming or weight training is key. So too is moderation, as injuries like stress fractures, shin splints and dreaded &quot;IT Band Syndrome&quot;--overworking the iliotibial band that stabilizes the knee--have stopped plenty in their tracks.</td>

Modeled on what a liaison officer might face behind enemy lines, modern pentathlon isn't as trendy as triathlon, but it has merits. Swimming (200 meters) and running (3,000 meters) offer cardiorespiratory benefits, while round-robin swordplay tests flexibility and endurance. Shooting from 10 meters demands focus--and you can't get much healthier than on the right end of a gun. Horse jumping, meanwhile, &quot;is always the critical event,&quot; says Elaine Cheris, owner of the Cheyenne Fencing Society in Denver. &quot;Horses are chosen by lot, and riders have 20 minutes to get intimate with an unpredictable beast.&quot; Sounds like good training for cold calling, at least.</td>

Indeed, dancing around the ring for a few rounds &quot;is like nothing you've ever felt in your life,&quot; says Devon Cormack, a three-time World Kick Boxing champ and boxing coach at Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn, N.Y., who admits he tries to &quot;take the wind out of students in the ring.&quot; Actual time inside the ropes is just part of the boxing regimen, which includes running, rope jumping and punching mitts with a trainer and against the bag. Though punches have more to do with alignment and efficiency than strength, your upper body will get a good workout. Watch out for ruptured biceps, strained rotator cuffs--and that roundhouse right!</td>
