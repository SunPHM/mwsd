</font></B><FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Telematch '88, held on May 7th at the Presentation College grounds, was a day to remember. Both the spectators and especially the competitors enjoyed the day to the fullest. The enthusiastic crowd cheered on its favorites vociferously - obvious amongst them were many Presentation students showing the true inexhaustible <SUP>t'</SUP>Pres" spirit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year, there were more schools participating than in previous years , which only made the challenge</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">greater for our team - the defending champions. Of the ten schools competing Presentation College, Naparima Combined and Barrackpore Snr. Comp. emerged as the major competitors. All participating schools found it to be a day of fun and enjoyment, especially when Holy Faith Convent Couva's cheer-leaders came on the field. They stole the show!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Presentation College, fielding the youngest team emerged 2nd, being beaten by Naparima Combined by a mere three points. Special credit should be given to the team captain, Brian Manning, who showed great leadership strength on the day, and to Andre Allum, without whose knowledge, perseverance and encouragement the team would have surely failed. Our young members, consisting of the second formers P. Attong, B. Lum Kin, C. Marshall, R. Mitchell, C. Hinds, K Peters and the highly spirited S. Morong, look forward to the 1989 Telematch. We will win next year!</P></FONT><DIR><DIR>

</font></B><FONT SIZE=2><P>1987-88 was again a year of relative success. For the third consecutive year, Presentation College was well represented both on the local and regional scenes. For many years we have produced many national players of unmatched calibre. This year, however, we were represented by one player, Sean Boyce.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boyce entered the Carifta Games, where he captured a gold and a silver medal, the Junior Brandon and J.I.T.C. His best local accomplishment was in the Emile Elias Top 16 Caribbean Championships, where he was one of only two juniors to qualify.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is indeed ironic that Presentation does not concentrate on the sport of tennis, yet we have produced national stars of considerable repute, such as the Evelyn brothers, Mc. Connie brothers, Craig La Croix and Sean Boyce.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the tennis players of the school, keep up the good work.</P></FONT><DIR><DIR>

</font></B><FONT SIZE=2><P>This team, affectionately known as the young ones, represents the future of Presentation College Championship Football. Due to the late start of the season the team was well prepared for the South U-16 league and the junior Intercol competitions. Their first match was a huge success in all aspects as they mercilessly whipped Princes Town Senior Comp. by 9 goals to nil and continued on in the following matches by winning (7-0), <I>(5-0) </I>and (4-1) consecutively in their three subsequent games. This placed them on the top of the South Zone U-16 league after playing only 7 games, of which they won 6 and lost 1 (against Naparima by three goals to two after a last minute goal). Presentation totally outclassed opponents by scoring a whopping 30 goals for with 7 goals against (which gives them a game average of over 4 goals to 1). S Boyce led the scoring with 6 goals, Prior Jones was second with four and K Samuels and S. Corbie followed with 3 goals each. The team went on to represent the South against Deep South Champions Vessigny in the South League Playoffs, in which we were edged out by a score of 2 goals to one. As we can all see, the future of Championship Football is in very good hands (or feet as the case may be).</P>
