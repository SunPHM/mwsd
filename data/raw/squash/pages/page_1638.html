        FINAL FOUR FOR FIRST TIME IN ANY WORLD SQUASH COMPETITION !!!</font></b></font></font></b></font><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><br>
        <br>
    Aidan Harrison and Narsha Tippet kept the US team on the toes during the day's 
    rest in anticipation of today's quarter final against New Zealand. To be precise, 
    the team didn't have a whole day off, they were taken to the Arena to practise 
    on the glass court, which none of them have played on before. Having witnessed 
    the electric atmosphere of the individual final, this was a shrewd move by 
    Harrison. "They wanted to be part of that and play on that court," he reports. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>THE CARROT WORKS </b><br>
    It was a carrot that worked, as well as the fact that the team wanted to beat 
    New <img src="../photos/malaysia01/glasscourt_vsm.jpg" width="196" height="249" align="right">Zealand 
    to show that their win over Australia wasn't a fluke. The playing order today 
    put Michelle Quibell on first against Kylie Lindsay and once more the American 
    showed too much class and experience. Michelle started slowly and fought back 
    from 0-4 down to lead 7-6 but Lindsay played hard to serve for the game at 
    8-7. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">'Cool -head' Quibelle saved that game 
    ball and went on to win 10-8 after 14 minutes. This was a psychological blow 
    to Lindsay and she felt overwhelmed by the Quibell persistence to lose the 
    next two games 9-2, 9-5 in 15 minutes. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>BASIC SQUASH BEAUTIFULLY PLAYED</b><br>
        Ali Pearson's confidence must be sky high but she did not let that deter 
        her from playing her game, which is very good basic squash. This may sound 
        dull, but it takes a<img src="../photos/malaysia01/pearson1_sm.jpg" width="144" height="253" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="8"> 
        great deal of discipline to stick with it. After all, the great Heather 
        McKay was not known for flashy shots, but a wonderful length. Pearson 
        won the first game against Catherine McLeod 9-3 and was leading 7-4 in 
        the second when McLeod fought back, chipping away at the lead until she 
        had tied it up. Pearson then made some bad shot selection by not taking 
        note where her opponent was allowing McLeod to continue her run to win 
        10-8 to tie the match. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Pearson, no emotion showing, came back 
    for the third and her focus was absolute. When she had to play a 12 shot rally 
    down the left wall, she did. Indeed there was one rally where both players 
    were hitting paint strippers down the left wall, with Pearson happy to do 
    it all day long. It was McLeod who cracked first deciding to go cross court, 
    but Pearson's shot had been too tight for her to do it properly, so the ball 
    came out loose by the right wall and Pearson was there to volley drop for 
    a winner. (One of their practise routines in Penang was to play 10 minute 
    rallies down one wall. "It has paid off," Harrison said). </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Like I said Pearson plays basic squash 
    very well. She took that game 9-1 and did the same in the four, gave a little 
    jump for joy, knowing that the US were now in the semis and guaranteed a top 
    four finish. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>CLOSE AMY, REAL CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR</b> 
    <br>
    The third dead rubber was played best of 3, and Amy Gross was pipped in overtime 
    on both games 10-9, 10-9 by Jaclyn Hawkes. But when you know the match is 
    in the bag, it is hard to go full out. During this whole match, Pearson was 
    in the drug room trying to provide a sample with coach Natarsha Tippet standing 
    by. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Australian Tippet has made this a full 
    family trip with 14 month old Nicholas being <img src="../photos/malaysia01/natarsha1_sm.jpg" width="244" height="275" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">babysat 
    by husband Jim McElhinney and father George who has come in to watch from 
    Australia. Natarsha (don't they know how to spell Natasha in Australia?) got 
    to number 19 on the WISPA ranking when she decided, five years ago, to make 
    money and accepted an offer from Greenwich Club in Connecticut and then later 
    an even better offer from the famous Merion Cricket Club (MCC) outside Philadelphia. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Finally Jim made an offer of marriage 
    (was this a better offer?) and she moved to Las Vegas. She and Harrison work 
    well together and as she was in Antwerp two years ago with Michelle, Ali and 
    Amy, they have a trusting relationship.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> "They are beginning to trust us now, 
    that we know what we are doing. We get together a couple of weekends in the 
    year and then we had a week together before we came here. &quot; ... Ali has 
    really improved, she has only started to volley and go for drop shots in the 
    last ten days. Before that her game was all depth... They were asking things 
    like 'where do we aim for a serve?' basic stuff, but now they are all beginning 
    to understand the game," explains Tippet in between following Pearson's natural 
    functions and Gross's progress on court. </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>LOOKING GOOD </b><br>
    The US Team is looking good to the eye. Each of the players raised over $5,500 
    to help with the expenses and a couple of days before they left, their off 
    court kits had not turned up. Harrison had to buy replacement stuff retail 
    and managed to get USA stencilled on the back of the Nike gear, so their waistcoats 
    now have <i><b>'USA Nike'</b></i> on the back. Does Nike need free publicity? 
    Hopefully they'll repay the team next time with some hard sponsorship. In 
    contrast, their opponents in the semis, England, had all their expenses paid 
    out of the lottery World Performance program. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>ENGLAND STILL NOT CHALLENGED</b> <br>
        The England team are still to be given a stiff challenge. Germany were 
        unable to do this despite selecting their strongest team. (Many teams 
        faced with an impossible win will field their weakest side, saving their 
        strength for the 5-8 playoffs). Jenny Duncalf lost the first game to the 
        talented Kathrin Rohrmuller, but soon had the large German running around 
        the court. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Duncalf took the next three games because 
        while Rohrmuller's superior racket skills got her out of trouble, she 
        simply does not have the fitness of the England players. She came off 
        the court exhausted while Duncalf could have played another match. Alison 
        Waters beat Sandra Ziemelis in three and Laura Jane Lengthorn took the 
        dead rubber 2/0 Immediately afterwards the England team left for the Arena 
        to practise on the glass court. David Champion is no fool. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>EGYPT AND MALAYSIA IN ROUTINE WINS<br>
        </b>The Egyptian and Malaysian girls powered ahead, trouncing India and 
        Australia respectively. These were fairly routine wins, so I will save 
        my reporting energy to give you a full report on the semifinals tomorrow, 
        which promise to be really exciting stuff.</font></p>
