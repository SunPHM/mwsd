  virus is transmitted by whiteflies and is a problem only in south Texas <a href="slcv1.asp?ploc=slcv.htm">[Picture]</a>. 
  Symptoms of the disease are crumpled leaves with yellowed, mottled areas <a href="slcv2.asp?ploc=slcv.htm">[Picture]</a>. 
  Leaves have shortened petioles that cluster around the vines <a href="slcv3.asp?ploc=slcv.htm">[Picture]</a>. 
  Squash is also susceptible to this virus. Severe yield losses are associated 
  with infection of young seedlings, usually when whitefly populations are high. 
  Infections of older plants do not affect yield. </p>
<p align="left">Another whitefly-transmitted virus recently identified in south 
  Texas is the cucurbit yellow stunt disorder virus, which causes a yellowing 
  of leaves <a href="slcv4.asp?ploc=slcv.htm">[Picture]</a>. </p>
<p align="left">The squash leaf curl virus is economically important only in fall-grown 
  watermelons. To alleviate the impact on yield, transplants should be used, rather 
  than direct-seeded plants. Fields should be plowed under after harvest to minimize 
  carryover of the virus to subsequent crops. The virus can persist in whiteflies 
  for 3 weeks after feeding on infected plants, so there should be a 4 week break 
  between melon crops.</p>
