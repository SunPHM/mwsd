<p>Ian got me into the popular show Spongebob SquarePants.<br />
We saw the movie on opening night which was last night.<br />
The theater was jam packed with loud little kiddos and the sound<br />
of popcorn being chewed was in effect in full surround sound.<br />
We got there a little late and were forced to sit in the third row.<br />
Yep we were smack dab in the front.<br />
But thats OK.  The movie was awesome.<br />
Only the writers of Spongebob Squarepants would come up<br />
with a plot such as the one presented in the movie release.<br />
Spongebob has the perfect mix of "twisted" and "wacky"<br />
which keeps kids laughing at certain levels as well as adults.<br />
We want to see it again.</p>

<p>My Sony Vaio laptop was just shipped back to me.<br />
It is good as new.<br />
I am now a believer of purchasing extended warranties for laptops.<br />
Well, we actually purchased an extended warranty for our <br />
Samsung refrigerator as well.  It was something I had to do.<br />
I have always owned Kenmore or Amana refrigerators and<br />
they never died on me.<br />
We purchased the Samsung because of the cool factor<br />
as well as the factory rebates that they had to offer at the time.<br />
We will soon come to know how robust Samsung<br />
refrigerators are.<br />
BTW, I just completed <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean - Curse of the Black Pearl </strong><em></em>on <br />
Ian's Game Boy Advance.<br />
So unlike me.  I have finished two games in a week.<br />
What's next?  One of the Spongebob games perhaps?<br />

<h3 class="title">Off For Two Weeks</h3>

<p>Today marks the second day of my 2 week vacation.<br />
Nothing eventful to report.  <br />
I hijacked Ian's Game Boy Advance and <br />
finished The Incredibles.  He also has<br />
Pirates of the Caribbean and have started<br />
that.  I am on level 8.  Why is it that <br />
all hit movies are converted to video games?<br />
<i>(I really should be working on my SQL assignments)</i><br />
Pulled out The Cramps from the CD collection<br />
and played Bad Music For Bad People<br />
for Ian and Lain.  They loved it and grooved<br />
to Human Fly and Goo Goo Muck.<br />
They are totally into that whole Goth scene.<br />
They are hooked on Halloween, Ghosts, Monsters, etc.<br />
And yes, we are going to Social Distortion tomorrow.<br />
I got tickets to their second showing at the Warfield.  They are also playing tonight.<br />
The Explosion are playing as well and look forward to checking them out.</p>

<p>G4 continues to resculpt the original tech shows that we have grown <br />
to enjoy (way before Gee4 took over TechTV).  G4 fired most of the cast<br />
of The Screen Savers today.  Only Kevin and Sarah remain.  <br />
I got a kick out of Martin Sargent and his show Unscrewed<br />
but unfortunately he and his show got the boot.<br />
It is scary.  The company that I am employed under<br />
has announced another round of layoffs (13,000 employees).<br />
What a way to start the holiday season.<br />
Today is my last day of work for two weeks.<br />
I am now officially on vacation.<br />
Hopefully this will not be a <i>perma-vacation</i>.</p>

<p>I am still on an Indian food kick.<br />
The past ten days or so I have had some form<br />
of Indian food. Whats going on? <br />
All the spices are wonderful<br />
and leave my mouth on fire for quite sometime.<br />
The spice gets me so bad that I sweat up a storm.<br />
My friends of Indian descent get a kick out of this.<br />
But that is fine.  The flavor is proper.<br />
I had a Tandoori Caesar Chicken salad<br />
for lunch (amercanized)<br />
and for dinner had seekh kebab and tandoori chicken.<br />
Manoj took me to an Indian market<br />
and I purchased a few items.  <br />
Fennel seeds were a proper purchase and is <br />
supposed to aid with digestion.  Additionally<br />
it tastes like licorice.  A very tasty, natural and healthy treat<br />
to partake in after a filling meal. </p>

<p>In other news, Firefox is now GOLD!<br />
Get the official 1.0 release <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0/win32/en-US/">here</a> and kick IE to the curb!</p>

<h3 class="title">Cauliflower and Squash - Acceptable Substitutes</h3>

<p>I just made some mock mashed potatoes.<br />
Instead of using potatoes, I used cauliflower.<br />
It turned out well (and tasted great) and the consistency<br />
was identical to its high carbohydrate counterpart.<br />
To continue with this low carb fest,<br />
I also made spaghetti.  Instead of using refined<br />
high carbohydrate pasta, I used spaghetti squash (SS).<br />
If you do not know, this particular squash contains<br />
strands almost like angel hair pasta.<br />
Half a SS is enough for two people<br />
(with side dishes).<br />
Make sure you cook it long enough to get the consistency<br />
to closely match that of pasta.<br />
Though it does not taste exactly like a plate of spaghetti,<br />
it was acceptable to me.<br />
Additionally, SS contains more vitamins<br />
than pasta and is better for the body all around.<br />
It is a good source of vitamin A and B.  SS is a great<br />
source for fiber, calcium and potassium.<br />
<i>Lastly, it contains <br />
very few calories, its low in carbs,<br />
contains no cholesterol<br />
and has no saturated fat</i><br />
If you are interested in making mock mashed potatoes<br />
or spaghetti squash, simply do a Google search.<br />
You will find a plethora of recipes.<br />
<i>This was a good way to break my Indian Food eating chain<br />

<p>Social Distortion will be at the Warfield 11/15 and 11/16<br />
The 11/15 show is sold out<br />
I started listening to Social D around 1987<br />
when I saw "Another State of Mind" on TV<br />
I listened to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000007SNL/qid=1099636055/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-1029517-2364713?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Live at the Roxy</a>  today and the urge to see Social D live has escalated.<br />
