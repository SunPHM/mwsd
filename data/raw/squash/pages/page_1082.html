		</CENTER>
		<FONT COLOR="#063479">Black rot is caused by the fungus <I>Didymella
bryoniae</I>. It causes a serious rot on the fruit of winter squash
and pumpkin in Connecticut. This fungus also causes the disease
known as gummy stem blight on the leaves and stems of watermelon,
cucumber, and cantaloupe in more tropical climates, such as the
Southeastern U.S. This disease was first described in 1891 in
France.</FONT>
		<P><B><FONT COLOR="#DC143C">Symptoms. </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#063479">The
general fruit symptoms vary widely. Fruit spots can be small to
large, and superficial to deep. They are not always black. The
spots often start as yellowish, irregular circular areas and later
become gray/brown then black. The spots may have drops of gummy
ooze in the center. There may be tiny pale and/or dark dots in
the spots.</FONT></P>
		<h4><font color="#228b22"><b>Watermelon</b>.</font></h4>
		<UL>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">Spots start as small, round, dark greenish-tan
  to black water-soaked areas.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">They enlarge slowly, becoming brown
  to black in the center.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">They remain smooth for a long time,
  but become depressed as they enlarge.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">The spots are usually surrounded by
  a narrow water-soaked area with an irregular border.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">Under moist conditions, tiny pale and
  dark dots develop in the center of the spots, although these
  can be difficult to see.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">The spots may become leathery, the
  centers become darker, and cracks may radiate from the center
  of the spots.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">When humidity is high, a white cottony
  fungal growth may grow over the spots. Gummy ooze is usually
  absent.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">If the fruit is sliced open, cutting
  the spot in half, the rind is dark brown to black directly below
  the spot, and progressively lighter toward the edges.</FONT>

		<h4><b><font color="#228b22">Cucumber</font></b></h4>

  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">On the vine, this disease usually affects
  immature fruit, causing black decay near the blossom end.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">After harvest, the first symptoms are
  small, dark, round or irregular-shaped, greasy or water-soaked
  spots anywhere on the fruit surface.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">Occasionally, a gummy ooze appears
  in the center of the spots, which later dries to a hard deposit.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">Later, affected areas become blackish
  and will dry out and shrivel.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT COLOR="#063479">Pale dots may develop in the spots.</FONT>
