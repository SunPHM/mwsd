        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thoughts

          I am that my nearest and dearest are healthy and doing well, my heart 
          reaches out for those faces we can no longer see, and for those who 
          are missing their loved ones.</font></strong></p>

          NATURAL ..... and when Christmas is stowed away and the decorations 
          are down .... we will get back to our usual state of equilibrium. We 
          will work, achieve, do good, live life, and move on. But for now, in 
          this limbo period between Christmas and New Year, when the whole world 
          seems to just <em>wait</em> .... find a good book to read, and HANG

          I'm resting after an amazing day in Las Vegas. My &quot;apparition&quot; 
          did happen, and it was a long day because there was much rehearsal needed 
          technically for this one-off (actually 2-off!) piece of showbiz..... 
          The actual few minutes I was on stage were an amazing blast .... I'm 
          not even going to attmpt to describe them ...for once I'm going to let 
          someone else describe the event ..... Our POP in Vegas is sensational. 
          He alerted us to the fact that it's not necessary to be old to play 
          Pop in We Will Rock YOu. His interpretation is so innovative and alive 
          that it changed our perceptions of what Pop could be. He has to be seen 
          to be believed. It's a whole-body performance, and not a single laugh 
          is not delivered with maximum skill and feel and tender loving care.

          to share this with you ... </font></strong></p>

          Subject: A Triumphant Return to Vegas!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Christmas came early for me this year...and it wasn't marked by the 
          arrival of St. Nick, but, rather, by the return of Brian May to the 
          Paris, Las Vegas (the North American home of WWRY)!&nbsp; It has been 
          and continues to be my great pleasure to play the role of &quot;Pop&quot;&nbsp;in 
          WWRY, here, in the States. Long before I ever set foot on a stage, myself, 
          I was a fan of Queen. I&nbsp;grew up with their music and often dreamt 
          as a child&nbsp;about singing their songs&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;a frenzied 
          capacity crowd&nbsp;You can imagine, then, how thrilled I was to be 
          cast as a member of the&nbsp;North American Premiere Company of WWRY 
          last summer! Throughout the final auditions and into rehearsals, I was 
          amazed to discover how incredibly supportive and caring and kind, both, 
          Brian and Roger were to me and each and every member of our cast, band, 
          and crew. Their passion for the show and generosity of spirit shone 
          through every minute they spent with us. I could not believe how blessed&nbsp;I 
          was to be working alongside these two true heroes of mine. We opened 
          to overwhelming reactions and I watched in awe as Brian and Roger played 
          (with our unbelievable band and a who's who of rock legends) at our 
          opening night party! Now, three months later, when&nbsp;I didn't believe 
          it could get any better, I was able to experience what&nbsp;I would 
          venture to say was one of, if not THE, most electric nights any of us 
          in the company had ever been a part of!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          You see, just hours ago, Brian made a guest appearance,&nbsp;here,&nbsp;in 
          WWRY&nbsp; - joining us onstage for BO RAP and leading the company in 
          a special encore of THE SHOW MUST GO ON!&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
          two shows tonight I had the opportunity&nbsp;to live out those childhood 
          dreams - singing two Queen&nbsp;classics while Brian played just inches 
          away! As&nbsp;I stepped forward to sing my solo lines &quot;Inside my 
          heart is breaking, my make-up may be flaking, but my smile still stays 
          on&quot;, I was overtaken by a rush of emotions I'm still unable to 
          describe.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          write this, not to sound like &quot;oh, isn't my life so great&quot; 
          (and, again, I'm very blessed), but, rather, to share with everyone 
          how truly phenomenal this man is - as an artist, and, more importantly, 
          as a human being. Brian is a STAR to be sure, but you would never know 
          it speaking with him. The ego and pretentiousness so common among today's 
          &quot;celebrities&quot; are no where to be found in him. When&nbsp;talking 
          with him, he speaks to you with a quiet assuredness&nbsp; - a gentle&nbsp;open-ness 
          - that let's you know he's listening and truly cares about that which 
          he speaks. And to be onstage with him while he plays...my god...I only 
          wish every fan could experience that! Brian is, perhaps, the most unselfish 
          artist I have ever seen or known. He willingly shared the stage with 
          us despite the fact that, after he made his entrance (very theatrical, 
          by the way - rising up on a lift from beneath the stage amidst a cloud 
          of smoke), everyone present was aware he had taken the evening to a 
          whole new level! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          don't know if any of this I'm writing is doing the night justice, or 
          even making a whole lot of sense, for that matter, but, most importantly,&nbsp;I 
          just wanted to say &quot;thank you&quot;, Brian, on behalf of the entire 
          company, here, in Vegas for being you and giving all of us on-stage, 
          back-stage, and in the house a chance to live out a dream. You reminded 
          us all how lucky we are to be a small part of Queen's legendary history 
          and provided us with a holiday season none of us are ever likely to 
          forget! Continued success with WWRY world-wide and all the best to you 
          and Roger for what will surely be an incredible tour next year! There's 
          a reason why you are so loved/respected/admired by so many millions&nbsp;and&nbsp;I 
          can't imagine anyone being more deserving! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
          all the happiness you've given and continue to give, I thank you!! </font></p>

          I too am very fond of this track ... I'm glad it's getting a good airing 
          on the Christmas compilations this year. <a href="../../queen/queennews/queennewsdec04.html#14c" target="_self">[SEE 
          QUEEN NEWS]</a></font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          story is simple. We thought it would be nice to make a Christmas record, 
          which would not be on any Album. Of course you have to have these thoughts 
          in the late summer, because it takes so long to turn records around 
          as a rule (even &quot;Do they Know it's Christmas&quot; needed some 
          lead time, and this was powered through in advance). </font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          is years ago, of course. Roger and I agreed we would both submit ideas, 
          and work together on working up the idea we chose. Roger wrote the beginnings 
          of &quot;Thank God It's Christmas&quot;, and I wrote the beginnings 
          of &quot;I Dream of Christmas&quot;. We met down at Roger's place and 
          demo'd both tracks together, as I remember. How the choice between the 
          two tracks was made I don't clearly remember, but I think it was a whole 
          group thing. We decided to finish TGIC for the Queen Christmas single, 
          and &quot;IDOC&quot; was put to one side, and I immediately worked it 
          into the version which we released as my Lady Anita's Christmas record. 
          This record charted briefly but is now a rarity (it features Anita singing, 
          along with a school choir of young kids, and quite a lot of Guitar soloing 
          by me!) </font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
          the eventual Queen song, Roger had the verse form already: &quot;Oh 
          - my love - we live in troubled days ....&quot;. I contributed the chorus, 
          with a key-change leading into it, using a lyric line which occurred 
          casually in the verse, so this now became the title, &quot;Thank God 
          It's Christmas&quot;. Of course when Freddie took up the singing it 
          jumped into another gear ... his lovely high register soaring above 
          the background in these choruses, then returning to a very gentle breathy 
          texture for the verses. The background was based on a synth pad which 
          Roger had found (he would have to tell you what it was made with), to 
          which I added a guitar texture very un-typical of me ... very clean 
          and bright ... the amp turned way down and the strings hit hard like 
          bells. This makes that Bright Frosty sound which I actually like a lot, 
          contrasting with the warm and dark synth chords. Of course as usual 
          John's subtle firm bass lines are a big part of the style of the eventual 
          outcome. The drums are programmed, the way Roger originally demo'd them, 
          an unusual choice for a Queen track but it works in this case. My favourite 
          part is the end, where there's a small building (subdominant) link into 
          the playout. Freddie is improvising, and it all becomes totally joyful 
          ... trekking off into the distance across the snowy fields..... noses 
          red, scarves wrapped around chins, snowballs being thrown .... Christmas 
          packages of good food being delivered to hungry villagers' doors ... 
          mulled wine being swigged to keep the blood flowing to those cold extremities....

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Well, 
          here's me on German Telly ! It was a major deal ... we actually spent 
          2 days of our lives, Roger, me, the entire cast and the band of WWRY 
          Cologne, in a TV Studio in Nuremburg, rehearsing. The reality is that 
          you rehearse for about 15 minutes, then you wait around for around 4 
          hours and do another run-through, etc etc ..... TV is anything but glamorous! 
          But the result was good, I think .... we were able to show off our great 
          show team, including Vera, as Scara (below) , and Alex as Gal. The band 
          rocked, and the cast gave it a million per cent. We were all proud. 
          And we were able to be hooligans too ...to be REAL and spontaneous, 
          which made me happy. I think there was a moment when our old friend 
          Thomas wondered if we were out of control!! But all ended well. They 
          are a very professional outfit, the Wetten Dass people ... (by the way 
          Wetten Dass means something like &quot;Wanna Bet ?&quot; ) They did 
          pull ou all the stops for us, with a great set, great lights, and a 
          director who really cared. That's appreciated big time. Television is 
          not always so admirable. </strong></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">And 
          this time it's not just a rumour. We are in the process of looking at 
          venues for a QUEEN tour in the spring. It really all came about because 
          of the Fender 50th Anniversary gig that I did with Paul Rodgers. We 
          were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in All Right 
          Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was &quot;something 
          happening here&quot;. And if we were to play together some more, which 
          we both thought was an exciting possibility, who would be the drummer 
          ??? Well, the expression &quot;No Brainer&quot; comes to mind. Then 
          the UK Hall of Fame awards just came up out of the blue. Apparently 
          we had won one of the categories and the request was there for us to 
          play. I had already had the conversation with Roger at this point, about 
          how brilliant Paul Rodgers was, and, since, very conveniently, he had 
          also been asked to be there, we agreed we would ask Paul if he would 
          team up with us for this event. </font></strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">The 
          rest in a way is already History. The show went so incredibly well from 
          our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, 
          we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together. 
          </font></strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">This 
          is what we have been doing over the last two or three weeks, looking 
          at venues, discussing how we might approach our collective material, 
          etc. etc. </font></strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">It's 
          very exciting .... ever since the run-up to that Awards show, I felt 
          in my waters that something big and scary was happening. Scary because 
          as soon as you press the button for something like this you set a massive 
          juggernaut into motion which cannot be stopped ! So bang goes the home 
          life, and anything else we might have planned for the coming months. 
          Suddenly the QUEEN Phoenix is rising again from the ashes, and will 
          take precedence over everything in our lives. So be it. So there ya 
          go. I won't go into more details right now, but, barring accidents, 
          QUEEN and PAUL RODGERS will be on the road, pretty much for sure, around 
          April 2005.</font></strong></font></p>

          COLOGNE PRESS NIGHT</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Funny, 
          the scurvy subject of journalists comes up again and again. We had a 
          press night here in Cologne, prior to the official opening night on 
          Sunday, in the MUSIC DOME, on the banks of the Mighty Rhine, in Cologne. 
          It was a riot - a fabulous response, even on this, the one night when 
          it was expected to be quiet. Just as &quot;We are the Champions&quot; 
          finished to a totally standing and waving and deafeningly cheering audience, 
          I caught a fat balding old Journo with his clip-board sneaking out the 
          back to get his coat. &quot;Didn't like it, then?&quot; I said. He pretended 
          not to understand. I repeated the question, and he shuffled his feet 
          and mumbled, &quot;NO&quot;. I said, &quot;I hope you're going back 
          in to review the end of the show, then, because if not, you're not really 
          qualified to review it, are you? &quot; No answer. I went back through 
          the doors, back into the tumultuous sea of hands clapping along to the 
          BOWS. And then the final song of the evening, Bohemian Rhapsody took 
          the place by storm. They didn't sit down for at least 10 minutes in 
          all. But that old fart missed it. I wonder which newspaper HE writes 
          for. Even if I didn't like a show I would never be so rude as to walk 
          out when the company, always a hard working and dedicated bunch of kids, 
          were taking their bows. This guy took his (presumably free) ticket, 
          and gave NOTHING back. Scum. </strong></font></p>

          don't need your review, Mr Old Fart. The German public have already

          have been meaning to talk about Dr. Paul Sherwood for a long time. This 
          man has effectively saved so many lives for over a 50 years with his 
          wonderful treatments for back disorders, asthma, and other difficult 
          ailments. Certainly without him I would never have been able to overcome 
          my painful back problems. I will be talking about him more in the weeks 
          to come, because I strongly feel that so many people out there need 
          this kind of expert help .. something which neither conventional Medicine 
          nor Chiropracty can quite offer. And the media are stubbornly refusing 
          to spread the word of his genius, denying so many suffering people their

          It's been a while but I didn't forget !! I've had lots of mail from 
          you guys about these things which float in front of our eyes .... and 
          I've been getting more and more conscious of them. I think people will 
          be starting to think I'm crazy or afflicted with some kind of nervous 
          tick, because in the middle of a conversation I find myself flicking 
          my eyes off to a corner of the room to catch sight of one of these amoebic 
          objects drifting across my field of vision. ! I have found that they 
          endure for quite a long time in more or less the same shape ... they 
          are not just creatures of one day .... but they do bend and twist and 
          turn gradually over a period of weeks.... they seem to be quite soft, 
          and occasionally I can see them flexing as they move across my line 
          of vision ... I can see now that these noticeable Floaters are only 
          the tip of the iceberg ... if I'm looking at a uniformly white background 
          I can actually see fainter ones absolutely everywhere .. a whole Sargasso 
          Sea of the buggers, covering my entire field of view ! </font></strong></p>

          more conscious you become of these things, the more annoying they get. 
          So maybe I am not setting a good example here. But they have now become 
          so familiar to me, these blobs and squiggles, that I've started to give 
          them names ... the Blob, the Sea-Horse, etc. (shown above) .. like constellations 
          ! I eventually thought I should seek professional advice, so I did. 
          I went to an eye specialist. And I'll tell you about that soon, if you're 
          interested ... I learned a lot. But the main thing I learned was not 
          to worry about it ! So, more on floaters soon .... </font></strong></p>

          <strong>STORY OF BO RHAP AND FREDDIE'S MILLIONS</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">STORY 
          OF BO RHAP</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          actually sat down and watched the Bo Rhap documentary last night (Saturday), 
          without trying to do something else at the same time (this is rare for 
          me - I don't like TV very much - even when it's US on - in fact, especially 
          when it's <em>US</em> on!) I thought it was quite well done on the whole. 
          Of course there are so many things which were NOT in there... and some 
          of it seemed a bit ...is fatuous the word ??!!! Especially Mr. Grant's 
          attempts to do a Richard Burton! And the &quot;experts&quot; trying 
          to figure out what the song means! ha ha! Dismal ! But a good honest 
          effort at telling a story on the whole, I thought. We helped them to 
          make this, by going down to Rockfield, as you probably noticed, and 
          our pal Roy T Baker spent quite a bit of time looking at the old multitrack 
          with them .. but mainly they put it together themselves ... so it was 
          not &quot;official comment&quot;, I guess... maybe better for that. 
          </font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
          we had the time I'd l ike to do something like this ourselves, and REALLY 
          tell the story .... but in a way it would still be only part of the 
          truth, because the truth is that it only makes sense as part of a much 
          bigger story - the story of the whole &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; 
          album and the events that led up to it. I could get a lot deeper into 
          the actual parts of the music, too.... Roy is very much NOT into the 
          musical structure of the recordings ... he's not that kind of a producer.... 
          so what you saw in this area really only scratched the surface. So maybe 
          one day we'll sit down ourselves with the multitracks ourselves and 
          get into it ... but it would need to be the whole album, not just this 
          track. </font></strong></p>

          MILLIONS </font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
          made the mistake of leaving the TV on for the next programme. My God, 
          what a hideous, nasty piece of work. The idea of trying to make out 
          that what was important about Freddie was his money is stupid enough 
          to start with, but what an utterly useless piece of journalistic conceit 
          the whole thing was from beginning to end. It was like watching a documentary 
          on Ghandi based around how much shaving cream he used in his life. And 
          the presenter .... I wonder if he was proud of this condescending and 
          sloppy piece of work. A man with zero understanding of his subject matter, 
          and apparently with an agenda of making Freddie look as small as possible. 
          <em>&quot;Freddie fancied himself as an art collector and connoisseur&quot;</em> 
          ??? You don't know the millionth part of it, young Mr. Know-It-All. 
          And the constant implication that Freddie actually based his life around 
          making money .... it's too ridiculous for words.... That's why we're 
          all still talking about him .... he was free, like we'd all like to 
          be. He did it out of his passion.... but where do begin ....? I can 
          only hope this piece of utter crap, &quot;Freddie's Millions&quot;, 
          finds its way into a refuse dump, along with all known copies!!! </font></strong></p>

          The Grand Order of Water Rats are an ancient and originaly secret brotherhood 
          (well, they go back to the 1920's or so) of men, originally exclusively 
          from the world of &quot;Music Hall&quot; - a very English form of entertainment 
          which has now almost ceased to exist. This society was formed originally 
          to care for its elder statesmen who were often without any means of 
          support, but became supportive of many charities over the years, particularly 
          to do with Children. The society has more recently become a little more 
          diverse in its membership, which is by internal nomination and vote 
          only. So now there are Rats from Sport, Pop and Rock, the acting profession, 
          and occasionally from other walks of life. </strong></font></P>
        <P align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Some 
          years ago I became friendly with some of the musical Rats, really through 
          Anita's involvement. Dec Clusky and Bert Weedon proposed me as a member 
          and I was voted in ... at that time one of the first &quot;rock&quot; 
          people to be admitted. It's something I'm proud of, and I try to do 
          my bit for the Rats and their charitable works. \Other activities are 
          regular meetings to tell jokes, have a drink and a chat, and various 
          functions throughout the year, including Ladies Night, which is a large 
          ball open to guests, and this is where I played last week. There is 
          a corresponding and affiliated society for Ladies, known as the Lady 
          Ratlings, and they also do great things for charity. There are still 
          some aspects of the Rats Brotherhood which remain secret, including 
          the induction ceremony. It's good to know there's still a little mystery 
          in the world ! </strong></font></P>

          version of TEO TORRIATTE for Jewels 2</strong></font></P>

          &quot;easy&quot; ! </font></strong></P>
        <P align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually 
          hundreds of hours have gone into rescuing every morsel of the original 
          recordings in order to be able to attempt the new version. I have contributed 
          a little to the work, and there are some areas which only I can answer 
          the relevant questions, since I was there all those years ago, trying 
          to make this then new thought into a 'proper record'. But mainly the 
          credit is due to Kris Fredriksson and Justin Shirley-Smith. These guys 
          are so dedicated to the excellence of these projects, that they work 
          much longer hours than anyone could ask, and treat every part of every 
          Queen note ever recorded as a priceless gem. I too love the original 
          mix, and it will always be there. But I have always known it suffered 
          from the limitations of pushing the existing equipment past its limit. 
          This new mix will be only very subtly different - I hope nobody expects 
          modern &quot;beats&quot; or dance mixes ! If we succeed, it will sound 
          just as you perhaps THOUGHT the old mix sounded, but comparing the two, 
          it will be as if a veil had been lifted after nearly 30 years... a bit 
          like cleaning an old Botticelli! ... making it possible to dive much 
          further into the sound image without coming up against noise and distortion. 
          Also, as the writer of the song, it's very satisfying to be able to 
          revisit the scene of this ancient battle. We have been able to get back 
          into many of the fine adjustments which were impossible with the old 
          technology, for instance updating some of the old 'bounces' and 'comps', 
          while yet retaining all of the inherent character of the original analogue 
          recordings. Well, you'll see. Er, hear ! Personally, I like it a lot 
          already. </font></strong></P>

          have high hopes (I always do, don't I?!). But you, folks, will be the
