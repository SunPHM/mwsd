		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    MOUNTAIN GREEN, Morgan County &#151; As a boy growing up here, Mark Johnson watched local farmers struggle to make ends meet.<BR><div class='viewPic' style='width:260px;float:right;margin-right:0;padding:6px 0 6px 0;border-top:1px solid #666666;border-bottom:1px solid #666666;'><img src='/photos/1138567.jpg' style='width:260px;height:172px;border:1px solid #000000;' alt='Image'><div class='viewPicCred' style='width:260px;'>Jeremy Harmon, Deseret News</div><div class='viewPicCap' style='width:260px;'>John Harames moves water lines in a field above Mountain Green that may become part of the 1,000-home Saddlebrook project.</div></div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Johnson and his buddies would take summer jobs with the farmers, cutting and hauling hay. As he labored, Johnson noticed how poor some of the families were. How farmers barely put food on the table and how all their children moved away to seek better lives.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He doesn't blame farmers and ranchers for wanting out of the business.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "The farmers up here have worked their guts out," he said. "They have the right to sell their land."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as more and more farmers sell out to developers, county planners are struggling to manage growth in a place that hasn't seen much population increase in the past 20 years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The struggle has manifested itself in a feud between the Morgan County Planning Commission and an Ogden developer seeking to place a 1,000-home, 2,000-acre planned community above Mountain Green.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The huge development, dubbed Saddlebrook, would likely boost the county's population of 7,200 by 50 percent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; County planners insist the area should hold to its rural heritage. The developer, Trapper's Land LLC, argues planners shouldn't hinder development because that could drive down land prices for farmers looking to cash in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For more than a century, Morgan has been a rural cousin to the more urban Davis, Weber and Salt Lake counties on the other side of the mountain range. The county's population remains sparse &#151; it has the same number of people as Park City in an area about the size of Salt Lake County.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not that fitting another 3,000 to 3,600 folks into the mix would make the valley urban. Some fear, however, that it would open the floodgates for development in a county that boasts more privately owned land than any other Utah county.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "It definitely would blaze the way," Mountain Green resident Bart Smith said. "Farmers have had a hard time making it in the farming industry, and the only way they'll make something out of their land is to sell it to the developers."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is if widespread development is allowed in Morgan.<P>
<B>A long process</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  While county planners say new growth isn't necessarily a bad thing, Saddlebrook remains stuck in the bureaucratic mix as the planners use a fine-toothed comb to search for flaws. With the $400 million project stalled, Trapper's Land is becoming increasingly frustrated.<BR><div class='viewPic' style='width:260px;float:left;margin-left:0;padding:6px 0 6px 0;border-top:1px solid #666666;border-bottom:1px solid #666666;'><img src='/photos/1138565.jpg' style='width:260px;height:132px;border:1px solid #000000;' alt='Image'><div class='viewPicCred' style='width:260px;'>Jeremy Harmon, Deseret News</div><div class='viewPicCap' style='width:260px;'>If developers get their way, Wilkinson Reservoir will become part of the 2,000-acre Saddlebrook development in Morgan County.</div></div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The frustration boiled into a 2nd District courthouse in April when Trapper's Land filed suit against Morgan County.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The developers wanted the county to pay $600,000 in costs that Trapper's Land had spent hiring consultants and engineers to appease county planners. The suit, which claimed the planning commission had undermined the project, was retracted days after it was filed; the planning process then continued.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And continues still, with Trapper's Land expenditures burgeoning to $700,000, managing partner Frank Murdock said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even now the planning process seems to have no end in sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We just have to get some kind of movement, some kind of decision," Murdock said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point Murdock would even take a denial from the planning commission; that way Trapper's Land could appeal to the County Council in an attempt to override the planners.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We feel that we can carry the County Council with a large number," Murdock said.<P>
<B>A question of size</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The very idea of Saddlebrook runs counter to Morgan County's rules for growth, county engineer Kent Wilkerson said, pulling out a copy of the county's general plan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Growth will come and must be compatible with the rural, residential, agricultural and small-town atmosphere of Morgan County," he read.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saddlebrook could work, Wilkerson said, but probably only as a development with 300 or so houses, not 1,000-plus.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We don't want to turn the county into an urbanized, sprawled mess," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trapper's Land says it needs at least 1,035 homes to make the project economically viable. Accompanying those homes would be a golf course, equestrian park, trail system, land for a much-needed elementary school, barber shop, convenience store and other amenities.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anything less than that model is as good as a rejection, Murdock said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Murdock says the planning commission is putting the rights of small-property owners, who like the county's peaceful setting, ahead of the large-property owners, who want to develop their land.<BR><div class='viewPic' style='width:193px;float:right;margin-right:0;padding:6px 0 6px 0;border-top:1px solid #666666;border-bottom:1px solid #666666;'><img src='/photos/1138562.jpg' style='width:193px;height:260px;border:1px solid #000000;' alt='Image'><div class='viewPicCred' style='width:193px;'>Jeremy Harmon, Deseret News</div><div class='viewPicCap' style='width:193px;'>A sandhill crane looks for food in a meadow that may become part of Saddlebrook.
</div></div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even the Morgan County School District has been asked to weigh in on Saddlebrook.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The administration favors planned growth; without it the district will "face a significant reduction in both staff and programs in the next few years," according to superintendant Ronald Wolff.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In past years, this year and for several years in the future, the county's incoming kindergarten class is smaller than its outgoing senior class, district business manager Robert Smith said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As other school districts grow by leaps and bounds, Morgan is losing the battle for per-pupil state dollars, Smith said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sans growth, Wolff predicts that student decreases in grades 7-12 in the next five years will cost the district $211,600 &#151; a significant figure for a small district.<P>
<B>Pros and cons</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Still, many in Morgan are torn about Saddlebrook.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On one hand, the development would provide a much-needed tax base for the county. On the other hand, Saddlebrook might be too much too soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "This used to be a farming community, and now it's moving away from that," County Councilwoman Joan Mortensen said. "The planning commission has had to work slowly on this because it's a new idea and a new process."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's not enough sewer capacity in Mountain Green to handle Saddlebrook, Mortensen said. Moreover, the county has nowhere near the level of emergency services it would need to provide for such a development, she said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Councilman Larry London wonders why there has to be a golf course at Saddlebrook, since the county already has a 27-hole course &#151; which isn't busy &#151; near the city of Morgan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he doesn't think Morgan County has the funds to build a new elementary school at Saddlebrook even if the land is donated. The cost of the school would be between $5 million and $6.5 million, Robert Smith said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both London and Mortensen point out that several new subdivisions in Morgan city still have vacancies, and they wonder if people will flock to Saddlebrook like developers say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilkerson further notes that the environmental impacts, including destruction of habitat, haven't been fully weighed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Elk, moose and deer all come down there in the winter," he said. "It's critical winter habitat to some extent."<P>
<B>Standard procedure?</B><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  With these issues in mind, the planning commission is pursuing its measured course as Murdock and company pull out their hair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trapper's Land managing partner Bruce Stratford insists people will beat down the door to live at Saddlebrook. It's not a subdivision, it's a community, he said. Saddlebrook will change Morgan County for the better, bringing more people, more business and more economic development, he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's a chance that Trapper's Land could bring back its lawsuit. Murdock predicts that if the planning commission takes a hard-line stand with every big landowner seeking to develop, more legal action will follow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There will be several lawsuits in Morgan County if that attitude prevails," he said. "They have zoning that's 60 years old that was put in place for a farming community. Now there's parts of that community that don't want to farm anymore."<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilkerson said the county is wary of lawsuits but maintains it isn't local government's job to guarantee anyone a return on an investment.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "We are supposed to follow the code of the county," he said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bart Smith said it has taken five years for him to have 50-unit developments pass planning commission muster. Smaller developments can take two years, so he has little sympathy for Trapper's Land.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "If they feel like they've been run through the mill, they can just look back and see that they're not being treated any differently than any other developer," he said.<BR>
