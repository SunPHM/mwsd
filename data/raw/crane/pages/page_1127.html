of the remains of the New York Central's 60th Street yards.&nbsp; New York
Central Railroad's main freight rail yard once resided at this location.&nbsp;
The railroad tracks and right-of-way are still used by <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/trains/adirondack.html" target="_blank">Amtrak</a>
for the railroad's service to upstate New York and Montreal, Canada.

<br><img SRC="Dscn0002.jpg" height=300 width=400 align=LEFT>The Henry Hudson
Parkway/West Side Highway combination was elevated in this area to carry
the parkway's roadway over the railroad yards.&nbsp; Although most remnants
of the yards are long gone, the parkway is still elevated in this area
- and the basic design remained this way even after the viaduct underwent
an extensive reconstruction project in the early 1990's.
