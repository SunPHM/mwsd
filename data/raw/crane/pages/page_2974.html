<P>It was during the summer of 1977, while working at the Ridges
Sanctuary at Baileys Harbor, that I received one of the most
unusual animal descriptions from some visitors that I had ever
heard.  The tourists had quite excitedly returned to the nature
center with an incredible story.  According to them, a young
turkey had just attacked them on the trail and did not let up
with its onslaught until they had been driven away.

<P>I pieced the information together as best I could and it soon
became apparent what had happened.  An unsuspecting ruffed grouse
hen and her chicks were surprised by the hikers.

<P>What very likely took place, in sequence, during the next
several seconds, was the hen sounded her warning cry and the
young immediately hid motionlessly among the dried fallen leaves
on the ground.  Next she puffed out her body feathers, extended
her tail feathers in that renowned fan-shape, and flew fearlessly
at the dangerous humans.  Her bluff worked perfectly, sending the
intruders away from her most prized and only possessions, her
downy, defenseless young.

<P>Two adult ruffed grouse performed for me on the same trail
around mid-September that year.  They behaved as though they were
unaware of my presence as they fought vigorously with each other.
Their sparring match consisted of running at each other, then
jumping into the air with both feet extended forward, wings
flailing rapidly.

<P>Neither appeared to be winning.  Perhaps it was a practice
bout preparatory to the real thing the following spring, or it
may have involved a claim to the lush stands of highbush
cranberry shrubs nearby.  Come winter the seeds of those plump
fruits would rank high as an emergency food in helping to balance
their winter diet.

<P>Summer poses little problem to ruffed grouse in regards to
their food.  One of the most abundant plants, yet least
conspicuous and known by people, produces some of the most
sought-after seeds and greenery, the tiny cow wheat,
<I>Melampyrum lineare</I>.  Jewelweed seeds and black cherries
rank as two of their favorites.  Fruit of the bearberry,
bunchberry, partridge-berry and sarsaparilla are included in
their primarily vegetarian diet.

<P>Along comes winter, many of the grouses’ food plants are
suddenly covered by snow and now these hardy birds are forced to
change their diet.  One of their primary foods now will be the
male buds on quaking aspens that are around 30 to 40 years old.
Research has shown that the male buds are considerably more
nutritious than are the female buds.  I have also seen grouse
actively budding on sugar maple, apple, and serviceberry trees
and the catkins of hazelnut shrubs.

<P>The first hen ruffed grouse that I ever encountered and could
positively identify greatly increased my appreciation of these
marvelous birds.  Having mated, the female will construct a
shallow nest on the ground usually against an obstacle such as a
log or even a steep bank.

<P>The encounter occurred in what I call the Christmas Fern Woods
near Ellisville in western Kewaunee County.  I had been taking a
count of those rare ferns in about the last week of May and was
making my way up a steep slope in the hardwoods.  Suddenly I
stopped in my tracks and found myself staring straight at the
beady black eye of a hen grouse, no more than five feet away,
sitting on her eggs.

<P>It was obvious that she was instinctively trusting her
marvelous camouflage.  However, her dark glistening eye revealed
her presence.  I admired her great courage, slowly took one more
step toward her and nearly had my hat taken off by her get-away,
a nerve-shattering explosion of feathered lightning.  I was able
to follow her speedy exit in a long curving arc for about 75
yards as she cackled excitedly all the way.  There were a dozen
creamy-buff eggs in the nest.

<P>Today a new hen ruffed grouse, who we call &quot;Nosey,&quot;
has entered our lives.  She has become the tamest of all the
grouse we have known since we began living in our Houby Hill
Woods 18 years ago.  We call her Nosey because of her
inquisitiveness.  Either she struts along the roof of our solar
collector and peers through the picture window into our living
room, or she walks back and forth on the deck outside our south
kitchen windows often pausing to look in at our activities.

<P>How patiently she waits for her daily pre-dawn and dusk
handouts of crushed walnuts.  Charlotte can easily approach her
to within a foot or less, and surely one of these days Nosey will
be eating from her hand.  The bird may appear to be conditioned
to people but nevertheless remains constantly on the alert, an
extremely wary creature.

<P>What rare and exciting Christmas adventures Nosey has brought
into our lives.  We can only hope you are so fortunate to have a
grouse around the house!
