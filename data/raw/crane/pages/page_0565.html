<P><FONT face="TimeScrDBol" color="#bbbbbb" size="5">The Bird</FONT><br>
Cranes are any of several wading birds comprising the 15 species of the family Gruidae, order Gruiformes. They are found in North America and throughout much of the Old World. The plumage is usually brown, gray, or white. Such species as the crowned crane, Balearica Pavonina, of Africa are particularly striking in appearance, and many species have unfeathered areas, sometimes brightly colored, around the head. Cranes often have loud, resonant cries. The trachea, or windpipe, in some species is convoluted into the keel of the sternum, a condition that facilitates the production of sound. Most cranes are terrestrial, preferring marshy conditions. They feed on plant materials and a wide variety of small animals. Their nests, usually containing two eggs, are on the ground in marshy areas. The crowned crane, however, occasionally nests in low trees.</p>

At least five crane species are in danger of extinction; these include the WHOOPING CRANE, Grus Americana, the tallest bird found in the United States and Canada.</p>

<P><FONT face="TimeScrDBol" color="#bbbbbb" size="5">The Crane Meaning</FONT><br>
<P>The Crane represents the nurturer, mother and protector from the 4 animals. It first seeks to find the best solution for all concerned before it seeks to have it's own needs satisfied. It is like most mothers, the martyr, caring for it's flock and putting the family's existence, the groups well-being, the health of the unit before it's own.</P>

<P>The Crane is graceful, light, well balanced, patient, watchful and never attacking. It is armed with claws at the end of long feet which give it a long reach as well as a sharp long beak. The Crane never attacks but just evades; and if it thinks that it is safe and appropriate it will teach, finding a point to counter, an obvious vital spot like eyes, ears, nose, crown of the head and anything else that is suitable for it's light long claws and sharp strong beak.</P>

<P>Caring, teaching, protecting, graceful, the crane would never seek to attack and would ensure that whoever it is dealing with would be able to make their point first, putting their consideration and needs before seeking to have it's own needs satisfied. For the Crane seeks to guide, support and help all in achieving their needs and thus fulfilling their own needs.</P>

<P><FONT face="TimeScrDBol" color="#bbbbbb" size="5">Strategy</FONT><br>
The Crane does not attack only counter attack. It would do this from any angle except the front. It would always side step the attack; possibly using it's wings to mask the movement, change direction again, possibly to deliver a technique to the attacker. It is a master of evading supported by blocking and redirection. It would seek to frustrate it's opponent, helping it to defeat itself.</P>

<P>The Crane uses any technique that causes no permanent harm. It's preference would be annoying techniques, energy sapping strategies, (like water wearing down rock,) rather than a single blow or finishing technique. It would seek to give it's opponent the ability to stop and reflect on the consequences of it's aggression, seeking to teach/show it the error of violence. For this it would - like a mother or mentor - seem to be cruel to be kind.</P>

<P><FONT face="TimeScrDBol" color="#bbbbbb" size="5">Techniques</FONT><br>
Yang - The Crane would do mainly leg work with kicks not requiring a lot of strength, but which would cause pain without permanent damage. The hands would be used for distraction and occasional 'Cranes Beak' (5 Finger) technique. Hands would also be used for blocking, not to divert the techniques but to move it's light and agile body around the attack. The kicks would mainly be direct, flicking and surprising, both from technique and where they would be applied.</P>

<P>Yin - Chin Na (Aikido) like wrist locking and redirecting, using the feet for distraction, movement and occasional redirection and blocking. The wristlock's would be increasingly painful, but would not cause permanent damage. If the attacker is persistent the Crane may choose to cause loss of consciousness through application of extreme pain.</P>

<P><FONT face="TimeScrDBol" color="#ffffff" size="5">Shaolin Crane Forms</FONT><br>
There are a number of Crane forms in Liang-I Shaolin Kung Fu including;<ul>

<LI>The Butterfly Crane (Flow and Grace)</li> 
<LI>Iron and Silk Crane (Form of Changes)</li> 
<LI>The Raptor Crane (Twin Swords)</li>
<LI>The Dancing Crane (Movement and Interchange with Fans)</li> 
<LI>The Flying Crane (Slow and Deliberate)</li> 
<LI>The Directional Crane (Change of speed, direction and height)</li></ul></p>


<P><FONT face="TimeScrDBol" color="#ffffff" size="5">Crane Character</FONT><br>
You are a Crane if you prefer to have everybody air their ideas and opinions; get everyone behind the decision and have all working together. If you seek to maintain a stress free people environment where all are happy working, playing, living and partying together. If this is even more important than achieving goals and targets; and if you think that the most important aspect of life is Friendship, being with people and enjoying each others company then you are Crane Dominant. (This is not to say that you do not use the others.)</P>

<P>You are best as a mother, social organizer, mediator and (ideal) diplomat! You have strong focus ability never losing site of what you want, but never making this obvious or achieving this to anyone's detriment. You are also a true and honest teacher, mentor, Sifu, guardian and family person who will do all to ensure the survival of the group/family/company . . </P>
