By Charles E. Gilliland and Harold D. Hunt
<p align=justify>Flocks of construction cranes hatched in
the 1990s by booming economies in
Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and
San Antonio are busy building office space for
expanding businesses. However, this drive to
develop new investment-grade office space has
not occurred in smaller metropolitan areas. So
when are Beaumont, Corpus Christi, El Paso,
Lubbock and McAllen likely to see new, topquality
office buildings appear on their skylines?
Analysis of building and land costs suggests
that office rents must rise significantly in these
markets before new development is feasible. 
<p align=center>
<img src="img/1373a.jpg">
<p align=justify>
Current rental rates for new office space in
these cities range from $12 to $18 per square
foot. New investment-grade development
would require rents greater
than $23 per square foot, even
if land can be acquired at a
minimal $6 per square foot.
While some land may be available
at that price in Beaumont,
El Paso and Lubbock
(see Table 1), land costs are
higher in Corpus Christi and
McAllen, and that translates
into required rents in the $25-
to $26-per-square-foot range. 
<p align=justify>
Investors develop office
space to earn a return on their
invested capital. When local
demand does not provide a
sufficient return, new development
ceases until rents rise
high enough to entice that
new investment. The capitalization
rate is a traditional measure of investors’ expected
return in any given market. When the market provides a return
exceeding the capitalization rate, new construction is likely.
Determining the point at which rising demand signals a need
for new space to be developed requires analysis of current
building and land costs in the local market. Table 2 shows
assumptions made for this analysis of proposed office construction
in Beaumont, Corpus Christi, El Paso, Lubbock and McAllen.
Applying the market parameters in Table 2 to actual land
and building costs in each local market yields the rent needed
to justify new construction (see Table 3). For example, in
Corpus Christi, with land selling for $10 per square foot and
building costs at $110 per square foot, new office space must
rent for at least $25.51 per square foot. Using the land and
building costs shown in Table 1, the rental rates needed to
justify new office construction in other smaller Texas markets
can be determined. 
<p align=center>
<img src="img/1373b.jpg">
<p align=justify>
Prime office space in Corpus Christi currently rents for
between $16 and $18 per square foot, substantially less than
the $25.51 required to encourage new construction. To build
new office space in this rental range, with land costs at $6 per
square foot, construction costs could be no higher than $60–
$80 per square foot. Projects with land costs of $14 per square
foot would be restricted to building costs of $60 per square
foot to keep rental costs within the current range. 
<p align=justify>
Investment-grade office buildings are described by the
Marshall Valuation Service as being constructed with reinforced
concrete frames in which the columns and beams are either
formed or precast concrete. These structures are fire-resistant,
with floors and roofs made of precast or formed concrete slabs.
Exterior walls are typically built of masonry or reinforced
concrete and may be partially load-bearing. However, nonbearing
panels of concrete, metal, glass or stone are often used
as well. Interior partitions are generally made of masonry,
reinforced concrete or gypsum block, but lightweight, movable
partitions may be used where structural walls are not a necessity.
Cost per square foot for a 30,000-square-foot, three-story
building of this quality in Corpus Christi approaches $114 per
square foot, according to the Marshall Valuation Service cost
estimator. Assuming that actual costs may vary, building costs
for investment-grade properties in Corpus Christi are likely
between $100 and $120 per square foot. Given current land
costs of $10 to $20 per square foot, Table 3 shows that new
construction would be feasible only after rents exceed $23.62
per square foot. 
<p align=center>
<img src="img/1373c.jpg">
<p align=justify>
That leaves a sizable gap between the current rent of $18
per square foot and the minimum $23.62 per square foot
needed to support new investment-grade office structures.
Only unsatisfied demand for better quality space or an influx
of highly profitable business is likely to boost rents to those
levels. The current outlook for business growth in Corpus
Christi does not indicate that either of these circumstances
will occur in the near future, so it is doubtful the city will
see new investment-grade office construction any time soon.
However, some office development projects may be possible
under current market conditions. Rather than investmentgrade
construction, Corpus Christi should anticipate construction
of less expensive structures, in the $60- to $70-per-squarefoot
range, developed by local investors. The same is true for
the other four markets discussed here. 
<p align=justify>
This office building market analysis
reflects the perspective of a no-nonsense
investor dedicated to achieving a
return commensurate with current opportunities
in other markets. To attract
such an investor, rents in a community
must provide returns that compensate
for the capital used to buy the land and
construct the building.
