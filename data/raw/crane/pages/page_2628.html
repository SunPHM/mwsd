        of the Sandhill Cranes</strong><br>
        Text and images copyright Michael Forsberg, all rights reserved</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
        is one of the wonders of the natural world: half a million sandhill cranes, 
        more than 80 percent of the world&#8217;s population, descending on the 
        Platte River Valley in central Nebraska every spring. It is the largest 
        gathering of cranes anywhere, and they have been coming to this sliver 
        of threatened habitat in North America&#8217;s Central Flyway for at least 
        10,000 years. On the Platte they rest and refuel for four to six weeks 
        before flying to their breeding grounds in the upper Midwest, Canada, 
        Alaska and Siberia.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mf1.jpg" width="600" height="398"></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
        recent years, growing numbers of tourists from around the world also have 
        migrated to the Platte to see and hear these grand birds crowd into river 
        roosts at sunset and leave in massive, noisy flocks at first light. To 
        many birdwatchers, spring migration is the sandhill crane&#8217;s defining 
        moment. But it is only a small part of the story.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        sandhill crane (Grus canadensis) is thought to be the oldest surviving 
        bird species in the world. A fossilized wing bone, found in 9-million-year-old, 
        late Miocene deposits in Nebraska, is virtually identical in structure 
        to the humerus of a modern crane.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Standing 
        about four feet tall with six-foot wingspan, sandhill cranes inhabit open 
        wetlands and shallow marshes. They are among the longest-lived birds, 
        surviving 25 to 30 years in the wild. Scientists believe the species has 
        survived because of its highly complex social behaviors, long-term care 
        for its young, innate wariness and adaptability. Today, the sandhill crane 
        is by far the most abundant of the world&#8217;s 15 crane species, including 
        seven which are endangered.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        sandhill crane travels farther than any other crane species - for some 
        individuals a roundtrip of 14,000 miles through four countries from eastern 
        Russia to northern Mexico. Because they are so numerous, wide ranging 
        and appealing, sandhills are the most easily identified of all the cranes. 
        A growing number of crane watchers and local festivals celebrate the birds 
        and their annual arrival at staging areas and wintering grounds.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According 
        to the International Crane Foundation, the sandhill crane is the most 
        thoroughly studied crane species and among the most studied of all North 
        American wildlife species. Habitat restoration and conservation efforts 
        beginning in the 1930s have brought one migratory subspecies, the greater 
        sandhill crane, back to its vast breeding grounds in the upper Midwest. 
        Today, most conservation work focuses on three non-migratory subspecies, 
        the Florida, Mississippi and Cuban sandhill cranes, all either threatened 
        or endangered by unregulated hunting in the past and, more recently, by 
        development and habitat alteration in the South. The migratory sandhill 
        subspecies are not considered threatened or endangered.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        some of its subspecies struggle for survival, the sandhill crane is contributing 
        to efforts to save other crane species and other migratory birds. They 
        have become surrogate parents in endangered crane breeding programs at 
        the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin, and contribute 
        to research to establish new migratory corridors for whooping cranes. 
        Outside the laboratory, the sandhill crane has become a &#8220;poster 
        child&#8221; for public education and preservation of threatened wetland 
        and grassland habitats, on which it and many less glamorous species depend.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nowhere 
        is this as evident as in Nebraska, where the sandhill crane has become 
        a conservation symbol in the central Platte River valley. Nowhere are 
        sandhill crane habitats more important, and 50 years of research has revealed 
        the importance of the Platte to the well-being of the species.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        central Platte is critical to crane migration success. An often-used image 
        depicts the region as the pinched waist of an hourglass. The top chamber 
        covers a vast breeding range stretching from Hudson Bay to northeastern 
        Siberia. The bottom chamber encompasses the wintering grounds extending 
        from the Texas Gulf Coast westward through New Mexico and southward into 
        Mexico. Every year, from late February through early April, the entire 
        mid-continent population of sandhill cranes pours through the constricted 
        passage between the chambers, an 80-mile-long, six-mile-wide swath of 
        river, wetlands, forest and croplands from Grand Island to Lexington, 
        Nebraska.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mf2.jpg" width="600" height="400"></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three 
        subspecies use the Platte: the greater sandhill crane (G.c. tabida), the 
        Canadian sandhill crane (G.c. rowani) and the lesser sandhill crane (G.c. 
        canadensis). The most obvious difference among the three is size. Greaters, 
        the largest, weigh 10 pounds or more; lessers, the smallest, weigh about 
        six pounds; Canadians average about eight pounds.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        lesser is the most populous, breeding throughout the arctic and subarctic 
        regions of northern Canada, in coastal and interior Alaska and in northeastern 
        Siberia. It winters primarily in the playa lakes region and riparian wetlands 
        of eastern New Mexico, western Texas and northern Mexico.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lesser 
        sandhill cranes are the earliest and most numerous of the cranes using 
        the Platte. Their largest concentrations are in the western part of the 
        central Platte staging area. A few lessers also stage near North Platte 
        and on the North Platte River near Ogallala.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        less studied Canadian sandhill crane is considered by some scientists 
        to be an intergrade or transitional race. It breeds in the Canadian subarctic 
        from Ontario to British Columbia, and winters primarily in coastal Texas. 
        The greatest concentrations are in the central part of the Platte staging 
        area. The greater sandhill crane breeds farther south than other migratory 
        crane subspecies, primarily in scattered areas in Canada and from the 
        Great Lakes states westward to the Pacific Ocean.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Five 
        distinct geographical populations migrate along different flyways to scattered 
        wintering grounds. The Prairie population, mostly birds from northwestern 
        Minnesota, southwestern Ontario and southern Manitoba, passes through 
        Nebraska and winters along the Texas Gulf Coast. It is most common in 
        the eastern part of the Platte River staging area. Greaters often are 
        the last to arrive on the Platte.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently 
        the greater sandhill has begun to re-establish itself in parts of its 
        former breeding range in western Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas and now, 
        perhaps, Nebraska. Last summer, nesting cranes with young were observed 
        on two Clay County wetlands south of the Platte River for the first confirmed 
        nesting in Nebraska in more than 100 years. The birds are thought to have 
        been greater sandhill cranes, the subspecies that nested in Nebraska until 
        hunting and habitat destruction extirpated them by the 1930s.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cranes 
        come to the wide, shallow, braided channels of the Platte because it provides 
        safe nighttime roosts, grain in crop fields and other nutrients in wet 
        meadows along its margins. No other river system in the Central Flyway 
        supplies their needs as fully.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cranes 
        prefer to roost on submerged sandbars in water about 18 inches deep in 
        wide channels, some up to 500 yards, that provide protection from predators 
        and people.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
        the day, they spend much of their time in harvested cornfields feeding 
        on spilled grain to build fat reserves. Grain makes up more than 90 percent 
        of their diet. They also feed in wet meadows and low grasslands near the 
        river. In those areas, which are fed by surface sloughs and connected 
        to the river by groundwater, cranes forage for snails, earthworms, beetles 
        and other invertebrates. The proteins and minerals they gain from those 
        foods and from calcium nodules in the soil are necessary for egg and chick 
        development.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="mf3.jpg" width="600" height="400"></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        wet meadows and lowland grasslands also are important loafing areas; safe, 
        secluded, sheltered spots where cranes rest, bathe and court. When storms 
        prevent cranes from taking flight or when high water blocks their return 
        to the river, they use wet meadows or tree-lined channels off the main 
        branch of the Platte as alternate roosts.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cranes 
        gorge themselves while on the Platte, storing energy needed to complete 
        migration and survive the early days on the northern breeding grounds. 
        They can gain nearly a pound, about 10 percent of their body weight, during 
        their stay. For nearly 10,000 years, the cranes returned to an undammed 
        Platte, a braided, prairie river described by European explorers as &#8220;a 
        mile wide and an inch deep&#8221;. The river valley was a vast complex 
        of wetlands, shallow channels, sandbars, islands and prairie. Spring floods 
        scoured the sandbars free of vegetation. Wet meadows and native prairie 
        stretched across the valley.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 
        Euro Americans settled on the Platte, the great crane migration is believed 
        to have stretched 200 miles along the river. Their diet consisted primarily 
        of roots, tubers and seeds that were abundant in the valley. Today, most 
        cranes passing through Nebraska use only 80 river miles and fewer than 
        20 major roost sites, each holding 10,000 to 15,000 birds.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        long-term loss of Platte habitat is a critical threat to the species. 
        Through the past hundred years, declining flows and the removal of sediment, 
        which is now trapped behind dams and diversions, have altered the hydrology 
        of the river, changed vegetation along the banks and reduced sandbar formation. 
        The cranes are now crowded into fewer suitable stretches, increasing their 
        risk of disease, the competition for food and vulnerability to spring 
        storms.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Platte, regulated by dams and pressured by politics, is narrower and deeper 
        than it was a hundred years ago. Dams and diversions reduced flows by 
        70 percent, and in many places highways and suburban acreage developments 
        crowd the river&#8217;s edge. Trees now cover banks, sandbars and islands 
        that were open and unvegetated. Up to 75 percent of the wet meadows and 
        native grasslands have been eliminated by agriculture, gravel mining and 
        development. The best habitats are large wet meadows, low grasslands and 
        wide river channels, all in close proximity. The few such places that 
        remain are crowded with cranes.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
        improve that situation, recent conservation efforts in the valley have 
        focused on maintaining, improving and restoring habitat. Wooded islands 
        and vegetated sandbars in the river have been cleared to increase roosting 
        areas. Crop fields and overgrazed pastures have been replanted in native 
        grass, and some have been landscaped to restore their natural drainage.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
        50 years of research, scientists agree there is still much left to learn 
        about sandhill cranes. Although biologists speak in broad terms about 
        the cranes&#8217; migration, their needs, where they breed and how they 
        behave at the nest, little is known about this secretive, ancient bird, 
        whose history dates back perhaps as far as 60 million years. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
        is certain is that during the past 40 years, the human population has 
        increased from three billion to six billion and the number of endangered 
        crane species has more than tripled. In few bird families are so many 
        species endangered and, compared to the time that cranes have endured, 
        it has happened in the blink of an eye. To researchers, sandhill cranes 
        have become increasingly important - for their own sake and for the future 
        of other species. They are a model for international conservation of migratory 
        species and, like the bald eagle, wolf and grizzly, they are a symbol 
        for habitat conservation.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
        centuries, cranes have touched the lives of the humans in whose midst 
        they have lived. With luck, the sandhill crane&#8217;s future will be 
        as bright as its past. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><em>Crane 
        Continent - Sandhill Cranes in North America</em></strong> <em>(a work 
        in progress)<br>
        </em>For a very long time, it has been a dream of mine to produce a picture 
        book on the sandhill crane, a mystical and revered creature, the most 
        ancient of bird species on the globe, and an ambassador for wetland habitats 
        throughout much of North America.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through 
        generous private donor support, sponsorship from the International Crane 
        Foundation, and help from a number of scientists, conservationists and 
        friends, the book is slowly beginning to take shape and become a reality. 
        The book will celebrate the species and the diverse wetland habitats in 
        which it resides from as far north as Alaska to as far south as Cuba. 
        The photographs will focus primarily on the sandhill crane's natural history 
        and their habitats, but also will point towards the role the species plays 
        in conservation, sometimes for it's own sake, sometimes for the sake of 
        others.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        book's introduction will be written by a good friend, George Archibald, 
        a world wildlife fund gold medal recipient, tireless conservationist, 
        and the foremost crane biologist of his time. It will also feature several 
        short &quot;notes from the field&quot; type essays, giving a glimpse into 
        this several year photographic journey.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ultimately, 
        I hope that this book educates and inspires, relating in pictures and 
        words the true value of these birds, and forwards the cause of crane and 
        wetland conservation worldwide. Although a publisher has not yet been 
        named, we plan to release in late 2004. Please stay tuned and check back 
        from time to time as the work on the project progresses.</font></p>
