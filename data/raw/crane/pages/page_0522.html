Commonly considered Stephen Crane's greatest accomplishment, The Red Badge of Courage (1895) ranks among the foremost literary achievements of the modern era. When its publication was announced in Publisher's Weekly on 5 October 1895, Crane was largely unknown. Although his volume of poetry published earlier that year, The Black Riders, had made some waves in literary circles, it struck most readers as quirky and cryptic. The gritty social realism of his first novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893) had earned praise from literati such as Hamlin Garland and W. D. Howells, but Crane probably gave away more copies than were actually sold. (The story is told that Crane, in a desperate advertising scheme, paid men to ride the Manhattan El train and conspicuously read copies of Maggie.) When Crane signed a contract with D. Appleton and Co. to publish Red Badge, he was not well-known enough to command an advance, and agreed to a flat 10 per cent royalty on the retail price of all copies sold. Published in the autumn of 1895, Red Badge went through two editions before the end of the year. By March of 1896 the novel was in eighth place on the international booksellers' list and had gone through fourteen printings; remarkably enough, Red Badge has never been out of print. Unfortunately, unremunerative contracts with publishers and a general lack of good business sense kept Crane insolvent for much of his life. But with the publication of Red Badge, Crane achieved almost overnight celebrity.

	it took me a while to get into the book, but once i got into it started to make more sense and it was actually a pretty good book.  crane does a very good job of showing all the struggles the main character has: hero v. coward; moral v. unmoral; and even life & death struggles. i don't think i would have chosen to read this book if i didn't have to for school, but it was actaully good and i'm glad i had to read it.  i got a sense of what war is like from a common soldier.  for someone to enjoy this book though, i think one must be able to read a variety of books or else you prolly won't like it... just my opinion though!!

	The Red Badge of Courage had some nice parts, but when forced to read as was the person who wrote before me, it become hard to read.  I am now required to write a research paper on Mr. Crane and his style... he is supposedly a Naturalist and a Realist. What struck me is that he had not fought in any wars at the time that he wrote the novel. I was also surprised when reading the book how Mr. Flemming walked away from the dieing soldier, and left him in a field.  If you have any resources i could use to write this research paper, please tell me what they are. This site has been a great help to me, so if you have found it... you are lucky<br><br>Lordofthejellies

I think all th negative comments are on here because the book is hard for younger kids to follow. I think the ending is very good, at first I didn't but it makes since, the character was an everyday person at the beggining and just like the day turns to night, crane sort of faded out the story back into the real world. I think Stephen Crane put a lot of though into how the ending should turn out and one more brush stroke to the pages would ruin this novel.

	There is good use of symbolism in this novel, but it is hard to pick out. The plot was good, but I was extremely annoyed at Henry by the end. He thought he was the best soldier, when in reality, he was a coward. I guess this is Crane's use of irony, which is cool. The book itself started our boring, got pretty good, but had a lousy ending.

	Personally, "The Red Badge of Courage" seems a little boring. But you can't judge a book by its cover! The main character is a very important person throughout the novel(obviously), and his mother has good morals and she only wants the best for her son.

This is an awesome book!  Almost everyone up there is complaining, but if you want the truth about this book you are reading the right thing.  Lots of people were talking about how the book is repetitive, but this is actually one of the books that is best to read if you want good character development.  I think that most people are just thrown off by the writing style.  Try to read this book!  It is definitely worthwhile, but it isn't meant to be idle reading.  It's best if you are doing it as a school project because it forces you to comprehend what you are reading.  If you really don't get it or hate it I would suggest reading the wishbone version and coming back to this one!  (I know that sounds really corny, but I read the wishbone one and got motivated to read this one as well.)  Don't brush this book off!  It's really high quality and needs a chance!
