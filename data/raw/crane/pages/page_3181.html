      Part 8</H1> 


<H2>Sunday</H2>
<P CLASS="dateline">Sun Apr&nbsp;16 2000</P>

<P>I woke up early again.

<P>My ankle didn't hurt.  It felt disgusting, though.
   Something in there was swollen and tender.
   Something in there felt it when other parts 
   slid by.  Were they tendons?  Muscles 
   flexing?  I didn't know, didn't want to know.
   I did some experimenting, learned to hobble around without 
   flexing my ankle.  

<P>There was something by the door of my hotel room--someone had shoved 
   a newspaper under the door.  I picked it up.  Generally, I don't 
   understand Japanese newspapers--they use lots of 
   <EM CLASS="foreign">kanji</EM>, 
   talking about people and places whose names I don't recognize.  But 
   this headline had a lot of 
   <EM CLASS="foreign">katakana</EM>--they were phonetically 
   sounding something out.  It said 
     ニュヨーク 
   ("<EM CLASS="foreign">Nyu Yo-ku</EM>") 
   okay, something 
   in New York. 
    ナズダック 
   ("<EM CLASS="foreign">Nazudakku</EM>")
   Oh! They must be talking about the 
   <A HREF="http://www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ</A> stock exchange.  
   There was a kanji, but I recognized it--it 
   was part of the word for "under".  Hey, I was most of the way through 
   this headline and I was <EM>understanding</EM> it!  I decoded a 
   number: 617.  I had understood this headline!  NASDAQ was down 617!
   I sobered up a bit when I realized what I was reading.  I put down 
   the paper and hobbled over the the A-Bomb museum.

<H2>The Peace Memorial Museum</H2>

<P>At the 
   <A HREF="http://www.tourism.city.hiroshima.jp/english/level7/h040100001.html">Peace Memorial Museum</A>, 
   I jotted down the Japanese for "Bikini Atoll" : マーシャル諸島のビキニ . (I'm not sure
   about that first <EM CLASS="foreign">kanji</EM>, my writing was messy.) 
   I jotted down 
    原爆 
   ("<EM CLASS="foreign">genbaku</EM>") (either an atomic blast or an atomic bomb, I'm not sure which).  
   I looked at an 
   exhibit about people who'd taken pictures of Hiroshima 
   in the minutes and days after the A-Bomb attack.  The War Office 
   had asked that most (all?) photos be destroyed--perhaps for morale 
   purposes?  Photographers who talked about taking pictures while 
   in shock.  The phrase "viewfinder blurred by tears" came up a few times.
   I looked at a mass of fused metal which looked for all the world 
   like one of those burlwood tables that were so popular back in the 1970s.
   There was a stack of pottery bowls, somewhat merged.

   Maybe you've heard of Sasaki Sadoko, who contracted leukemia
   from radiation poisoning after the A-bomb hit, who died in the 
   attempt to fold 1000 origami cranes.  This is where she went 
   to school.  If you're at the entrance to Shukkeien garden, 
   go widdershins around the block.  You can't miss it.  Not that 
   there's much to see.
</DIV>

<P>I didn't get much out of the Museum.  By this time, 
   I'd studied the history of the Manhattan Project.  I'd read <I>Black 
   Rain</I>.  I didn't think I knew everything about the attack on 
   Hiroshima, but maybe I knew everything that 
   this intro-level museum was ready to teach me.

<P>Jaded, jaded.

<P>No, wait, It's not just that I was jaded.

<P>The museum's message was so simple, it was a straw man.
   The museum's message was, <EM>Please don't use anything 
   like the Atom Bomb again.  It killed lots of people.</EM>
   That argument isn't very convincing to people in a war, 
   people fearing for their own lives.  I'm convinced that 
   Hiroshima was a tragedy, an avoidable tragedy, but this 
   museum would never have convinced me.

<H2>In Between Places</H2>

<P>When I saw the movie 
  "<A HREF="http://www.wayofthesamurai.com/">Ghost Dog</A>", 
   I'd snickered at the pigeons.
   In the movie, an American who's gotten a bit carried away by 
   reading about <EM CLASS="foreign">samurai</EM> decides to become one.  He 
   communicates with his liege by courier pigeon.  "Oh, a pigeon, 
   that's <EM>really</EM> Japanese," I'd sarcastically thought.  
   I'd forgotten 
   about the pigeons of Hiroshima.  Sure, they were imports, 
   the fall-out of a screwed-up attempt to import doves.  But 
   it was impossible not ignore them, to ignore the way they
   gave a sense of place.

<P>The lady at the Peace Park Tourist Information Center spoke excellent 
   English and gave me a ferry schedule and some useful maps.  

<P>I went 
   looking for an Indian restaurant that was on the map in my tourist 
   guide.  I failed to find it, but did find another Indian restaurant, 
   which wasn't on the map.  It was one of the blander pretenses at Indian 
   food I've ever had, and some of the best food I would have during this 
   trip.  

<P>Remembering how crowded Saturday's train had been, I reserved 
   a ticket for next Saturday morning's Okayama-Tokyo run.

<H2>Shukkei-En</H2>

</DIV>

<P>I went back to the hotel to lie down for a while, then to 
   Shukkei-en, a garden.  Sitting and writing was 
   easier than walking, and I took some notes:

        ALT="[Photo: Shukkeien]"><BR>
   This blurry photo adds nothing to the art 
   of photographing Japanese gardens.  Can I blame the rain?
</DIV>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I am hobbling around.  I sit on benches.  This is a 
       good strolling garden, but I am not a good stroller.
       When I go downhill, I risk pulling my ankle.

    <P>Still, it's a pretty spot.  Lawn for locals to picnic on.
       Koi, bridges, trees, rocks, shrubs--everything you could want.

   <P>I sit and look out at pond.  Either there's lots of fish
      (unlikely)  or else it's sprinkling (likely).  I'm sitting 
      and watching the ripples on the water and feeling relaxed.

   <P>When was the last time I felt so relaxed?  On a day when I 
      slept the night before, I mean.

   <P>It's so strange to think that this place was destroyed by the 
      A-Bomb.  It's so serene.  It's been restored just recently.

   <P>Well, it's definitely raining.

   <P>I'm glad I'm in this shelter.

   <P>Saw a splash.... half a minute later, saw a fish jump out of
      pond twice.  It's gray/silver.  Could be a koi, but I can't tell.

   <P><B>RAINing harder now.  I can only hope it lets up before I get 
         bored.</B></P>

   <P>A couple just sat next to me.  "Koi no haneda"--said when a 
      fish jumped.  Within seconds of sitting down, the guy lit up    
      a cigarette.

   <P>And another couple [sits down in the shelter].  But this guy's 
      not smoking.

   <P>And a group of three.

   <P>The rain calmed down, mostly, and the  
        日本人 
      (Japanese people) have 
      dashed off.  Still I sit and unwind.

   <P>That curry wasn't so great, but I'm still so glad I had it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It wasn't a black rain.</P>

<H2>Back in the Room</H2>

<P>It didn't take a genius to realize that traipsing around 
   that garden wasn't helping my ankle any.  I went back to 
   the hotel, making a couple of stops--I burst into a closed 
   restaurant, had an enlightening conversation with the 
   restaurant's proprietor (in which I learned they were 
   closed until 5:00), burst back out, and stopped off at a 
   convenience store to buy a movable feast.

<P>Back in the room, I ate dinner and watched TV.  I reflected 
   that if I'd watched this much TV in Albuquerque, I'd have 
   felt as if I was wasting my time.  Fortunately, Japanese TV 
   was sufficiently exotic such that watching it was "cultural tourism."

<P>"Chibi Maruko-chan" came on TV.  I did a double-take.
   Hadn't she been on TV the last time I'd been in Japan, eight 
   years before?  Sure enough, they were celebrating their 10th 
   year on the air.  I listened to "Owner of a Lonely Heart" in 
   a Nissan commercial.  I watched a basketball game whose 
   accented commentary I had a hard time following--I thought the game
   was between the the Jaws and the Spaz, but it was the Jazz 
   and the Spurs.

   You might think this was a <EM CLASS="foreign">sarariman</EM> 
   charging forth, proclaiming, "Excelsior!"  In fact, he seemed 
   to be a dockboy, running around tossing and catching lines.
</DIV>

<P>I woke up early, packed, checked out.
   I took the tram to the Ujina ferry harbor station.
   Thanks to my map, I knew not to get off at the Ujina-1 
   tram stop, the Ujina-2 tram stop; I knew I wanted the 
   unnumbered Ujina tram stop.  Thus, when the driver called 
   out various stops with "Ujina" in the name, I didn't 
   just hop right out.  Fortunately, my stop was the 
   end of the line, hard to miss.

   Here are some views from the ferry.  
   This was one of the most beautiful times of my life.
   No, really.
</DIV>

<P>I bought a ferry ticket and headed onto the boat.
   I watched another ferry coming in on the other side 
   of the dock.  A dockboy tossed up a line--I noticed 
   that this dockboy was wearing a suit.  Soon someone 
   was hosing down that ferry--and he was wearing a necktie 
   under his waterproof jacket.  I don't think I could be 
   a dockboy or a deckhand in Japan.  It's too formal.

<P>All of the other passengers had waited back on land, 
   in the designated waiting area.  I'd boarded as soon 
   as possible so that I could get a view of the harbor 
   activity from the ferry's high decks.  I was looking 
   over at the well-dressed dockboys when a woman in 
   uniform appeared from a doorway and started jabbering 
   at me excitedly.  
   "<EM CLASS="foreign">Wakarimasen</EM>," ("I don't understand.") 
   I grimaced.  And, 
   bless her, she switched into Tarzan mode.  She slowly said, 
   "<EM CLASS="foreign">Kippu wa...</EM>" and I knew that a 
   <EM CLASS="foreign">kippu</EM> was 
   a ticket, showed her mine, and that was fine.

<P>The ferry ride from Hiroshima to Matsuyama was gorgeous.
   An inland sea, boats, wooded islands receding into mist, 
   sunlight on water, clouds.  It seems ridiculous to point 
   out how pretty the combination of air, water, and light 
   can be, but there you are.  It was easily the best part 
   of my whole vacation.

<P>I saw power lines strung from the mainland to an island, 
   power lines high enough for a ship to sail under.  I 
   guess that wasn't so pretty, but it was rather impressive.  
   The ferry route carried me into and out of the city of 
   Kure with its many armed navy boats.  
   I did my best to look harmless, not worth blowing up.  
   The ferry smelled of guano and diesel, and there was a 
   constant cold wind.   Okay, so it wasn't all beautiful islands.

<P>But it was nice.

   Here's a photo of me and a photo of this guy.
   He took the photo of me; I took the photo of him.
   This happened in the usual way:
   he offered, in English, to take my picture;
   of course, he asked me, in English, where I was from;
   I'm from San Francisco;
   of course, he said, "Ah, Giants!" and then rattled off a
   bunch of names which I might have recognized if I 
   followed baseball. It was not the first time
   I'd had this conversation in Japan.  At least I 
   got a couple of photos out of it.
