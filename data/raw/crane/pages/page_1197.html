      added November 9th, 2002</font></b> 
    <P align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana"> The model is now getting pretty 
      close to completion. The funnels are plated and painted, all of the cowl-vents 
      are complete but still have to be painted and the davits are under construction. 
      Hopefully we'll have it finished by the end of this year and then it'll 
      be off to Orlando. I shall send at least one more update before it embarks 
      on its maiden voyage! </font>

      The lifeboats were built using Bob Reads' plans. They were of great help. 
      Thanks Bob! I have received some e-mails from fellow Titanic modellers asking 
      questions about pics that are already on the TRMA-site. Please don't take 
      anything for granted until the model is finished! We are still learning 
      and correcting mistakes as we are going on, like the rods on the reciprocating 
      engine casing. <br>

      Promenade deck enclosure nearly completed. The huge box underneath the engine-telegraphs

      (on the ceiling of A-deck, underneath the bridge) still has to be added.

      An aft well-deck crane. Note the ladder. The wooden handrail still has to 
      be firmly attached.
