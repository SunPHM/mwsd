<b>Michigan's Upper Penninsula - Land of Walkingshaw and pasties.</b><br>The late Michigan dentist Larry Walkingshaw loved cranes and decided to study them, first in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, then the entire continent. His land is a land of bogs and boreal forests, wolves and loons, black flies and good German staple food called "pasties".  It is a place that still holds good populations of cranes, but a land also increasingly visited and developed by the outside world.
