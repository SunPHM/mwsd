<p><b>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 1:&nbsp; The wall between the kitchen and fellowship
hall has risen above the top of the door; supports are now in place at
the serving window for the blocks which will be above the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A walkover of the site reveals that a 3 inch copper tubing has been installed
at the east side of the building about six feet south of the east entrance,
elbowing up inside the building; this is obviously the water service line
to the building.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will probably connect to the existing water
service line in or at the plumbing valve house built during an earlier
renovation of the existing building.</b></span>

The elevator shaft has reached the second floor level.&nbsp; Columns and

shaft.&nbsp; One of these columns has reached the level of the second floor
ceiling.</b></span>

<p><span STYLE="font-family: Serifa Th BT"><b>WHY NOT MORE PICTURES?&nbsp;
Briefly, picture files take much more disk space than text.&nbsp; Over
the weekend, we bumped the limit on available disk space. The website was
expanded by 10mb.&nbsp; Incidentally, on Tuesday evening, the church conference
voted to purchase the Crow building, which includes all property fronting
on the north side of Acadamy Street in this block, subject to certain conditions,
which appear to be assured.&nbsp; The vote was 29-0.&nbsp; A conflict of
events with the Museum caused some to arrive after the vote was taken;
but they indicated that they supported the purchase as well.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 8:&nbsp; Several
bar joists have been hoisted onto the walls of the fellowship hall.&nbsp;
The lintel over the serving window has been poured.&nbsp; The elevator
lobby wall has come up some.&nbsp; The walkway around the southe side of
the building has been completed. There will be an entrance into each of
the classrooms on the south from this walkway.&nbsp; The column at the
corner of the fellowship hall, equipment room, and kitchen is held plumb
by a hand hoist ("comealong") and the boom of the construction site fork
lift while the concrete footing cures.&nbsp; The elevator installer visited
the site yesterday and proclaimed the elevator shaft good.&nbsp; The block
masons are scheduled to return Monday.&nbsp; Their first tasks will be
to enclose the stairwell, complete the elevator lobby walls, then close
the construction equipment entrance on the Oak Street side.&nbsp; Then
the "complicated" part of the indoor flooring will be undertaken.&nbsp;
This part involves several levels which will be connected by ramps.&nbsp;
Brick should arrive this week; the choice of bricks was in favor of the
darker colored offering (lefthand or first mockup wall).</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>MONDAY AFTERNOON, SEPTEMBER 10:&nbsp;
Blockwork has risen to second floor floor level for most of the building.&nbsp;
The north entrance stairwell outside wall has been put up.&nbsp; The only
exception is the gap on the east side, and the curved portion of the south
wall.&nbsp; A row of columns appears to be the eastward extension of the
wall between the fellowship hall and the kitchen.&nbsp; These support I-beams
spanning the equipment room, the north-south corridor approach to the elevator
lobby, and another at the east where the south wall curve begins.&nbsp;
This, apparently, is the primary support perimeter line.&nbsp; At least
three of these columns rise to the second story ceiling, and have beam
attachment flanges at both first story ceiling and second story ceiling.&nbsp;
Fourteen bar-joists have been set upon the walls of the fellowship hall,
at what appears to be 2-foot centers.&nbsp; The fellowship hall is a full-span
room (no internal columns).</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11: The east
wall of the ramped corridor to the elevator foyer is up to second floor
level; there are three windows in this wall.&nbsp; The west and center
portions of the curved south wall are up to eye level.&nbsp; The east portion
of this wall is not quite that high.&nbsp; There are two openings in the
curved portion, presumably locations of doors opening to the walkway and
the yard beyond.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12: Barjoists
went up over the kitchen, pantry area, dishwasher area and elevator lobby.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13:&nbsp;
The remaining barjoists went up over the fellowship hall.&nbsp; There are
a total of 28.&nbsp; There are now a total of 11 columns standing, some
single story, some 2-story, and footings for at least five more are evident.
A 24" x 24" drain grate has been installed in the courtyard between the
corridor to the elevator lobby and the south wing.&nbsp; This drops into
the 12" culvert extending from the front equipment plaza to the storm sewer
system at Oak Street.&nbsp; It is not yet evident whether there will be
a concrete floor in this area.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15:&nbsp;
Barjoists are now up to the west side of the north-south corridor, all
the way across the building.&nbsp; The center I-beam has reached a point
about 12 feet east of the north-south corridor.&nbsp; Minor details:&nbsp;
four pass-thru tubes have been inserted high in the west side of the kitchen
wall, presumably to facilitate installation of refrigerant piping between
the indoor and outdoor sections of the air conditioning equipment.&nbsp;
The location, however, indicates that the piping will run exposed outside
the building around the perimeter of the equipment plaza, or the equipment
will be located between the building door and the mop wash area.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17:&nbsp; In
the fellowship hall, small (1" x 1") angle iron runners are being welded
in place at the 25% and 75% of span locations. These are prependicular
to the barjoists.&nbsp; At center span, x-members are being bolted in place
between the barjoists.&nbsp; These runners and braces prevent flexing of
the barjoists and ensure rigidity of the barjoist system, which must support
the concrete floor above.&nbsp; In the east end of the building, Additional
columns and I-beams are in place, extending the main support structure
to the east wall of the building.&nbsp; The beams in place are a direct
extension of the south wall of the fellowship hall.&nbsp; The small courtyard
between the north-south corridor and the south wing extension of the building
has been paved.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18:&nbsp; The
wall surrounding the small courtyard has reached one course above the top
of the single window.&nbsp; The south third of the east wall of the building
has gone from floor level to three courses above eye level.&nbsp; The east
and west portions of the south wall which are not curved have both reached
window-top level.</b></span>
<br><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>Inside, the center beam has reached
about half-way from the north-south corridor toward the east end or the
building.&nbsp; One additional column footing has become apparent; there
will probably be one more at the east wall.&nbsp; The columns on the inside
corners of the stairwell have been erected.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 19:&nbsp;
The south wall has reached the second floor level except in the curved
portion, which is above the window level.&nbsp; Inside, the north-south
wall which is the partition between the fellowship hall and the storage
room has reached full height, just below the bottom of the barjoists.&nbsp;
The partition between the equipment room and the fellowship hall has reached
several courses.&nbsp; Both of these walls include double-width doors.&nbsp;
These walls deliniate the east end of the fellowship hall. More concrete
blocks arrived at the site late in the afternoon.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20:&nbsp;
The South wall is up to second floor level!&nbsp; The curved portion has
been completed.&nbsp; There are two doors in the wall.&nbsp; The east wall
of the fellowship hall has been completed to full height.&nbsp; The columns
and beams defining the stairwall are in place.&nbsp; The elevator lobby
has been swept.&nbsp; Note: at this point, the walls are only concrete
block.&nbsp; Eventually brick will be laid on the outside of the building.&nbsp;
It is not evident whether the interior walls will be plastered or left
as concrete block finish.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 22:&nbsp;
The barjoists hang from the walls by the extended top members, which are
1 1/2" angle iron.&nbsp; This places the top of the barjoists above the
level of the supporting walls. A course of brick has been or will be placed
between the joists and along parallel walls to provide a smooth footing
for the block wall to rise above. This has been accomplished around most
of the fellowship hall.&nbsp; Otherwise, the most apparent work has been
the continued installation of x-members and lower stabilization struts
in the barjoist system.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 4:00 PM:&nbsp;
The barjoists are in place on the north side as far east as the east side
of the stairwell.&nbsp; Barjoists are also up, but not in place in the
straight portions of the south wing.&nbsp; All of the barjoists run north
and south.&nbsp; The trench for the foundation on the east side of the
building, including the entry-way is about half complete.&nbsp; There is
a square about three feet on each side drawn in concrete dust on the dirt
along beam center beam line several feet east of the stairwell.&nbsp; Is
this a location for another column footing?&nbsp; There is a footing already
poured east of this location.&nbsp; A very light drizzle is falling.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25:&nbsp; Footings
for two additional interior columns have been poured.&nbsp; One is at the
location mentioned Monday, the other directly in line with it supporting
the end of the center beam at the east side of the building.&nbsp; Footings
have been poured for about two thirds of the east wall.&nbsp; The only
gap in the perimeter foundation is from the center of the building on the
east end, south for about twenty feet.&nbsp; Barjoists in the straight
sections of the south wing have been put in place.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1:00 PM:&nbsp;
Barjoists have been raised for the remainder of the north side of the building;
those nearest the east end of the building are not yet in final position,
as masons are completing the north half of the east wall.&nbsp; This wall
should reach full height today.&nbsp; At shortly after noon, the wood frame
support for
the line of blocks over the east foyer door was being constructed.&nbsp;
This will support the lintel blocks until the concrete cures.&nbsp; Masons
working on the scaffolds can look over the top of the barjoists, an indication
of the height of the wall.&nbsp; There still remains about 1/4 of the east
wall which has not yet been blocked up this is the portion from the corridor
south to the first column.&nbsp; Presumably this is being left open to
allow access by equipment during the pouring of floors.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1:00 PM:&nbsp;
Brickwork has begun at the southeast corner, where the new building joins
the existing building.&nbsp; Before the brick goes up, a 1" thick layer
of polystyrene ("SYTROFOAM") board is tacked to the concrete block wall.&nbsp;
This board has a thermal r-factor of 4, approximately the insulation value
of 4" of fibreglas.&nbsp; Between the insulation and the brick veneer there
is another 1" of air space. The small air conditioning unit will be relocated
on the floor of the concrete courtyard, and a retaining wall built to prevent
erosion.&nbsp; The area will then be contoured to divert water away from
the buildings.&nbsp; On the front side of the site, the wall in front of
the equipment plaza has reached its full height, about a foot below the
church floor level.&nbsp; This hides the equipment from the street.&nbsp;
There is an opening in this wall where a stairway will be constructed to
the lower level.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>Discussion with the superintendent
reveals that the west section of the upstairs floor will be poured before
any more barjoists are installed. This allows the concrete pumping truck
access to the west side of the building from the back.</b></span>
<p><span STYLE="font-family: Verdana"><b>The contractor will erect a column
at the street corner which will allow the Utility department to secure
guy wires and remove its live power lines from the south side of Acadamy
Street in this block.&nbsp; Cranes can then safely be used at the site
if necessary.</b></span>
