			<P>Pictures to come - With a bit more time to recover from the construction ordeals
			of the past several months, we will put up pictures of our beautiful, although <I>still</I>
			unfinished, new house.  Stay tuned!  :)</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>August, 2001 - Well, Rick's stress is somewhat reduced and his blood pressure
			has almost returned to normal; ergo the 8/6/01 update to this page. Moving in is
			still a work in progress, we have accumulated so much over the years and are trying
			to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were, one piece at a time.  More to come....</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>July, 2001 - On July 3 we send a <A HREF="SCH.html">letter</A> to the builder
			proposing waiving the final payment in lieu of their having to fix remaining items.
			Given the ineptitude of previous work, we are very concerned about their doing more
			harm than good with their fixes, as well as damaging our furnishings and other personal
			property in the process. The builder calls on July 5 and leaves a nasty message (we
			still have it recorded on tape) but does not reject the proposal in writing by the
			deadline of July 20 (deliberately selected as exactly a year and one-half from signing
			our contract - exactly <I>twice</I> the time they told us it would take to plan and
			build our house!).</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>February-June, 2001 - To make the long horror story short, we must call the builder
			almost every day to get the minimum work completed for final inspection 3/2/01, the
			last day of our mortgage commitment. Then more of the same trying to get the house
			done enough to move in. Rick complains, the builder gets nasty, so we start moving
			into the unfinished house on 4/26/01. With all the agony of having multiple teeth
			pulled, we get the builder to do some more minimal stuff through 6/4/01.  Major punch
			list items remain uncorrected.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>January, 2001 - Happy New Year, Century and Millennium!!! During the week of 1/1
			Kodman <A HREF="prim0103.jpg">primes</A> and <A HREF="paint104.jpg">paints</A> all
			of the interior Cottage White, including the <A HREF="garag107.jpg">garage</A>; and
			pressure washes and <A HREF="caulk107.jpg">caulks</A> the exterior. During the week
			of 1/8 Kodman paints most of the exterior <A HREF="swiss109.jpg">body</A> Swiss Coffee;
			and Al Young Tile preps the <A HREF="showr110.jpg">master</A> shower and <A HREF="bath_110.jpg">guest</A>
			bath. During the week of 1/15 Kodman paints more <A HREF="extr121a.jpg">body</A>
			and <A HREF="extr121b.jpg">trim</A>; Young tiles parts of the <A HREF="mbath121.jpg">master</A>
			and <A HREF="gbath121.jpg">guest</A> baths and the <A HREF="firep121.jpg">fireplace</A>
			trim; kitchen and bath <A HREF="cabnt121.jpg">cabinets</A> are delivered; and Susan
			and our friend Kay shop for many of our <A HREF="lites120.jpg">light</A> fixtures.
			During the weeks of 1/22 and 1/29 cabinets are installed and <A HREF="foyer122.jpg">floor</A>
			and kitchen <A HREF="kitch129.jpg">countertop</A> tiling are underway.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>December, 2000 - On 12/2 California Sewage <A HREF="sewg1202.jpg">backfills</A>
			the septic system and spreads some of the remaining decomposed granite for a temporary
			<A HREF="driv1202.jpg">driveway</A>. On 12/3-4 Rick does pickup drywall <A HREF="shrk1204.jpg">nailing</A>
			on studs missed by the hangers. During the week of 12/4 rough taping is <A HREF="shrk1206.jpg">completed</A>
			and the mud is allowed to dry. On 12/14 the <A HREF="garg1214.jpg">garage</A> doors
			are installed and on 12/16 the drywall is sprayed with <A HREF="txtr1216.jpg">texture</A>.
			During the week of 12/18 <A HREF="edor1219.jpg">exterior</A> and <A HREF="idor1221.jpg">interior</A>
			doors are installed along with casings, shelving, sills and <A HREF="itrm1222.jpg">baseboards</A>.
			After Christmas, the dormers and gables <A HREF="etrm1226.jpg">trim</A> is completed;
			and Kodman Painting does the interior spackle and caulk prep while Rick does drywall
			paste touchup and finishes <A HREF="clok1231.jpg">clocking</A> the arrival of the
			true first new year of the 21st century and 3rd millennium!</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>November, 2000 - During the first week, Rick strings TV and computer coax and
			other <A HREF="coax1030.jpg">cables</A> throughout the attic. On 11/3 <A HREF="PacB1103.jpg">Pacific
			Bell</A> lays a 6-pair DWID and Rick installs 300' of <A HREF="cond1103.jpg">conduit</A>
			for future power to the old well pump. On 11/7 we vote and watch the election results.
			<A HREF="Fla_vote.jpg">:)</A> On 11/10 Sloan <A HREF="fill1110.jpg">backfills</A>
			and compacts the power and gas line trenches. During the week of 11/13, Arcade Insulation
			<A HREF="insu1114.jpg">does</A> its thing, and Clovis Drywall measures and <A HREF="shrk1116.jpg">marks</A>
			for sheetrock. On 11/22 <A HREF="ston1122.jpg">gravel</A> for the septic system leach
			field, and <A HREF="shrk1122.jpg">sheetrock</A> for the walls and ceilings, are delivered.
			On 11/27 PG&amp;E pulls wire from the <A HREF="pgea1127.jpg">house</A>, with one
			<A HREF="pgeb1127.jpg">snag</A>, to the <A HREF="pgec1127.jpg">street</A>; while
			<A HREF="shrk1124.jpg">drywall</A> install is well underway. On 11/29-30 California
			Sewage digs and sets our <A HREF="sewg1129.jpg">septic</A> tank and leach lines;
			<A HREF="shrk1129.jpg">drywall</A> hanging is completed; and PG&amp;E mounts a new
			50 kva <A HREF="pge_1130.jpg">transformer</A> and heats up the underground wire to
			the meter lugs.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>October, 2000 - On 10/2 <A HREF="roof1002.jpg">roofing</A> is delivered and <A
			HREF="rear1002.jpg">siding</A> is started with a second wrap right side up. :) On
			10/3 Rick marks the electric and phone underground trenching <A HREF="usa_1003.jpg">start</A>,
			for USA to confirm there are no buried &quot;surprises&quot;; while Sierra Roofing
			gets going and more siding <A HREF="frnt1003.jpg">stuff</A> gets done. On <A HREF="frnt1004.jpg">10/4</A>
			again more siding and roofing get done. On 10/5 the guest <A HREF="tub21005.jpg">bathtub</A>
			is set, Pistacchio Pump pours the well <A HREF="pump1005.jpg">slab</A>, and more
			<A HREF="roof1005.jpg">roof</A> is done. On 10/6 roofing continues while Sloan backhoes
			our 470' utilities trench from <A HREF="pge11006.jpg">road</A> to <A HREF="pge21006.jpg">house</A>,
			and also the trench for our propane <A HREF="gas_1006.jpg">gas</A> line. Question:
			what happens when the annual Big Fresno Fair and Tellier's new house coincide? Here's
			the <A HREF="rain1010.jpg">answer</A>! Despite the muddy <A HREF="mud_1011.jpg">mess</A>,
			much gets done during the week of 10/9: Triangle Oil rolls out and pressurizes the
			propane <A HREF="gas_1009.jpg">gas line</A>, more <A HREF="side1013.jpg">siding</A>
			is installed, almost all of the <A HREF="roof1013.jpg">roof</A> is finished and Homerun
			Electric gets the <A HREF="elec1014.jpg">wiring</A> started. During the week of 10/16,
			Pistacchio sets the <A HREF="pump1018.jpg">water</A> pump and tank et al, Triangle
			sets and fills the <A HREF="gas_1018.jpg">propane</A> tank, and electric and siding
			are completed all around - <A HREF="frm1019n.jpg">north</A>, <A HREF="frm1019e.jpg">east</A>,
			<A HREF="frm1019s.jpg">south</A> and <A HREF="frm1019w.jpg">west</A>! During the
			remainder of the month the attic <A HREF="hotw1025.jpg">hotwater</A> heater is installed;
			most pickup framing, e.g. the master <A HREF="bath1026.jpg">bath</A> tub and shower,
			is completed; Homerun lays the 3&quot; PG&amp;E <A HREF="PGE_1027.jpg">conduit</A>;
			and the gas <A HREF="fire1027.jpg">fireplace</A> is rough set.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>September, 2000 - 9/1 starts with early morning <A HREF="rain91.jpg">rain</A>
			(about two months ahead of usual); it stops and framers come midmorning for a few
			hours of roof braces, sub-fascia, gables and porch <A HREF="hips91.jpg">hips</A>
			work. On Labor Day (9/4) Rick drives to San Francisco to enjoy a baseball game with
			Tiekka at the new <A HREF="pacbell.jpg">Pacific Bell Park</A>. He returns on <A HREF="hous0905.jpg">9/5</A>
			to see that the front roof sheathing is done. On 9/6 some more <A HREF="hous0906.jpg">shear
			walls</A> are put up, and <A HREF="side0906.jpg">siding</A> is delivered and promptly
			checked by our chief inspector, &quot;Mama&quot; cat. On 9/7 our <A HREF="patio907.jpg">patio
			roof</A> is framed and Susan brings home <A HREF="susan907.jpg">samples</A> of cabinets,
			carpets, tiles, linoleum and paint. On 9/8 the <A HREF="dorms908.jpg">dormers</A>
			(lightwells) are positioned. Over the weekend <A HREF="frame910.jpg">more framing</A>
			is done, and we have an inaugural <A HREF="picnic.jpg">picnic</A> with great friends
			Kay and Chuck, who have always helped as and since we bought this property. The week
			of 9/11 is very slow in <A HREF="shear912.jpg">framing</A> progress, although some
			more <A HREF="plumb912.jpg">plumbing</A> does get done despite that. Rick, ever the
			manic/ depressive, is on the phone every day trying to keep things moving. The week
			of 9/18 hums: most of the <A HREF="wndws924.jpg">windows</A> and <A HREF="ducts924.jpg">heat/air</A>
			mechanics, and all <A HREF="xdoor924.jpg">exterior door</A> frames, are installed;
			and the remaining framing is basically completed, including <A HREF="shlvs924.jpg">plant
			shelves</A> and pony walls, <A HREF="skylt924.jpg">skylights</A> and <A HREF="litwl924.jpg">lightwells</A>,
			and the <A HREF="chmny924.jpg">fireplace</A> housing and chimney stack. The week
			of 9/25 is slow and problematic: nothing gets done until Friday afternoon, when the
			remaining windows are installed, but the one that is supposed to be <A HREF="ntmpr929.jpg">tempered</A>
			glass isn't. On Saturday, <A HREF="patio930.jpg">soffit</A> is nailed to the patio
			roof before wiring is done for ceiling fans; and two walls of the garage are wrapped
			<A HREF="wrap930.jpg">upside down</A>. :(</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>August, 2000 - On 8/1 Anderson lays wire <A HREF="wiremesh.jpg">mesh</A> over
			the plastic and sand after Homerun Electric installs conduits to floor <A HREF="florelec.jpg">outlets</A>
			and to the <A HREF="wellelec.jpg">well</A>; and more <A HREF="gargsand.jpg">sand</A>
			is delivered for the <A HREF="gargwatr.jpg">garage</A> area. On 8/2 Anderson sets
			leveling <A HREF="slabstak.jpg">stakes</A>; Valley <A HREF="wellpres.jpg">pressure-tests</A>
			the entire water system including the 2-inch well pipe; and later Rick keeps the
			sand and dirt <A HREF="watrsand.jpg">wet</A>. On 8/3 at the crack of dawn the first
			of five <A HREF="frsttruk.jpg">concrete</A> truckloads arrives and <A HREF="frstpour.jpg">footers</A>
			and house and garage <A HREF="midpour.jpg">slabs</A> are poured throughout the day;
			also the well trench is <A HREF="wellbkfl.jpg">backfilled</A>. On 8/8 Anderson pours
			the <A HREF="ptiopour.jpg">patio</A> and <A HREF="prchpour.jpg">porch</A> - the concrete
			is <A HREF="slabdone.jpg">done</A>! On 8/10 a truckload of <A HREF="lumbr810.jpg">lumber</A>
			is delivered by Holt. On 8/15 Kenner Construction starts to <A HREF="chlkwall.jpg">chalk</A>
			the walls. On 8/18 <A HREF="frame818.jpg">framers</A> pick up the pace and our <A
			HREF="firstwal.jpg">first wall</A> goes up! Over the weekend (8/19-20) we <A HREF="chalk820.jpg">chalk</A>
			some last-minute changes to the floorplan. On <A HREF="frame821.jpg">8/21</A>, <A
			HREF="frame822.jpg">8/22</A>, <A HREF="frame823.jpg">8/23</A>, <A HREF="frame824.jpg">8/24</A>
			(Holt delivers the <A HREF="truss824.jpg">trusses</A> today), and <A HREF="frame825.jpg">8/25</A>
			the walls are completely framed and plumbed to vertical. On 8/28 a <A HREF="crane828.jpg">crane</A>
			lays the trusses on top of the walls and the <A HREF="truss828.jpg">south</A> span
			is rolled. On 8/29 the <A HREF="truss829.jpg">garage</A> is rolled while Rick discusses
			with SCH whether the <A HREF="highspan.jpg">highspan</A> trusses as drafted are sufficient
			in number and positioned properly. On 8/30 the first <A HREF="shear830.jpg">shear</A>
			wall is done along with some sub-fascia while awaiting two additional highspan <A
			HREF="truss830.jpg">trusses</A>. On 8/31 the highspan and north trusses are rolled
			- <A HREF="truss831.jpg">all trusses</A> are up!</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>July, 2000 - Finally, on 7/3, our building <A HREF="permit.jpg">permit</A> is
			issued! On 7/12 the <A HREF="sign.jpg">sign</A> goes up and lot <A HREF="bobcat.jpg">leveling</A>
			begins by Anderson Concrete, including our <A HREF="watering.jpg">sprinkling</A>
			to soften the clay soil that's hard as a brick. On 7/15 we <A HREF="chalked.jpg">chalk</A>
			the house location for all eternity and Expert Trenching does the <A HREF="expert.jpg">footers</A>.
			On 7/17 Anderson sets the perimeter <A HREF="forms.jpg">forms</A>. On 7/19 Valley
			Plumbing marks the septic drain lines; and on 7/21 Sloan Backhoe Service <A HREF="draindig.jpg">digs</A>
			them; and on 7/22 Valley rough <A HREF="drainpip.jpg">plumbs</A> them. On 7/26 perhaps
			the most important site prep <A HREF="portolet.jpg">facility</A> is delivered ;)
			and the drain lines pass county inspection and Valley does the first of two days
			of water rough <A HREF="plumb726.jpg">plumbing</A> while Anderson starts prep for
			concrete pour. On 7/27 Anderson sends <A HREF="sandpile.jpg">sand</A> for under concrete
			slab, Valley finishes rough <A HREF="plumb727.jpg">plumbing</A>, we connect a <A
			HREF="hose_in.jpg">hose</A> into house pipes to <A HREF="pressure.jpg">pressurize</A>
			the lines, and another <A HREF="hose_out.jpg">out</A> to purge them and water a <A
			HREF="tree.jpg">tree</A> in the process. On 7/31 Anderson spreads <A HREF="plastic.jpg">plastic</A>
			and <A HREF="mainsand.jpg">sand</A> while Rick runs temporary electric power from
			the old circuit breaker <A HREF="breakers.jpg">panel</A> via overhead <A HREF="tempwire.jpg">wire</A>
			to a ground-fault <A HREF="gfoutlet.jpg">outlet</A> in preparation for the framers.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>July 1, 2000 - A scary aspect of country living in the San Joaquin Valley in summer:
			a vulture tries to land on PG&amp;E transmission lines and flames to the ground,
			starting a grass <A HREF="smoke.jpg">fire</A> about 1/4 mile south of us. Quickly
			California Department of Forestry spotter <A HREF="plane.jpg">plane</A> and water-bucket
			<A HREF="helicptr.jpg">helicopter</A> and <A HREF="dozer.jpg">bulldozer</A> and several
			engines are on the scene, and the fire is soon <A HREF="fire_out.jpg">extinguished</A>.
			Whew!</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>May 15, 2000 - We continue to await final plans and permits to break ground. Perhaps
			in two weeks or so? Meantime, we again have <A HREF="visitors.html">visitors</A>
			coming by each day to help keep the building site from getting overgrown. :)</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>April 28, 2000 - California Sewage Disposal backhoe's our septic system <A HREF="testhole.jpg">test
			hole</A> (10' deep). Looks good: all decomposed granite for fast leakage. County
			will test prior to issuing building permit.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>April 21-24, 2000 - Johnson Drilling Company drills our <A HREF="well.jpg">new
			well</A>. After one marginal 110' test hole, second drill results in good well: 120'
			of decomposed granite water plus 50' of hard rock water, yielding 40+ gallons per
			minute.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>February-March, 2000 - Planning progresses on revised drawings and all the other
			stuff that goes into building a new house from scratch. Meanwhile, Rick retires on
			2/22 after <A HREF="rickcard.jpg">27 years</A> of teaching and administration and
			research and service at <A HREF="http://www.csufresno.edu" target="_blank">California
			State University Fresno.</A></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>January 20, 2000 - We sign a contract to have SCH build our American Farmhouse
			with some modifications to <A HREF="floorpln.jpg">the floorplan</A>.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>December, 1999 - Susan has found a great design for &quot;The American Farmhouse&quot;
			at Sierra Custom Homes in Clovis. We drive by the one they've built to see <A HREF="newhouse.jpg">how
			it looks</A>.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>November, 1999 - All things considered, we decide to stay on our existing 20 acres
			and build a new house on a <A HREF="site.jpg">site</A> farther back from the traffic
			noise of Academy Avenue and with our great view of the Sierra Nevada.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="bluerule.jpg" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
			<P>Fall, 1999 - We decide that <A HREF="oldhouse.jpg">this old house</A> has served
			us well and it is now time to move on to something new. So, we look at both existing
			houses for sale and builders of new homes for a couple of months.
