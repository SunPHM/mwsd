      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Imagine being 
      a wild baby crane, wet and exhausted after finally breaking out of your 
      egg. How strange the world seems! With your downy feathers still wet and 
      plastered against your skin, every little breeze feels cold compared to 
      the constant warmth inside the egg. The light dazzles your eyes, and there 
      are so many bewildering sights! Everything sounds more intense now that 
      your ears aren't stopped up with fluid. It could be very scary, but you 
      know your parents are near.<BR>
      <BR>
      But who, and where, are they? You've never seen anything in your life before 
      this, and all of a sudden there are bewildering sights in every direction. 
      You can see your nest, shrubs and trees, grasses and flowers, a puffy white 
      cloud in the sky, a frog jumping right past your face, a brightly colored 
      butterfly. A duck waddles close, and suddenly two long, black legs attached 
      to a big white, feathery body with a long neck and startling face chases 
      it away in a flurry of quacks and feathers. Every sight is strange, but 
      your eyes are drawn to the gold eyes, long black beaks, and especially the 
      bare red skin on the face attached to that big, white, feathered body.</P> 
      </font><font size="2"> 
      <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Its big beak draws 
        close and tenderly takes away some jagged pieces of eggshell, and something 
        clicks. This is Mommy! For the next 10 or 11 months, this bird and one 
        who looks just like her will be the most important things in your life. 
        You will feel anxious anytime you can't see or hear them. If one of them 
        takes a step with those long legs, you will take a dozen baby steps to 
        keep up. And when one of them flies and calls to you, you will beat your 
        little wings and run to try to keep up. One day in about two months, your 
        growing wings will beat so hard that they'll pull you off the ground a 
        bit, and by the time you're three months old or so, you'll be flying strong--just 
        to keep up with your parents. <BR>

      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">baby cranes 
      learn what food to eat, how to fly, and where to migrate only because they 
      can identify their parents and try so hard to stay with them and imitate 
      them. The critical time for a baby crane to identify its parents happens 
      within the first hours of hatching. We say it gets <B>imprinted</B> on its 
      parents. And once imprinted, a crane will never accept anything else for 
      a parent. In the wild, cranes nest in large territories, isolated from other 
      cranes. Baby cranes are large and tasty. They would be in danger if they 
      stayed on the nest too long. Imprinting is a quick way of learning who their 
      parents are, so they can follow them within hours of hatching and won't 
      get lost. Imprinting is also ultimately the way cranes identify their own 
      species. Then, when they grow old enough to choose a mate, they will only 
      consider birds that look like their parents. And they will raise their own 
      babies in the same way their parents raised them.</font><BR> <BR> <HR> <FONT SIZE="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Operation

      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But what if 
      you're a baby crane hatched to be part of Operation Migration and the reintroduction 
      project? You don't see quite so many strange sights when you hatch: the 
      bars and rubber floor of your incubator, light fixtures and lab equipment. 
      The big white bodies you see don't have feathers. They don't have skinny 
      crane legs, either, but you do see what you somehow know you're supposed 
      to see--that bright red crane head. So you know you're safe, and you quickly 
      imprint on them. But they aren't really cranes. They're humans dressed in 
      billowy white costumes with a crane puppet on one hand.<BR>

      Raising baby cranes in captivity to release them into the wild is a difficult 
      and tricky task. It's important for any growing baby to feel safe and comfortable, 
      but wild cranes are in terrible danger if they come too close to humans. 
      Captive-bred baby cranes that will be released into the wild must never 
      become tame with their handlers. They must never associate hands with food, 
      or faces with love and kindness. The scientists at Operation Migration know 
      that the safest way to raise their baby cranes is to keep the babies from 
      ever seeing a human face or hands. They badly want these cranes to grow 
      up as healthy wild cranes, and eventually to mate with other wild cranes 
      and raise healthy wild babies. To give the chicks the best possible chance 
      for this, the OM folks have developed a set of rules, or a <B>protocol</B>. 
      Everyone who comes anywhere near these babies must follow that protocol.<B> 
      NO</B> exceptions! Ever!<BR>

        The pilot-scientists at Operation Migration are pioneers in leading birds 
        on migration with ultralight planes. Their experiences with geese and 
        sandhill cranes have taught them many ways to use the techniques with 
        whooping cranes. Their protocol is the result. Print and read the Operation 
        Migration's official protocol. As you read, think of possible reasons 
        why each rule is important. Note reasons in your journal or on the chalkboard 
        as you discuss them in class.</font></P>
