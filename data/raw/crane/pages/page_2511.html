<p>The <b>SANDHILL CRANE</b> inhabits marshes,grasslands and grain fields during the summer months. The female usually lays two eggs on a large mound of sticks, reeds and grass in a remote marshy area. Young birds stay with their parents for nearly a year. Food consists of amphibians, reptiles, insects and small mammals as well as fruits, grain and other fruit material. Although about the size of a Great Blue Heron, the Sandhill Crane differs in flight by flying with its neck outstretched whereas  the heron flies with its head and neck folded back to its shoulders.
