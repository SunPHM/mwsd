<H2>Urban Ecology in Illinois</H2><p><p>

When one thinks of ecology or ecosystems, the first thought to come to mind may
be dramatic, sweeping habitats, such as vast stands of tallgrass prairie
plants, river-bottom forests of cypress and tupelo, or the rugged ecosystems
associated with canyons and bluffs--all places that conjure up the sense of
"somewhere else."  All three of these habitats can be found within the
boundaries of Illinois-- the Midewin tallgrass prairie near Joliet, to the
Cache River floodplain forests of southern Illinois, to the canyons and bluffs
of Apple River Canyon and the Mississippi Palisades.  But ecology isn't
restricted to pristine habitats or "somewhere else."  Sometimes ecology happens
in our own backyard or in places that might be unexpected--such as large urban
areas.<p>
The greater Chicago area is one such area in Illinois.  Encompassing much of
the six counties in the northeastern part of the state, greater than 200,000
acres of habitats are protected.  Many of these habitats exist in Illinois only
within the greater Chicago area, and others are well represented within that
array of protected sites.  The term "Chicago Wilderness"--a partnership of over
60 public and private organizations--is not an oxymoron.  Instead, it reflects
the fact that there are thriving areas within the greater urban and suburban
setting, sheltering nearly 200 plants and animals that are listed as threatened
or endangered in the state, and that numerous organizations in the state care
about the ecology of urban areas and the species they contain.<p>

Although there are many beneficial ecological interactions in urban and
suburban settings, those areas also are often so disturbed that they are prone
to ecological problems--whether the disappearance of habitats or degradation of
them due to human activities, or just the proximity of urban areas to other
habitats.  For example, aquatic areas near cities are home to mosquitoes that
can carry diseases, such as West Nile encephalitis that occurred in New York
last year.  Disturbed urban forests and aquatic habitats have been ripe for
invasions by exotic plants, such as garlic mustard or purple loosestrife;
exotic aquatic organisms, such as round gobies and zebra mussels; or exotic
insects, such as Asian longhorned beetles or gypsy moths.  Invasions of urban
areas are not limited solely to exotic species:  our backyards, forest
preserves, and other green areas have been invaded by more familiar species,
such as Canada Geese and white-tailed deer.  <p>
In this issue of Illinois Natural History Survey Reports, we highlight ongoing
INHS research and outreach projects that can be collected under the umbrella of
"urban ecology."  Survey scientists from all disciplines are studying the
interactions of plants <br><br> <STRONG>View of Chicago looking north from<br>

The studies
reported here range from particular species to habitats to entire ecosystems.
The report on energy and resource use and the "ecological footprint" of urban
areas illustrates a crucial concept for long-term urban planning and "smart
growth" of our state.  A report on the wise and perhaps paradoxical development
and restoration of wild and natural areas in the Calumet area of southeastern
Chicago illustrates how once-maligned and abused habitats can remain vital and
even be restored, as long as they are not paved and fragmented.  <p>

Northeastern Illinois is the remaining stronghold in the state for the
endangered Yellow-headed Blackbird.  Suburban housing and office-park
developments with appropriate wetlands may provide significant habitat for this
colorful avian marsh dweller.  Other wildlife, such as white-tailed deer, have
benefited from the extensive urban forest preserve systems, vastly increasing
deer populations.  As reported here, deer can cause habitat degradation and
even harm to humans by colliding with autos and by hosting the tick vectors of
Lyme and other human diseases.  Yet, controlling deer populations in an
ecologically sustainable manner brings habitat managers into conflict with
urban humans.  <p>
The extensive aquatic areas near urban habitats--many urban areas are situated
on lakes or rivers due to trade--provide environmental recreation, but also
potential environmental nightmares due to exotic invaders.  The invaders also
threaten the extensive urban forest, as the article about Asian longhorned
beetles attests.  Even landscape plantings and home gardens are subjects of
ecological studies and outreach--studies that can enhance the health of
landscape plants that provide shade and other benefits to homeowners and
outreach that teaches gardeners about ways to reduce use of pesticides in their
own backyards.  <p>
While this issue may seem to vary from the usual presentation of studies of
wild and natural places in Illinois, we hope you recognize that these ongoing
research and outreach efforts are valuable additions to the understanding of an
increasingly significant part of the Illinois landscape.  Far from oxymoronic,
the issue of urban ecology is alive and an important part of the Survey's
mission, and crucial to the wise use of the state's natural resources.<p>
