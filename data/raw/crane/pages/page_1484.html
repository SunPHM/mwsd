            Minn., U.S.A.-The second of two ships bringing several enormous pieces 
            of equipment built in Japan and destined for Canada via record-setting 
            rail shipments arrived in the Port of Duluth-Superior Thursday, December 
            7, aboard the Dutch vessel Fairlift.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            The unique Rotterdam-based vessel arrived under the Duluth Aerial 
            Lift Bridge at 11:45 p.m. She proceeded to Duluth's Clure Public Marine 
            Terminal with equipment destined for the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, 
            a $3.5 billion oil sands mine, extraction and upgrading development 
            currently under construction in northern Alberta.</font></p>

            a heavy-lift shipping company headquartered in Rotterdam, arranged 
            for arrival of the equipment via two ships outfitted with deck cranes 
            capable of handling heavy loads. This shipment is from Muroran and 
            Kobe, Japan, as was the first shipment, which arrived in Port October 
            13 aboard Jumbo's vessel Stellanova.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            Lake Superior Warehousing Co., Inc., will offload 56 pieces of equipment 
            from the Fairlift, seven of which weigh in excess of 500 tons. The 
            first shipment of 36 pieces contained five<img src="../images2000/fairlift-201211-121.jpg" width="400" height="337" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"> 
            in excess of 500 tons. The largest pieces measure approximately 14 
            feet (about four meters) in diameter and 75 feet (twenty-two meters) 
            in length.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            The majority of the equipment will be transferred onto special12-axle 
            railcars, only 28 of which are available in North America. Sixteen 
            of these cars will be used for this shipment (twelve were used for 
            the first shipment). The remainder of the equipment will be moved 
            by truck.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            &quot;These shipments represent the largest multiple loads ever carried 
            over U.S. and Canadian railways,&quot; said Ed Clarke, materials management 
            representative for Fluor Daniel Canada, Inc., transportation contractor 
            for the project.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            &quot;Duluth was selected as the North American port of entry because 
            of a combination of its excellent facilities for dimensional cargoes 
            and the rail clearances between the Port and the job site.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

            equipment is scheduled to be shipped December 14 on the Burlington 
            Northern Santa Fe Railroad from Duluth, and the Canadian National 
            to Alberta. The first shipment of equipment departed the Port via 
            rail on October 13 and arrived in northern Alberta on October 29.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            Lake Superior Warehousing Co., Inc., has established an excellent 
            reputation for handling heavy-lift cargoes. This November alone the 
            company handled turbine generator equipment from Sweden destined for 
            Chaska, Minn.; dimensional ductwork from Bremen, Germany, destined 
            for Trimont, Minn.; an apron conveyor system manufactured in Bremen 
            needed for a crane being built in Alberta, Canada; two 86-ton pieces 
            of a stone crusher manufactured in Pennsylvania and destined for an 
            oil sands project in Alberta.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            In the past few years Lake Superior Warehousing has been chosen as 
            the conduit for such large projects as oil rig equipment built in 
            Canada and bound for Stavanger, Norway; pulp mill machinery from Finland 
            destined for Potlatch Corporation as part of its $500 million dollar 
            expansion in Cloquet, Minn.; piping manufactured by Duluth's BendTec, 
            Inc., destined for the Island of Sumbawa in the Indonesian Archipelago 
            as part of a gold mine project.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            &quot;Duluth is known as a 'can-do' port,&quot; said Gary Nicholson, 
            Lake Superior Warehousing president. &quot;Clearances for oversize 
            loads from Duluth are often the best available whether the product 
            is moving via rail or truck. Coupled with the strong work ethic of 
            Lake Superior Warehousing's employees, shippers of oversized cargo 
            are provided with a powerful combination of reasons for choosing Duluth.&quot;</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            The largest single loads carried on North American railroads also 
            moved through the Port of Duluth-Superior. In October 1990 two Japanese-built 
            cylinders destined for the BiProvincial Upgrader oil project in Lloydminster, 
            Saskatchewan, arrived at the Clure Public Marine Terminal aboard the 
            Dutch vessel Starman Asia. The 773-ton cylinders were transported 
            to Canada on the Asea Brown Boveri 36-axle Schnabel car, the world's 
            largest capacity railcar according to the Association of American 
            Railroads.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            The 329-foot (100-meter) long Fairlift, built in 1990 at Ysselwerf 
            B.V., Capelle aan den IJssel, Netherlands, is a heavy-load carrier 
            owned by Fairplay Heavy Lift B.V., Rotterdam. The 314-foot (96-meter) 
            long heavy-load carrier Stellanova was built in 1996 at the same shipyard. 
            She is owned by Kahn Shipping, Ltd., Rotterdam. Local agent for both 
            vessels is Guthrie-Hubner, Inc., Duluth.</font></p>

            The Athabasca Oil Sands Project, scheduled for completion in the fall 
            of 2002, involves removing sand from the earth that is impregnated 
            with oil, separating the two and then using new technology to upgrade 
            the oil to a usable product.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            Athabasca Oil Sands Project officials indicate that the three targeted 
            reserves of oil contain more oil than the entire reserves left in 
            Saudi Arabia. Officials say the synthetic crude produced will enable 
            refiners to generate very clean, high quality gasoline and diesel 
            fuel with low sulphur levels.</font></p>
