For a very long time, it has been a dream of mine to produce a picture book on the sandhill crane, a mystical and revered creature, the most ancient of bird species on the globe, and an ambassador for wetland habitats throughout much of North America.<br><br>
 Through generous private donor support, sponsorship from the International Crane Foundation, and help from a number of scientists, conservationists and friends, the book is slowly beginning to take shape and become a reality. The book will celebrate the species and the diverse wetland habitats in which it resides from as far north as Alaska to as far south as Cuba. The photographs will focus primarily on the sandhill crane's natural history and their habitats, but also will point towards the role the species plays in conservation, sometimes for it's own sake, sometimes for the sake of others.<br><br>
The book's introduction will be written by a good friend, George Archibald, a world wildlife fund gold medal recipient, tireless conservationist, and the foremost crane biologist of his time. It will also feature several short "notes from the field" type essays, giving a glimpse into this several year photographic journey.<br><br>
Ultimately, I hope that this book educates and  inspires, relating in pictures and words the true value of these birds, and forwards the cause of crane and wetland conservation worldwide. Although a publisher has not yet been named, we look to a release date of late 2003 or early 2004. Please stay tuned and check back from time to time as the work on the project progresses.
