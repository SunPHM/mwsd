Every day we're making our young fly farther to strengthen their wings. Tomorrow we're starting our trip to our wintering grounds.

                <b><font size="3">O</font></b>ctober 12th<br>We're flying towards the biggest fork of the Missouri River near Pierre, South Dakota. After we arrived, we decided to replenish our supply of food. This is Indian country and we asked the locales where the richest wetlands could be found. When we finished fishing it was time for lunch so we invited some of the Indians to share our bounty of freshly caught shellfish, In thanks, the Indians shared berries and seeds with us.

                <b><font size="3">O</font></b>ctober 22nd<br>We were flying over the northern border of Kansas when a biologist and radio tracker shot me. The rest of my family kept flying and didn't notice that I was missing. If I didn't feel dead I would have let out a load warning cry. The biologist waited 'til I was sedated then he put the radio tracking device on my leg.<br><br>Ten hours later around Hays, Kansas when the rest of my family were getting ready for the night they realized I was lost. But I was already in the air, though I wouldn't catch up with them for a couple of days.I'm happy to report that the tracking device didn't slow me down while flying.

                <b><font size="3">O</font></b>ctober 30th<br>We've made it as far as Oklahoma City. The food pickings are slim around town because of all the development and the summer-long drought. It looks like we might have to stay an extra couple of days to refuel.

                <b><font size="3">N</font></b>ovember 12th<br>We finally reached the Gulf of Mexico and located our territory. We let out a big "Whoop!" so the other pairs in the area would know that we had arrived. That night we had a delicious feast of blue crabs and celebrated our safe arrival.

                <b><font size="3">N</font></b>otes:<br>Endangered whooping cranes migrate approximately two thousand six hundred miles over two months.  The Texas-Canada population had 185 birds in 2002.  Much of their wetland habitat has been drained for farmland and pasture. In March 2003 I was lucky enough to see the whooping cranes at their wintering grounds in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.  They were quieter than I thought they would be.  I was surprised at how white their feathers were.   I was also surprised by how much time they spent feeding, which was all the time we were watching them. I hope that the whooping cranes can expand their range and increase their population.
