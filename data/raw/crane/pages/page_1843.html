					Taking his base from his instruction in Crane Boxing, Xie Zhong Xiang continued to study 
					and to develop his martial art. It is said that he studied at a Shaolin Temple in the 
					mountains of the Fujian Province. During much of his life, he was forced to conceal his 
					identity due to his family name and status. Xie Zhong Xiang spent his days, and made his 
					living, working as a bricklayer and a builder in his younger years. Later in his life he 
					used cane and bamboo to produce a variety of household goods like baskets and furniture, 
					trying to blend in with the working class in the Fujian society.
				</p>

					From his home, Xie Zhong worked with his cane and bamboo on the first floor and had his 
					living space on the second floor. He taught martial arts to a very small group of students 
					in his home. It was at sometime during these years that the master was given the name Ryu 
					Ryu Ko. There is much confusion introduced by this name. Some say that the name Ryu Ryu Ko 
					is a Japanese translation of the Chinese Xie Zhong Xiang. There are several other historians 
					who - more plausibly - say that Ryu Ryu Ko is a nickname given to protect the true identity 
					of his aristocratic ancestry. There are two versions available to validate this theory. 
					In one, the translation of the name means "great, o very honorable master", while the other 
					means "to proceed the brother". Either of these seems viable considering the life of Xiang. 
					Adding to the confusion of the facts, it is written that Xie Zhong Xiang produced a son who 
					was also a martial arts master. This son was called Xie Tzu Xiang. The Chinese pronunciation 
					of the two names was so close that it has become increasingly difficult to differentiate 
					the facts attributable to the father and son.
				</p>
				<p>
					Xiang continued to teach from his home for several years. Many students from Okinawa eventually 
					sought out the great master. Sometime after opening his school, Xiang took on an assistant 
					named Wai Shin Zan. In 1883 Xie Zhong Xiang had opened a public school of martial arts in 
					Fuzhou with his assistant. From this point, we can trace the lineage of White Crane into 
					Okinawa and other parts of the world.
				</p>
				<div align="center"><img src="/images/bios/xiang/lineage.gif" width="480" height="360" border="0"></div>
				<p>
					Each of these students of Xiang has passed the art on to many more generations of masters, e
					specially the Okinawan student Higashionna. It is said that Higashionna studied with Xie Zhong 
					for fourteen years before returning to his homeland and opening his own school in 1905. 
					This lineage is by no means complete, but attempts to give some sense of the influence the 
					First Generation Master, Xie Zhong Xiang, has had on martial arts all over the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					While his life history is not easily accessible, the influence that Xie Zhong Xiang or Ryu Ryu 
					Ko had on Karate is documented in every written word that can still be found today.<br>
