      <H3>&nbsp;Description</H3>

      <P>Standing 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall, the whooping crane is the
      tallest bird in North America. Boasting a snowy white body and
      thin black legs, it has a long, pointed beak, a long neck, and
      a white and black head with a red crown. It has immense, black-tipped
      wings that allow it to glide with little effort and stay aloft
      for up to 10 hours at a time.</P>

      <H3>Ecology</H3>

      <P>Whooping cranes migrate north from their wintering grounds
      in March and April. They breed in the boreal wetlands of Canada's
      Wood Buffalo National Park. The nest is usually a flat-topped
      mound of vegetation in shallow water. The female lays one clutch
      per year which usually consists of two eggs, but most often only
      one chick will fledge. Both adults incubate the eggs and raise
      the young. Whooping cranes feed on crustaceans, fish, small mammals,
      insects, roots, berries, and grain. They begin migrating south
      in early September.</P>

      <H3>Causes of Decline</H3>

      <P>Historically, the whooping crane ranged from an area near
      the Arctic Circle south to central Mexico and from Utah east
      to the Atlantic coast. Having once numbered at least 10,000 birds,
      by the late 1800s the total global population had decreased to
      an estimated 1,500 individuals and continued to decrease. The
      decline was due to hunting, egg collection, and habitat disturbances
      such as conversion of wetlands for agriculture. By 1941, global
      whooping crane numbers had sunk to a low of 22 birds. Of these,
      16 birds comprised a migratory flock that bred at Wood Buffalo
      National Park in Canada and wintered at the Aransas National
      Wildlife Refuge in southern Texas. A remnant population of six
      non-migratory whooping cranes existed in Louisiana, but by 1949
      this population died out.</P>

      <P>Human activities, such as poaching and development, continue
      to be chief threats to whooping cranes. Their migration corridor
      is undergoing continuous industrial development, causing incidents
      such as fatal collisions with power lines. During the breeding
      season, a drought or bad storm could destroy eggs and newly hatched
      chicks. On the wintering grounds, oil and chemical pollution
      in the bays along the Texas coast could destroy the remaining
      habitat, while a hurricane could wipe out the entire flock. In
      the winter of 2000/2001, there were approximately 180 birds in
      the Wood Buffalo-Aransas flock.</P>

      <H3>Research and Recovery</H3>

      <P>In the late 1940s, government agencies in Canada and the United
      States began actively sharing data and expertise to prevent the
      extinction of the whooping crane. In 1967, the Canadian Wildlife
      Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service launched a whooping
      crane captive-breeding program for release into the wild. Scientists
      transported eggs from Wood Buffalo National Park by air 3,453
      kilometers (2,145 miles) to the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center
      in Laurel, Maryland. In 1989, a whooping crane breeding facility
      was established at the International Crane Foundation in Wisconsin.</P>

      <P>Canadian biologists created a captive-breeding facility at
      the Calgary Zoo in 1993, the same year U.S. officials began establishing
      a non-migratory flock in Florida using cranes from the U.S. and
      Canadian facilities. In 1996, after 230 eggs had been collected,
      biologists discontinued egg collection for captive rearing. The
      flock in Florida numbers about 80 birds, but has yet to successfully
      raise young. In the spring of 2000, one pair hatched two eggs,
      the first whooping crane eggs to hatch in the wild in the United
      States in 60 years. One of the chicks died within two weeks.
      The parents raised the other to fledging age, before it fell
      prey to a bobcat.</P>

      <P>Since 1990, the United States has helped Canadian scientists
      conduct aerial surveys on the cranes' reproductive success on
      the nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park. In the spring
      of 2000, they discovered 50 nests, tying the record for the most
      ever found in one spring. In 1993, scientists began tracking
      sandhill crane migratory routes to identify their wintering areas
      and determine whether sandhill cranes could be used as guide
      birds for whooping cranes. Since 1993, scientists have been using
      ultralight aircraft to teach a specific migration route to surrogate
      sandhill cranes. Biologists also initiated studies into potential
      crane reintroduction habitat in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Wisconsin,
      hoping to eventually establish a new Wisconsin-Florida migratory
      flock of whooping cranes.</P>

      <P>For 15 years, Canada and the United States have conducted
      formal joint recovery efforts. In 1985, the two countries signed
      a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to improve coordination and
      joint cooperation in whooping crane conservation. The document
      has been renewed in 1990 and 1995. The 1995 renewal confirmed
      a goal of increasing whooping crane numbers in the Wood Buffalo-Aransas
      flock to one thousand individuals (an objective first established
      in the species' 1994 U.S. recovery plan). Officials expect to
      renew the MOU in 2001. In 1996, Canada and the United States
      formed a joint Whooping Crane Recovery Team that meets once every
      year or two. The team consists of five members from each country.
      Whooping crane recovery plans in the two countries are currently
      being combined into a single plan.&nbsp;</P>

      <H3>Description</H3>
      <P>The piping plover is a small, stocky, sandy-colored bird with 
      yellow-orange legs, and resembles a sandpiper. In summer, the plover 
      develops breeding plumage with a black band across the forehead from eye 
      to eye and a black ring around the base of its neck. In winter, these 
      marks are absent (see photo). Like other plovers, it runs in short bursts. 
      The bird derives its name from its call notes, plaintive bell-like 
      whistles that are often heard before the bird is seen.</P>
	  
      <H3>Ecology</H3>
      <P>Piping plovers arrive on their breeding grounds during mid-March 
      through mid-May and leave again by late August. They breed on the northern 
      Great Plains, including the Canadian prairies, and along the Atlantic 
      coast from Newfoundland to North Carolina. They also breed along the U.S. 
      shores of the Great Lakes. They winter on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico 
      coasts from North Carolina to Mexico, in the Bahamas, West Indies, and in 
      Cuba. In 1996, there were nearly 6,000 breeding individuals throughout the 
      plover's range, including 20 States, 9 Provinces, and the French islands 
      of St-Pierre-Miquelon off Newfoundland's southern coast.</P>
      <P>Piping plovers lay three to four eggs in shallow depressions lined with 
      light-colored pebbles. The eggs are speckled with dark brown or black 
      spots that make them scarcely distinguishable from the pebbles. Both 
      partners incubate the eggs, which hatch within 26 to 28 days. Both sexes 
      also tend to the chicks during feeding and resting, and continue to 
      safeguard them until they can fly, at about 25 days.</P>
	  
      <H3>Causes of Decline</H3>
      <P>Historically, habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development 
      were the major contributors to this species' decline. The plover is now 
      threatened largely by predation. Gulls, crows, raccoons, and skunks (all 
      predators that thrive around human development) prey on plover eggs and 
      young. Another significant threat is from human recreation. Walking, 
      jogging, and operating vehicles on beaches prevent plovers from feeding, 
      flush them from roost sites, and destroy camouflaged eggs. Similar threats 
      face the plover on its wintering grounds.</P>

      <H3>Research and Recovery</H3>
      <P>Since 1988, Canadian and U.S. wildlife experts have shared information 
      regularly about piping plover conservation strategies, such as beach 
      guardian programs. Scientists exchange technical knowledge on banding, 
      capture techniques, census methods and results, predator management, and 
      all aspects of management of breeding and wintering populations. An 
      International Piping Plover Coordination Group, comprised of Canadian and 
      U.S. biologists, also facilitates information exchange and is coordinating 
      recovery efforts.</P>
      <P>This exchange of information has led biologists in both countries to 
      employ innovative recovery methods. In breeding areas, experts direct 
      human traffic around the fragile nests on beaches and erect wire fencing 
      around nests to keep predators out. On the Great Plains water bodies, such 
      as the Missouri River in the United States and Lake Diefenbaker in Canada, 
      officials try to maintain water levels conducive to plover nesting. The 
      two countries also exchange biologists to assist with specific projects. 
      The United States sent two biologists to Canada in the mid-1990s to help 
      resolve problems with predator exclosures in Nova Scotia. In 1998, a 
      Canadian biologist participated in a review of wintering habitat issues in 
      Texas. In 1994, the United States sent four biologists to help census 
      plovers in Atlantic Canada.</P>
      <P>In 1991 and 1996, wildlife officials from each country participated in 
      two international censuses of breeding and wintering plovers. These 
      censuses gave the first global population counts for the plover. More than 
      a thousand biologists and volunteers from several countries participated 
      in the census, including many government agencies and conservation groups. 
      The results indicated that the plover's status remains precarious due to 
      its low population numbers, sparse distribution, continued threats to 
      habitat, and low reproductive success throughout its range.</P>

      <H3>Description</H3>
      <P>The marbled murrelet is a quail-sized bird with a plump body. It swims 
      with its bill pointed upward, and flies in zigzags low over the water. 
      Like most migratory birds, the marbled murrelet has different breeding and 
      wintering plumages. The breeding plumage is dull brown on top, with 
      "marbled" brown and white underparts. In winter, the bird is black with 
      white on its throat, white shoulder patches, and white underparts. In 
      autumn, the young resemble the adults in winter plumage, but the 
      underparts have fine dusky bars.</P>
	  
      <H3>Ecology</H3>
      <P>The marbled murrelet is an unusual seabird. It prefers to nest high in 
      the well-hidden canopy of old-growth forests. By contrast, most seabirds 
      nest in large colonies in burrows and crevices on offshore islands. In the 
      northern part of its range, the murrelet nests in trees but also on the 
      ground in treeless areas. Each May, adult marbled murrelets fly inland as 
      far as 80 kilometers (50 miles) to nest. The birds are solitary nesters, 
      and lay their single egg in a cup-shaped depression in thick mosses found 
      on large branches. Both males and females incubate the egg in 24-hour 
      shifts. While one incubates the egg, the other stays on the ocean, and 
      flies back to the nest to feed the chick and change places with its mate. 
      Once the egg hatches, they change places and feed the chick more 
      frequently. The exchanges are most common in the early morning and in the 
      evening. After the nesting season, marbled murrelets fish the coastal 
      waters of the North Pacific throughout the fall. In more northern 
      latitudes, they are usually forced farther out to sea in the winter by 
      coastal ice formation and the limited availability of small fish.</P>
      <H3>Causes of Decline</H3>
      <P>In the United States, the marbled murrelet occurs along the Pacific 
      coast from the Canadian border to northern California, as well as in 
      Alaska. In Canada, it is found off the coast of British Columbia and 
      around coastal lakes. The estimated population is 301,000 in the United 
      States and 50,000 to 60,000 in Canada. Major threats to the marbled 
      murrelet are oil spills, their incidental catch in commercial fishery 
      nets, and the destruction of habitat due to timber operations. Old-growth 
      forest harvesting removes the bird's nesting habitat, while the toxic 
      effects of leaked oil have directly killed thousands of marbled 
      murrelets.&nbsp;</P>

      <H3>Research and Recovery</H3>
      <P>Since the mid-1980s, Canadian and U.S. wildlife biologists have 
      cooperated on marbled murrelet conservation and recovery issues. In 1972, 
      scientists created an international organization called the Pacific 
      Seabird Group to undertake seabird research and conservation. The group 
      established a Marbled Murrelet Technical Committee in 1988 that includes 
      Canadian and U.S. representatives. The committee meets annually to share 
      information on recovery issues and the conservation status of marbled 
      murrelets in the United States and Canada. The committee coordinates an 
      ongoing effort to develop and update an inland survey protocol for marbled 
      murrelets in British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington. Marbled 
      murrelets are secretive and difficult to detect at inland forest stands, 
      and a reliable survey technique is important for identifying nesting 
      areas.</P>
      <P>In Canada, scientists are also focusing recovery efforts on searching 
      for murrelet nesting sites. Officials impose interim habitat protection 
      measures in areas where nests are known to exist. Various forest companies 
      on Vancouver Island have voluntarily deferred harvesting old-growth 
      habitats used by marbled murrelets. As part of the U.S. and Canadian 
      recovery efforts, biologists are emphasizing the need to reduce marbled 
      murrelet mortality from net fisheries in the marine environment. The U.S. 
      Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Wildlife Service are 
      collaborating to devise methods to assess the number of marbled murrelets 
      caught in commercial fishing nets, and subsequently to reduce the 
      incidental net entanglement of marbled murrelets.</P>
