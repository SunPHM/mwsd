Were Hitler to somehow step out of his bunker, which lies buried intact beneath the construction cranes of Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, were he to gaze upon what was once his city and his people, he would be disturbed indeed.<BR>
<BR>
Berlin is a city of ethnic minorities, decaying buildings, new buildings, international jet-setters, left-wing radicals, western capitalism, communist relics, graffiti and thousands of other items that contradict Nazi ideology. He would see a country whose major cities were totally destroyed and rebuilt in the 1950s, some more successfully than others. He would see a pluralistic society with so many different voices and people, a society with so many contradictions<NOBR> -</NOBR> the old and new, left and right, remembered and forgotten<NOBR> -</NOBR> to the point of public schizophrenia.<BR>
<BR>
And while he might crack a smile at a few things and congratulate himself here and there, I can hardly imagine his expression when he sees the Jewish music festival, or the newly rebuilt synagogue in Berlin, the Jews flocking here from Eastern Europe, or a Jewish novelist reading to a large audience, a play in Yiddish, or me<NOBR> -</NOBR> a student and a Jew living comfortably in his favorite city of all, Munich.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most contradictory to the Nazi ideology is the small but quickly regrowing Jewish community here, composed of German Jews who remained after the war, immigrants from Eastern Europe, students and other long-term visitors. It was this community with which I hoped to establish contact during a recent visit to Berlin. I knew that my stay would not be long enough for me to become a participant, but I only wanted to be an observer.<BR>
<BR>
My first day in the city, I borrowed a bike from a friend in the East and started riding west. I found my way to the main boulevard of eastern Berlin, Unter den Linden, drove up and down that for a while, and then headed north along the Spree, at some point crossing over the river.<BR>
<BR>
I found myself at Oranienburgerstrasse, rode north a few blocks, looked up and saw a massive gold dome, on top of which stood a big Star of David. The synagogue on Oranienburgerstrasse is unlike any other in Germany. Originally built by the wealthy Jewish population that once inhabited Berlin, it was meant to rival the city's impressive churches<NOBR> -</NOBR> thus its rather ostentatious appearance. As the story goes, the synagogue was set ablaze on Kristallnacht, "night of broken glass" of 1938, but the fire was quickly extinguished at the order of a police chief sympathetic to the Jewish community.<BR>
<BR>
The fate of the synagogue building is that of most other imposing structures in Berlin: war and bombing completely destroyed it, and it wasn't until 1988 that reconstruction took place. Thus there was for me a strange sense of betrayal when looking at this building; I wanted to see an old world, but this synagogue exists only as a re-creation of something that doesn't exist anymore, like a movie set or a fossil in which the original compounds have long since disappeared.<BR>
<BR>
I purchased some tickets for the High Holiday services inside. The building itself serves as a museum and the center for Berlin's Jewish community. The hallways seemed to be quite empty, and most of the activity was going on at the entrance, where an imposing team of police with metal detectors checked out those who entered the building. Because of money concerns, I could only buy a cheap seat in the back of the synagogue. So I assumed the place would be quite full on Rosh Hashana.<BR>
<BR>
It wasn't until I got home that I looked at the ticket and realized that the service would not be held at the new synagogue. Rather, it would be in a synagogue in the neighborhood where I was staying, Prenzlauer Berg, one of the old Jewish neighborhoods before the war, and an area which had become during the '60s (and remains) the center of Berlin's leftist counterculture. At first I was a little upset about this turn of events, partly because I imagined a huge symbolic coming together of many Jews in the grand Oranienburgerstrasse synagogue. But after scoping out the area, the synagogue itself and the impressive Jewish cemetery a few blocks away,  I figured it would be just an equally authentic experience, if not more so. And why should Jews aspire to such lascivious and impressive gatherings anyway, and especially in Germany? <BR>
<BR>
<B>Culture embraces Jewish subjects</B><BR>
Judaism exists in a multitude of dismembered and often unrelated fragments in Germany. There is of course the synagogue<NOBR> -</NOBR> in Berlin I think there are three. There is a Jewish community, itself divided among immigrants, students, older and more religious German Jews, liberals, and those non-practicing. Then there are Jewish travelers coming to Germany. And most interesting are the Germans, in whom Judaism and Jews are constantly reflected and live on. By this, I mean to say that there are so many Jewish relics that abound within the culture here, and these relics, so to speak, surface all the time in the people and the society.<BR>
<BR>
There are entire sections in bookstores devoted to German-Jewish culture; at sidewalk sales I always stumble across books in German titled "The Sayings of Jews" or "Yiddish Tales." A store I passed by in Berlin had its windows full of menorahs. A theater might be playing a piece adapted from the original Yiddish. One evening, I watched a little bit of a full-length documentary of Itzhak Perlman and his discovery of Klezmer music. Also, one finds Klezmer music playing in popular clubs in Berlin. The Jewish bookstore in Munich rivals any that I have seen in the United States, and it is visited mostly by non-Jews. A reading of a Jewish author that I attended in Munich attracted a substantial crowd.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, one of the most controversial authors in Germany today, Ralph Seligmann, who writes about growing up Jewish in post-war Germany, is based in Munich. The newspapers of Berlin are filled with debates about the purpose of the new Jewish Museum, which is almost ready for exhibit installation.<BR>
<BR>
Interest in Jews and Judaism extends to the personal level: at a recent visit to a friend staying with a host family in a suburb of Munich, I noticed that the house, which contained some ancient Bavarian Catholic artifacts, also had a mezuzah on the doorpost and a menorah inside. As it turns out, the host father had as a child witnessed a death march headed to Dachau, which ran along the street in front of the house. Since then he has built monuments and helped research information on the Jews who once lived in his small town.<BR>
<BR>
What I have described above has been called "exploitation" and "philosemitism." I think it is a little bit of both of these things; Germans can be extremely curious about Jews (sometime one feels like a zoo animal). However, I think one has to distinguish carefully between what I think is a genuine interest here in Jewish culture and history (which is directly bound up with German history), as opposed the sort of false love created by the collective guilt of which so many people here seem possessed.<BR>
<BR>
A friend recently warned me that I would receive many apologies and requests for forgiveness, when and if I revealed to someone that I am Jewish. Although this hasn't happened yet, I have felt that when the subject comes up and my religion slips out of my mouth, there is a sudden sense of hushed stillness and a rather forced absence of any reaction. After all, what are you supposed to say when one reveals their religion: "Oh, that's very nice; congratulations"? I don't think so. But maybe they feel that something should be said. Nevertheless, after the revelation of being Jewish, it seemed that my cultural value doubled because of a certain exoticism and rarity.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, while I have noticed this German caution toward Jews and Judaism, most people I have met, especially fellow students, are very willing to engage in serious discussion (in or out of class) concerning German history without using the clich‚s that are so common to both Jews and Germans; that is to say, that discussion starts and ends with a genuine interest to learn and understand, rather than apologize and condemn.<BR>
<BR>
But what about Judaism? I admit that everything I have been talking about has very little to do with the practice of Judaism as I have seen it done elsewhere. Germany has truly polarized for me the issues circling within the problem of contemporary Jewish identity<NOBR> -</NOBR> practice, history, memory, tradition, and nationalism. Choose one, chose all. In Germany it is memory that is at the core of the Judaism I have experienced. It is the Judaism I know best; the Judaism of ancestor worship<NOBR> -</NOBR>  I could say "my grandma was in Birkenau," or "I am a second-generation Holocaust survivor." The atmosphere of memory is so thick here.<BR>
<BR>
How can a Jew live in or visit Germany? For me, the question is now, "How can one not?"<BR>
<BR>
I was listening to an American-Jewish author read from his novel, which concerned Holocaust survivors living in post-war Germany. After the reading, he took some time to answer questions from the audience. A member of the audience asked him about a statement he made a few days earlier in Frankfurt, where he told a journalist, "I see Hitler everywhere I go." It was the author's first time in Germany; although, as the son of a Holocaust survivor, he must have spent so much time here in thought. He stood by his comment but also replied that his visit had complicated all his notions about Germany: the monsters he had imagined where only people; he never realized before that there still exist German Jews; and he seemed surprised at the genuine interest there was in the collective past.<BR>
<BR>
It was then, looking around the audience, I realized the amount of people participating in the same experience as this author<NOBR> -</NOBR> the exciting and confusing experience of looking into a Diaspora that everyone had thought disappeared, but finding out it still exists<NOBR> -</NOBR> the sadness of realizing that it will never and cannot be what it once was. And sitting there, I thought of the author's statement, about seeing Hitler everywhere, and I could only ponder: Yes, but think, what if he saw you?<BR>
