<P>One of my favorite old-growth forests in northeastern
Wisconsin is liberally laced with the tracks of snowshoe hares
this winter.  Surely these animals must be near or at the top of
their ten-year cycle.  Years ago a sign along the narrow road
leading to the buildings there read, &quot;Take only pictures,
Leave only tracks.&quot;  The wily big-footed hares surely have
lived up to at least the latter portion of that sign.

<P>Few wild animals have evaded me as much as have these
fascinating hares, <I>Lepus americanus</I> (LEE-pus
a-mer-I-CANE-us), that turn white in winter, with the exception
of the tips of their ears which remain black. I’ve seen thousands
of tracks of the hares but only a few of the living creatures
themselves, even though I know more about this native wild
mammal, from reading about them, than any other.

<P>It was while I was a summer student during 1956-57 at the
National Audubon Camp in Northern Wisconsin that I read Wallace
Byron Grange’s incredible book, &quot;Those of the Forest,&quot;
the life story of snowshoe hares and their wilderness.   Mr.
Grange won the highly-coveted Burroughs Award for the best nature
book in 1955.  Knowing that he lived near Babcock, Wisconsin
(south of Wisconsin Rapids), I was determined to meet him some
day.

<P>That visit became a reality in the late fall of 1959.  No one
responded to my knocks on the front door of their rather plain
little house so I wandered over to a long work shed, opened the
door and found that several men were there working on building
duck blinds.  When I asked about the whereabouts of Mr. Grange,
one of the men said, &quot;He’s somewhere on the property.
You’ll just have to look for him.&quot;  Little did I realize
that his game farm contained around 10,000 acres!

<P>Grange’s pet sandhill crane, &quot;Silver,&quot; was in the
large open yard so I amused myself in getting the closest look at
one of those stately birds that I’d ever had.  Occasionally an
energetic man would come barging across the yard carrying a
timber or two on his shoulders and disappear into one of the
nearby wooden sheds.  The point that I noticed immediately about
him was that he wore a pair of Gokey boots.  The style of those
boots was unmistakable.  In fact I had been receiving the Gokey
boot catalog from St. Paul, Minnesota (no longer in business)
for several years and unfortunately realized that the boots I
longed to buy were simply too expensive. Well, I never did meet
Grange at his game farm.

<P>Several years later, in 1964, I began working as the summer
naturalist at the Ridges Sanctuary in Baileys Harbor.  One Sunday
afternoon I had just about finished my orientation for the large
tour group when a deeply-tanned gentleman joined the group and
stood in the very back.  As we began the tour across Ridges Road
to the beach that same gentleman fell in line directly behind me.
I casually looked downward and backward as I walked and, much to
my surprise, he was wearing a pair of Gokey boots.

<P>Immediately I turned around and asked him, &quot;Are you
Wallace Grange?&quot;  He looked at me quite puzzled and replied,
&quot;Yes, but how did you know?&quot;  Rather sheepishly I
replied, &quot;I could tell by your Gokey boots!&quot;  I’ll
never forget the look that came over his face.  Anyway, we had a
wonderful tour and, much to my satisfaction, Mr. Grange
contributed a lot to the tour.

<P>When we completed the afternoon hike Mr. Grange and I had the
longest talk. Yes, he was the rugged man carrying timbers at the
game farm the day I visited.  Having told him how much I enjoyed
&quot;Those of the Forest,&quot; he related to me how he, his
wife, and a crew of men spent four or five winters trapping and
selling around 50,000 snowshoe hares, mostly to the state of New
York.  This was to save them from being killed by a federal
poisoning campaign implemented to kill the hares in the northern
states because it was felt that they were damaging young white
pine forest reproduction.  As he told me, sixteen years of his
field notes about the snowshoe hares were used to write his
famous book.

<P>Grange, a wildlife biologist for the old Wisconsin
Conservation Department at the time, objected strongly to the
program, claiming that the hares were not as much of the problem
as were the white-tailed deer and their mismanagement.  That’s
when Grange parted company with the WCD and set out on his own.
Later he and his wife purchased around 10,000 acres (delinquent
tax land) of mostly wetland, that unbelievably was on fire at the
time he purchased it, and eventually developed it into a very
successful game farm, the Sandhill Game Farm.

<P>In later years the Wisconsin DNR purchased the property from
the Granges and today it is the popular and widely-acclaimed
Sandhill State Wildlife Area located in southwestern Wood County
north of the junction of State Highways 73 and 80.

<P>Another book that will add immeasurably to your appreciation
of the contributions of the Granges to our state is,
<a href= "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883755085/qid%3D983283001/102-5673432-2309737">&quot;Live
Arrival Guaranteed,&quot;</a> written by Hazel Grange.  In it she
relates the great challenges they encountered at their game farm
and also the years they spent trapping and shipping the snowshoe
hares.

<P>Here’s wishing you luck in getting to see your first live
snowshoe hare!
