    pair of doors was added to facilitate entry / exit into the walkways without 
    using up the only small access doors<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/hanger_09.jpg">hanger_09.jpg</a> - the center control 
    room also surfaced, note the trim added around all the doors, the control 
    room, and wall edges, this was so the metal panels didnt appear to suddenly 
    stop at an edge.<br>

    the connection yellow caution area (this would be some sort of flexible air 
    tight sealing structure) a linear extensible accordian like connection from 
    the seal to the walkway. The metallic X panneling is applied to the rest of 
    the walkway. Flexible structures at corners surfaced as well.<br>

    rotational joint paneling added<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/hanger_crane_03.jpg">hanger_crane_03.jpg</a> - length 
    of crane surfaced, paneling added to each long cylinder, to pivot joints and 
    rotational jouints at each main hinge.<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/hanger_crane_04.jpg">hanger_crane_04.jpg</a> - the base 
    of the hand surfaced, with yellow spinning caution lights (to be on when crane 
    is in operation) and a central camera (the dark spot) next to a central spot 
    light, to help illuminate and see whatever is being worked on.<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/hanger_crane_05.jpg">hanger_crane_05.jpg</a> - the hand 
    and fingers added to the rest of the crane. At the end of each finger is an 
    electromagnetic clamp (marked with the yellow cation surface) and hard metallic 
    barbs facing toward the center. Each finger tip also has its own light and 
    camera. Along the inside of the fingers with each segment are a high friction 
    gripping material (the darker segments). </p>

  <p>Hanger Doors External</p>
  <p>The doors and hangers were not fitted to hold four waveriders, and the general 
    surface applied to the outside doors was just a repeat of the Ark hull surfacing, 
    which didnt match the hanger shap / structure overall, and which made unrealistically 
    large paneling compared to the hull doors.</p>
  <p><a href="june20_2003/hanger_doors_01.jpg">hanger_doors_01.jpg</a> - starting 
    point, back to a generic surface. The hanger door sizes were changed to fit 
    four waverider sized hangers, in addition are 8 smaller rectangular hangers, 
    and 16 2m doors that would allow entry/exit for people in suits, small maintenence 
    bots, probes, etc.<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/hanger_doors_04.jpg">hanger_doors_04.jpg</a> - the doors 
    for the waverider hangers were segmented and surfaced. This will slide open 
    to one side.<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/hanger_doors_05.jpg">hanger_doors_05.jpg</a> - a large 
    texture map was used to surface the largest hanger doors, the paneling was 
    lined up with the door openings and edges. Cation surfaces lines the internal 
    edges.<br>

    - in operation</p>
  <p>Next step was to animate the Waverider in motion, then activating the forward 
    reaction thrusters, slowing to a stop</p>
  <p><a href="june20_2003/Waverider_slowtostop_2.avi">Waverider_slowtostop_02.avi</a> 
    - the thrusters activate midway through the animation. In this video the vehicle 
    is going too fast, and slows too quickly, additionally the camera is moving 
    and makes it appear to bob.<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/Waverider_slowtostop_3.avi">Waverider_slowtostop_03.avi</a> 
    - better, but waverider still stops too abruptly. Note also that even while 
    off the thrusters create some light...<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/Waverider_slowtostop_4.avi">Waverider_slowtostop_04.avi</a> 
    - slower all around<br>
    <a href="june20_2003/Waverider_slowtostop_5.avi">Waverider_slowtostop_05.avi</a> 
    - added earth background. A master control was added to the lights, I plan 
    to have prepared scenes for the thrusters ready to be loaded should any Waverider 
    need to be animated, controlling the thrusters whould simply be changing the 
    key frame where they turn on and where they turn off, and that controller 
    dictates the status of the lights throughout the animations, even if the lights 
    are made to fluctuate and pulsate. I have not gotten this to work succussfully, 
    as you can see in this animation, in an attempt to get rid of the thrusters 
    being lit up even with off, I moved the lowest setting of the control to below 
    0% for intensity, this made the rockets 'negative' lights whenever they were 
    off, 'sucking' in light around the. I am currently reasearching how to resolve 
    this. Ideally, all the directional thrusters of the waverider will be ready 
    to be easily animated and controlled.<br>

<p>Notes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I will look into using some better codecs, perhaps DivX or something similiar, 
    since avi's do not compress animations from frame to frame.<br>
    <br>
    In the future, some images can be done similiar to hanger_doors_11.jpg, once 
    more of the internal of Ark I is modeled. e.g. A cutaway view of the entire 
    craft down the middle through the length of the bridge, cross sections of 
    the hubs, and details of the interior of the rings. </p>
  <p>Once I fix the problem with the lights, I will repost the animation of the 
    WR slowing to a stop. Eventually a series of animations like these can be 
    pieced together into on long animation detailing the waverider from liftoff 
    to docking. The might be a good medium to present a narrative of interacting 
    with the Ark in the near future, from the security and quarantine requirements 
    at boarding and unboarding to the cargo scanning, etc. Something like this 
    presented in a series of short animations, hi-res screen shots, and technical 
    details could be beneficial. </p>
  <p>resource_07 - I will have to rebuild parts of the hanger / crane set up scene 
    to find out what happened to the missing part of the hand. </p>
