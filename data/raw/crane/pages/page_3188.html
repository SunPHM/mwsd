We sat around for a quick breakfast and then Grandpa Fumie, Fumie, Anna, and I were planning to visit quite a bit today. Yoji was not able to come with us, because of a report that he needed to get done soon for the government. So we waved goodbye and off we were for the day.</font></p>						<p><font size="4">The first stop that we made was the Peace Park Memorial in Hiroshima. We visited the museum that was three stories tall and was filled with information and artifacts from the Atomic Bomb dropping. We walked around the first floor as it gave the history behind the city of Hiroshima, along with a watch that was stopped at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 the time the bomb was dropped. After going through the museum I will no longer forget this day or time. There was a display of a model city the day before the bomb, and the day after. It was completely destroyed expect for a few buildings.</font></p>						<p><font size="4">We then went to the second floor were there was a collection of uniforms, lunch boxes, and many others that were collected from the war. There were pictures on the wall that showed the burns of the victims, and a large drawing of the hypocenter of the bomb. There were several pieces of concrete with a burned shadow of a victim of the bomb who died instantly. There was also glass shrapnel that was logged into cement wall slabs. After completing the museum, I saw the effects of dropping the Atomic Bomb from the other side, and I felt a sad feeling in my stomach. </font></p>						<p><font size="4">Then we went to find the Peace Park Statue that was to represent all of the children affected by the atomic bomb. The statue on top is to represent a girl named Sadako and the story of 1,000 cranes. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/hiroshimasadakoandcranes.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">She was two when the bombed went off and grew to be a healthy girl. But the radiation of the bomb resulted in her getting leukemia. She than began to make origami cranes as in hopes of getting better. She died at the age of twelve and is a hero of the people today. Out of respect, many people visit and leave paper cranes, drawings, and other symbols of peace and hope. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshima1000papercranes.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimasadakoartwork.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">There were many great works left and I took pictures. There was even one from a group of students who came to visit from Madison, Wisconsin. She is a hero, and may her legend live on forever.<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimasadakocraneswi.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">Next we went to the only remaining building from the Atomic Bomb dropping. It is called the Genbaku Domu-mae A-bomb Dome. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimadomebuildingone.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/hiroshimaendofbuildingsid.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimafullbuildingshot.jpg"></font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">We were able to walk around the building and get rather close. You could see the rubble on the outside that came down from the bomb. The discoloring was apparent on the building as well. The inside of the building was absolutely totaled and the staircase was twisted. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimainsiderubbletwo.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimainsidebuildrubble.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">I took many pictures from different angles that help to show the building as a whole. It served as a reminder to all the destruction that occurs with nuclear weapons, and how we should promote peace to solve world conflicts. The government invest large amount of money for the upkeep, but it is definitely worth it.<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/hiroshimamemorialanddome.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/hiroshimastatuewithcranes.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/hiroshimastatuewhole.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/hiroshimamotherchildstatue.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/hiroshimadomeacrossriver.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">Then we jumped in the car and made the transition from such a powerful experience for myself to go to &quot;Miyajima&quot; (may-yah-gee-ma), an island of shrines and shopping. Although getting to Miyajima was the problem. It took us two hours to drive three miles, not a good ratio! But we made it and then had to get on the boat to go to the island. I figured since I was on the boat&#133;a nice dramatic picture from the Titanic scene seemed right, and that is exactly what I did.<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/boattitanicscene.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/boatannahangingupsidedown.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">We arrived at the island and visited &quot;Itsukushima&quot; (its-sue-koo-she-ma) Shrine. This contains a gate that is in the water. It was splendid and we caught it just in time to watch the sunset. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/miyajimamainbuildingtemple.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/miyajimalanterninshrine.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/miyajimaannastrikespose.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/miyajimaoldbuildingpreserv.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/miyajimatorresunsettwo.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">We walked around and I helped out talking photos for people. I just hate it myself when you take photos and one person is missing from the photo. I provided a valuable service to all who I helped.<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/miyajimasunset.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">Then we did a little shopping, but it proved to be unsuccessful for my brother&#146;s request. We boarded the ship back after dark and returned to the main shore. While getting off the boat I talked to two ladies who were from Australia. I think it is the unwritten rule to make some sort of communication, whether verbal or non-verbal, to those who are not Japanese. So we talked for a while to find out that they are teaching for one year in Tokyo and needed to escape for the weekend. Before we parted we took a group photo.<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/miyajimateacherfriendfar.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/miyajimateacherfriends.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">We then returned back to Hiroshima and the three miles that took two hours before, only took five minutes. I love traffic jams!! We then went out for dinner at another favorite restaurant with reservations, but we were 30 minutes late for them. So instead, we went from restaurant to restaurant looking for one to stop at. It reminded me of the time in Minneapolis that we drove around for one hour to find a restaurant five minutes away from the hotel&#133;now whose crazy family would do that? We then ended up eating a nice restaurant, and afterwards, we finished the meal by going out for Ramon noodles at a different place.</font></p>						<p><font size="4">Then we had the chance to cross another thing off of my list of things to do in Japan&#133;and it was KAREOKE. It was truly a blast and very different atmosphere from the American way. Here you go into a booth with family and friends and lounge around in comfy couches and chairs.<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/kareokenanakosinging.jpg"><br>							<br>							<img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/kareokefumieandannasing.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">They have books filled with songs and you select them and grab a microphone and have at it. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/kareokedjyojiselectsongs.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">Anna did a wonderful job of singing many songs, and Grandpa Fumie did too. <br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="300" width="225" src="../pictures2/kareokegrandpasinging.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">Grandpa Fumie was a one hit wonder, because after he sang the first song, he napped on the couch for the remainder of the time. I found that I excel best at heavy metals songs!<br>						<br>						</font></p>						<center>							<p><font size="4"><img height="225" width="300" src="../pictures2/kareokegrandpasleeping.jpg"><br>							<br>							</font></p>						</center>						<p><font size="4">We returned to drop off Nanako, who joined us for dinner as well, on the way back. Her husband Tom was walking the dog and she jumped out of the car and joined him. We waved goodbye and headed home. It was a long day, but a complete day at that. I feel this day I will never forget, and when August 6, 2002 comes, I will take time to remember what happened that day 57 years ago. I hope you remember that day as well and take time to think of the victims. Once you see it through the other set of eyes&#133;it leaves you with a different impression.<br>						<br>						</font></td>					<td width="5" height="9823"></td>				</tr>				<tr height="32">					<td width="1" height="32"><spacer type="block" width="1" height="32"></td>					<td width="192" height="32" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top" align="left" xpos="0" content csheight="32"><i>Return to <a href="../week8index.html">index</a></i></td>					<td width="356" height="32"></td>					<td width="5" height="32"></td>				</tr>			</table>		</center>	</body></html>
