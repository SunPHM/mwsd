The photo of the Spedden boy playing with his top was shot from inboard.
A-deck slopes down to B-deck and the bulwarks for both lay almost next to
each other. A&amp;B decks shifted inward, leaving wall to the 2nd class

Frederick Spedden watches his son Robert play with a top on A-deck aft.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The photo of the Spedden boy playing with his top is from
the Father Browne collection. The boat deck above the crane collapsed down
and twisted aft on the starboard side until it nearly touches the crane.
The crane is still present, but hangs precariously over the side. A-deck
is shifted inward and shattered in the center area. The starboard palm court
cafe on A-deck is crushed by the weight of the boat deck section that flipped
back and is hanging over the side, pulling the remaining boat deck down
toward A-deck. A-deck itself is collapsed downward to B-deck at the aft
end.</FONT>
