<h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Whooping Crane is the rarest of the world&#146;s 15
crane species. The species&#146; historic decline, near extinction, and gradual recovery
is among the best known and documented cases in the annals of conservation. Over the last
fifty years, a combination of strict legal protection, habitat preservation, and
continuous international cooperation between Canada and the United States has allowed the
only remaining wild population to increase steadily from a historic low of just 15 known
individuals in 1940-41 to more than 150 at present. Since the mid-1960s, captive
propagation has provided security against extinction of the species while affording
opportunities to initiate new populations. The species provides an important case study in
the conservation of rare and endangered species, and serves as a symbol for international
cooperation in conserving not only threatened cranes, but biodiversity in general. The
species is classified as Endangered under the revised IUCN Red List Categories. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Whooping Crane occurs exclusively in North America.
The historic mid-continental breeding range stretched from Alberta across the northeastern
portions of the mid-continental prairies to near the southern end of Lake Michigan. The
historic wintering grounds included the highlands of northern Mexico, the Texas Gulf
coast, and portions of the Atlantic coast. Non-migratory populations occurred in Louisiana
and possibly other areas in the southeastern United States. The species declined rapidly
in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a result of hunting, collecting, and the conversion
of its habitats to agriculture. By 1940, only the one self-sustaining flock remained. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As of August 1996 the adult Whooping Crane population
numbered 205 in the wild and another 91 birds in captivity. In the wild, the species
exists in three separate populations<span style="vertical-align: super"><sup>1</sup></span>:
the historic Aransas-Wood Buffalo population; an experimental cross-fostered population,
containing 3 birds, in the Rocky Mountains of the U. S.; and an experimental non-migratory
population of released birds in central Florida. Whooping Cranes are maintained in
captivity at five locations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Historically, the species bred primarily in wetlands of
the northern tall- and mixed-grass prairies and aspen parklands. The remnant wild
population breeds at the northernmost extreme of the historic range in intermixed muskeg
and boreal forest in Canada&#146;s Wood Buffalo National Park. During migration, this
population uses a variety of feeding and roosting habitats, including croplands, marshes,
and submerged sandbars in rivers along the migration route. They winter in bays and
coastal marshes in and near the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the Texas Gulf Coast.
The cross-fostered population in the Rocky Mountains utilizes high elevation marshes and
riparian wetlands from Idaho to New Mexico. The experimental non-migratory population
inhabits palmetto grasslands, savannahs, and shallow marshes in the Florida&#146;s
Kissimmee Prairie region. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Whooping Cranes continue to face multiple threats,
including habitat loss and pollution in their traditional wintering grounds, collision
with utility lines, human disturbance, disease, predation, loss of genetic diversity
within the population, and vulnerability to natural and human-caused catastrophes. Concern
over the near extinction of the Whooping Crane has prompted a broad range of conservation
actions, including national and international legal protections; comprehensive scientific
research and monitoring programs; protection of key habitats; development of Whooping
Crane recovery teams and comprehensive recovery plans; and extensive public education
campaigns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Priority conservation measures for the future include:
integration and implementation of the U.S. and Canadian Whooping Crane Recovery Plans;
special attention to key problems within existing habitats, potential breeding areas, and
potential reintroduction sites; continued efforts to establish two additional
self-sustaining wild populations and a viable self-sustaining captive population; and
research on a variety of specific topics important for the recovery and establishment of
the species. </font></p>

<p><small><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="vertical-align: super"><sup>1</sup></span>The
Whooping Cranes in the experimental Rocky Mountain population did not successfully
reproduce, while those in the Florida population have not yet reached sexual maturity.
Thus, these are not self-sustaining biological populations in the strict sense. The term
&quot;population&quot; is used in this account to differentiate the three wild flocks. </font></small></p>
<a name="subsp">

<h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">Subspecies/populations</font></a></h3>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">No subspecies. In the wild, the species exists in three
populations: the historic Aransas-Wood Buffalo population (AWP); an experimental
cross-fostered Rocky Mountains population (RMP); and an experimental population of
recently released non-migratory birds in central Florida (FP). </font></p>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Whooping Crane was likely never very common in
historic times. The total population prior to 1870, when European settlement began to have
a significant impact on the species and its habitats, has been variously estimated at
between 500 and 1400 (Allen 1952, Banks 1978, Lewis 1995b). The principal historic
breeding range stretched across central North America from central Alberta through
southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, northeastern North Dakota, western Minnesota, southern
Wisconsin, northern Iowa, and northern Illinois (Allen 1952). Wintering grounds included
southwestern Louisiana, the Gulf Coast of Texas, interior west Texas, the highlands of
northern Mexico, and Atlantic coastal areas of New Jersey, Delaware, South Carolina, and
Georgia (Allen 1952, Howell and Webb 1995). Non-migratory populations were found in
coastal Louisiana, and possibly in other portions of the southeastern United States
(Nesbitt 1982, Gomez 1992, USFWS 1994). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The species' range shrank rapidly in the second half of
the 19th century, and by the 1890s it was extirpated from the U.S. portion of the historic
breeding range (Allen 1952, McNulty 1966). Nesting in the aspen parklands of Canada was
last observed in 1929, with unconfirmed reports continuing into the early 1930s (Hjertaas
1994). By the late 1930s, only two breeding populations remained: a remnant non-migratory
population around White Lake in southwestern Louisiana, and a migratory population that
wintered in coastal Texas but whose breeding grounds were unknown. Birds in the Louisiana
population last nested in 1939. A hurricane in August 1940 reduced this population from 13
to 6 individuals. The last member of this flock was taken into captivity in 1950. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The only remaining flock of wild Whooping Cranes, the
wintering population in coastal Texas, reached a low of 15 birds in the winter of 1941-42,
and hovered between the low 20s and mid 30s over the next two decades (Boyce 1987, USFWS
1994) (see Figure 2.1). Efforts to locate the flock's breeding grounds intensified
following World War II. Evidence of breeding was first reported in 1954, when several
adults and pre-fledged juveniles were observed in Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP) in
Northwest Territories, Canada. Researchers were able to locate the first nests the
following year (Allen 1956). The inaccessibility of the breeding grounds, protection of
the wintering grounds, and extensive public education campaigns have contributed to the
population's increase to its current (August 1995) level of 150 birds (Lewis 1995a). Since
1967, biologists have removed single eggs from two-egg clutch nests of the population,
using these eggs in establishing captive and experimental wild populations (Erickson 1976,
Kuyt 1993, Edwards et al. 1994). </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="fig02-1"></a> <img src="images/popgro.gif" alt="Population size (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)" WIDTH="682" HEIGHT="425"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Aransas-Wood Buffalo flock remains the only
self-sustaining wild population. The 47 known breeding pairs within the population (as of
1995) nest almost exclusively within the borders of WBNP. The population follows a
relatively narrow (80-300 km wide) migration route across nine provinces and states:
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma,
and Texas (Kuyt 1992). The wintering grounds are found within and near the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Texas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1975, experimental efforts to establish a second
migratory wild flock through cross-fostering began at Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge
in southeastern Idaho (see Drewien and Bizeau 1978 for a summary of the methods used in
this program). Eggs were transferred from the nests of AWP Whooping Cranes to nests of
Greater Sandhill Cranes. Sandhill Crane &quot;foster parents&quot; raised the Whooping
Cranes and taught them their traditional migration route to wintering grounds along the
middle Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico. Continued artificial supplementation increased the
number of Whooping Cranes in this population to a peak of 33 in the winter of 1984-85.
However, the cross-fostered birds failed to form pair-bonds with others of their species.
High mortality rates within the population, the failure of the birds to pair and breed
(due likely to improper sexual imprinting), and prolonged drought in the summer range led
to the decision in 1989 to curtail the egg-transfer program (Lewis 1995b, J. Lewis pers.
comm.). Three captive-reared, Whooping Crane-imprinted juveniles have subsequently been
released to test the viability of using adults as &quot;guide birds&quot; to teach cranes
raised in captivity to migrate. Three birds remain in the population (J. Lewis pers.
comm.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the 1980s, other options for release programs were
explored. Potential sites for establishing a third wild population were selected for
evaluation in 1983 and research at these sites began the following year. In 1988, the U.S.
Whooping Crane Recovery Team selected the Kissimmee Prairie area in Florida for
establishment of an experimental non-migratory population. This decision was made based on
the failure of the cross-fostered migratory Whooping Cranes to pair and reproduce, and the
lack of a proven technique for teaching migration to captive-raised birds. The project was
endorsed by the Canadian recovery team in 1988 and approved by the respective government
wildlife agencies in 1989. The first releases, involving 33 captive-reared juvenile
cranes, occurred from January 1993 to March 1994 (Nesbitt 1994b). As of August 1996, 52 of
the released birds had survived. Additional releases of 20 to 40 birds annually are
planned until the population is self-sustaining. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the wild populations, approximately 91 (as
of August 1996) captive Whooping Cranes are maintained at five locations (see
&quot;Captive Propagation and Reintroduction&quot; below) (Lewis 1995a). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Historical records indicate that during the breeding
season the migratory populations used the aspen parklands and wetlands along the northern
and eastern borders of the tall- and mixed-grass prairie regions of central North America.
In the winter, these populations foraged in grasslands, coastal marshes, and other
wetlands on wintering grounds in Texas and Louisiana and along the Atlantic coast. The
extirpated non-migratory population in Louisiana used tallgrass (<i>Panicum</i>) prairie. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The nesting grounds of the AWP within Wood Buffalo
National Park are in poorly drained areas where muskeg and boreal forest intermix (Allen
1956, Novakowski 1966, Kuyt 1981a). Nesting territories range widely in size, from 1.3 to
47.1 km<span style="vertical-align: super">2</span> (Kuyt 1981a, 1993). The cranes nest in
emergent vegetation (primarily bulrush and sedges) in the shallow portions of ponds, small
lakes, and wet meadows (Kuyt 1995). Nests are usually constructed of bulrush and other
surrounding wetland vegetation in shallow (14-28 cm) water (Allen 1956; Kuyt 1981a, 1981b,
1995). Kuyt (1995) provides a comprehensive summary of data on Whooping Crane nests and
eggs collected over 25 years at WBNP. More than 90% of clutches contain two eggs. The
incubation period is 29-30 days (Kuyt 1982). Chicks fledge at 80-90 days. Whooping Cranes
are omnivorous. On breeding grounds, they feed primarily on mollusks and crustaceans,
insects, minnows, frogs, and snakes (Allen 1956, Novakowski 1966). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">During migration, they feed and roost in a wide variety of
habitats, including croplands, large and small freshwater marshes, the margins of lakes
and reservoirs, and submerged sandbars in rivers (including the South Saskatchewan,
Platte, Niobrara, Cimarron, and Red) along the migration route (Howe 1989, Armbruster
1990, Kuyt 1992). Especially in the Canadian portion of the migration route, waste grain
(barley and wheat) are an important part of the diet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most of the winter is spent in the brackish bays,
estuarine marshes, and tidal flats of the Gulf of Mexico in and near Aransas NWR in Texas
(Allen 1952, Stehn and Johnson 1987). These areas are dominated by salt grass, cordgrass,
and other aquatic vegetation (Allen 1952, Labuda and Butts 1979). There the cranes feed
primarily on blue crabs, clams, fiddler crabs, shrimp, and other aquatic invertebrates,
small vertebrates, and plants (Allen 1952, 1956; Blankinship 1976). Upland areas are also
used, especially when flooded or prescribe-burned. Cranes forage there for acorns, snails,
insects, rodents, and other food items (Hunt 1987). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The cross-fostered population at Grays Lake shares the
habitat of the Rocky Mountain population of Greater Sandhill Cranes: high elevation
marshes and riparian wetlands in the Idaho-Wyoming-<br>
Montana border region, along the migration route through Utah and Colorado, and on
wintering grounds in the middle Rio Grande valley. The cross-fostering site was an 8900 ha
marsh at 1946 m elevation. The birds also use grain fields and pastures on private lands
surrounding the refuge (Lewis 1995b). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The birds of the experimental Florida population are being
released in the Kissimmee Prairie region -- a flat, open area of palmetto (<i>Serenoa
repens</i>) grassland and savannah interspersed with shallow freshwater marshes and
lake-edge wetlands (Lewis 1995b). The release area also contains open, low-growth
grasslands, including nearby private ranches where native grassland has been converted to
pasture. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Several factors contributed to the historic decline of the
species. Much of the former range became unsuitable as a result of conversion to
agriculture (Allen 1952). The migratory populations of the mid-continent lost large
portions of their breeding and wintering habitat in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
Conversion to rice culture deprived the non-migratory population of much of its habitat in
the coastal marshes and prairies of Louisiana and Texas. In addition to outright habitat
loss, these activities increased the level of human disturbance, which may have had
adverse effects on crane behavior. At the same time, hunting, egg collecting, and specimen
collecting were a substantial drain on the population, particularly from 1870 to 1920
(Allen 1952, Doughty 1989). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Legal and Cultural Protection</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Whooping Crane is legally protected at the
international level under the Migratory Bird Treaty (1916) and the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (1975). At the national level, legal protection
is provided by the U. S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act (1918), the Canadian National Parks Act
(1930), the Canada Wildlife Act (1972), the U. S. Endangered Species Act (1973), and the
Canadian Migratory Birds Convention Act (1994). Although the species no longer occurs in
Mexico, it is legally protected there. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>International Agreements and Cooperation </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Whooping Crane provides an important example of
international cooperation on behalf of wildlife, and a model for collaborative efforts to
protect other migratory cranes. Lewis (1991) notes that, &quot;cooperation between Canada,
which protects the nesting ground and important fall staging areas, and the United States,
which manages the wintering grounds and migration stopovers, has been essential [in
bringing] the species back from the brink of extinction.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Canada-U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty of 1916 provided the
first international-level protection for the Whooping Crane. The conservation agencies of
the two countries had already worked together successfully for several decades when their
respective roles and responsibilities were formally outlined in 1985 in a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) on the Conservation of the Whooping Crane Relating to Coordinated
Management Activities. The MOU has been renewed twice, in 1990 and 1995. The parties to
the MOU are the USFWS, the CWS, the U.S. National Biological Service, and the Canadian
Parks Service. The MOU provides mechanisms for shared decision-making and implementation
of recovery activities, and for appointment of coordinators to facilitate such
cooperation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cooperative conservation activities have also been
stressed at the state and province level. To reduce the risk of loss during migration and
to improve treatment of sick or injured birds when necessary, a Contingency Plan for
Federal-State Cooperative Protection of Whooping Cranes was developed and adopted in 1985.
The plan, approved by thirteen states and the USFWS, coordinates monitoring and response
activities along the Whooping Crane's migration route. In Canada, a parallel contingency
plan has been in place since 1987. The plan was outlined in the initial <i>Canadian
Whooping Crane Recovery Plan</i> (Cooch et al. 1988). These contingency plans have also
been incorporated into the Canada-U.S. MOU (Lewis 1992). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Whooping Crane Recovery Plans</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The U.S. Endangered Species Act (1973) provides for the
development and implementation of recovery plans for endangered species. These plans are
prepared and periodically updated by recovery teams appointed by the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior. The U.S. Whooping Crane Recovery Team was appointed in 1976 and the USFWS
published its first Whooping Crane Recovery Plan in 1980. Since then, the plan has been
revised twice, in 1986 and 1994. The Canadian Whooping Crane Recovery Team was established
in 1987 to define and coordinate recovery activities within Canada. Its first plan was
published in 1988 (Cooch et al. 1988) and revised in 1994 (Edwards et al. 1994)<sup align="3">3</sup>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Recovery activities have been closely coordinated between
the two nations, and the 1995 MOU on Conservation of the Whooping Crane calls for the
preparation of a combined plan and the formation of a single recovery team comprising five
U.S. and five Canadian members. At the time of publication these steps had not yet been
taken, but were expected to be achieved directly (J. Lewis pers. comm.). The goals and
strategies of the two national recovery plans are outlined below in the &quot;Priority
Conservation Measures&quot; section. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Protected Areas</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Much of the critical nesting, migration, and wintering
habitat of the AWP is contained within protected areas. The main nesting grounds are
located within Wood Buffalo National Park (established in 1922). Many of the population's
migration stopovers and staging areas are protected within federal, state, and provincial
wildlife refuges, waterfowl management districts, and other designated conservation areas.
Several Whooping Crane staging areas are protected under Saskatchewan's Wildlife Habitat
Protection Act of 1992 (B. Johns pers. comm.). Saskatchewan's Last Mountain Lake National
Wildlife Area (established in 1887) also protects a significant stopover site. In the U.
S., migrating Whooping Cranes utilize approximately twenty national wildlife refuges in
eleven states (Lewis 1991). The Cheyenne Bottoms State Wildlife Area in Kansas is an
important stopover point. The Aransas NWR, established in 1937, protects the main
wintering grounds. Additional habitat surrounding Aransas NWR has been purchased by the
U.S. government and the state of Texas with the assistance of The Nature Conservancy
(Doughty 1989). The National Audubon Society has also entered into leasing arrangements on
lands outside Aransas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Rocky Mountains population is concentrated at Grays
Lake NWR in the breeding season and Bosque del Apache NWR in the winter, and utilizes
several other state and federal wildlife refuges (especially Ouray NWR in Utah and Monte
Vista and Alamosa NWRs in Colorado) during migration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The core of the area where the experimental Florida
population has been established consists of state wildlife management areas and parklands,
as well as several large and small private holdings (including lands owned by the National
Audubon Society) (Lewis 1995b). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Habitat Protection and Management</b> </font></p>

monitored. The AWP has been counted annually on its wintering grounds since 1938. The AWP
has been monitored on the breeding grounds by CWS since 1966 (Novakowski 1966, Kuyt 1993).
The USFWS initiated a migration monitoring program in 1975 to compile information on
sightings and stopover points. The program has been expanded and coordinated with
information gathering activities of the CWS and states and provinces along the migration
corridor. Aerial surveys of the breeding grounds are undertaken each spring to determine
the number of breeding pairs and their nesting success. Annual productivity in the
population is determined through surveys conducted annually at the Aransas NWR by the
USFWS (see Binkley and Miller 1983, Boyce and Miller 1985, Boyce 1987, and Nedelman et al.
1987). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">From 1977-1988, a color banding program undertaken at WBNP
allowed U.S. and Canadian biologists to identify and study individual birds, yielding
valuable information on many aspects of the population's demographics, migration behavior,
and habitat use (Kuyt 1992). Radiotelemetry studies of the local movements and migration
patterns of the cross-fostered RMP were carried out from 1979 to 1982. Similar studies of
the AWP were undertaken from 1981-83. These studies were especially useful in providing
information on migration dynamics and causes of mortality (Drewien and Bizeau 1981,
Drewien et al. 1989, Kuyt 1992). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Research</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the 1940s, the Whooping Crane has benefited from
intensive research on virtually all aspects of its biology, life history, and ecology.
These efforts were first carried out under the Cooperative Whooping Crane Project (Allen
1952, 1956). Since then scientists have built upon this foundation with wide-ranging
studies of demographics, genetics, reproductive biology, migration, food habits,
environmental threats, behavior, habitat ecology and restoration, captive propagation,
health management, and reintroduction. This information has been summarized in several
publications, including Walkinshaw (1973), Johnsgard (1983), Doughty (1989), Mirande et
al. (1993), USFWS (1994), and Lewis (1995b). Recent research topics include studies of
historical summer and breeding records, winter habitat and ecology, breeding range
expansion, new reintroduction and release techniques, potential release sites, the
availability of migration habitat, and conservation genetics (e.g., Armbruster 1990, Ellis

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Education and Training</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Educational programs have been key to the survival of the
Whooping Crane. Over the decades, the story of the species has been widely disseminated
through books, newspaper and journal articles, radio, television, and documentary films.
These efforts date to the late 1940s, when the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina
undertook an extensive education program focused on the species (B. Johns pers. comm.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">After the discovery of the AWP breeding grounds in 1954,
educational efforts were initiated along the population's migration route. Hunter
education was and continues to be important in reducing the risk of hunter-caused
mortality in both the Aransas-Wood Buffalo and Rocky Mountain populations. The U.S. and
Canadian Contingency Plans for protection of the species include educational components
designed to enhance the public's ability to identify cranes and to encourage reporting of
observations during migration (Lewis 1992, Edwards et al. 1994). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Whooping Crane is also used in educational programs to
convey broader lessons involving the conservation of endangered species and biodiversity
in general. Recent education projects focused on Whooping Cranes include: a live
interactive video conference for students coordinated by the Patuxent Environmental
Science Center and the Alliance for Environmental Education; exhibits at the new National
Wildlife Visitor Center at Patuxent; and a new Whooping Crane educational exhibit at the
International Crane Foundation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Captive Propagation and Reintroduction</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Captive propagation of Whooping Cranes for conservation
purposes was first proposed in the mid-1950s (see Doughty 1989 for a review of the history
of the captive propagation program). The initial step in establishing the program was
taken in 1966, when a single male bird was transferred to the USFWS Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center (now the Patuxent Environmental Science Center). In 1967, the CWS and
USFWS began to remove single eggs from the nests of the AWP for hatching and raising at
Patuxent. Birds from these eggs produced their first eggs in 1975. To minimize the risk of
disease outbreaks and other potential threats, the captive propagation program was
eventually expanded to the International Crane Foundation in 1989 and the Calgary Zoo in
1992. The Patuxent program provided eggs for the experimental cross-fostering efforts at
Grays Lake. The programs at Patuxent and ICF are currently providing juvenile birds for
the establishment of the non-migratory flock in Florida (USFWS 1994). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As of August 1996, 91 adult birds were maintained at the
three principal propagation centers: 39 at Patuxent, 29 at ICF, and 18 at the Calgary Zoo.
In addition, 4 adult Whooping Cranes are maintained at the San Antonio Zoo and one bird at
the White Oak Conservation Center. Studbooks for both the captive and wild populations of
Whooping Cranes are maintained by Claire Mirande of the International Crane Foundation and
are available through ICF. Mirande et al. (in press a) and Mirande (pers. comm.) summarize
current trends in the captive populations as follows: </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The GCAR for cranes has recommended that Whooping Cranes
be given the highest priority for intensive management, and endorses current efforts to
develop a viable, self-sustaining captive population and to establish two separate
additional self-sustaining wild populations (as per the recommendations of the U.S. and
Canadian recovery plans) (Mirande et al. in press a). At present, reintroduction and
release efforts are focusing on: continued supplementation, monitoring, and evaluation of
the experimental Florida population; evaluation and selection of future release sites in
Canada; further development of release techniques for establishing a migratory population;
and development and testing of techniques for teaching captive-raised birds to migrate and
survive in the wild. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, preliminary efforts were undertaken
to identify an appropriate release site in Canada for establishment of the third wild
population (A. Burke pers. comm.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Teaching migration to young Whooping Cranes continues to
be the most significant barrier to reestablishing wild populations through captive
propagation. At present, two methods are being tested on an experimental basis using
Sandhill Cranes. The first involves using ultralight planes to guide imprinted juvenile
cranes on migration. This method has been successfully used to guide Canada geese and is
now being tested on cranes at two sites. The second method involves transporting
captive-raised juvenile cranes along migration routes and releasing them at intervals (+/-
35 km) to allow them to orient themselves. If these methods prove successful with Sandhill
Cranes, they may be used to teach migration to Whooping Cranes within several years (D.
Ellis pers. comm.). </font></p>
