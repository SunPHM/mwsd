<h1>BUILDINGS</h1>
<p>There are approximately 1500 buildings on the site; this figure includes many
air raid shelters, unusual buildings useful only to a filling factory, small
offices, ablution rooms etc.</p>
<p>An analysis of the buildings has been made with a
view to establishing how much floor space would be suitable for normal
industrial usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are:</p>
<ol type="i">
  <li>420 buildings with a total area of 1,800,000 square feet suitable for normal
    industrial work.</li>
  <li>127 buildings with a total area of 453,000 square feet suitable for
    stores.</li>
</ol>
<p>Buildings under (i) are reasonably large buildings with rail bays, and
moderate sized buildings in the interior of the sections. Most of these
buildings have good natural lighting, while under (ii) are all buildings which,
because they are too small or have no windows, are unsuitable for industrial
work.</p>
<p>Apart from the two main administration offices the factory area is well
provided with office accommodation, though most of the process buildings are
quite suitable for offices, in fact, many are being used as such at the present
time.</p>
<p>The standard office building on the factory comprises one large general
office with six small private offices, and lavatory and cloak room accommodation
for men and women.</p>
<p>The standard 60' x 30’&nbsp; buildings are constructed with steel
stanchions or brick piers carrying the roof trusses and on the flank walls are
filled in between the stanchions with hollow tiles covered with bituminous felt.
The end gable walls are in 9&quot;’ brickwork. The roofs are carried on steel
trusses, one third pitch, covered with boarding and felt. In some cases
corrugated asbestos sheets, lined on the underside, are substituted.</p>

<p>Floors of concrete designed for a superficial load of 2 cwts. per square
foot are either covered with linoleum or asphalt.</p>
<p>Each 60’ x 30’ building has two porches with internal end external double
doors, the 40’ x 20’ buildings have one porch of similar type. Emergency
doors are provided on the opposite side of each shop.</p>
<p>Ample natural lighting is provided, by metal industrial sash windows part top
hung for ventilation.</p>
<p>Large transit buildings are constructed,&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>with 14&quot; brick walls and 6”
concrete flat roofs carried, on steel joists supported on stanchions and covered
with bituminous felt,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>steel and, asbestos sheet walls (with 5’ dwarf brick
walls) and north light roofs on steel trusses, covered with corrugated asbestos
sheeting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both types have concrete floors asphalt covered.</p>
<p>The buildings mentioned under (i) and (ii) above are well intermingled i.e.
buildings suitable for industrial work are never far from buildings which are
suitable purely as stores. Many of the 123 buildings shown as being suitable for
stores are provided with rail and road access. The construction of the large
buildings suitable for stores is such that 1 ton blocks can be fitted at the
present time.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/s2_buildings2_sml.jpg" alt="Road with Buildings" width="400" height="254"><br>
<font size="1">Road with buildings</font></p>
<p>In addition, some of the stores are fitted with electrically operated
travelling one ton cranes. In two buildings hand operated travelling ten ton
cranes are available, and in a third building a hand operated ten ton jib crane
is installed. All of these building equipped with cranes have road and rail
access.</p>
<p>Typical of the large building suitable for industrial work is building 8.B.1,
which is 200x128x18'6&quot; high ‘ This building has both rail and road access
and is equipped with five one ton travelling overhead cranes. The floor area is
2,600 ft.</p>

<p>Most of the services facilities are concentrated in what is known as the
10.A. Group situated at the north end of the factory, near School Lane Gates. In
addition to the central service group,&nbsp; fitters and joiners shops for plant
and building maintenance purposes are distributed throughout the factory. The
fitters shops on the factory have been used primarily to implement the planned
maintenance scheme and are fitted with sufficient equipment to implement that
scheme - lathes, drills, etc. </p>
