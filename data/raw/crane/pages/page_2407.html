      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Before European settlement, 
      as many as 150,000 trumpeter swans lived in the Eastern United States. By 
      the end of the 19th century, they were all dead, victims of pioneer settlers 
      who wanted their meat, or hat-makers who wanted their feathers. (Hatters 
      played a major role in conservation: their use of feathers from the great 
      blue heron and the bald eagle helped spark the formation of the Audubon 
      Society and the passage of laws protecting migratory birds.) </font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Today, 36 nesting 
        pairs of the ghostly trumpeter swans grace the marshes of northern and 
        central Wisconsin, courtesy of a program that began brining the birds 
        home more than 10 years ago. The population has doubled in the past two 
        years, according to Sumner Matteson, an avian ecologist with the Wisconsin 
        Department of Natural Resources (DNR) who works on the reintroduction 
        project. </font>
      <p> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the streams, 
        lakes and marshes of the Eastern United States lost the trumpeter swan, 
        they lost a majestic bird with snowy white feathers whose bills, legs 
        and feet are trimmed in jet black. With a wingspan between 7 and 8 feet, 
        the swan is the largest waterfowl in the United States; males can weigh 
        35 pounds. </font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">"It's an absolutely 
        stunning sight, on a fall morning, in the fog, to see this pure white 
        bird with its black bill," says Matteson. "In these still mornings, it 
        has one of the most haunting calls you'll ever hear."</font>
      <p><font size="+1"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">After 
        two years of false starts, DNR biologists began collecting eggs in Alaska 
        in 1989. The swan's historic breeding range extends in a wide band from 
        the Bering Sea east through most of Canada and south to Missouri, Illinois, 
        and Indiana. The Alaska population was healthy, and removing 50 eggs per 
        year caused no harm.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The eggs were incubated 
        and hatched at the Milwaukee County Zoo. From there, cygnets -- young 
        swans -- went into one of two programs: </font> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="+1"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><font color="#660033"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Captive 
          rearing</font></b><br></font></font></font><font size="+1"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Cygnets 
          were raised in pens on the shore of a pond for 12 weeks. Then they were 
          allowed to roam the entire pond with some flight feathers removed to 
          prevent them from taking wing. After two years on the pond, they were 
          transported to wetlands in northern Wisconsin and released. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="+1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1" color="#660033"><b>Decoy 
          rearing</b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><br>
          Five days after hatching, cygnets were flown to the wetlands, separated 
          into groups of up to 10, and tended for the summer by University of 
          Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate interns. The interns sat inside a blind 
          mounted on an inner tube and tied to a swan decoy and ushered the cygnets 
          to feeding spots. If a great horned owl, coyote, fox, bear or human 
          appeared, the interns played a warning sound on a hidden tape recorder. 
          Matteson says the birds must be taught to fear predators. </font></font></p>
        </blockquote>
      <p><font size="+1"><img src="images/swan2.jpg" vspace="2" alt="swan decoy leads cygnets, followed by student inside of the blind"></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> 
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#660033">Soggy 
        but satisfying: In return for wading around all summer long, wildlife 
        ecology students inside this blind-decoy contraption got to watch a marsh 
        up close and personal while "baby-sitting" groups of cygnets. Goal: to 
        teach cygnets to recognize food, fear danger, and respond to the "follow 
        me" call. <font color="#330033">Courtesy Sumner Matteson.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">Given the recent 
        successes, Matteson expects the population to continue growing, and to 
        reach perhaps 50 pairs in state. The exact goal will be determined by 
        a computer program that hasn't yet been run. </font></p>
      <font size="+1"> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Despite the success, 
        problems remain. The majestic swans are being poisoned from eating lead 
        shot pellets, which still pollute the bottom of wetlands even years after 
        being banned. Just a pellet or two, Matteson says, is enough to kill a 
        swan, or sicken it enough to be easy prey for predators. As old pellets 
        oxidize, they become more toxic, so the "problem will always be with us."</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> And hunters continue 
        to shoot swans, either because they don't know that the bird is protected 
        by federal law, they can't recognize them. (The only white waterbird that 
        might be mistaken for a trumpeter swan is a snow goose, which is less 
        than half the size. Snow geese have black wing feathers; the trumpeter 
        swan's feathers are solid white.) The birds winter in Illinois and Indiana, 
        and the shooters that Matteson calls "vandals" are mainly found in Illinois. 
        The penalty for intentional shooting ranges up to $5,000. </font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Still, the project, 
        which was funded mainly by private donations, is succeeding, says Matteson. 
        The birds have established what he calls "a migratory tradition," and 
        their health indicates that their marshes are in good condition. "Trumpeters 
        are a symbol of nature's majesty, and a wonderful vehicle for promoting 
        wetland conservation in the state," says Matteson. "They're ambassadors."
