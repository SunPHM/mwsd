We turned downstream, passing HMS Belfast on our right. HMS Belfast is a cruiser, and
was launched in March 1938, serving throughout the Second World War. She played a leading
part in the destruction of the German battle cruiser Scharnhorst at the Battle of North
Cape and in the Normandy Landings. After the war, she supported United Nations forces in
Korea and remained in service with the Royal Navy until 1965. In 1971 she was saved for
the nation as a unique and historic reminder of Britain&#146;s naval heritage in the first
half of the twentieth century.</p>

And passing the Tower of London on our left. The Great or White Tower was begun by William
the Conqueror. Since the first foundations were laid more than 900 years ago the castle
has been constantly improved and extended by the addition of other smaller towers, extra
buildings, walls and walkways, gradually evolving into the castle, fortress, prison,
palace, and finally museum and home of the Crown Jewels that it is today. </p>

...before passing through Tower Bridge, which has lifted to allow us through. <span class="artcopy">The bridge was completed
in 1894 and provides an opening 200 feet wide. Its twin towers rise 45 metres above the
Thames. Between the towers stretch a pair of glass-covered walkways that are popular with
tourists. The Bridge was operated by hydraulic pumps driven by steam until 1976, when
electric motors were put into operation; the steam power system is still kept (in good
repair) as a tourist display.</span></p>

The new offices of the Mayor of London and Great London Authority under construction. The
building is expected to open in summer 2002. The design apparently &quot;expresses the
transparency of the democratic process and promotes the image of a modern vibrant world
city&quot;. <span class="artcopy">(See our <a href="../2003/2003tower_bridge.htm">visit
to Tower Bridge in 2003</a> for the completed building.)</span></p>

New flats by the Thames. The banner says that the sub-penthouse is yours, for a mere
£2.3million</p>

Passing over the Thames Tunnel, the first tunnel of the modern age, and the first under
the Thames. It was built by Marc Isambard Brunel at a cost of ten lives and £614,000. It
was completed on the third attempt - the first ran into quicksand and out of money, the
second failed after the Thames broke in twice. The third attempt took fifteen years, was a
national joke, and was only rescued by repeated additional money from the Government. It
was completed on 4 April 1840, and opened by Queen Victoria on 27 January 1843.</p>

A swing bridge, behind which is a lock and the entrance to Limehouse Basin (formerly known
as Regent's Canal Dock), the start of the Regent's Canal, which climbs up round central
London towards Paddington, meeting the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal at Little
Venice.</p>

The Cutty Sark, a three-masted clipper ship that served in the British-Chinese tea trade
through the 1870s, moored at Greenwich since 1957. The circular domed building is the
southern entrance of the Greenwich foot tunnel, built in 1902. &quot;No person may enter
the tunnel in a state of intoxication ... No person shall spit on or upon the tunnel or
its approaches, stairs, lift, passages, or other means of ingress or egress thereto or
therefrom&quot;.</p>

The Old Royal Naval College, with The Queen's House in the centre. The Queen's House was
commissioned by Queen Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I (reigned 1603-25).
Traditionally he is said to have given the Manor of Greenwich to Anne in apology for
having sworn at her in public, after she accidentally shot one of his favourite dogs while
hunting in 1614.</p>

Here we turned and headed back upriver. Here you can see the giant wheel to which is fixed
the gate which is rotated up to protect London against flooding. These ten gates weigh up
to 3000 tonnes each. They protect 45 square miles of low-lying land and 1¼ million people
who live there.</p>

The Dome with Canada Tower and its two new twins - I think the skyline looked much better
before the two newcomers.</p>

Virtually the whole of our route this evening is lined with flats, either converted
warehouses or new additions. Many of the newer ones are hideous. Here the architect
appears to have mistaken the brief for some buildings in Amsterdam, but the result is
better than many.</p>

Tower Bridge lifting for us once again, and looking spectacular lit up with the dying rays
of the sun behind it.</p>
