<P>The Sandhill Cranes of Reifel Bird Sanctuary are very tame
birds, at times to the point that they will beg for handouts of
grain if they see the familiar brown paper bags. This helps in
getting close-ups such as this one, where the bird was waiting
for another serving of food. Here we see the folded wing and the
colour of the feathers that gave the bird its name.</P>

<P>The photo was taken with a 300mm f4.0 on Fuji Superia on a
bright overcast day.</P>
