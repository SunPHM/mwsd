<h2>Taking The Load</h2>
<h3>by Jeremy Davey, ThrustSSC Webmaster and Satellite Communications Manager</h3>
</center>

<p>Saturday 9th November. Engine tests have been scheduled for today as the final check before ThrustSSC takes to the desert
for the first time tomorrow. The test pan is quite a distance across the airbase, and the jet-car is now on its solid
aluminium desert wheels which must be protected at all time by rubber matting. ThrustSSC cannot be towed - there is no
option but to load the car onto its trailer.</p>

<p>ThrustSSC had never been loaded onto the trailer on its aluminium wheels before. The loading
process is complex: step one is to winch the car up backwards until the rear wheels are on the trailer, and the fronts are
on a level part of the side ramps a foot up in the air. The middle ramp used for the rear wheels is then moved out to form
the high part of one side ramp and a second high ramp is brought up on the other side. The car can then be winched the
rest of the way aboard. Unloading is the reverse.</p>

<p>This works well on the rubber-tyred wheels used at Farnborough and in transporting ThrustSSC to Jordan. This morning the
team tried it for the first time on aluminium wheels - and immediately hit the first snag: the keels on the rear wheels
which dig into the desert to give Andy Green a means of steering were doing the same to the rubber. As the car started up
the ramp the rearmost wheel took the full load of the back of the car and cut through the matting. Once both wheels were
on the ramp and shared the load there would be no problem, but the initial hurdle had yet to be overcome.</p>

<p>As a first solution the team tried what had always worked - a crane! With press cameramen and photographers swarming
around the hangar, ThrustSSC was rolled out of the hangar and the largest crane available brought up. However, it was soon
discovered that it did not have the ‘power lowering’ necessary to lower the car gently onto its trailer - just a brake on
the mechanism which would bounce the car around too much.</p>

<p>Back to square one, and looking for a way to use the ramps. The next try involved lifting the rear end onto the trailer
by slinging it from the massive Merlo forklift and rolling the front wheels up the ramps. Again the team hit a problem -
the grip of the steering keels on the rubber was so great that it restricted turning of the steered rear wheels to a
minimum - the car could not turn itself enough to align onto the trailer. As it was hauled up, ThrustSSC came perilously
close to the edge of the ramp: so it was back down to the ground again.</p>

<p>The answer was to align the car, ramps and trailer extremely accurately before attempting to load up. The ramps were
aligned with the car, and Transport Manager Brian Palmer skillfully reversed the trailer exactly into position. Finally
ThrustSSC rolled happily up the ramps and into place on the trailer - seeming to make a mockery of the day’s struggles.</p>

<p>Sadly by now it was far too late to try for the engine tests - by the time the car was unloaded at the test pan it
would be dark: great for photography, not so good for checking out the car. So it’s engine tests tomorrow, and desert runs
on Monday. As people keep saying round here: <em>"If record-breaking was easy, everyone would be doing it!"</em></p>
