        to detail and adherence to stringent quality control procedures, both 
        during fabrication and erection, resulted in the successful completion 
        of the Trident Steel warehouse in Saldanha.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif">The large warehouse, built 
        to accommodate Trident Steel&#8217;s coil slitting facility at Saldanha, 
        has a length of 159 metres, width of 128 metres and a height at eaves 
        of 13.3 metres. A total of 1126 t of steel was used in the fabrication 
        of this warehouse structure. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif"><img src="../photos/trident2.jpg" alt="Trident Steel - interior" width="232" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="right">Hein 
        Buys, contracts manager at Cosira International, says that the structure 
        houses four separate crane lines which carry two 40 t and two 30 t cranes. 
        The crane girders were fabricated and welded automatically using submerged 
        arc welding technology.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif"> </font><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif"> 
        &#8220;By using this particular welding process we can ensure the structural 
        integrity of these girders, and this is obviously of importance when it 
        comes to the fabrication of crane lines such as these,&#8221; Buys says.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif">In addition to ensuring the 
        structural integrity of these girders, the fabrication process used by 
        Cosira resulted in the tolerance of 5 mm being achieved on the crane rails 
        which are fitted to the crane girders. Buys says that the close tolerance 
        achieved was independently verified by Demag Germany who used a specialised 
        machine to inspect the crane lines.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif">Logistics also played 
        an important role on this project as the fabricated steel had to be taken 
        via road from Cosira&#8217;s Heriotdale facility to Saldanha, a distance 
        of 1575 km. The company makes use of internal quality management systems 
        which assisted in ensuring that all aspects of the project ran according 
        to the pre-planned erection schedule.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif"> The building was 
        designed by Pretoria based EDS Engineering and the project consultants 
        were Capex Projects. The warehouse was completed at the end of November 
        2003.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma, sans-serif, SansSerif">Cosira International 
        is the largest privately owned structural steel fabricating company, and 
        operates three facilities in Heriotdale. The company is ISO 9001:2000 
        accredited, and has completed work for most of the major mining houses 
        and industrial property developers.</font></p>
