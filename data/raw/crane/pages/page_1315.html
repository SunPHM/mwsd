<H1>Germany, Sweden, and Finland in 1999</H1>

<H2>March 3rd - March 10th, 1999</H2>

<P> 
Just after midnight on March 3rd, Beno&icirc;t, Gernot and myself
started driving north. We wanted to include a short visit to Berlin,
and ultimately stay in Stockholm for a few days, where 
<A HREF="http://www.sbox.tu-graz.ac.at/home/k/kflorian/">Flo</A> 
studied for one year. We also planned a day trip to Helsinki.

<P>

However, at this time we didn't know that several complications would
arise. The first one was in the Czech Republic, near
<STRONG>Teplice</STRONG>, where Gernot drove through an enormous hole
around a gully crate in the street, and eventually one tyre went flat
(sorry, no picture). With the spare tyre we went to Berlin.

Gernot took lots of photographs of the vast construction sites in
Berlin. The tubes you see are everywhere in Berlin's center. They are
used to pump water out of the construction sites.

All those constructions have obviously given rise to secondary

Berlin, also for large groups"...

Finally, between Norrköping and Nyköping, we had a car crash. Gernot
wanted to overtake a truck, but it came nearer (sideways) and braking
resulted in the car going to the right into the crash barrier,
spinning around and coming to rest on the middle strip of the
motorway. This was at about 4am.

Here you can see how close we avoided desaster: The crash rail ended
about one or two meters after the spot where we bumped into it. If we
crashed three meters later, our car would have gone down a slope.

The car was towed to Nyköping. I want to thank all the nice people who
helped us.

We spent most of the day in Nyköping trying to find out whether we
should fix the car or scrap it and which insurance would pay and which
would not pay and be unfriendly at the same time. On this day we also
learned that it's not easy to find a public phone in Sweden.

The guy to my right is the scrap metal dealer, who finally bought the
car for a reasonable price. The guy next to Gernot is the head of the
repairs department of the company. A big thank you to him - he spent
most of his time at that day for us. Also a big thank you to everyone
at the garage in Nyköping, to Malin at the nearby hotel, to the police
who let us stay at their station until the garage opened, and to the
woman at the cafe, who helped us with finding a phone.

In Stockholm's "Gamla Stan" (old town). The only bad thing about
Stockholm is the expensive night life. Also strange is that there is a
security guy at almost every pub, restaurant or bar. Usually you must
give him your coat and of course you have to pay for that.

Gamla Stan seen from the boat. I was surprised to see so many old
houses, which are mostly in a very good state. I like the laid-back
atmosphere there very much, and the houses look very friendly.

This is on top of the "Viking Lines" ferry. This is the biggest ship
I've ever been on. It has over ten floors, and includes a nightclub, a
disco, several restaurants, a duty free shop, and some more
stuff. Amazing, I've never danced in a disco on a moving ship before!
When going to Helsinki there were lots of very young folks abourd, who
were obviously not used to drinking... It smelled like vomit
everywhere in that disco. :-(

I woke up when I thought the ship had an accident (which I really
expected after all the bad luck we had on this trip). Fortunately it
was just ice: Huge ice blocks floating on the water! The cheap rooms
we had were approximately near sea-level, so we had the full sound
experience.

like Steven Spielberg on this picture. Maybe I can sell it to the
yellow press.

Here we come, Helsinki! While Gernot and Beno&icirc;t went
sightseeing, I visited the <A
HREF="http://www.tcs.hut.fi/pub/smodels/">smodels group</A> at <A
HREF="http://www.hut.fi">Helsinki University of Technology</A>. I
talked very long with <A
HREF="http://saturn.hut.fi/%7Epsimons/">Patrik Simons</A>, who is a
really nice guy. In the evening we boarded the ship again, and had a
nice Sauna and Jacuzzi experience on it.
<BR CLEAR="all">
</P>

<P>
On the next day, Gernot and Beno&icirc;t immidiately boarded a bus to
Prague, while I had time to visit the Museum of Modern Art and collect
my stuff. My train left at 4 (the bus at 10), but still we met each
other again on the ferry from Sweden to Germany. The only drawback on
the train was that one beer was about 5 times the price of the beer in
the czech bus. A nice thing is that the train goes onto the ferry and
leaves it again while you sleep. Bad thing: The train was delayed and
I couldn't catch my follow-up connection in Berlin. Fortunately I only
had to wait for 2 hours.

<P>
To sum it up: I recommend that trip, but only if you leave your car at home.
