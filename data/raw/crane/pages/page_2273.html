<FONT SIZE =3> When Carlos Solano came into Maureen "Mo" Nickels' fourth-grade class last fall, his first words were, "I hate science."<P>

 The class laughed recently as they remembered those words. Little did Carlos and the others realize that they were in for a year-long science adventure.<P>

 It took only three weeks for Carlos to change his mind. Now he says he likes science, especially learning about birds. He will go crane watching for the first time in a few weeks.<P>

 The Wasmer fourth-graders unanimously agreed that their teacher is like Miss Frizzle on "The Magic School Bus," a cartoon show in which a teacher takes her class on a series of wonderful field trips.<P>

 "I think Mrs. Nickels is a really good teacher. Other classes don't get to go where she takes us," said Diana Castilleja.<P>

 By the end of the year, the class will have taken about seven field trips, including three to the Platte River, two to Stuhr Museum and one each to the library and Lincoln.<P>

 "It seems we're always on the go looking for drivers," Nickels said.<P>

 The trips are not just for fun and games.<P>

 When Nickels teaches about rivers, the kids go to the river. When they learn about prairies, they visit the prairie. A series of guest speakers also supplements the lessons.<P>

 "I'm a person who truly believes kids need hands-on things," Nickels said. "There's so much in the world of nature that they've not experienced."<P>

 The students seem to love it. In a recent visit to the classroom, they told about splashing in the river, catching crayfish and toads and seeing plants they'd never seen before.<P>

 "I got to catch a crayfish, and I saw a big snake eating a frog," said Grant Norman.<P>

 Malory Majorins said she found a caterpillar that they had studied in a slide show. She kept it until it turned into a butterfly.<P>

 Aaron Hamilton said he's learned that most people aren't allergic to goldenrod but to the rag weed that grows around it.<P>

 Malina Bartlett said she found a deer bed and tracks.<P>

 "Mrs. Nickels made us learn by getting messy and making mistakes," said Tim Thorton.<P>

 She's not like other teachers because she keeps tree frogs in her classroom, Tim said. Other teachers are afraid of things like that.<P>

 "It's really my bag," Nickels said. "I like nature."<P>

 She wasn't always that way. Nickels said she grew up mostly indoors. It wasn't until she met her husband, an avid outdoorsman, that she began to appreciate nature.<P>

 It was 10 years ago that she began bringing her students outdoors for learning.<P>

 Students learn better when they can see and experience the things they are studying in the classroom, she said.<P>

 While other schools may offer such programs for gifted students, Nickels said, it's the students who have learning or behavioral problems who benefit the most from this type of teaching.<P>

 On a field trip, all of the students explore and experiment at the same level. Often, it's the gifted kids who are afraid to touch fish and pick up frogs, she said. The resource kids and average students are "right in there digging."<P>

 Being outdoors brings a calmness to life as well as creativity, she said.<P>

 One of her exercises at Crane Meadows Nature Center is to have the students spread out in the tall prairie grasses for five minutes of quiet time. They sit and listen to nature for two minutes and then write about what they've experienced.<P>

 "All of a sudden, nature just pops out," she said. Students write things such as they'd never heard the wind before.<P>

 When she sees children experiencing nature like that, Nickels said it gives her the willies.<P>

 "They too get the willies, and they start to write," she said.<P>

 Being outside not only helps the students learn their science lessons but teaches them life lessons as well.<P>

 "Life really is an adventure and journey and taking different paths," Nickels said.<P>
