Due to exceptionally dry and warm weather, construction of the 2001 GMWP house was begun in October 2000.  The footings were dug by R. P. Beard and Son Inc.  Brother Pittman Beard and his son Brother Ronnie Beard are both members of Union Lodge #38.  Concrete was poured by a crew from Botkin Construction; Brother Gary Botkin, owner of the company, is an Entered Apprentice Mason of Union Lodge #38.

<P>The Foundation was built by Brother Raymond Powers (Past Master of now defunct Oakdale Lodge and current member of Emerald Lodge #377 in Wartburg);  Brother Powers is shown in the photo at right laying block.

On Friday November 24, GMWP Director Brother Tom Boduch led the future homeowners, <A HREF="http://www.gmwp.org/2001/siteandfamily.html">the McElroy Family</A> and other volunteers in building the sub-floor.  In late October, Bro. Boduch and the McElroys had built the walls in 12 foot sections.  On Saturday December 9, the walls were raised.  Shown in the photo at left are (from left to Right), Paul, Darlene and Jeremy McElroy, Mr. Jonathan Brile, Union Lodge #38 Treasurer Bro. D. C. Martin, Andy McKissack and his father, Paint Rock Lodge #367 Worshipful Master Brother David McKissack.  Standing in the doorway in the background is dedicated Roane HFH volunteer Mr. Ed Brinner;  Ed had previously belonged to a DeMolay Chapter.

<P>Also assisting was newly installed Union Lodge #38 Worshipful Master Brother Ross Hickey.  Other Volunteers included Roane County HFH 2000 co-volunteer of the year Tad Tadlock, HFH Treasurer Franz Raetzer, Roane HFH homeowner Linda Schultz and her son Andrew (Linda's house is concurrently under construction, and is being built by <A HREF="http://www.gmwp.org/roanehfh/womenbuild">all women</A>).  Representing the First Baptist Church of Kingston were Larry Billings, Bill Morton and Ron Eckstrom.  In summer of 2000, the First Baptist Church sponsored and built Roane HFH's 22nd home.  Their Mission Group also installs roof trusses on Roane HFH houses.  Many Union Lodge members attend this Church and serve of committees, as deacons and ushers.

<P>
This day was truly a day of "Masonry in Motion--Ritual in Action," as the Roane County Scottish Rite Club hosted its annual Shoe Party at Union Lodge #38 just 2 HFH houses up from the building site.   Nearly 200 needy school children were fitted with a pair of shoes, and also were provided with a small Christmas basket and a hot dog, chili and coke.
