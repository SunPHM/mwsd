Frank Caldwell &#039 42 maintains that reminder of his experience as a unit leader who survived six wounds during the 36 days of that gruesome World War II campaign.

Following V-E Day, they discovered each other, and had a mini Davidson reunion in Germany with Calhoun Hipp &#039 43, who was also there.<BR><BR>Patton (l) participated in a veteran&#039s panel on Friday afternoon along with <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-panel.JPG>(l-r) Sam Maloney &#039 48, Dick O&#039Hair &#039 47,Bill Rogers &#039 46, and Frank Caldwell &#039 42</a>. Among those in the audience was proud veteran <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-gibbs.JPG>Charles Gibbs &#039 48</a>, whose 24th Marine division suffered through the battle of Iwo Jima. History professor Earl Edmondson introduced the panel with a relic of his youth, <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-edmondson.JPG>a helmet</a> that he and his childhood friends used in playing Army.<BR><BR>The panelists recalled stories of tragedy and triumph, and memorialized their college friends who were killed in the fighting. Rogers, a clergyman who flew fighter planes in the South Pacific, offered free copies of <I>Outcast Red</I>, a novel he wrote based on those experiences. He told the audience, "It was a terrible price to pay. The whole experience for me was trying to figure out how you relate the losses to whatever you gain in war."<BR><BR>Dick O&#039Hair &#039 47 recalled Napoleon&#039s words, "War is a fable we all agree upon." He said he still feels the pain of losing three roommates in the fighting--John Barron, Tommy Peters, and Bill Lymon. He noted that the most positive aspect of the experience for him, a platoon leader whose duty included being the first to emerge from his foxhole to charge the enemy, was learning how to hide your fear. He said, "As frightened as you were of the enemy, you were more frightened that your men would discover how frightened you were." <BR><BR><a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-audience.JPG>As (l-r) Max Polley and Dick Port &#039 47 listened</a>, Frank Caldwell &#039 42 remembered being commissioned into the service on the day of his Davidson graduation. His Marine unit landed on Iwo Jima on D-Day, and he survived all 36 days of the horrible battle there. Caldwell landed with 257 men, most of whom he had known for a full year and come to think of as family, and left with only 44. 101 of his men were killed, and 113 were wounded.<BR><BR><a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-maloney.JPG>Sam Maloney &#039 48</a>, James Sprunt professor <i>emeritus</i> of religion, flew in the 494th bomber group in the South Pacific, and told the tale of their most significant mission. On the day following Maloney&#039s final mission, two of the group&#039s bombers were shot down over Japan. Several crew members survived by bailing out. They were captured, and taken to a regional police headquarters for questioning. Their city of internment was Hiroshima, and the fliers were incinerated in the atomic bomb blast several days later. A memorial to the 10 Americans who died in the blast has been erected in the city.<BR><BR>Following the presentation, <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-huffines.JPG>(l-r) David Huffines &#039 42 and President Emeritus Sam Spencer &#039 40</a> spoke to each other. <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-gray.JPG>John Gray &#039 49</a> displayed medals he earned in World War II and as a survivor of the Chosin Reservoir campaign in the Korean War. <BR><BR><a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-penick.JPG>George Penick &#039 70</a>, president of the Alumni Association, introduced as the next speaker for the day <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-crane1.JPG>Conrad Crane</a>, professor of military strategy at the U.S. Army War College. Crane, author of a book about air power strategy in World War II and Korea, talked about the moral dilemmas and arguments for and against bombing civilian targets. Following his presentation, he was quizzed by <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-crane2.JPG>(l-r) Sam Maloney &#039 48, Dr. Elliot White &#039 44, and Dr. Alex Goley &#039 52</a>. <BR><BR><Table align="right" width="239"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-sailor.jpg" ALT="Eustace Smith" ALIGN=center VALIGN=top WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="316" BORDER="0"></TD><BR></TR> <BR><TR> <TD align="center" valign="top"><font size="1"><b><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Among the many WWII veterans who returned was Eustace Smith &#039 42 (l), one of the few who retained his service uniform--and could still fit in it!<BR></font></b></font><BR><hr></TD></TR> </Table><BR><BR>The afternoon&#039s World War II program was capped by the third annual Alumni Association Distinguished Lecture, delivered by <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-denham.JPG>Scott Denham</a>, professor of German. Denham spoke about "The Holocaust and World War II." He discussed the cultural effect of "war stories," and how they become myth and generalization over time. He also noted that the war stories presented by survivors don&#039t tell the complete picture of the conflict. He asked, "How do we validate the good works of some survivors without forgetting the horror felt by the dead?"<BR><BR>President Robert Vagt &#039 69 followed Denham with a "state of the college" address for a room full of interested alumni. He spoke privately with many of them following his talk, including <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-vagt2.JPG>(l-r) Jack Stevenson &#039 52 and Ed Mack &#039 37</a>.<BR><BR>Alumni were then freed for an evening of parties and celebration. The Class of &#039 52 gathered on the front lawn of the President&#039s House. <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-52chairs.JPG>Eric Clark &#039 52 and Tom Stockton &#039 52</a> were reunion chairs. Their Golden Anniversary class was entertained by the "Dismembered Tenneseeans" bluegrass band. Band members <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-52band.JPG>(l-r) Ansley Moses &#039 52 and Fletcher Bright &#039 53</a> grew up next door to each other in Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and started making music together 55 years ago! During their Davidson years, they performed with a group known as the Cripple Creek Boys. <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-52picture.JPG>Bill White &#039 52 and friends</a> tried to identify faces of 50 years ago as they examined a picture of their freshman class that Bill brought along. <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-beanie.JPG>Joe Neal &#039 52</a> was sporting his carefully maintained freshman beanie! As the shadows lengthened across front campus, class members enjoyed getting reacquainted. <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-52chatting.JPG>(l-r) Rip Bernhardt &#039 52 talked with Frederick Spach &#039 52 and his spouse, Gerri Spach</a>. <BR><BR>Over in Chambers Gallery, <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-77chairs.JPG>(l-r) Rob Hutchinson &#039 77 and Ann Wicker &#039 77</a> organized their classmates for the big two-five celebration. Featured speaker for the evening was Fox News Channel broadcaster Tony Snow &#039 77, who cleverly bashed elected officials on both sides of the political fence. Snow kept his remarks brief, leaving his long-time friends with plenty of time for <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-77dinner.JPG>conversations</a>. Friends recalled Snow&#039s macabre political career at Davidson, claiming that he campaigned for SGA President by dressing up as John F. Kennedy and riding around in a green Mustang convertible with a woman dressed as Jackie O. until a friend wielding a cap gun concluded their bit of theatre. <BR><BR>The Class of &#039 32 convened for its 70th reunion dinner in the DuPont Room through the efforts of class secretary Roger Enloe &#039 32, <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-32dinner.JPG>pictured here (l)</a> at their Friday night dinner with classmates (l-r) Joseph Houston, Paul Hudgins, and Foy McDavid.<BR><BR>The Class of &#039 62 gathered at Vail Commons under the leadership of <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-leonard.JPG> Habitat for Humanity International Board Chair Paul Leonard</a> &#039 62. Two illustrious classmates who returned for the festivities were "the Martin boys," <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-martins.JPG>(l-r) D.G. Martin and Joe Martin</a>. D.G. served as the evening&#039s master of ceremonies. President Vagt spoke at the reception, and offered some statistics about the class at the time of their matriculation. He said when they arrived at Davidson in 1958 they were from 19 states and 9 foreign countries, John W. Kuykendall &#039 59 was SGA president, members of the class serenaded President Grier Martin on his birthday, and the class had the highest SAT average in the south (1102)!<BR><BR><a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-workman.JPG>Opera singer Bill Workman &#039 62</a> led the class in the national anthem and the <i>alma mater</i>, and <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-freeman.JPG>Charles Freeman &#039 62</a> offered an invocation that brought a smile to D.G.&#039s face. The program included an "interlude" from <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-robinson.JPG>Joe Robinson &#039 62</a>, oboist with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He joked, "I didn&#039t want to play tonight, but they always make me play for my supper." Both Workman and Robinson were presented with framed drawings of Chambers Building for their participation in the evening&#039s program.<BR><BR>Martin then introduced as speaker for the evening <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-fowler.JPG>Wyche Fowler &#039 62</a>, who recently concluded six years of service as U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Martin introduced Fowler as "The Night Mayor of Atlanta." Fowler accepted the title, and revealed its origin. As a student at Emory Law School, he called the Mayor&#039s office one evening and got no answer. When he called back during office hours, he told officials that city hall was a public building and should be open all the time, and at least have a duty officer at night. Fowler himself eventually took that position. During a subsequent press interview he called himself "the night mayor of Atlanta." The paper quoted him on that, to the consternation of the legitimate full-time mayor!<BR><BR>Fowler reminisced about the campaign that launched his political career: his race for SGA president at Davidson. George Trask &#039 62 defeated him with "the most brilliant political strategy I have ever faced..." Trask took his junior year abroad, and had a proxy do his campaigning!<BR><BR>Fowler, who was posted to Saudi Arabia by President Clinton in 1996, said the United States has had a strong friendship with Saudi Arabia since 1945. He said the Saudis have a unique culture and religion. "Arguably, there is no place in the world that cares more for the historic family, and the women&#039s role in that family," he said. "Family is at the heart of their love security and existence." He pointed out that to Saudis, the separation of church and state is unthinkable. Since the holy Muslim cities of Mecca and Medina are within their borders, Saudis see themselves as custodians of Islam for the three billion people that practice the religion all over the world. <BR><BR>Fowler said three major issues must be resolved to quell the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: 1) the existence of two states; 2) the right of return for refugees; 3) a resolution of Jerusalem&#039s status. Israelis want Jerusalem as their capital, but it is also the third most important city in Islam. Fowler said that only the United States can lead the political negotiations, and only the United States can create a coalition that will support a subsequent peace. <BR><BR>Saturday morning began with the traditional Alumni Cake Race. About three dozen runners sprinted away from the starting line when <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-fagg.jpg>Dave Fagg &#039 58 fired the gun</a>. The <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-cakerace.JPG>leaders</a> were looking good as they cruised down the sidewalk along Main Street. Former cross-country runner <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-browne.JPG>Howard Browne &#039 82</a> was among the early finishers. After the adults cleared the track, it was time for <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-kidsrun.JPG>future Wildcats</a> to take their turn in a one-lap race. <BR><BR><Table align="left" width="265"><TR><TD><IMG SRC="http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-colorguard.jpg" ALT="ROTC color guard" ALIGN=center VALIGN=top WIDTH="265" HEIGHT="348" BORDER="0"></TD><BR></TR> <BR><TR> <TD align="center" valign="top"><font size="1"><b><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Cadets from Davidson&#039s ROTC department provided a color guard for the ceremonies honoring World War II Veterans.<BR></font></b></font><BR><hr></TD></TR> </Table><BR><BR>War veterans and others gathered at the college&#039s World War II memorial behind Elm Row a little later for a ceremony in honor of all those who served during the conflict. Many who gathered had been on hand when the memorial was dedicated five years ago. <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-port.JPG>Dick Port &#039 47</a> gave introductory remarks to the crowd of about 100 veterans and their spouses <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-memorialcrowd.JPG>who attended</a>. President Vagt <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-vagt.JPG>thanked</a> the 2,450 alumni who fought the war effort, and asked "To what end was this effort, pain, suffering, and heroism?" He replied, "Time has passed and we still vote, still live lives of personal freedom, live where we choose, and worship as we see fit. More importantly than your recognition as the &#039Greatest Generation,&#039 you set the standard for how we protect our rights."<BR><BR><a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-merrell.JPG>Matt Merrell &#039 84</a>, alumni director, told the story of Rufus Geddie Herring, the college&#039s only Medal of Honor winner. Herring was credited with saving the lives of several comrades when the landing craft he piloted was struck by enemy fire during the landing at Okinawa. Merrell compiled that story, and many others from alumni, into a paperback book entitled, <I>Soldiers and Sentinels: Davidson&#039s World War II Veterans Speak</I>, which is for sale through the alumni office.<BR><BR>Herring&#039s son, Stanley, was a guest of honor at the ceremony. Stanley brought along <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-herring.JPG>a picture of his late father</a>, and lit a candle of remembrance in honor of all alumni who served. Another guest of honor was <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-wheeler.JPG>Patty Wheeler</a>, whose Davidson alumni father was lost at sea in the submarine service when she was just three months old. She talked about her quest to get to know more about her father, and hoped some of his classmates present at the ceremony could tell her something about his years at Davidson.<BR><BR><a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-memorial.JPG> Many took time after the ceremony</a> to scan the list of 159 names of Davidsonians killed during the war and remember those friends. <BR><BR>Many alumni and many others then gathered in Love Auditorium to hear a talk by <a href=http://www2.davidson.edu/news/news_imgs/0204_reunion-kedem.JPG>Zev Kedem</a>, a survivor of the Holocaust. Kedem told a horrifying and wrenching tale of the disintegration of his happy childhood after the Nazis occupied his native Poland.
