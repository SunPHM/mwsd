This is why Texas has somany types of trees, grasses, flowers, and other forms of vegetation.These conditions also affect the way people live.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Wildflowers, brush, trees, bushes, nativegrasses, and other wild plants are types of natural vegetation inTexas. They grow without any help of the natives. These plants havemany important jobs such as preventing erosion, proving food foranimals, and making the country beautiful. </FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Along the humid and tropical Gulf coast ofSouth Texas, palm trees and blossoming flowers decorate thelandscape. Grasses cover the dry plains of South Texas. Mesquitetrees complete for space with cacti and shrubs. In Central Texas, thepecan tree lives besides rivers and in neighborhood yards and parks.The pecan tree is the states flower. Far West Texas is so dry thatonly the plants requiring small amounts of water can survive. Someexamples of these are cacti, grasses, and yucca dot.</FONT></P><H3><CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/img0068.jpg" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></H3><H3><FONT COLOR="#0033FF">Animals&nbsp;</FONT></H3><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Texas is home to a broad array of wildanimals. The whooping crane and the armadillo are two famous animalsTexas is known for. Three or four million deer roam through Texas.The state also has thousands of prong horn antelope. Alligators arefound in the wetlands and mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes alsolive in Texas. </FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since 1973 Texas has legally protected sometypes of animals to help with ensuring that that type of animal willnot disappear. These species are called endangered. Threatenedspecies are those that are likely to become endangered in the future.An example, is the horned lizards. The horned lizard used to livealmost everywhere in Texas, but they have disappeared from East Texasand South Texas. Two out of three of the species of horned lizardsare considered threatened.</FONT></P><H4><CENTER><A HREF="page_3b.html"><FONT COLOR="#CC0000">Return toTexas home page</FONT></A></CENTER></H4></BODY></HTML>
