			<B>A.</B> They are named for their <A HREF="/jnorth/sounds/craneWCEP_uc.wav">whooping

            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><A NAME="7"></A><B>Q. Why do cranes have such an elaborate courtship dance?</B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> The courtship rituals help forge and strengthen pair bonds. The courtship
			consists of calling, wing flapping, head bowing, and tremendous leaps into the air
			by one of both birds. These dances occur not only before mating, but also may occur
			as whoopers defend their territories or simply release tension. See <A HREF="http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/crane/Archibald.html">Dancing
			With the Cranes</A>. <BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="8"></A><B>Q. How is a whooping crane's body adapted to its lifestyle and
			habitat?</B> <BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> A crane has a very reduced back toe, so it won't get tangled in wetland
			vegetation, but this also means it can't perch in trees. A crane has a long, slender
			beak so that it can reach into deep water or through dense wetland vegetation to
			pull out crabs, plants, and other food on the bottom of shallow water. A crane's
			long legs allow it to see above tall, dense marsh vegetation. Such long legs help
			it walk in rivers and shallow lakes. Black tips on its flight feathers provide the
			pigments that strengthen the feathers right where they are most vulnerable to wear
			and tear in flight. <A HREF="/jnorth/tm/crane/Adaptations.html">Read more here</A>,
			and do a fun activity.<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="9"></A><B>Q. Do cranes travel together when they migrate? </B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> Even with so many cranes leaving within a short time period, whooping cranes
			do not travel together. They leave in small groups of 2 or 3, at staggered starting
			times. Sometimes, two such units will join forces; possibly 5 cranes, or occasionally
			a few more, may be flying together--but not the entire flock. <BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="10"></A><B>Q. What might be some advantages for whooping cranes to migrate
			in very small groups rather than big flocks?</B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> One advantage is fewer of the birds would get hurt if an accident occurs.
			The cranes can't afford for a large group of them to die. Finding food is easier
			for a smaller group than for a whole flock. Smaller groups can fly at different rates
			to help the inexperienced flyers. Cranes traveling in small groups can hide more
			easily from predators that might kill them. And it might be easier for a small group
			to find a place to rest.<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="11"></A><B>Q. Do all the whoopers leave at the same time from their Texas
			winter home?</B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> No. When a territorial pair departs, their neighbors begin to leave shortly
			afterwards. Departures are never randomly spread across the wintering grounds. Instead,
			they occur in clumped patterns. <BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="12"></A><B>Q. When cranes travel, do the groups with inexperienced flyers
			leave sooner than adult cranes because the flight may take them longer?</B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> Tom Stehn, Journey North's crane expert, doesn't think so. Some
			adults leading a young on migration are among the first to leave;
			that is because they
			are already an established pair and become ready to nest earlier
			than more inexperienced birds. Last year's young may not know the
			landmarks	and route for their migration,
			but they are strong fliers. <BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="13"></A><B>Q. What do whooping cranes eat?</B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> They eat mostly crabs, crayfish, frogs and other small aquatic life.
			They rarely eat fish. On the wintering grounds, <a href="/jnorth/tm/crane/BlueCrabs.html">blue
			crabs</a> are the
			whoopers'	favorite food item. Blue crabs in their diet are important
			in helping	cranes	build up enough
			energy reserves to have a successful nesting season. <BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="14"></A><B>Q. What happens to cranes when blue crabs are in scarce supply?</B>
			<BR>
			<BR>
            <B>A.</B> It means possible low egg/chick production the next summer. About 
      half of the whoopers failed to nest in 1994, when blue crabs had been scarce. 
      Experts think this was because the cranes weren't in good enough condition. 
      Low crab supplies in 2000 probably led to the low production in summer 2001. 
      When blue <A HREF="/jnorth/tm/crane/CrabConnection.html">crabs are in trouble, 
      cranes are in trouble.</A><BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="15"></A><B>Q. What do cranes eat when getting ready for their migration?</B><BR>
			<BR>
			<B>A.</B> Whooping cranes eat a wide variety of foods, but they concentrate on blue
			crabs while putting on body fat and protein before their long journey north. <A HREF="/jnorth/tm/crane/BlueCrabs.html">Blue
			crab</A> is simply the right stuff, with the best balance of nutrients. They're very
			high in protein and fat, as are many other things that cranes eat. A crane's beak
			is so well adapted to getting the meat out of crabs that cranes tend to take a lot
			of crabs.<BR>
