In the         past century, the bog has become a refuge for animals that otherwise would         have become extinct. As city development spreads into the lands these         animals call home, their lives continue to be threatened. </p>	      <p>Not all animals within the bog&#146;s boundaries thrive within its acidic-peat         center. The areas near the bog&#146;s borders feature forested regions         that have grown for centuries. As a result, Burns Bog is home to many         one-of-a-kind animals.</p>      <p>This diverse landscape, with high dry areas and low wetlands, makes Burns         Bog home for an array of animal life. The bog is a haven for many of its         tenants. Its occupants include over <b>150 species of birds</b>. One of         these is the endangered <b>Greater Sandhill Crane</b>. This magnificent         bird is on the endangered species list as only 600 are left in all of         British Columbia. The Greater Sandhill Crane uses the bog for migration         and spends about four months in the bog before heading south for the winter.         But the time here is well spent as this bird builds its nest on mats of         <b>sphagnum</b>. Greater Sandhill Cranes can grow to stand shoulder height         to a full-grown human. These waterfowl use the wetlands for their nesting         and feeding grounds. Flocks of these birds used to blacken the sky, but         now only 20 Greater Sandhill Cranes are left in this part of the country.       </p>      <p align="center"><img src="/supergraphics/bog/images/crane_sketch.jpg" width="422" height="278"> </p>      <p>Burns Bog is a critical refuge for many species, particularly the Greater         Sandhill Crane. The land is vital to its survival. One pair of cranes         needs at least 800 acres of land in order to survive. </p>      <p>Burns Bog offers almost <b>10,000 acres of habitat</b> for this endangered         species. </p>				<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="0" align="right">		<tr>		  <td><img src="/supergraphics/bog/images/frog.jpg" width="200" height="160"></td>		</tr>		<tr>		  <td class="small" align="right">A bog frog.<br>            photo courtesy of the<br>            <a href="http://www.burnsbog.org" target="_blank">Burns Bog Conservation Society</a>.<br></td>			</tr>		<tr>		  <td><img src="/supergraphics/bog/images/goose.jpg" width="200" height="167"></td>		</tr>		<tr>		  <td class="small" align="right">A bashful bog goose.<br>            photo courtesy of the<br>            <a href="http://www.burnsbog.org" target="_blank">Burns Bog Conservation Society</a>.</td>			</tr>		</table>				<table class="actiontable" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="300" border="0">		<tr>		<td>		      <p>Burns Bog’s land area supports more than 28 species of mammals.
