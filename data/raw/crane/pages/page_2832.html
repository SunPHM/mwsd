<p>Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) is the largest of the permanent residents.  It is mainly grayish with a pale or yellowish bill.  Unlike the Sandhill Crane, the Great Blue Heron flies with its neck folded, rather than extended.  Because of its size, the Great Blue Heron feeds on a variety of prey including large fish, frogs, mice, small birds, and insects.  This variety of food sources allows the Great Blue Heron to stay at the Refuge throughout the year.</p>
