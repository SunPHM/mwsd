<P>Visits in past years to several different parts of our state
and country in late April and early May have rewarded us with
some of the most awe-inspiring panoramas of thousands upon
thousands of wildflowers.  A camping trip from late April through
the first week of May in 1975 at the Great Smoky National Park
found that incredible botanical paradise with mountainsides
carpeted with &quot;seas&quot; of spring beauties and other
wildflowers.

<P>It was on this past May 6 that Charlotte and I were taken by
our friends, Phil and Marilyn Hansotia, to see the large-flowered
trillium extravaganza at the Powers Bluff County Park south of
Marshfield, Wis.  Seventy acres of this rich botanical site have
been designated a State Natural Area containing great
biodiversity and requiring special attention and protection.
Prior to that memorable visit we had been of the opinion that our
Houby Hill Woods had quite a few thousands of these immaculate
large members of the lily family and was a pretty special
wildflower environment at this time of the year.

<P>What a breath-taking sight of tens of thousands of giant
trilliums, carpets of white, lay in store for visitors to enjoy
at Powers Bluff.  Where the woods was more open, there the
trilliums were most abundant.  Even though these and many other
so-called spring ephemerals do quite well beneath a thick canopy
of leaves during the summer, by far the most luxuriant masses of
especially the trilliums were found where less underbrush
occurred.

<P>One can kneel at the edge of one of these trillium expanses,
examine the plants carefully and easily see several different age
groups of these widespread members of the lily family.  They will
range from very tiny single-leaved plants in their first year,
followed by many two-to-three-inch, typical three-leaved plants
lacking blossoms, and finally to blossom-producing plants of
quite a few different sizes.

<P>The very first blossoming large-flowered trilliums in our
woods every spring are quite small, often no more than four to
five inches tall.  The very tallest of the trilliums are
invariably the last to blossom and can occasionally reach over 20
inches in height.  Their generally most-accepted common name,
large-flowered trillium, is based upon their scientific name of
<I>Trillium grandiflorum</I>, referring to three in a whorl and
large-flowered. Visit other parts of their range throughout
eastern U.S. and surely you will come upon other common names
including the great white and the giant trillium.

<P>Carefully examine a flowering plant to see that the three
leaves are without stalks, or nearly so, and that the
flower-stalk is at an angle to the stem.  The pollen of rigid
upright blossoms could conceivably receive damage from rain
including all of their pollen being washed off the stamens.  This
is only a guess as to why the flower-stalk is angled.

<P>About 25 species of trilliums are native of temperate North
America and eastern Asia.  Some botanists feel this genus is best
represented in the U.S. in the southern Appalachian Mountains.
The trillium that Charlotte and I enjoyed in the Smokies was
<I>Trillium luteum</I> (LOU-tee-um), a yellow variety.  Its
blossoms are upright and its leaves are mottled, quite a handsome
plant.  We found them growing with Christmas ferns and showy
orchis orchids.

<P>Rich moist woods of southeastern Wisconsin, at least as far
north as Milwaukee and Green counties, produce the unusual
stalkless <I>Trillium recurvatum</I> (re-cur-VAY-tum), known by
various names including prairie trillium and recurved trillium.
What unusual upright red-brown petals and handsome mottled
foliage these wildflowers have.  Its recurved name can be easily
seen in the downward hanging position of the sepals during time
of blossoming.

<P>Wildflower enthusiasts for a long time have thought that the
painted trillium, <I>T. undulatum</I> (un-do-LAY-tum), is the
most handsome of all trilliums.  Its white petals are
&quot;painted&quot; with red-pink near the center.  A poll in the
1940’s of favorite wildflowers in the U.S. ranked the painted
trillium number six out of more than 1000 candidates.  This gem
of a flower ranges from Nova Scotia to the mountains of Georgia.

<P>  Unfortunately this dazzling wild plant is becoming less and
less common in the southern two-thirds of its range.  As
difficult as it is to point a finger of blame to the reasons for
its decrease in numbers, the most logical thoughts are
destruction of habitat brought about by the increasing human
population that naturally leads to more and more development.

<P>This is trillium time, when the large white lilies of the
woods put on their finest and are at &quot;front and center
stage!&quot;
