      Miller was late. &quot;That's not like Steve,&quot; says Doug Webber.
      &quot;He's usually early.&quot;<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> As we waited I talked to a
      group of canoers who had just been flown in on Doug's Beaver after
      paddling the Seal River. They were unanimous in their appraisal of the
      trip they had just completed. They loved it and would do it again. That is
      strong praise from dirty hungry and sore paddlers who had just come in
      from the cold and bugs. The young men and women were still craving their
      first &quot;Coffee Crisp&quot; chocolate bar to be followed by a McDonald's
          hamburger. The burger still a long way off considering that the
      nearest franchise was 600 miles south. Instead they settled for
      licking the powder contents of &quot;instant blueberry muffins.&quot; I
      envied the young travellers as I could not remember when I had been so
      hungry or desperate.</b></p>

          Their comments were even
      more encouraging considering we were waiting for Steve to take us up to
      the Seal River Heritage Lodge. There was a big difference in our mode of
      travel and also the landscape of our journey. They came down the river
      slowly. Very slowly. And they stopped short of the coast. A good thing
      that as the polar bears don't often go far inland here. Most of the bears
      are up north now, but these are the summer bears. They mostly hang around
      the coast avoiding the worst of the bugs and generally not eating. Still,
      the bears are a concern for canoers sleeping in tents. And I have my
      personal doubts about the &quot;no eating in summer&quot; theory. What
      bear could resist a canoer fattened on blueberry muffin powder?<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> Moreover, we will be flying up
      the coast in a helicopter. Much quicker than paddling, but still slow and
      low enough to enjoy the coastal scenery. Plus, we get to see the world
      from the advantage of height. In this flat but undulating landscape of the
      sub-arctic tundra you could possibly see a polar bear from miles away.
      From the perspective of the ground bound, however, the bear could be
      sleeping on the grass in a little meadow just over the next ridge and you
      would not see him until you were right there. From above you will find him
      before he finds you.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> One of the young canoers, ears
      tuned to the silence, says he hears a helicopter. The helicopter appears
      from the direction of Churchill town. I anticipate meeting Steve the
      pilot. He introduces himself with his flying. His approach is a well
      written poem. Like sea-fog approaching on wings. Steve circles in like an
      arctic tern and lands like a robber fly. He makes the transition in the
      JetRanger from slow flight to the hover landing as graceful as the mating
      dance of the sandhill crane. Steve Miller can fly that machine.</b></p>

          There is something I've
      noticed about helicopter pilots. Something in their environmental
      circumstances insures that the eldest take the best and most interesting
      jobs. While Doug Webber's Beaver pilot was a young guy with little actual
      flying experience, Steve Miller is the archetype of helicopter pilots.
      Steve, when he does show, flying in low over the horizon, is a white
      haired white bearded well tanned wind burnt grizzled pilot of local
      renown.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> &quot;Sorry,
          I'm late.&quot;
      He exclaims. &quot;Busy day. Are you ready?&quot; Steve is indeed busy. He
      has established himself and his two helicopters as the only full time year
      round operator in the Churchill area. You don't mind waiting a few minutes
      for him, mostly because during this time of the season the other operators
      are off somewhere else, and you couldn't get them if you wanted. Steve
      stays to take care of his people. He may not get as much contract work by
      staying in one area, but he hopes that his dedication and loyalty to his
      Churchill customers will pay off in the long run. We appreciate the fact
      that both him and his helicopter are available to take us North.</b></p>

          His beautiful new forest
      green Bell 206 JetRanger 3 is equipped with two photographic windows and
      full intercom, to make the best of the guaranteed photo opportunities that
      will come our way. I sit up front to get to know Steve better, and let a
      film maker and a photographer have the two scenic windows. They are full
      of dumb questions which Steve answers good-naturedly. Steve has this
      santa-claus smile and a perpetual twinkle in his arctic weathered eyes
      that immediately puts you at ease with the upcoming flight whether you are
      scared of flying or not. You just know whatever happens he can handle it.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> We finish loading and Steve
      fires up the Allison turbine with the soul lifting smell of burning Jet
      Fuel. My favorite smell next to fresh baked bread. (Only a
      turbine-spoiled bush pilot could understand that preference.) Within
      minutes we lift off skimming <i>Landing Lake</i> waters like an arctic
      skimmer searching for herring. As we skim the shores the bushes part from
      the rotor wash beneath us. Slowly we gain altitude turning north bound to
      view the Churchill Port and the mouth of the Churchill River. Steve points
      out the pods of Beluga whales heading out of the river with the outgoing
      tide. &quot;Not many here, compared to where we are going,&quot; he quips
      over the intercom. &quot;Wait until we get to the Seal River, that is
      where we will see whales.&quot;<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> The JetRanger settles in to
      about 200 feet above seal level. The sky is blue and the visibility is
      virtually unlimited. Severe clear. I can distinctly see 360 degrees of
      horizon surrounding us. As we reach one horizon there is always another.
      Horizons. Not one but many. &quot;Polar bear,&quot; Steve whispers over
      the intercom to me. I strain forward to see better. I see a huge white
      rock looking menacingly like a white bear. I wait for Steve. Maybe he sees
      something I don't.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> Shortly after Steve
      acknowledges the bear like rock. I know how he feels. I continuously point
      out large white cap waves as breaching whales to my passengers in West
      Africa. I don't get embarrassed, however, and neither did Steve. He knows
      it's his unbounded enthusiasm for wanting to see the bears that turns
      rocks to bears. He loves what he does. And besides, he also knows that the
      next rock could very well be alive. Steve knows we will see a bear.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> Along the way to the lodge we
      cross the Seal River. Sure enough the river is full of beluga whales in
      pods of 10's and 20's. Steve slows down for the film crew to get off some
      good footage and I manage to snap a few pictures myself. The whales
      naturally gather in groups; some feeding along the bottom, some just
      drifting along noses touching in two's and three's. We do not linger long.
      Steve straightens out the helicopter from the 45 degree bank and we
      continue up the coast toward the Seal River Heritage Lodge. Along the way
      we view a sea of snow geese scouring the shoreline of the Hudson Bay.
      Steve says he has seen more geese recently than anytime in the past. The
      geese are everywhere. It has been a good breeding season.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> Soon we reach the Seal River
      Heritage Lodge where we spot land inside the bear proof fence. We linger
      just long enough to pick-up Virginia Petch, an archeologist, Dan Good, a
      geologist by training who will be running the GPS for our site surveys,
      and Quinten the acting guide and polar bear warden. Our mission is to fly
      hop over Hubbard Point up the coast from the lodge to carry out a special
      investigation. Hubbard Point is normally difficult to reach by boating and
      hiking, and we wanted to make the most of our sub-arctic time. Thus, the
      helicopter. The reward of the scenic flight in a helicopter has already
      shown itself over the beluga whales, but there is more. Just after
      takeoff, Steve whispers &quot;bear&quot; into the intercom, and this time
      Steve's vision is not rock.</b></p>

          It's a lean mean looking
      young male polar bear lazing around the coast line just up from the lodge.
      We circle to have a good look. It's been many years since I have been this
      close to a polar bear in the wild. I am ecstatic as we watch the bear
      continue his aimless prowl. Mike Reimer had told us that the bears will
      not feed this time of year. They are just waiting along the coast waiting
      for freeze up when they can head off shore to hunt seal. In the meantime
      the sea breezes can help keep the bugs at bay and the bears cool.<br>
          <img src="images/1ptrans.gif" hspace="12" width="1" height="1"> We cross the lowland flats
      littered with thousands of geese and the occasional caribou. Inland the
      clouds are blown into a line perspective that converges on the horizon.
      The skies between clear and blue. Hubbard Point comes into view. Besides
      the blue of the water and the white of the wind blown wave tops, we see a
      river of purple running through the moraine and rock strewn coastline
      flats. Fireweed. A large flowing field of bright purple fireweed growing
      on the high ground. As we drive closer, Steve again whispers
      &quot;bear&quot; or this time &quot;bears.&quot; We counted five bright
      white healthy polar bears making their way though the purple patch.</b></p>
          <p align="center"><a href="images/ppolar2_5.jpg"><b><img vspace="10" hspace="4" src="images/ppolar2_4.jpg" alt="Polar Bears in a purple patch" border="0" width="400" height="267"></b></a></p>

          Two of the big
      bruisers had just emerged from the cool bay waters striding slowly to the
      middle of the island spit. Steve circled low enough for us to get a good
      look, but not too low to bother the bears. They were not perturbed by our
      presence, but the feelings were not mutual. The archeologists pointed out
      that the bears were just 1-2 kms from where we were planning to land. It
      was a real treat to spot the bears, but we were on a mission and they were
      a threat. Steve and Quentin both assured the rest of us that there was
      enough distance between them and our landing zone. Even if they did decide
      to come our way we would have plenty of time to spool up and leave safely.</b></p>
