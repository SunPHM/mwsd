<P>The Sandhill Crane is rare in the Vancouver area but, since
there is a couple in the Reifel Bird Sanctuary that are habituated
to people, we have many photographs of these birds. This spring
they had two chicks, one of which survived to adulthood. This
photograph of the younger bird was made when (s)he was about three
months old.</P>

<P>An 80-400mm VR lens was used for this photo. It was set around
300mm, shutter speed and aperture were not recorded. The film
used was Kodak Gold 100, it was scanned at 10,000 samples per
square millimetres.</P>
