<B>Editorial Note:</b>  About 30 years ago, the most authoritative Chinese kungfu magazine then, <i>Xin Wu Xia</i> (New Martial Hero), published a series of articles on Sifu Wong’s commentary on the Tiger-Crane Set.  The series consists of four articles, namely:

This article on “Miscellaneous Techniques of Tiger-Crane Set” is the third of the series.  The sentence structure in this English translation follows that in the original Chinese version.

<i>As Sifu Wong grips Goh Kok Hin’s elbow with a Tiger Claw (please see the illustration in the previous .series on “Combat Sequences”), Goh Kok Hin shifts his left False Leg Stance to a right False Leg Stance and strikes Sifu Wong’s right temple with his left Crane Beak in a pattern called “Satisfied Reincarnated Crane”.</i>

In the previous two issues, the principles as well as the combat sequences of the Tiger-Crane Set were explained.  The Tiger-Crane Set has both “hard” and “soft” dimensions, and the famous “No-Shaow Kicks” of Shaolin.  Students should understand the principles and application of the set.  Having learnt the patterns of the set, students should practice its combat application, and understand its variations.

<i>Sifu Wong jumps up and lands his heels on the opponent’s toes, while his elbows. Simultaneously strike the opponent’s ribs.  It is important that Sifu Wong  turns to his left as he jumps so as not to land on the opponent’s knee.</i>

In this issue I shall explain the “san shou” or miscellaneous techniques of the set.  What are miscellaneous techniques?  Using each one pattern or a series of patterns in the set to meet miscellaneous combat situations, that is miscellaneous techniques.
<p>

For example, if an opponent grabs you from behind with two hands, as in the illustration above, how would you meet this combat situation?
<p>

The pattern “Flying Bird Flaps Wings” from the Tiger-Crane Set can be used to counter this attack.  The photographs illustrate these miscellaneous techniques.

Miscellaneous techniques and combat sequences are very important aspects of kungfu sets.  Students must realize this.  If students merely learn kungfu sets, and desire to learn more and more kungfu sets, they may unknowingly neglect the utmost importance of miscellaneous techniques and combat sequences.  In this way their kungfu sets will become merely demonstrative forms, without any practical combat functions.
<p>

It is hoped that students will understand this point, and prevent the essence of the Chinese martial art degenerating into flowery fists and embroidery kicks.  Kungfu practitioners must take up this responsibility and promote the essence of the art.

In practicing miscellaneous techniques and combat sequences, it is not true that there must be two persons practicing; it is also possible for a single person to practice alone.  When practicing alone, imagine an opponent in your mind.  The objective is to perform the patterns with force, speed and fluidity, so that in real combat the patterns can be implemented naturally.

In the next issue I shall explain the methods of training the Tiger Claw of the Tiger-Crane Set.
