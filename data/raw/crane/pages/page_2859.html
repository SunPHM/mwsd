		<div class="content"><h1>Birdwatching in Oregon's Outback</h1>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_ducks.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">Birds are prevalent throughout Lake&nbsp;County - from the sagebrush covered hills to the wetlands to the forest covered mountains. There is a very large variety of birds to be seen, in keeping with the many ecosystems, from small songbirds to large raptors, from ducks to cranes, there's something here for everyone.</p>
<p>Although you can see birds anywhere, information on three locations will be discussed on this site at this time - the Warner Wetlands, Summer Lake Wildlife Area and Goose Lake. More locations and sites will be added - so keep checking back! Please feel free to <a href="mailto:elasater@oregonsoutback.com?subject=Bird Name Correction">e-mail</a> any corrections.</p>
<p>More Info: <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/fremont/birdlist.html">Fremont National Forest Bird List</a></p>
<h2>Warner Wetlands</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_marsh2.JPG" alt="Warner Wetlands" height="116" width="296" border="0">The <span class="highlight">Warner Wetlands</span> is nestled at the base of Hart Mountain in eastern Lake County. The wetlands are comprised of several large bodies of water, including Hart, Warner, and Crump lakes and a wide spread of marshlands.</p>
<p>There is a walking trail and several bird blinds at the Wetlands along with an outhouse and several informational boards.</p>
<p>The huge variety of birds that pass through during migration or choose the wetlands as a nesting place makes this area an excellent stopping place for any bird enthusiast.</p>
<h3>Violet Green Swallow</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_swallows.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0"> The <span class="highlight">violet green swallows</span> were gathering in thick social crowds and I was able to get very close for some wonderful pictures.</p>
<h3>American Avocet</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_avocet.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">The <span class="highlight">American avocet</span> is a beautiful medium-sized wading bird easily recognizable by its white body with black wings and red head. During the winter the head is a pale buff color. It has a long black up-curving bill and long black legs.</p>
<p>This picture was taken in early May.</p>
<h3>White-Face Ibis</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_ibis.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">The <span class="highlight">white-face ibis</span> is distinguished by it's thick down-curving bill. It is a solid-looking mid to large size wading bird.</p>
<p>This photo was shot in early June.</p>
<h3>Sandhill Crane</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_sandhillcrane.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">The <span class="highlight">sandhill crane</span> is heard frequently during the breeding and nesting season throughout Lake County. This picture was taken in early June. Its mate was not far away.</p>
<h3>Sparrows</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_swallow.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">In the tall march grasses, <span class="highlight">sparrows</span> and other marsh birds can be seen among the reeds.</p>
<h3>White Egret</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_egret.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">This <span class="highlight">white egret</span> was spotted during one of my early spring trips to the Warner Wetlands (early May).</p>
<h2>Summer Lake Wildlife Area</h2>
<p>The <span class="highlight">Summer Lake Wildlife Area</span> is located in central Lake County along HWY 31 at Summer&nbsp;Lake.</p>
<p>More than just a wildlife area, it is an excellent place to stop and see the birds. There are walking paths and roads (unpaved) through the area, making access easy for anyone.</p>
<p>This is also a popular <a href="../hunting/index.html">hunting</a> location for many bird hunters in the fall.</p>
<h3>Cinammon Teal</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_cinammonteal.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">This pair of <span class="highlight">cinnamon teals</span> was taking up residence in one of the many rush-filled waterways that wind through the wildlife area. Located fairly close to the road, they made for an easy photograph (taken early May).</p>
<h3>Killdeer</h3>
<p><img src="../../images/birds/photo_killdeer.jpg" alt="" height="185" width="250" border="0">The <span class="highlight">killdeer</span> is a spunky little bird, easily identified by the bold white and black face and chest markings and tan back.

<h2>Goose Lake</h2>
<p><span class="highlight">Goose Lake State Park</span> is nestled on the Oregon Californa border 14 miiles south of Lake County. There is a campground and day use area located at the park.

This large wading bird stands at 20 to 26 inches and is most easily identified by its long, downward curving beak (about 8 inches). Its body color is a speckled brown. They are commonly seen in wet, marshy areas.</p>
