<h3><u>Where it lives</u>
<br>The Whooping Crane lives in the marshlands of northern Canada.


<br><br><u>Appearance</u>
<br>Cranes are the tallest birds in North America - up to 1.5 meters tall.
They have long black legs. Cranes wade (walk in the water ) in the marshes.

The fully grown crane  has a red patch on the top of its head , 
a long white neck  and a white body,
 except for the black feathers on the tips of the wings. 
It has a mustache of black on either side of its dark beak.
The wings measure over 2 meters from tip to tip.<p>
The young  are reddish-brown in color.

 <br><br><u>The young </u><br>
The mother lays two eggs in the nest made of marsh plants.
 The nest is built in the shallow water. The baby is covered with soft reddish down 
(feathers).<p>

<p><u>Food</u>
<br>Whooping cranes feed on crayfish, frogs amd  other small animals 
that live in the water.
They also eat roots and  waterplants. During their migration 
they have been seen feeding on grain that was left in the farmers' 
fields after the harvest.<br><br>

<u>Adaptation</u><br>With their long beaks and long legs,
 they are able to get small animals that live in the water.
<br> <br>The whooping crane's wings are very strong. 
This helps it to make the long flight to its winter home in Texas.
<br><br>Whooping Cranes rest in the marshy areas near Regina and Moose
 Jaw when they are migrating. They also stop in farmers' fields to rest
 and eat grain. <p>

<p><u> Interesting things </u>

<br>The Whooping Crane got its name from the booming call it makes when 
 angry or disturbed.  Some say it makes a bugle-like trumpeting sound.
<br>
<br>Cranes dance - making loud noises, flapping their wings , 
bowing their heads and then leaping into the air. <br>
<br>By 1941 there were only 22 whooping cranes left in the world.
 Whooping cranes were hunted for their beautiful feathers.<br>
<br>Today these cranes still have a problem surviving  because :
<ul><li>The marshlands are disappearing.  
<li>People shoot them. 
<li>They fly into power lines. 
<li>They die from diseases ( or pollution ).</ul>

<p>There are about 380 whooping cranes in North America.  
There are 188 Whooping Cranes  in Wood Buffalo National Park (northern Alberta-Northwest Territories ) 
. They fly to this park every spring to nest and raise 
their young.<p>
