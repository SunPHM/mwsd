<P>There is no native species of bird that we watch more closely,
keep daily records and thoroughly enjoy in September with greater
intensity than the ruby-throated hummingbird.  The young being
off the nest and vying for their turns at the hummingbird
feeders, what exciting aerial displays are now being performed.

<P>An increasing number of people with many years of bird-feeding
experiences are advocating leaving hummingbird feeders up until
you no longer see these small birds visiting them.  The last
visits to our feeders in September of 2000 were on the
21<SUP>st</SUP>.  Our feeders remained in place until the last of
the month.  And by the way, it will be the adult males that will
be the first to leave for the South.

<P>Too many people associate a year’s wildflower extravaganzas
with May and June.  Yesterday a group of around a dozen people
either working for or volunteering with The Nature Conservancy
hiked along the shores of a vast wetland in northeastern Door
County and were treated to one of the most dazzling wildflower
expanses in full bloom that one could imagine.

<P>Stars in the sprawling colorful wild garden were Joe-Pye-weed,
boneset, blue vervain, bull thistle (attracting many butterflies
to a rich feast of nectar), Kalm’s lobelia, and wild lettuce
(having yellow flowers).

<P>One of the best encounters during the wetland jaunt was a high
number of <a href="a041699.htm">leopard frogs.</a>  What an encouraging sight they were as
they took two or three of their famous leaps in order to avoid
being stepped on, so wonderful was their camouflage.  Twenty
years ago we would have been hard pressed to find even one of
these easily recognized amphibians along these shores.  Hopefully
more of you will find time to explore your favorite creek bottom,
woodland pond or lake shore to search for leopard frogs.  This is
an ideal month to do so.  Let’s hope that these valuable
&quot;partners in nature&quot; are staging a strong return to
their high numbers of 40 years ago.

<P>It’s early September and already the quaking aspen leaves take
on a different shimmering quality against the deep azure sky.
Sulphur butterflies, that appeared in record numbers this past
month, wing in their zig-zag manners matching in color the myriad
goldenrods set off so handsomely against the dark edges of the
cool woods.

<P>The strikingly formed and subtly colored lichens, nature’s
indicators of pure, sweet, fresh air, silent through they are,
are &quot;speaking&quot; in their own way with loudness and
clarity, &quot;Nature’s way is the best way, free as it all may
be.  Stay here.  You’ll not be sorry, for the best is yet to
come.&quot;

<P>British red soldiers, reindeer &quot;moss,&quot; pixie cup
lichens and a host of other species put their best foot forward
in September, the morning air and plants being laced with
moisture.  Surely it must have been during September when Thoreau
wrote, &quot;This is a lichen day.&quot;

<P>Cast a downward glance now and then as you hike during this
invigorating ninth month of the year.  This is prime time for the
ripening of wintergreen berries.  These plump, mealy, spicy,
vermilion fruits as well as the leaves are eaten by ruffed grouse
and deer, too.  Fortunately many of the so-called berries will
winter well and provide us with choice morsels come spring.

<P>Speaking about <a href="a013098.htm">ruffed grouse,</a> hardly a September goes by
without someone lucking onto one of these dauntless little
woodland birds that utterly dumbfounds the human race and
actually takes a peculiar interest in people.  These
unexplainable shenanigans, the exact opposite of this bird’s
usual and extreme wariness, establish an indisputable fact.
Ruffed grouse are unpredictable creatures.

<font size=-2 color=000000>The bumblebee ranks among the best friends of people.
</font>


<P>The cool mornings of this month will frequently find many
bumblebees sluggishly walking around on the ripening sunflower
heads in search of some of their last food.  According to the
findings in the field of aerodynamics, bumblebees, for their
weight and small wing surface, theoretically can’t fly, and some
old wives’ tales indicate they cannot sting.  Obviously neither
statement is true.  These hairy bees may begin to stumble and
bumble during some cold September snaps, but rejoice that they
have done such great work for us.

<P>You can be assured that, come spring, the comparatively large
queens will be afield in search of the very first makings for bee
&quot;bread.&quot;  We could very well pause at our outdoor work
now and offer a word of thanks to these well-known insects, among
the greatest assets to mankind.  Harvest your garden and field
crops with a tip of the hat to the &quot;bumbees.&quot;

<P>We know that garden crops will ripen fast and furiously during
early September and that the first heavy frost may well arrive
before the end of the month.  The bird-month, the harvest-month,
the month of wetland wildflowers and leopard frogs, September in
all its great richness provides something for all.
