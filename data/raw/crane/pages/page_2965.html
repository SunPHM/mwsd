<P>It was in the last week of May, 1980, that I wrote in one of
my weekly nature stories: &quot;We hope that the sighting of 30
double-crested cormorants off the shore of Baileys harbor is a
sign of improving conditions and that some of them will nest
here.&quot;

<P>Harold Wilson, veteran gull bander from Ephraim, along with
some of his volunteer assistants, including Bob Davis, witnessed
and photographed nesting cormorants on the Strawberry Islands in
the early 1950’s while banding herring gulls there.

<P>Dating back into the 1950’s and 60’s, double-crested
cormorants, the species of the interior of the U.S., were
becoming more and more rare on the Great Lakes to the point that
they were listed as an endangered species in Wisconsin in 1973.
Several factors brought about the decline of this once-abundant
species.  Loss of nesting habitats, pesticide build-up in their
prey species of fish, and killing by irate fishermen who detested
their competition all contributed to their low numbers.

<P>Gradually, beginning in the late 1970’s, their population
began to rise.  Island nesting sites in Lake Michigan and Green
Bay, including Spider Island, Gravel Island and the Strawberry
Islands began to support more and more nesting pairs.  So rapidly
did their numbers recover that the state DNR delisted these large
black birds in 1985.

<P>Charlotte and I, while driving north from Fort Myers and
Sanibel Island along the southwest coast of Florida in the early
spring of 1977, stopped for gas in Punta Gorda.  There, within a
block of the filling station, perched several hundred
double-crested cormorants on the power lines crossing above a
narrow body of water draining into Charlotte Harbor.  I made some
favorable exclamatory comment to the station attendant to which
he answered, &quot;Oh those pests – I wish we could get rid of
them.&quot;

<P>In late September of 1992 I estimated 4,300 of these unusual
birds fishing en masse at the mouth of Moonlight Bay north of
Baileys Harbor.  At times their fishing technique reminded me of
a long drawn-out skirmish line.  Obviously, those bird swimming
underwater were driving the prey species of fish ahead of them
and also catching their fair share.

<P>There was often a movement of dozens of birds from the back of
the slowly-moving flock to the front with much frenzied activity
accompanied by splashing and flailing of wings.

<P>These strange-appearing prehistoric-like creatures are the
perfect example of gregarious birds.  They feed, nest and roost
in large groups and seldom are far from land.  So large are some
of their island nesting colonies that most plants, including
trees, have little chance of surviving due to the burning effect
of the heavy lime deposits from the birds’ droppings.  Needless
to say these are smelly places due to the droppings, regurgitated
fish and offal.

<P>My first introduction to Jack Island, one of the Strawberry
Islands situated generally between Peninsula State Park and
Chambers Island to the west, was in June of 1963.  Harold Wilson,
Murl Deusing and I spend the greater part of the day banding
slightly over 1100 young herring gulls.

<P>I vividly recall plenty of stinging nettles, red elder shrubs
and, interestingly, very little foul odor.  There was plenty of
green and outwardly healthy vegetation.  Last week my friend, Bob
Davis, took Mike Grimm of The Nature Conservancy and me to
explore the island.  What drastic changes have taken place there
during the span of the last 35 years since I saw it last.

<P>Following at least 25 years of steady yearly cormorant and
gull nesting the middle and higher portion of the island,
comprising at least three-quarters or more of the total surface,
is completely devoid of any living plants.  A solid coat of limy
guano covers the landscape and the odor is extremely unpleasant,
at least to humans.

<P>Interestingly the bird fertilizer has produced one of the most
dense stands of stinging nettles, six-foot-tall smartweed,
jewelweed, and especially American elderberry shrubs loaded with
fruit, rimming nearly the entire perimeter of the island, that
I’ve ever seen.  Obviously the birds prefer to nest on the
considerably higher inner portion of the island.

<P>Reports from commercial and sport fishermen in northeastern
Wisconsin and elsewhere on the Great Lakes are strongly against
the very existence of the questionable cormorants.  If there is a
trend occurring, I suspect that by late April of next year more
double-crested cormorants than ever will return to this region to
nest.

<P>Here is a fascinating bird whose role in nature is little
understood and appreciated and, like humans, appears to have a
bad side as well as a good side.  (But who are we to tell?)  One
might call it the Jekyll and Hyde of the waterbirds.
