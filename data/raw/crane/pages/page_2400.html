        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The change is the 
        cost of success. By 1973, extermination campaigns had practically eliminated 
        wolves from the lower 48 states. Today, wolves are back. </font> 
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Roughly 3,500 members 
        of Canis lupus now reside in the lower 48 states, primarily in Minnesota, 
        Wisconsin and Michigan, with smaller numbers in the Southwest and Rocky 
        Mountains. </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The rebound reflects 
        natural increase among Midwestern wolves, and the success of a controversial 
        program that started reintroducing the gray wolf to the Rocky Mountains. 
        The 31 gray wolves trapped in Canada and loosed in Yellowstone National 
        Park in 1995 and 1996 have increased to about 120 adults today. </font>
      <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Breeding 
        season</font></b></font> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        The wolf's comeback is good news to wolf lovers and anyone who favors 
        returning endangered species to their home ranges. Ironically, wolves 
        are doing so well that they could soon lose some or all protection of 
        the Endangered Species Act, which helped ensure their survival. </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The goal of the 
        Rocky Mountain reintroduction is to have at least 30 breeding pairs survive 
        for at least three years. Once 10 pairs each survive in each area: Yellowstone, 
        Central Idaho, and Northwest Montana, the wolf will be removed from the 
        endangered species list. </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The thriving population 
        of this awesome, doglike predator is enchanting Yellowstone's visitors. 
        "It used to be that visitors would come and ask where to find grizzly 
        bears," says Marsha Karle, head of the Park's public affairs office. "Now, 
        it's really incredible the number of people asking to see wolves." </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The opportunity 
        often arises early or late in the day along roadsides, and the animals 
        are especially easy to see in winter, when their coats contrast against 
        the snow. Wolf-watching is bringing visitors to the Lamar Valley, in the 
        northeast part of the park, and cash registers in Cook City have benefited 
        from their reappearance, say Karle.</font>
      <p>
       <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">What's 
        for dinner?</font></b></font> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        </font> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The reintroduction 
        was not only supposed to benefit cash registers, tourists and the wolf itself, 
        but also ecological relationships in Yellowstone. The wolf is a top carnivore 
        in the area, and many ecologists think its long absence allowed a population 
        explosion among wolf prey -- deer, moose, bison and particularly elk -- 
        resulting in widespread damage to park vegetation. Ecology 101 tell us 
        that the return of a keystone predator should echo through the ecosystem. 
        <img src="images/pquote1.gif" width="225" height="165" align="left" alt="Gray wolves are prospering. So we don't need to protect them. Right?">Since 
        wolves eat herbivores, more willow and aspen trees should survive, increasing 
        the number of perching and feeding opportunities for birds and butterflies. 
        </font> 
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> However, four years 
        later, the impact on grazing animals has been less than expected, says 
        Karle. "We're not seeing any changes in population sizes among ungulates 
        [hoofed animals like deer and elk]... If lots of young are killed, ungulates 
        have more young." </font> 
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Still, the ungulate 
        herds (if not individuals) stand to benefit since genes from weak, disease-prone 
        animals are culled by wolves. </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Wolves are having 
        other effects. Each pack kills an elk -- usually a calf or an old female 
        -- every one to five days, supplying a feast for scavenging animals. John 
        Varley, the park's chief scientist, told The New York Times in 1997 that 
        a horde of scavengers descends on an elk carcass after the engorged wolves 
        depart. "You can see a grizzly bear, four or five ravens, coyotes, a fox, 
        bald eagles and golden eagles on the carcass. All at once." The carcasses 
        also feed such lowly scavengers as beetles, which in turn become MacGrub 
        for magpies, bluebirds, warblers, nuthatches and Western tanagers. </font>
      <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660033">Call 
        of the coyote</font> </b></font> <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        So far, the main loser in the reintroduction has been the many coyotes 
        around Yellowstone. Coyotes will fight wolves, but being outweighed by 
        three to one, they generally lose. "It's displacing and killing coyotes, 
        both adults and pups," says Karle. "It's been fairly high, more than we 
        expected." But before you start feeling sorry for this relative of the 
        wolf, remember that when one animal loses, another generally wins. Fewer 
        coyotes should translate into more rodents and thus more prey for hawks 
        and bald eagles. </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Ironically, while 
        ranchers don't like coyotes, they've been positively alarmed by the plan 
        to reintroduce the animal that's eating those coyotes. To many ranchers, 
        the idea of introducing a predator for sheep and cows is, well, stupid 
        on its face. But Karle says ranchers have been mollified by reimbursements 
        for dead livestock and by the prompt use of deadly force by Fish & Wildlife 
        Service sharpshooters, who kill wolves that think a wilderness dining 
        experience should include raw hamburger and uncooked mutton. </font>

        If the resurgence of the wolf is having ecological effects, it also has 
        regulatory ones. As gray wolves rebound in the Rockies and Midwest, bureaucrats 
        want to change the status of two subspecies, the eastern timber wolf and 
        the northern rocky mountain wolf, from "endangered" to "threatened." </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The change reflects 
        success at Yellowstone, and the entrenched status of the Midwestern population. 
        A leading wolf biologist, L. David Mech, of the U.S. Geological Survey, 
        told the New York Times that the Minnesota population -- about 2,000, 
        is safe. "I can't conceive of anything, excluding poisoning, that would 
        endanger this population" (see "Rules Shielding the Gray..." in the <a href="biblio.html">bibliography</a>).</font> <p>

     <font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The impending change 
        would, if enacted, establish four regions for wolf management: the Rocky 
        Mountains, the Midwest, and the Southwest, all of which have some wolves, 
        and New England, where they've not been seen in a century. </font> 
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> The Mexican wolf, 
        a rare subspecies struggling to survive in New Mexico, Arizona and Texas, 
        would apparently retain full protection as an endangered species. Here's 
        a <a href="http://news.fws.gov/newsreleases/Display.cfm?ID=270" target="new">news 
        release</a> on the proposal. </font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Curiously, Fish 
        & Wildlife decided to stop protecting nonexistent wolves. In all or portions 
        of 30 states ... "Gray wolves are not believed to be present ..., and 
        their restoration in these areas is not necessary in order to achieve 
        wolf recovery under the ESA [Endangered Species Act]. Therefore, the Service 
        proposes to delist, or remove from ESA protection, any wolves that may 
        occur there now or in the future. " In other words, the wolf resurgence 
        may not extend beyond the four areas listed. </font>

        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The main effect of reclassification 
        would concern livestock depredation, says Adrian Wydevan, a wolf biologist 
        with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Today, under endangered 
        status, federal agents relocate or shoot problem wolves. Under threatened 
        status, that responsibility would shift to state managers. If the animals 
        are removed from the Endangered Species Act, landowners could pull the 
        trigger. </font></font>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Without question, 
        the reintroduction of the mysterious mammal reflects a change in public 
        attitudes. Thanks in part to better education, wolves are now seen as 
        an essential -- and beautiful -- component of a healthy ecosystem. "My 
        feeling is that we have learned so much about how important each species 
        is to the ecosystem," said Cheryl Matthews, in Yellowstone's public affairs 
        office, told The Why Files in 1996. "In the 1920s and '30s, we shot these 
        animals. It's an opportunity for us to right a wrong." </font>
