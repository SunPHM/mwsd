A day at the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge in Central Washington State</font></p>
<p>Sunday, March 10</p>
<p>The day's temperature was in the high 40's with intermittent misting. On my 
way to the refuge I passed by some friends who were busy deciding how to cross 
the road safely to chow down on the grass.</p>

<p>Gray and overcast with gusting winds around 8 mph made my walk a bit 
uncomfortable. When I arrived at the parking area for the Pillar Wigeon area of 
the Columbia National Wildlife Refuge and was packing up my scope pack for the 
loop trip of some 3-4 miles, I was greeted overhead by a chorus of familiar cries. 
A flock of Sandhill Cranes [<i>Grus canadensis</i>] flew directly overhead.</p>

<p>The area of today's interest is detailed by a sign located just south of the parking 
area. This area of seep lakes came about after the construction of O'Sullivan Dam 
and the East Low Canal. For more information about the Columbia Basin Irrigation 
Project, O'Sullivan Dam and the Potholes Reservoir

<p>The signage for the area has the proverbial bullet marks. It still is in 
pretty good shape considering its age.</p>

<p>A close-up of the map helps to orient the reader. [The map is fuzzy because 
it is a picture of the sign and I am still trying to learn how to hold the 
camera still when I take a picture.]</p>

<p>My walk would lead me from the parking lot, overland to the east and Elbow 
Lake and then south along the west boundary, just below the canal embankment. 
Along the way there would be many fine examples of unbrowsed sage, wetlands, 
basalt outcrops and the never ending vistas. Once I reached the area east of 
Wigeon Lake I would head east between Wigeon and Upper Hampton Lake. This would 
lead me to a gravel road that runs north by Lemna Lake and Gadwall Lake. This 
road eventually leads back to the parking area.</p>

<p>Packing my scope, water bottle and a snack I headed out. Spring in this area 
is a special time. Shrub steppe literally bursts with growth during March and 
April as the spring rains and winter snow packs provide nearly the entire 8 
inches of annual moisture for the area. I immediately spotted Canada Geese 
[<i>Branta canadensis</i>] making there way across the sky. These engrossing birds are a common site here 
in the Columbia basin. Living up to the areas name, I spotted numerous American Wigeon's 
[<i>Anas americana</i>] in full breeding plumage. Common Mergansers [<i>Mergus 
merganser</i>]were also on Elbow Lake. I 
dropped down below the canal a made my way towards the first patch of 
cottonwoods. I drew the immeditate ire of a possessive Canyon Wren [<i>Catherpes 
mexicanus</i>], who after an 
excited run past me a few times, settled down on a rock for a perfect pose. 
Notice the distinctive white throat and very long bill. These are good 
diagnostic field marks for this interesting species.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/wren1.jpg" width="250" height="211"> </p>

<p>I felt the area was perfect for locating a Great Horned Owl [<i>Bubo 
virginianus</i>] . I found Northern Flickers [<i>Colaptes auratus</i>], American Robins
<i>[Turdus migratorius</i>], American Magpies [<i>Pica hudsonia</i>] and Song Sparrows 
[<i>Melospiza melodia</i>]. No 
Owl was located. </p>

<p>The view of the area is beautiful. The silence, especially the lack of 
barking dogs, is exhilarating.</p>

<p>I continued south along the base of the canal through some gorgeous sagebrush. The smell of sage in the spring is special. This area has some of 
our regions&nbsp; 
best sagebrush. Shrub steppe and its native plant communities are a vanishing 
resource. We need to pay special attention to this fragile environment that is 
home to so much life.&nbsp; If left alone sage can grow to phenomenal sizes. Many in this area are 6 - 8 inches in diameter, or more. The height of some 
is over 8 feet tall. Each bush is unique and I find wonder in then all.</p>

<p>In the background of these shots the high embankment of the East Low Canal 
can be clearly seen.</p>

<p>I continued south with the canal to my left and the lakes to my right. 
Numerous Flickers and Robins let my coming be known far in advance. Immediately 
above Sago Lake I crossed a draw and a broad marshy area suddenly appeared between me and the 
canal. I heard the distinctive calls of the White-Crowned Sparrow [<i>Zonotrichia 
leucophrys</i>]. I scanned the 
shrub and low cottonwoods. Then, as if on cue, he popped out on a branch to see 
who was in his neighborhood. I was able to get a good shot of him before he 
decided I was of no interest.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/whitecrown1.jpg" width="250" height="288"></p>

<p>The loud cries of at least 3 Belted Kingfishers [<i>Ceryle alcyon</i>] could be heard as they darted 
from the canal embankment overhead. As I continued to &quot;Pish&quot; [this is the noise 
birders use to beckon curious avian species to show themselves] a pair of large, 
aerial shapes zoomed from behind the canal and immediately began their slow, 
deliberate circles. I was obviously in a prime hunting area for the Red Tail 
Hawk [<i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>].</p>

<p>They were checking me out closely. One of them was a bit ragged. They both 
came together directly overhead for a great display of either playfulness or 
warnings. It is hard to say which.</p>

<p>After my exciting encounter with the Buteos I headed away from the canal and 
made my way towards the east shore of Wigeon Lake. From there I would look for an old 
foot bridge that crossed part of the marshy area between Wigeon and Upper 
Hampton Lakes. As I passed below Wigeon Lake and made my way towards the gravel 
road which would take me north and back to the parking area I came upon the sign 
of a common resident of the area. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/beaver.jpg" width="482" height="360"></p>

<p>Beaver roam all over the refuge and this one was very industrious. This weed 
tree, a huge Russian Olive, was toppled without much of a problem.</p>

<p>As I progressed towards the road I came across an Ant Hill. The ants seemed 
to be having a major meeting on top of the huge mound. They were all pretty 
docile and not much activity was apparent around the nest. This was a very 
intriguing find.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/P3110057.JPG" width="530" height="398"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/P3110056.JPG" width="530" height="396"></p>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/P3110054.JPG" width="531" height="396"></p>

<p>Once I hit the road I headed north. I passed Lumna Lake and Gadwall Lake. I 
found various waterfowl such as Mallards [<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>], Buffleheads 
[<i>Bucephala albeola</i>] and Coots [<i>Fulica americana</i>]. At the far end 
of Lumna lake I spotted a Muskrat just before he made shelter in the cattails.</p>

<p>The wind started blowing a bit harder and I began huffing a bit more so I 
decided to head back to the vehicle and call it a day. Spring was arriving at 
Pillar Wigeon and I was looking forward to my next trip and the changes I would 
find.</p>
