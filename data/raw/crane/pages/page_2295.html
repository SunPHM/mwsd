and Enhance <br>
Wet Meadow Habitat Along the Platte River</font></p>

Platte River system is one of the most
highly developed river basins in the world. At the same time, the central Platte
River and its associated wet meadows
are an important habitat resource for&nbsp; regional&nbsp; <img border="0" src="wetmed.jpg" align="left" width="260" height="134">biodiversity,
numerous migratory birds and other species.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"> Central Platte habitats are host to
species federally listed as endangered (e.g., whooping crane, interior least
tern) and threatened (e.g., piping plover, western prairie fringed orchid).
Hundreds of thousands of sandhill cranes and millions of waterfowl use the
Platte River during their annual migrations.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3"> Wet meadows once occurred
extensively along the Platte River; however, substantial reductions have
occurred during the past century. Many wet meadows have been drained, leveled
and converted to cropland.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">The sponsors of this Project: Central Platte
NRD, Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, Nebraska Public
Power District and the Central Nebraska Public Power &amp; Irrigation District,
with the aid of grants from the Nebraska Environmental Trust Fund- have joined
together in an attempt to study alternative methods for maintaining and
enhancing Platte River wet meadows. Specifically, the Project goal is to assess
the feasibility of enhancing the ecological integrity of Platte River wet
meadows at three south-central Nebraska demonstration sites using means other
than stream flow. Success will be measured by gaining additional insights into
developing alternative methods in enhancing and maintaining wet meadows.
Information gained through this study will be useful in developing other
habitats along the Platte River. The three demonstration sites being studied are
the Cottonwood Ranch property near Overton, the Grand Island Well field site
located south of the city of Grand Island and the Wyoming property located
southeast of Kearney.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="3">Project sponsors developed site enhancement
plans with input from participants of a Wet Meadow Workshop. Two independent
experts reviewed revised draft plans. Baseline biological and hydrologic
monitoring began in early 1997. Site enhancements have been implemented and
post-treatment biological and hydrologic monitoring efforts are underway.</font></p>
