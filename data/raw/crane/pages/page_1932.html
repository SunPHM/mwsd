			&quot;The whooping crane migration is underway, but only by a little bit, writes
			Tom Stehn from the wintering grounds at Aransas. &quot;On March 28, after eight hours
			in the census airplane swooping, diving, circling, turning, and doing everything
			but breakdancing, (and every once and a while flying in a straight line), I concluded
			that a total of nine whooping cranes have started the migration. One of the nine
			has been sitting on the Platte River in Nebraska since March 20th. (Biologist Wally
			Jobman confirms that bird is still there, but he reported no new confirmed sightings
			during the past week. What do you suppose the bird is waiting for?) &quot;The other
			eight are cranes in four adult pairs that are headed north to nest. These pairs probably
			headed north on March 24th when it was incredibly windy on the Texas coast.&quot;
			Windy? Tom tells you HOW windy in the next section of this Update.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Why have 9 cranes started the migration and the remaining 185 in the flock
			are still here eating blue crabs and getting ready for the trip? The timing of the
			migration is always spread out, starting in late March and going all the way through
			April and sometimes even into early May before the last whooping crane departs. With
			the flock migrating at different times in small groups of usually 1-5 cranes, no
			single natural hazard will devastate the population.&quot; Which leads us to ask:

			Tom expect most of the whooping cranes will start the migration between April 5 and
			April 15. After about April 20th, all the breeding pairs have migrated. All of us
			join Tom in his wish: &quot;Safe traveling to the nine whooping cranes that have
			started the migration.&quot;

Tom Stehn enjoyed some great wind-surfing weather on March 24, and the first whooping
			crane pair probably took off on those same winds. Says Tom, &quot;These pairs probably
			headed north on March 24th when it was incredibly windy on the Texas coast. That
			would have provided strong 25 mph tailwinds to aid the birds as they crossed Texas.
			With winds like that, the cranes could have flown 60 mph and crossed almost all of
			Texas, flying 400+ miles all in one day. The winds sure were a handful for me as
			I windsurfed on the bay that day. I was easily going 30 mph myself, the sail pulling
			me along just as the wings of the cranes act as a sail catching the wind and making
			their migration easier.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			What made those winds blow, and blow in the right direction to aid migration speeds
			of an astonishing 60 mph? You'll figure it out with a close look at the weather and
			wind maps leading up to the March 24th take-off! We'll lead you along the way:

			Cranes normally fly between 32 and 35 miles per hour. On a day with 25 mph winds
			from the south, how long would it take a whooping crane to fly from the southern
			border to the northern border of YOUR state? What do you need to know to figure this
			out? (Tailwinds ADD to the bird's own speed.)<BR>

What's happening with the five ultralight-led cranes on their remote island at the

			Hayes.<BR>

			How will the young cranes know when to migrate? And how do they prepare their bodies

			How do you read a weather map? Which way does the air around a high pressure center
			circulate? What direction does the air around a low pressure system move? What does
			this all mean for birds? What makes a good day to fly? Thanks to Dr. David Aborn,
			you can read the weather from a bird's point of view. Although written for songbird
			migration, the weather principles discussed also apply to whooping crane migration:

<A NAME="Internal"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Internal Clocks: Discussion of Challenge
			Question #8</B></FONT><BR>
			&quot;Wouldn't it be something if the whooping cranes in Florida and Texas all started
			the migration about the same time? It's possible, since whooping cranes have an internal
			clock,&quot; said Tom Stehn. He asked you: &quot;What do you think we mean by internal
			clock? What clues do the whooping cranes use to set their clock to know what time
			they should start the migration?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Hooray for Taylor and Genevieve, fourth graders from Ms. Thurber's class at Ferrisburgh
			(VT) Central School, who answered: &quot;We think that an internal clock means that
			the whooping cranes can tell the time of year by instinct. The length of day is a
			clue to what time of year it is.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Tom Stehn confirms Taylor and Genevieve's answer, and adds this: &quot;How do the
			cranes know when to migrate? It has to do with the length of the days. The cranes
			have an internal clock and ability to know how long the days are. (They don't have
			a wrist watch to tell time, but did you know they do have a wrist -- a joint located
			out near the tip of the wing?) How animals can measure the length of daylight is
			a mystery, but I know cranes can do it because I know I have an internal clock myself.
			How else can you explain that I usually wake up just BEFORE the alarm clock goes
			off, telling me it's time to go to work? How can I possibly do this unless I have
			an internal clock that mysteriously wakes me up? So somehow the cranes use their
			internal clocks and know that the spring days are getting longer. This triggers hormonal
			changes in the cranes, readying them for the migration. They eat more, gain weight,
			and build up fat reserves needed for the long, hard migration. And when the days
			reach a certain length, off they go to Canada for the summer.&quot; <BR>

Any ornithologist seeing a crane for the first time could instantly guess that this
			bird lives in wetlands, flies long distances without a lot of flapping, nests on
			the ground, gets food from wet soil or water, and has a loud voice. How? Fascinating
			secrets are revealed when we study how an organism's body--and its behavior--are
			adapted to its environment. An &quot;adaptation&quot; is a physical or behavioral
			feature that evolved in response to an organism's environment, due to pressures for
			survival. How a species looks (its anatomy), as well as how it behaves (how it moves,
			obtains food, reproduces, responds to danger, etc.) are all based in the species'
			evolutionary history. This spring, we'll look at a whooping crane's body from head
			to toe to see just how this bird is designed precisely for the kind of life it leads.
			Each week, we'll pose a Challenge Question related to an adaptation that helps cranes.
			Remember: There's always a WHY behind WHAT you see. So whenever you see an unusual
			behavior or body part, ask yourself WHY. Here goes:

			<BR>
			&quot;How self-centered can a species be to allow such possibilities to become realities?
			It certainly doesn't speak much for us does it?&quot; commented Mr. Ramsden. He explains:
			&quot;I am from Texas, San Antonio to be specific, and I now live in Colorado Springs,
			CO. The point is, water was critical when I lived in San Antonio and it is critical
			where I live now. We MUST, as a species, control our breeding. To double, or increase
			our population even 10% is just irresponsible. We cannot increase infinitely with
			finite resources. What quality of life can we expect if we DOUBLE our population?
