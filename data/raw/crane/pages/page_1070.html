<CENTER>This photo and several others below are video shots I took while</CENTER>

<CENTER>on the observation deck of the "Japan World Trade Center" in</CENTER>

<CENTER>Tokyo. I have been to Tokyo maybe a dozen times, and I have</CENTER>

<CENTER>seen it most often as it appears above and below.</CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Tokyo</I></CENTER>

<CENTER>It appears to be a mixture of foggy mist, because of the proximity</CENTER>

<CENTER>to the Pacific Ocean, and smog, a big problem most major cities</CENTER>

<CENTER>suffer from. I have seen Tokyo with perfectly clear skies too.
And</CENTER>

<CENTER>it is a sight to see. I am always amazed at the number of large</CENTER>

<CENTER>construction cranes always within view and working.</CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="tokyo4.JPG" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Tokyo</I></CENTER>

<CENTER>The land with no buildings on it in the center of the above photo
is</CENTER>

<CENTER>a rarity in Tokyo. I do not know what it is. The only other large
and</CENTER>

<CENTER>unbuilt area of Tokyo that I have seen is the area around the</CENTER>

<CENTER>Emperor's Palace and The Diet<I> </I>or seat of the national government.</CENTER>

<CENTER>With Yokohama harbor and a straight shot across the pacific to
the</CENTER>

<CENTER>western coast of the USA, Tokyo, with its 30+ million inhabitants</CENTER>

<CENTER>is a city where you can find probably anything that you can find</CENTER>

<CENTER>anywhere else in the world. American Hamburgers, chicken, Italian</CENTER>

<CENTER>restaurants, French restaurants, German ratskellers where "fresh</CENTER>

<CENTER>pig knuckles" are widely sought after. It is all here in Tokyo.</CENTER>

<CENTER>While in Japan, I have heard that if you want any chance of moving</CENTER>

<CENTER>up in the corporate world, you must be in Tokyo. I have heard some</CENTER>

<CENTER>tell me of their wish to move to Tokyo. I have also heard those
wishing</CENTER>

<CENTER>to move to the countryside, where it is a much slower pace and
not</CENTER>

<CENTER>as crowded. My personal preference also would be to live in a smaller</CENTER>

<CENTER>countryside city. I think I would have a better chance of experiencing</CENTER>

<CENTER>a little more of the real Japan and not so much of the world wide
culture</CENTER>

<CENTER>that I view Tokyo as having. Of course, true japanese tradition
is</CENTER>

<CENTER>alive and well in Tokyo also. My preference is the smaller cities.</CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Tokyo</I></CENTER>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<CENTER>I understand that Japan has about 1/2 the population of the entire
USA.</CENTER>

<CENTER>But their land area I think is about the size of the state of Montana.</CENTER>

<CENTER>And of their land area, I think that Japan is somewhere around
50%</CENTER>

<CENTER>mountains. So you can see that with so little flat land, so large
a</CENTER>

<CENTER>population would be very crowded.</CENTER>

<CENTER>When I went to visit Mount Fuji from the first page, from Tokyo,
you</CENTER>

<CENTER>must travel south several hours by bus or maybe 1 hour or so by
train.</CENTER>

<CENTER>To get to Niigata Prefecture, and Sanjo City in particular, where
my</CENTER>

<CENTER>business in Japan took me, you travel almost 2 hours by Bullet
Train</CENTER>

<CENTER>or "Shinkansen" as it is called in Japan. The bullet train travels
very</CENTER>

<CENTER>fast. Maybe around 200 miles per hour. The ride is very smooth
and</CENTER>

<CENTER>comfortable. Japan is a country of trains. With all the mountains
it</CENTER>

<CENTER>seems that the best way to travel is definitely by train. When
I traveled</CENTER>

<CENTER>to Sanjo City in Niigata Prefecture from Tokyo, out of the nearly
2 hour</CENTER>

<CENTER>trip, about 40 or so minutes of it was spent racing through tunnels
in the</CENTER>

<CENTER>mountains. Tokyo is on the east coast of Japan, and Niigata Prefecture</CENTER>

<CENTER>is north and on the west coast. Probably this distance between
Tokyo and</CENTER>

<CENTER>Sanjo City is around 300-350 miles. Japan is sort of split from
north to</CENTER>

<CENTER>south by what is known as "The Japanese Alps." My trips took me</CENTER>

<CENTER>through the alps.</CENTER>

<CENTER>Skiing is very popular in Japan. Some of the towns I traveled through
are</CENTER>

<CENTER>extremely popular during the winter months.</CENTER>
