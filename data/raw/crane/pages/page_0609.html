<H2><A NAME="hist"> History of Far Acres Farm </A> </H2>

  The farmstead was built between 1799 and 1813 by Isaiah and Jemmy
Palmer.  When my grandparents arrived in 1919, the oldest inhabitants
told them that Jemmy had been reluctant to marry Isaiah, because his
land was on a quiet side road.  She'd grown up on the highway (now NH
Rt. 107A), busy with wagons, ox-carts and droves of animals coming
down to tidewater at Amesbury and Newbury's Port.  Isaiah promised
Jemmy the best house in South Hampton if she'd marry him, and I guess
she was satisfied, although the house didn't appear on the tax rolls
until 1800, five years after they were married. <P>

  My grandparents operated the place as a small dairy farm for a
number of years before my grandmother's health and worsening economic
conditions for small farms led them to different pursuits.  After
their deaths, my family rented it out until I moved from Cambridge in
1988.  Since then my wife Jocelyn and I have done quite a bit of
clearing, rehabilitation and construction.  We're taking a break
this year, but there's still stuff to be done. <P>

<H2> <A NAME="consider"> Considering Solar </A> </H2>

  I had had solar energy on my mind for a number of years, but there
were obstacles.  The most serious was that Isaiah had built the house
facing East by Northeast.  This presented the best aspect to visitors
coming down from the center of town, and gave the Palmers a view out
the front windows clear to the top of the hill (re-forestation and new
houses have put an end to that).  192 years later, I was left with no
easy way to mount solar energy collectors facing the sun.  Another
obstacle was the partial cellar, on the North side of the house.
Putting it on a slope probably saved the builders a lot of digging, but
it meant I didn't have much room for the batteries I'd need to store
electricity for after sunset, or cloudy days. <P>

  Two events finally started me moving.  The first was the hurricane of
September 1991, when Exeter & Hampton Electric was out for three days,
and my freezer had a crisis.  The second was Jocelyn's wish to keep her
horse here, instead of boarding elsewhere.
  The existing cow barn had low ceilings everywhere the floors were
strong enough for horses.  A new <A HREF="pv_barn.jpg"> barn </A>
could have an East-West ridgepole, with the roof sloped to face the
sun in Winter (when there's the least sun and our PhotoVoltaic panels
must collect as much as possible), as well as space for the
batteries. <P>

  Ten years ago I'd have had trouble getting the power from the barn
to the house, since most DC appliances use 12 volts, and I would have
needed 150 feet of VERY heavy wire.  However, solid-state inverters that
convert DC to AC quite reliably seem to get less expensive every year.
Using AC for most loads also meant that I could keep the old grid
(power company) connection and switch back if necessary.
  Five years ago most available inverters generated what's called
"Modified Square Wave" power.  It's efficient to produce, but the
waveform is enough different from grid power that it can cause some
problems with noise on telephone lines and won't run some appliances or
computer accessories.  Recently, inverters that produce "Sine Wave"
power have gotten big enough and cheap enough to be a reasonable
alternative, so that's what we chose. <P>

<H2> <A NAME="design">Design and Installation </A> </H2>

  When we sat down with Chip Mauck <I>(Sunweaver Energy
Enterprises, Northwood, NH, 603-942-5863)</I> to design the
system, we wound up with a big one: 48 Solarex MSX-60 PV panels
(totalling 2.6 kiloWatts) to generate electricity, 48 Trojan L-16 6
volt deep-cycle lead-acid batteries to store it, and an AES 5kW
sine-wave inverter to convert DC from the PV/battery system to 120VAC
for the house.  We chose 48 volts DC as the system voltage in order
to make wiring easier (doubling the voltage halves the current). <P>

  PV power is too costly to waste, so conservation measures were in
order: Incandescent light bulbs were replaced with compact
flourescents, an existing refrigerator and freezer were replaced with
<I>SunFrost</I> high-efficiency 120VAC units, and we located all our phantom
loads (things like VCRs and wall-socket power cubes that draw current
all the time, whether you're using them or not).
  The PV power system was a big project already, so three major power
consumers got left till later: The oil-fired hot water heater, the
oil-fired forced hot air furnace and the 3/4HP 120VAC well pump.
Because of this we bought quite a bit of grid power just after the
system went on-line in February of 1993. <P>

  The next step in implementing conservation was replacing the
oil-fired hot water with solar.  In September '93, Chip installed a
<I><A HREF="http://www.thermomax.com/thermomax">Thermomax</I>
evacuated-tube collector </A> and a <I>Vaughn/Sepco</I> 120 gal. tank
with the solar heat exchanger option.  I chose Thermomax collectors
because they're a lot more efficient in cold weather and weak sun.  I
probably wouldn't have used a drain-back system in any case, but the
"thermal diode" provided by the Thermomax's heat-pipe and manifold
collects enough energy on below-freezing days to justify using a
separate propylene glycol loop between the roof and the tank in the
cellar. <P>

  The Thermomax collectors provide almost all of our hot water in the
summer, even while we were washing cloth diapers for Alice, but
during the dead of winter they only manage to keep the tank around
70F.  This gives the backup <I>Aquastar</I> tankless LP gas heater
more of a workout, but that's what we get for living at 42 degrees
North latitude. <P>

We put up with the inefficient 3/4 HP centrifugal well pump until it
let us down during the Summer of '93.  Drought lowered our well's
level to the point where the pump couldn't pressurize the tank.
After a good deal of research, we settled on a 120VAC high-efficiency
vane pump (<I>Slow-Pump</I>, from <I>Dankoff Solar Products, Santa
Fe, NM, 505-820-6611</I>).  It uses a 1/4HP motor, and after it was
installed in November '93, we found that it fills the tank in one
quarter the time while drawing one third the power. <P>

The last major conservation measure was replacing my grandfather's
coal furnace.  He had converted it to oil in the '50s, but the blower
and burner used lots of power, running more than 25% of the time in
the coldest weather.  New hot air furnaces used even more electricity
than the old one, probably because they're designed to push air
through smaller ducts.  We found that forced hot water delivers heat
most efficiently.  We wanted to avoid the ugliness and wasted space
of baseboard units and the possibility of freeze-ups, so we installed
radiant panels and filled the system with a mix of water and
propylene-glycol antifreeze. <P>

  The new boiler is an <I>H.S. Tarm</I> combination oil and wood
gasifier with a Canadian-made <I>Riello</I> burner, which draws 1/3
the current of the old Beckett.  As a bonus, we're no longer
completely dependent on fossil fuel for heat.  As installed, the
control system was using 1.5 kW-hour per day just keeping
transformers and contactors warm.  During the summer of '96, one
high-efficiency toroidal 24 VAC transformer from <I>Plitron</I>
replaced three inefficient ones.  Later I found a way of re-wiring
the Tarm control box to save the 0.27 amp drawn by the two 110VAC
contactors.  <P>

<H2> <A NAME="after"> Afterthoughts </A> </H2>

  Since 1994 we've been installing insulation, to reduce both the
electric load of the furnace, and the waste of non-renewable fossil
fuel generating the heat.  Insulating a house this old is never easy,
but we can't even use blown-in or foamed-in-place products because of
the fancy inside sliding shutters that Isaiah gave Jemmy.
Nevertheless, we're slowly getting it into the walls the hard way,
from the outside.  Simultaneously we've been replacing the aluminum
combination storm windows with old-style wood storms, using
double-pane glass in the smaller ones. <P>

  During the winter of 1993-4 the first battery box was revealed to
be inadequate: it let the batteries get too cold in winter.  Cold
batteries hold less power, which is really bad beause there's less
sun in winter (due to short days and bad weather), and demand is
up because the heat is on.  Other goals included fireproofing, better
cable routing, easier access if I needed to lift a battery out, and
room for air to circulate around the batteries.
  We were on-grid for two weeks in July '94 replacing the box.  The
new one, besides being better insulated, no longer has a concrete
slab carrying cold in underneath it, and is heated in Winter by a
removeable 18 square foot solar hot air collector.  That winter the
new box stayed at or above 45F, about 10F better than the old one.  I
subsequently improved the weatherstripping, which has held the
battery bank at or above 50F through the past winter.  At some point
in the future I will supplement the simple hydrogen vent pipe with a
voltage-controlled fan, possibly integrated with a thermostatic
control for the heat collector. <P>

  In December 1995 we bought a <I>Staber System 2000</I> top loading
horizontal axis clothes washer.  It saves both electricity and water
compared to the Kenmore top-loader it replaced.  It uses less soap,
leaves less residue in the clothes, and extracts more water with its
high-speed spin cycle.  It has not needed any repairs to date, though
I have had to open up the front a couple of times to extract things
that accidentally fell down around the clothes bin. <P>

<H2> <A NAME="wind"> Adding a Wind Generator </A> </H2>

Originally, I had hoped to avoid buying any power except in special
circumstances (system shutdown for repairs or maintenance).  To my
annoyance, this didn't pan out even after various energy conservation
refits.  After living with the system through a couple of winters, it
became clear that neither adding more PV capacity nor trimming small
amounts of demand would help: In this climate the sun can disappear
behind storm clouds for a week or more.  The record so far is 10 days
without direct sun.  Our battery bank is already quite large, but it
still stores at best 4 days' power without severe conservation
measures like shutting off the freezer and the furnace. <P>

Luckily, in the record-holding January 1998 storm we were South of
the icing line.  We didn't have an auxiliary generator on hand, and
the cloud cover was thick and uninterrupted for the whole 10 day
period.  North of the icing line, many places in Maine and Quebec
were without grid power for weeks afterward.  Still, with the
battery/inverter combination alone we would have been a lot better
off than most people - running a generator for 10 or 12 hours would
re-charge our batteries enough for another two or three days. <P>

A good deal has been written about the way PV and wind power can
complement each other - in many climates, when there's no sun,
there's usually wind, and vice versa.  Here in New England, the match
isn't perfect (the January 1998 ice storm had long periods of calm),
but the idea still interested me.  I started digging into wind
technology in 1995, but the two old Enertech wind generators I
salvaged required grid-intertie; We needed a stand-alone unit to take
advantage of our existing battery bank.  It appeared that our
existing PV didn't need a whole lot of help, and some research into
average wind speeds in the area convinced me that around 1 or 2
kiloWatts capacity would do.  <P>

Taking factors like required maintenance, availability and
manufacturer's reputation for quality into account, I decided on a
1500 watt unit from <I> Bergey Windpower Company, Inc. </I>.  This is
a self-furling 3-bladed upwind-rotor machine, with a permanent magnet
3-phase direct drive alternator.  Its tower-top weight is about 170
lb., with a 10 foot rotor diameter.  In my application, a
solid-state control box installed near my batteries converts the AC
to regulated DC for battery charging. <P>

Because our house is in a partially forested valley, our wind
generator wanted a tall tower.  Surveying from the roofs of my barn
and a neighbor's house with a level convinced me we needed about 100
feet worth.  Tilt-up towers are the cheapest way to get height, but
in 1995, I had had a couple of unpleasant experiences with one while
conducting wind speed measurements.  What tipped the balance was
salvaging the second Enertech genny; UNH wanted it dismantled, and
threw in a never-used 60 foot Rohn free-standing tower as an
incentive.  That job also confirmed that I wasn't any more bothered
by heights than I had been while climbing trees as a kid.  So, rather
than worry about when (not if) a farm animal or vehicle would clip a
guy wire, I decided to extend the free-standing tower to 100 feet by
buying two new sections. <P>

I had expected that buying everything off the shelf would mean that
the installation would go quickly.  Boy, was I wrong.  I wrote the
first check in September 1997, hoping to be on-line by Winter.
However, the foundation couldn't be poured until the day before
Christmas, because Chip wanted to assemble the tower first to ensure
it fit the bolt pattern.  The Bergey and its special tower stub for
use with a free-standing tower didn't arrive until February.  But,
everything finally came together, and I scheduled the crane for March
24, 1998.<P>

The crane arrived on time, the weather was fine, and not too windy.
The only glitch was that Chip had assembled the tower too close to a
tree, so we had to lift it once, horizontally and move it a bit
before we could put it upright. I was taking pictures <A
HREF="crane1.jpg"> as the crane began the lift. </A> It handled the
load (less than 3000 lb.) easily, bringing it <A HREF="crane2.jpg">
almost upright </A> in about a minute.  Then it lifted the whole
tower and <A HREF="crane3.jpg"> swung it over to the foundation. </A>
After we got it onto the mounting bolts and tightened down, <A
HREF="crane4.jpg"> Chip's employee Ian climbed the tower to unhook
the sling </A>.  It took another couple of days to finish the wiring
and tower grounding.<P>

Writing two weeks after, the installation, I'm pretty satisfied.  As
expected, when the wind blows, the Bergey adds quite a bit to our
capacity.  So far, we've only seen two consecutive days with neither
clear skies nor wind, which the batteries handled easily.  The
generator is a bit noisier than I had expected - the most noticeable
noise is the swish of the blades as a gust dies down and the rotor
decelerates.  The only problem so far has been a fuse blown in the
Bergey control/rectifier unit.  I was confused to find a 1 amp fuse
where the manual specified a 2 amp fuse, but a couple of calls to
Bergey set that straight. We'll see how things go the rest of the
year, and whether "net metering" gets approved by Concord... <P>

<H2> <A NAME="payoff"> Does it Pay? </A> </H2>

  I often get asked "Does it pay"?  Solar hot water with LP gas
backup costs a lot less than electric.  I don't know how it compares
with oil; I never knew exactly how much oil went to the water heater
and how much to the furnace.  PV electricity is fairly costly; the PV
panels and other hardware will last a long time, but even with the
best treatment the lead-acid battery bank deteriorates in 10 years.
However, one of our major concerns was power outages.  Back in 1994,
our daughter Alice was born here at home, with a midwife attending.
While Jocelyn was in labor, thunderstorms knocked out grid power
throughout the town.  We never even noticed.  As far as I'm
concerned, the whole PV system paid for itself that evening.<P>

<H2> <A NAME="future"> Future Plans </A> </H2>

  In the future, we're thinking about an electric car for all the
short trips and errands to town.  The existing PV system isn't big
enough to handle a large daily charging load, and moving power from
one battery to another doubles your inefficiency.  If we proceed, we
expect we will have to change over to grid-intertie (where we sell
power to the grid when we have extra, we buy it when we aren't
generating as much as we need).  Our AES inverter seems quite solid,
having run six years without a glitch, but it can only run
stand-alone.  Newer inverters are easy to configure for
grid-intertie, but we're dawdling because current control software
treats the battery bank strictly as an emergency backup.  We're told
that soon they will be configurable to use the battery first, and
grid power only when the battery is partially discharged, which we
prefer.  In any case, a fast electric car charger would need 220 VAC,
which would arrive as a side-effect of the inverter upgrade required
by grid intertie.  <P>

I also want to reduce the overall refrigeration load.  Simplest way
would be to blanket the Sunfrosts - they have more insulation than
the competition, but it could still be improved upon.  There are also
some people with interesting ideas about dumping waste heat from
refrigerators into the hot water tank, which might make the
compressors run more efficiently as well.  Another strategy would be
two freezers - one in a cool part of the house (cellar?) for 3 -
season use, and another in an uninsulated space on the north side for
the dark days of winter.<P>

Total consumption is about 6.7 kWh/day in summer (refrigerators
working hard).  The Winter of 1995 was about the same, partly because
the the heating system wasted a remarkable amount of power.  The
electrical changes I made in the Summer of 1996 reduced the idle
current draw quite a bit, and with the house mostly insulated, the
heat ran less as well.  Still, I bought power to charge up the
batteries at least once in every month from November to March in the
succeeding winters. <P>

<H2>PV system cost</H2>

Roughly $47,000, including 110VAC distribution wiring to house. The
battery bank would cost about $9,000 to replace after a 10 year
lifespan (by 2003).  The only other maintenance cost is distilled
water for batteries, about $12/year.  A newer, better-insulated house
wouldn't need as large a system, and eliminating one of the
refrigerators or switching to wood stoves for heat would also save
quite a bit.<P>

<H2>Solar Hot Water System cost</H2>

Roughly $6,000.  LP gas use (including gas stove) is about 12
gal/month in Winter.  The only maintenance is periodic refresh of the
propylene glycol antifreeze. <P>
