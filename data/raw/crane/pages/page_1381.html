<div class="h1">The Bureau of Street Services as a Municipal Enforcement Agency</div>

      <div class="text"> The 
        Bureau through its Street Services Investigation and Enforcement is primarily responsible 
        for public property and protecting citizens from injuries and accidents 
        that may occur as a result of hazardous and dangerous conditi<span class="h1"><img src="Chief%20Investigator%20Pic05_work.jpg" width="179" height="202" align="right"></span>ons existing 
        on public property. The Division enforces a variety of Municipal Code 
        Sections and Board of Public Works regulations enacted to protect public 
        property, ensure public safety and minimize the City's exposure to liability.</div>

      <div class="text">Street Services Investigators are classified as "Public Officers" 
        pursuant to Section 836.5 of the Penal Code of the State of California. 
        This classification grants investigators the authority to issue " personal 
        service" citations (Notices to Appear in Court) and to effect misdemeanor 
        arrests for violations under their jurisdiction. While this authority 
        is an effective tool, it is mainly utilized for flagrant and/or recurring 
        type of violations. Under most circumstances, compliance is obtained through 
        the issuance of "Nuisance" type notices and via the Administrative/City 
        Attorney Hearing process.</div>
		 
      <div class="text">Enforcement and regulatory activities within the Division 
        fall within three general categories: <strong>construction, public health 
        and safety, and community/event based operations</strong>. </div>
		
		
      <div class="text"><img src="../gif/DCTM.jpg" width="252" height="158" align="left">Within 
        the area of construction related operations: the Division utilizes a permit 
        based system to regulate the use of cranes, the placement and storage 
        of building materials and equipment, the construction of protective fences, 
        walkthrough canopies, the importing/exporting of earth materials, fire 
        apparatus tests (excess water on streets), imperilment of lateral support 
        of streets and sidewalks, the movement of houses and other extra-legal 
        loads, and Rail Traffic Construction Impact Area Ordinance enforcement.</div>
		
		
      <div class="text"><img src="../gif/Illegal%20sign%20real%20estate.jpg" width="247" height="252" align="right">Public 
        health and safety related operations include: visibility obstructions 
        at intersections; illegal sign removal; obstructions in public rights-of-way; 
        entrance canopies, broken sidewalks, curbs and driveway approaches; illegal 
        dumping of combustible or non-combustible rubbish on public property or 
        private premises; sidewalk cleaning contract oversight; and coordinating 
        homeless clean-up activities. </div>
		
		
      <div class="text">Community/event based operations involve: temporary street 
        closures for community based organizations or neighborhood watch groups, 
        sidewalk selling activities, street banners announcing special events, 
        Bus Bench Program Management and Transit Shelter contracts, and permits 
        for seasonal decorations.</div>
		
		
      <div class="text">One investigator is assigned to each of the 24 maintenence 
      districts. Each district is comprised of approximately 250 centerline miles. 
      The Division's mission is to improve the quality of life for the public 
      by increasing safety and cleanliness levels throughout the city and by making 
      public rights-of-way more aesthetically pleasing. Division investigators are 
      encouraged to accomplish the objectives primarily by voluntary compliance, 
      taking into consideration that most contacts are with individuals that are 
      tied to the community (property owners, business owners, contractors and 
      developers). The Division responds to 97.4 percent of all complaints within 
      24 hours of receipt and due to the wide ranging types of violations enforced, 
      it acts as a liaison and provides referrals to and for other agencies. </div>
