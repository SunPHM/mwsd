<font size=-2 color=000000>Cottontail rabbit tracks. The bunny that
left these marks behind was running in the direction of the bottom of this
page.  The large hind-foot tracks land ahead of the smaller front-foot
tracks to push the rabbit along.

<P>Two wild creatures have been entertaining us quite regularly
each day at dusk.  The cardinals are filling their crops with
sunflower seeds for the last time before retiring for the night
to safety, and to get out of the wind in the dense grove of white
spruce trees to the west of our house.

<P>The other stealthy animals, the cottontail rabbits, quite
often sneak out of their daytime &quot;hides&quot; in a nearby,
snow-covered brush pile, before the cardinals have filled up on
food.  Cottontails are largely nocturnal and will carry on their
feeding, frolicking and courtship activities under the shield of
darkness.

<P>Now that the remaining snow is so hard and crusty, the
cottontails can run at full speed without sinking down.  The
recent light dusting of snow clearly reveals a veritable plethora
of tracks that the seven &quot;bunnies&quot; we have counted at
one instant in our front yard have laid down during the past
several days.

<P>Throughout much of the northern half of the state the tracks
of cottontails will commonly be seen along with those of their
larger cousin, the snowshoe or varying hare.  Their ranges
clearly overlap.  I have found this to be most prevalent in our
county in mixed woods, especially closer to the lake, where
conifers predominate.  When my dad went hunting the larger of the
two animals in areas north of Green Bay he always referred to
them simply as jackrabbits.

<P>One feature, in addition to its larger size, that
distinguishes the jackrabbit from the so-called cottontail
rabbit, is its longer ears.  In fact it is thought that the term
jackrabbit came about due to its large ears resembling those of a
jackass.  Another point of differentiation is the change of color
of the jackrabbit’s pelage, from largely reddish-brown, peppered
with black in summer, to white in winter, with the exception of
its black ear tips.  The cottontail’s pelage remains generally
the same throughout the year.

<P>I like the name of varying hare, due to its change of color,
and also its nickname, snowshoe hare, due to its unusually large
hind feet, nearly five inches long.  Its genus name,
<I>Lepus</I>, is Latin for hare – so hare it will be for me.

<P>When I was between 18 and 20 years old, the few years that I
ever hunted with rifle or shotgun, a group of us occasionally
hunted for what we called &quot;prairie jacks.&quot;  We’d hunt
in late fall or early winter north of town in the wide-open
fields, and all I can remember is that I never shot one of those
incredibly swift runners.  Unfortunately I never thought of
measuring their leaps but my guess is that they could easily span
ten or more feet at top speed.   I can distinctly remember them
running away from us in the distance and resembling small deer – big and fast.  Those animals were most likely European hares, <I>Lepus europaeus</I> that were introduced to the US late in the Nineteenth Century and eventually spread across the eastern part of the country and also around the Great Lakes.

<P>The farther one travels on our continent the bigger the native
hares become.  Far to the north are the Alaskan and Arctic hares,
both of which can weigh between five and ten pounds with an
occasional heavyweight going as high as sixteen pounds.  Our
native snowshoe hare is between two and five pounds.

<P>An interesting feature of the northernmost hares is their
upper incisors which are elongated and projecting.  This enables
those hares to scrape thin crustose lichens from the surfaces of
boulders, one of their primary sources of food in some regions in
winter.

<P>Our snowshoe hares’ diet ranges quite widely although it
consists almost exclusively of plant material including aspen,
evergreens, dandelions, clover, willow, grasses, sumac, ferns,
hazlenut, alder and dwarf birch.  One look at a browsed twig and
you can easily tell if it was chewed by a hare or a deer.  The
hare (and cottontail) will leave very sharp slant or diagonal
cuts while a deer will chew or rip the twig leaving it with a
ragged tip.

<P>I have an idea that the cottontail rabbit population is quite
high now, based on the number we are observing on our property
and also on the number of road-kills of these creatures we
encounter.  However I do not know where the snowshoe hares stand
in their approximately 10-11-year cycles.  Based upon past
studies done in our state, their peak population can be around
four and a half million.

<P>One of the natural foods they rely upon heavily is the quaking
aspen.   The small two-to-three-year-old shoots coming back on
heavily-browsed stands of aspens quite magically synthesize
noxious chemicals that are &quot;defensive&quot; to the survival
of the aspens and which the hares cannot assimilate, nor are they
very palatable.  As a result the hare population becomes lower,
weaker, and much easier prey for their many natural predators
such as the Canada lynx, wolf and bobcat.  Now their populations
climb rather quickly.

<P>How wonderfully the populations of some wild creatures are
naturally controlled.  Perhaps it’s high time that the
&quot;experts&quot; take a closer look at the human population
explosion occurring within our midst which in turn is leading to
the disappearance of space for ourselves as well as nature.  Do
you suppose they might learn a thing or two from the snowshoe
hares?
