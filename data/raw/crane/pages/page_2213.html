<meta NAME="abstract"
CONTENT="The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has held a        leading international position in wildlife research and management since its                                         founding in 1936 as America's first wildlife experiment station and research refuge.
In 1940 there were less than 20 whooping cranes alive in the world. Changes in habitat, egg collecting, and hunting almost led to its extinction. There are now 188 whoopers in that wild flock, another 100 in captivity, and over 60 in an experimental flock in Florida. This recovery was directly due to conservation efforts, scientific research, and changes in land management.
	Unique to North America, the whooping crane stands 5 feet tall with a long neck and long legs. Its pure white body feathers are accented by jet black wing-tips and a red-and-black head with a long, pointed beak. The wings measure about 8 feet across.
	Breeding whooping cranes in captivity at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center began in 1967 with 12 eggs collected from the wild flock.  The Patuxent flock currently has 44 adults, with 9 experienced breeding pairs who generally lay around 50 eggs a year in total. From these eggs last year, we raised 26 chicks most of which were released in Florida.  ">

      <p ALIGN="CENTER">An Eagle Scout Helps the Cranes</p>

      </font><p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Volunteers
      have always been a critical part of the crane program, providing services
      that we might otherwise have to do without. But recently, several
      volunteers went beyond the norm in helping the crane program solve a
      long-term problem. The solution directly affected the well-being of the
      cranes, and helped us provide the high quality animal care we
      strive for.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Like any
      other government research facility that uses animals in research, the
      Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has an Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC)
      that inspects facilities and animals and reviews research study plans to
      ensure we are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. One member of the
      ACUC must be from outside Patuxent from the local community. It was while
      serving on the ACUC that volunteer Jerry Persall recognized, during
      routine inspections, that some of the crane facilities' older feed sheds
      needed replacing. Budget and staffing constraints had postponed this
      project for years, but the sheds were now beyond the point where simple
      repairs and fresh paint could prolong their useful life.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Jerry was
      also a member of the board of <a href="http://www.friendspwrc.org/">The
      Friends of Patuxent</a>, a volunteer organization whose purpose is to
      support the missions and programs of the Patuxent Research Refuge and the
      Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. He discussed our need for new feed
      sheds with other board members, to see if the Friends could provide the
      funds for new sheds. Ed Grimes, another volunteer on the board of the
      Friends, had a grandson, Matt Horton, who was looking for a project to
      complete his Eagle Scout requirement. Jerry was able to get the funds for
      the building materials through a grant from the Friends, and Matt agreed
      to build the sheds for his Eagle Scout project.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Through this
      combined volunteer effort, the Patuxent crane project received 20 brand
      new feed sheds to replace old, worn sheds. It was a big project requiring
      carpentry and roofing skills as well as lots of labor -- over 400 hours of
      labor. Matt needed the help of many volunteers. Other scouts worked with
      him, as did adult volunteers including his parents and grandparents, and
      several friends.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Once the
      sheds were built, the crane crew dismantled the old sheds and prepared the
      sites for the new ones. This style of shed, which is shorter than the tall
      sheds we use in breeding pairs pens, are used in community pens where they
      are shared by several birds. The shed is a good wind-break and a place for
      the birds to get out of the weather if they choose, as well as protection
      for the cranes' food supply.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The
      volunteers involved with Matt Horton's Eagle Scout project to build 20 new
      feed sheds were: Susie Ahlfeld, Barbara Buck, Lou Buck, John Carroll, Susan Crawford,
      Allen Dansie, Ed Grimes, Lucy Grimes, Daniel Hanlan, Hazel Horton, Jackie
      Horton, Lori Horton, Mark Horton, Matt Horton, Josh Ingeholm, John
      Ingeholm, Richard Klingner, Malcolm Livingston, Grant McDaniel, Andrew
      Mulhall, Jay Pape, Ellen Pattin, Jerry Persall, Rick, Potvin, Alex
      Righter, Bryan Righter, Gwen Robinette, and Sparky Sparks.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Everyone in
      the crane program at Patuxent is grateful to all the volunteers who helped
      on this project. Every time we work in the community pens with their brand
      new, handsome feed sheds we are reminded of their tremendous contribution
      to the welfare of the cranes.&nbsp;</font></p>

      surrogate research work.&nbsp;</font></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#008000"><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">There
      are three rows of crane pairs in the Yellow Series and until this year,
      the third row was still waiting for their old style low feed sheds to be
      replaced with modern, tall sheds. The old sheds were in poor condition,
      many over 20 years old, and needed replacement. The new sheds make it
      easier for staff to check feed without entering the pen, and provide good
      shelter in bad weather.&nbsp;</font>



      </font>



      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The pairs
      were moved out of the pens until the 16 new feed sheds were fully
      installed, so they wouldn't be disturbed by the heavy equipment and
      unusual activity.&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The
      Fish and Wildlife Service, our partners on the refuge, helped us by
      loaning us the heavy equipment we needed to move the sheds, and also
      gravel and sand for filler.&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">The
      crane technicians worked hard on the project, moving the birds themselves,
      then removing the old sheds, cutting chain link, preparing the site, metal
      detecting the ground once the sheds were completely installed, and
      bringing the birds back home.&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">In
      addition, volunteers Allan Dansie, Jay Pape, and Charles Robinson helped
      enormously with the project, giving us many hours of their time and
      expertise as we installed the new sheds, reattached the chain link, and
      prepared the pens for the return of the pairs.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="center"><img border="0" src="photog/report32fencecutting.jpg" width="283" height="412" alt="Jane and Brian, crane technicians, cut the chain link fence to prepare the pen for the new feed shed.
