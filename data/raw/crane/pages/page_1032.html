<strong>By Suzanne Fischer</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000"><b>F</b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">ly in or out of one of North Carolina's three major airports these days and you can't
help but notice all the new construction. More parking decks are going up, access roads
are improving and more runways are being added. At both Raleigh-Durham International and
Charlotte Douglas International, on-going and potential construction could vastly change
the size and scope of the airports and improve convenience for passengers. Of course,
those benefits won't occur until after all the construction is finished.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Mention RDU's &#147;parking problem&#148; and Mike Blanton, the
airport's public relations chief, winces slightly. &#147;We do get a bad rap for that, but
how much of it is perception and how much reality?&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Currently 11,300 cars can park at RDU, albeit a good number of
them in far-flung park-and-ride lots. With the completion of a $40 million parking lot (<em>pictured
above</em>), due with luck to open in November, that number will increase by 2,700. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">If the lot does get completed by November, in time for holiday
traffic, it will still have missed its original deadline by five months. &#147;Unlike
putting up a new building in some empty site,&#148; Blanton says, &#147;our challenge is
to provide normal operation with construction going on around it.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The expanded parking and the addition of a new curbside and two
lanes of traffic at Terminal A will eliminate a lot of headaches for Triangle travelers.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;This will essentially double the amount of roadway we have
to work with,&#148; Blanton says. &#147;It'll make everything out there run a lot
smoother.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Other immediate parking improvements include the paving of a
gravel park-and-ride lot. &#147;We know it's no fun dragging luggage over the rocks and
around mud puddles,&#148; Blanton acknowledges. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">And over the course of the next eight or nine years, the airport
will continue to add on to the new deck in order to end up with some 16,000 parking spaces
between terminals A and C, not including the existing park-and-ride lots. A tunnel
eventually will run under the parking deck, connecting the two terminals.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Terminal construction, too, is in the works. Airport plans call
for tearing out an existing cargo facility to expand Terminal A, making room for more
flights and additional carriers. Eventually, like neighboring Terminal C, A will be two
levels with departing passengers and ticketing on the upper level and arriving passengers
and baggage claim on the lower. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;It's a major, major project, in the neighborhood of $400 to
$500 million dollars,&#148; Brantley says. &#147;It'll take place in a series of phases
over the next five to seven years.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The airport's capital improvement plan also calls for the
addition of a third larger runway in the next six to eight years, and there's a five-year
redevelopment project for the general aviation facilities, including new hangar space, new
taxi way, and new terminal.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">In Charlotte, in addition to proposing a fourth runway, airport
officials are in talks with Norfolk Southern Railroad about a plan to build a $90 million
railroad terminal, that would link the airport, railroad, highways and the Port of
Charleston.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;Certainly if you look at the fact that Charlotte is a
primary distribution hub and the sixth largest wholesale center in the country with $26
billion in wholesale sales and 43,000 people in this county employed in wholesale, you can
see there is a need for cargo shipping and handling here,&#148; says Tony Crumbly, vice
president of research for the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. &#147;Nothing of the scope
they're talking about is available now. And this is the logical place for pulling all the
goods that are shipped in and out of this area.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Construction at the airports is an outward sign of strong growth
this entire decade by the state's economy. That growth is obvious in other ways, as
follows:</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Fed-Ex Plans Proceeding</font></b> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">In Greensboro, planning continues for the Federal Express
Mid-Atlantic Hub at Piedmont Triad International Airport. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;We don't have the same kind of dynamics going on as
RDU,&#148; says Ted Johnson, executive director of the Piedmont Triad Airport Authority.
&#147;But we're working hard and excited about Fed Ex.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Currently an environmental impact statement study is underway.
Engineering and architectural consulting firm URS Greiner, charged with overseeing the
process, has begun gathering data on 21 areas of potential environmental impact, including
noise, land use, air and water quality, light emissions, hazardous materials, and
wetlands. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">A draft of the EIS is expected in late 1999 with a complete
statement submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration by August 2000. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Dr. G. Donald Jud, an economics professor at UNC-G, recently
estimated that the hub will generate an economic impact of $2.4 billion in its first 10
years of operation. He also predicts that the facility will produce 2,541 full-time jobs,
both directly and indirectly, and projects that the number could increase to over 3,000 by
the year 2008.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The proposed hub has not been without its share of controversy,
however. Local citizens' groups worry that the hub will increase noise and pollution
levels and actually cost the area money, although airport officials call claims that the
city will have to spend unreasonable amounts of money on noise mitigation &#147;grossly
exaggerated.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Raleigh-Durham International</font></b> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The news that could have the greatest impact on travelers at RDU
is the arrival of Southwest Airlines, which begins service on June 6 with 12 daily
departures.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;Southwest is going to be a very big deal,&#148; says Keith
Debbage, a UNC-Greensboro professor and airline industry expert. &#147;If the market is
anything like they're predicting, they could be looking at 30 to 50 flights a day. It will
revolutionize air travel in this state.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The nation's fifth largest air carrier, Southwest chose RDU over
several other airports, including Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International, RDU's closest
competitor. Blanton attributes RDU's appeal to the area's diverse marketplace and
potential for growth.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;We're not reliant on any one industry. We've got computers
and pharmaceuticals, medical facilities, lots of high-tech, government . . . oh, and
students! Students love to fly Southwest,&#148; he says. &#147;It's part of Southwest's
corporate culture to have a ball at work and provide unique customer service. That's
resulted in a lot of customer loyalty.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Despite it's reputation for uniqueness, however, Southwest's real
draw is its fare structure. Known for being a low-cost carrier, Southwest's impending
arrival already has stimulated a fare war among some of the airport's other carriers in an
effort to remain competitive. According to Blanton, Delta Express and MetroJet started
dropping prices in April, with others likely to follow suit.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Ironically, it was American Airline's decision to close its hub
at RDU that opened the airport to new low-cost carriers and more competition among
airlines and, as a result, more favorable fares for passengers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;When American closed its hub in 1995, a lot of people had a
`woe is me' kind of thing going on,&#148; Blanton explains. &#147;But John Brantley [the
airport's director] has a good knack for seeing 15 to 20 years down the road. He knew that
without a dominant player we would eventually be able to reap the benefits of airline
deregulation.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Fare Woes in Charlotte</font></b> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">More than 20 years ago, passage of the Airline Deregulation Act
phased out government control over fares and service and allowed market forces to
determine the price, quantity and quality of domestic air service. In many markets,
deregulation resulted in lower fares and more competition. But, according to a March study
by the U.S. General Accounting Office, &#147;these benefits have not been evenly
distributed throughout U.S. air service markets&#148; and &#147;some operating and
marketing practices have created barriers to entry for new airlines wishing to begin
service and for established airlines seeing to enter new markets.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">The GAO's report names Charlotte/Douglas International Airport as
one of six &#147;gate restrained&#148; airports, meaning the agency believes that
competition at the airport is restrained by restrictive gate-leasing arrangements
predominantly held by one airline. Indeed, the airport is known in the industry as a
&#147;fortress hub,&#148; or one where a single carrier can claim at least 75 percent of
the market share. In the Queen City, US Airways handles 90 percent of all the traffic in
and out of the airport and holds exclusive leases on 43 of the airport's 48 gates. This,
the GAO reports, makes Charlotte one of the most expensive airports to fly out of in the
country.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;From our perspective, there is no barrier to entry in
Charlotte,&#148; US Airways spokesman Rick Weintraub says. &#147;We don't have a lockdown
on facilities. There are facilities there for other carriers.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">Haley Gentry, a public information specialist for the airport,
concurs. &#147;We have all the major carriers here and they serve their hubs in other
cities. We have available gates as of this moment, so space is available for other
carriers to initiate service.&#148; (</font><i>US Airways is adding a new flight to
London. See story. p. 41</i>)</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">As for widely reported studies about the expense of flying out of
Charlotte, Weintraub counters that the comparisons weren't made &#147;on an apples to
apples basis.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;The problem with these studies is they lump all the
business fares [which are traditionally more expensive] and leisure fares together and
come up with an average. If you compare a destination like Orlando, which has almost all
leisure travel, to one like Charlotte, where there is a much higher percentage of business
travel, sure, Charlotte's going to look expensive.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#000000">Even so, </font><i>The Business Journal</i> recently reported
that almost 60 percent of the companies it surveyed say high fares at Charlotte/Douglas
International Airport negatively affected their business. In response to mounting concerns
about the fares and their impact on industry, Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory appointed a
10-member task force, chaired by Ed Weisiger Sr. of Carolina Tractor, to evaluate all
aspects of airline service, competition and airfares in the Charlotte region. The task
force is expected to conduct a thorough evaluation of the issues before making an August
recommendation to the City Council.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Gentry says the task force isn't unique to Charlotte and that the
city is dealing with issues familiar to other hub cities around the country. &#147;We have
high hopes that it will do something positive, and if there's a market that can be served
by a low-cost carrier we'd love to figure out how to do that.&#148; The airport authority,
she says, is also working closely with the business community through the Chamber to see
if its needs are being met.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">And while the hub has spurred controversy of late, Debbage, the
airline industry expert from UNC-G, reminds us of its benefits as well. &#147;You've got
to remember that there are not many cities with a million folks that have 500 daily
departures, as Charlotte does.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;It is hard to have both,&#148; Gentry agrees. &#147;Either
you have the level of service that a major carrier can offer, or you have more competition
and more airlines but half the cities to choose from.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">US Airways employs 7,300 at the Charlotte hub; created 1,000 new
maintenance positions there last year, with average annual salaries of $40,000; and serves
about 140 destinations directly from CDI.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Small Airports Providing Big Service</font></b> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Sometimes left out of the limelight generated by the state's
major airports, North Carolina's smaller airports work to remain the logical choice for
local flyers.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;That's just the nature of the beast,&#148; says Will Plentl
Jr., executive director of the New Hanover County Airport Authority. &#147;What we try to
do is make Wilmington International Airport as attractive and convenient as possible and
we offer the best air transportation services we can.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Last year, the airport served about half a million passengers, an
increase of almost 20 percent over 1997. Plentl partially attributes that increase to the
addition of United Express and Midway Corporate airlines as well as the trend toward more
competitive fares. In all, five carriers serve Wilmington with about 50 total arrivals and
departures a day. A $6 million terminal renovation will add more gates and jetways.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">What the airport lacks in sheer numbers it hopes to make up in
comfort: the terminal's waiting areas are designed to feel more like a hotel lobby or
front porch, even, with rocking chairs and couches, and business travelers can plug in
laptops in private work modules.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;We're a small, but self-sufficient airport,&#148; Plentl
says. &#147;We're profitable in a small way.&#148;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Asheville Regional Airport, too, saw gains in passenger levels
last year, with over half a million flyers, up 6.8 percent from 1997. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">&#147;We're pretty modest by state-wide standards, but big from
an Asheville perspective,&#148; says Kathryn Solee, director of the airport's marketing
and public relations.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Three carriers serve Asheville Regional with an average of 27
flights daily to hub airports in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Raleigh.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2">Debbage, from UNC-G, thinks this strategy works well for smaller
airports. &#147;I encourage them to offer more commuter flights to the big hubs, because
there just is no more room in the state for major jet service. I think that by focusing
their promotional strategies on recruiting commuter affiliates of major airlines smaller
airports can really thrive.&#148;</font></p>
