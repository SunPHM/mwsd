				    cranes must have
				    mate choices besides their
				own brother or sister! But it would be impossible for OM people
				    to lead each crane individually, the way
				    natural crane parents do in the wild. So to maximize
				the number of cranes released in the project, the cranes are
				    taught to accept other baby cranes into their flock. They
				    aren't really brothers and sisters. They ARE the
