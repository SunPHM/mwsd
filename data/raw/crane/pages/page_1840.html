			&quot;This has been a bad year for the whooping crane. Despite a record 51 nesting
			pairs, production was low in Canada in the summer of 2000. Although 30 chicks were
			present in June, only 9 completed the 2,500 milemigration and arrived at Aransas.
			In addition, two of the 9 have died at Aransas this winter. Total numbers in the

Meanwhile, some exciting events are taking place in the efforts to save endangered
			whooping cranes--officially called the Whooping Crane Recovery Program. Experts like
			Tom Stehn, Wally Jobman, and Brian Johns are some of the folks working hard on behalf
			of cranes. Together with the <A HREF="www.savingcranes.org">International Crane Foundation</A>
			and <A HREF="www.operationmigration.org">Operation Migration</A>, they are helping
			good things happen. The important discovery of another scientist has played a big
			role too. His name is Bernhard Wessling. He has discovered a valuable and surprising
			thing: Just as fingerprints identify individual humans as one-of-a-kind, crane voiceprints
			can be used to identify individual cranes! <BR>
			This photo shows Dr. Wessling in front of an ultralight aircraft with pilot Bill
			Lishman. The photo was taken just before the first test flights for Operation Migration,
			during which planes equipped with Dr. Wessling's recorded crane calls led sandhill
			cranes on migration. It was the first time it was possible to &quot;talk to&quot;
			cranes in their own language as they followed the plane. (This important aircraft-led
			migration experiment was conducted in fall 2000, using 13 sandhill cranes. Experts
			will use what they learn to carry out a similar migration project in the near future
			with whooping cranes. It will be an important step in the hopes for establishing
			a SECOND flock of migratory whooping cranes.) For more information about Operation
			Migration and the exciting use of crane calls to train the cranes, see:

			<P>Dr. Wessling was recently at Aransas NWR with the whooping cranes. Today Journey

			<P>Dear Journey North Students:<BR>
			As I write this on February 6, 2001, I am ready to fly back to Germany. I was just
			in the wintering area of the Whooping cranes at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge,
			where I recorded whooping crane calls for a full week. Together with some pairs recorded
			by Brian Johns in summer 2000 at Wood Buffalo National Park, we now &quot;personally
			know&quot; by voice 35 whooping crane pairs--or more than 70% of all breeding pairs!
			<BR>
			The first pair I recorded back in December 1999 made it back to Aransas this winter,
			and I met this pair again on Heron's Flats. Known as the Mustang Lake pair, it usually
			stays and roosts at Mustang Lake. Thanks to my earlier recorded calls from these
			cranes, we just realized that this crane pair changes back and forth between Heron's
			Flats and Mustang Lake! After I recorded their call this time, I compared by listening
			to the recording from last year. My ear says it is the same pair, and I am looking
			forward to seeing what my computer analysis says when I get back home in Germany.
			Hear them here:

			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>This is the only crane pair that can be seen from publicly accessible places at
			ANWR--either from the &quot;Herons Flats Trail&quot; or from the visitor tower overlooking
			Mustang Lake. All other pairs live in territories in the closed part of the Wildlife
			Refuge, but visitors aboard a tour boat cruising the Intracoastal Waterway can observe
			some pairs when the cranes are looking for food in the shallow water.<BR>
			Back in Germany, I will start analyzing the many recordings I made --about 150 files.
			I keep track of comments where I am, from where I recorded, and the location where
			the calls came from. The files comprise calls from 25 to 27 crane pairs. I will try
			to match these with the calls recorded last winter (1999-2000). Then we will see:

			<P><BR>
			Dr. Wessling's goal is to record the voices every year, and at different times of
			the year. That way scientists can better find out who is still alive and living with
			his former partner in his former territory. There may be pairs changing territories
			with other pairs, and there may be pairs splitting up, changing mates, or getting
			a new mate when the former mate is no longer alive. All these events happen with
			whoopers and other crane species. Can YOU tell cranes apart by listening to their
			voices? Dr. Wessling invites you to start out as he did, using just your ears. Read
			on!<BR>

			Three crane calls are given below. They are Eurasian (Common) Crane calls recorded
			by Dr. Wessling. Two of the calls are from the same pair of cranes. Begin by listening
			to see if you can differentiate the two cranes in each unison call. Once you realize

			calls in between. After practice, see if you can answer:

			<P>Dr. Wessling says, &quot;The 'tak-tak-tak' you hear in between calls is the female.
			Most people never get to hear whooping cranes call. If you visit the refuge, they
			don't call in the daytime, or it's so far away you can't distinguish male and female.
			Even people who have heard the call have not distinguished male and female. You can
			definitely hear it. Listen over and over again until you can say, 'I have differentiated
			two voices in the unison call. Somebody calls a little longer, starts deeper and
			goes higher, and in between I hear someone else.'<BR>
			&quot;Most listeners think the call of the Eurasian crane sounds clearer, more like
			a pure musical instrument. Whooping cranes sound less melodical and more like an
			old musical instrument with a rattle in it. The male and female whoopers in this
			call are more or less on the same tone height /frequency. They also use a relatively
			wide range of their frequency. But in the Eurasian crane calls, the female crane
			calls much higher than the male. The female's 'tak tak tak' is the same.&quot; You
			will see more differences on a computer-made sonogram. (See teacher Tip below.)<BR>
