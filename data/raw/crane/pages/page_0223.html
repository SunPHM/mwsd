Black, they've added a drain from the area runninginto the storm sewer.&nbsp; Shortly after my arrival a flatcar and a <a href="crane.jpeg">magnetcrane</a> came down the north spur and went west out of town.<p>There appeared to be a fairly sizable group waiting on the train todayand many of them were not in the waiting room, but hanging out on <a href="waiting1.jpeg">whateverseating</a> they could find in the <a href="waiting2.jpeg">shade on thenorth side</a> of the depot.&nbsp; One thing that distinguishes Amtrakfrom its competition in central Iowa is that they do not provide an air-conditionedwaiting room.&nbsp; They do provide generous amounts of waiting, though.<p>At 10:20, Foreman Jack Ellis gave the approaching passenger train permissionto pass his Form B at the grade crossing (MP 359.7 to 360.8) and then madesure that <a href="paver.jpeg">the pavers</a> were in the clear.&nbsp;The <a href="train.jpeg">Zephyr</a> showed shortly with <a href="AMTK150.jpeg">AMTK150</a>, 132 and <a href="AMTK127.jpeg">127</a>.&nbsp; The remainder ofthe consist:<blockquote>Baggage 1188<br>Transition Sleeper 39031<br>Coaches 34054, 34045, 31036 (coach-baggage) and 31524<br>Sightseer Lounge 33022<br>Diner 38004<br>Sleepers 32009 (<a href="pullman.jpeg">George M. Pullman</a>), 32110(<a href="tennessee.jpeg">Tennessee</a>) and 32030<br>Material 1460<br>Baggage 1269<br>Six boxcars and <a href="AMTK71172.jpeg">no Roadrailers</a></blockquote>After the coach passengers were aboard, the train pulled down for a secondspot at 10:28.&nbsp; One family of four got into a discussion about their"expectations" on the platform with conductor <a href="doc.jpeg">"Doc"Livingston</a> that ended with them being told that if they wanted to ridetoday they'd better just get aboard.&nbsp; After the train pulled out theOsceola times were reported to the dispatcher as ":23 and :30".<p>After the train was on its way I overheard discussion from on board,"Doc, you got any room?&nbsp; I've got a family of four and no room atall."&nbsp; After some searching it sounded like at least the adults wereseated somewhere in first class.&nbsp; Unfortunately Amtrak's interpretationof the word "reservation" isn't always the same as the customer's.&nbsp;I found that my trains were well oversold when I traveled on the Zephyrlast summer.<p>10:45 and 90 degrees.&nbsp; I started east along Hwy. 34.&nbsp; Fromconversations between the dispatcher and maintenance of way people, itsounded like there would be one westbound train and that would be the lasttraffic until late in the afternoon today.&nbsp; The westbound was alreadyon its way over from Halpin.&nbsp; I heard them report themselves clearof MP 338 as I reached Lucas, so I turned around and went to the bridgenear Stephens Forest for a picture.<p>I caught them at 11:00.&nbsp; <a href="BNSF4318.jpeg">BNSF 4318</a>,SF 905, and IC 6140 and 6007.&nbsp; I'm not certain about the last twounits.&nbsp; Just as the train came under the bridge there was trafficabove, so I was stuck on the east side until a couple of pickups got by.&nbsp;Incredible luck, to get two vehicles in this remote spot at just the righttime.&nbsp; I uttered a discouraging word or two into my microcassette.&nbsp;The consist was a solid block of empty <a href="BNSFGrain.jpeg">BNSF coveredhoppers</a>.<p>In Chariton I stopped to get a shot of a <a href="railroadpark.jpeg">newsign</a> that's been placed in a little triangle of land west of Hwy. 14and just south of the underpass with the BNSF.&nbsp; It's not exactly Rochelle,Illinois, yet, but it's a start.<p>At 11:45 I heard a northbound UP train get a warrant from Allerton toBeech, with a meet at Beech.&nbsp; Their "at" location was still southof Allerton (MP 373), so I stopped for a Subway sandwich to go and headedfor Beech.&nbsp; I kept track of the train's progress by the reports ofthe detectors at Chariton and at Melcher.&nbsp; At 12:40 I heard the TrentonSub. dispatcher talking to a southbound at Des Moines that I assumed wouldbe the other train involved in the meet.&nbsp; They were changing their"Warrant for Bulletins" from a Wisconsin Central to a Norfolk Southernunit.<p>1:05 and 95 degrees.&nbsp; I had time to finish my sandwich before the<a href="UP7555a.jpeg">northboundappeared</a> and slowed before reaching the siding.&nbsp; This turned outto be a stack train pulled by <a href="UP7555b.jpeg">UP 7555</a> and <a href="UP4179.jpeg">4179</a>.&nbsp;The conductor hopped out and threw the siding switch before the train <a href="UP7555c.jpeg">pulledahead</a> and slid quietly <a href="UP7555d.jpeg">into the siding</a>.&nbsp;They <a href="UP7555e.jpeg">stopped</a> with the rear of the train hangingout on the main at 1:16, probably with the head end just short of the onlygrade crossing in Beech.&nbsp; Just a couple of minutes later, the crewon the ill-fated Norfolk Southern unit called in to say they were on theground at Hartford, "...milepost sixty and a quarter..".<p>7555 was instructed to cut their train and tie it down.&nbsp; I consideredfor a microsecond sticking around to haul the conductor back and forth...Nah, let's go to the wreck!&nbsp; Hartford's not far from Beech and I figuredfrom the milepost that they might be right beside Hwy. 5.&nbsp; It tookonly about 15 minutes to get up there via the "Palmyra Road".&nbsp; Onthe way I heard that the locomotives were not derailed and that there wereno hazardous cars in the derailed portion of the train.<p>I turned east on Hwy. 5 and soon saw the rear of the train, still onthe highway overpass.&nbsp; Two fire trucks were parked just east of theoverpass on either side of a construction road that led to grading justeast of the right of way.&nbsp; Since that entrance looked well-controlled,I passed it up and headed for Hartford's main drag.&nbsp; That street turnedout to have been repaved recently and was still marked with "Road Closed"signs.&nbsp; It was evident that people had been driving around them, soI did, too.<p>A couple of blocks into town, I met a deputy coming onto the new pavingfrom the east.&nbsp; I figured I'd either be assumed to belong there orbe in trouble, so I decided to go for it and rolled down the window toask, "Say, can you point me in the direction of this derailment?"&nbsp;The officer said he was looking for it too, and he followed me south andback west into the construction area next to the rails.&nbsp; There waseasy access to the derailment from the construction area, all you had todo was dodge the off-road dump trucks that were running between cut andfill areas.<p>The derailed train (MDMKC-31) was in three parts.&nbsp; The locos anda set of about 20 cars that did not derail were stopped to the south, withthe head end pretty close to MP 61.&nbsp; The lead unit was <a href="NS9119.jpeg">NS9119</a> and the second, <a href="WC6596.jpeg">WC 6596</a>.&nbsp; A memberof the Hartford fire department was on the front of the NS unit talkingon a cellphone (and perhaps labeling specimens?)<p>The <a href="UP71777.jpeg">last car</a> of this lead twenty-or-so wasderailed and had been <a href="track1.jpeg">cutting ties</a> and <a href="track2.jpeg">strippingthe west rail</a> away for approximately 1/4 mile as the front of the traincame to a stop.&nbsp; The next 30 cars were <a href="hoppers2.jpeg">piledup</a> on <a href="hoppers3.jpeg">and near</a> the right of way.&nbsp;Most of these appeared to be <a href="hoppers1.jpeg">loaded covered hoppers</a>.&nbsp;The Hartford Fire Department had a number of its vehicles parked on theconstruction area near the end of the <a href="hoppers4.jpeg">piled-uphoppers</a> and the start of the third, not derailed, portion of the train.<p>While at the scene of the derailment, I overheard a train crew memberstate that they had come around the curve to find a pretty bad sun kink.&nbsp;As I understand them, sun kinks are usually lateral displacements of therails caused by expansion of the steel rails under high temperatures.&nbsp;It was near 100 degrees today, this portion of the line is continuous weldedrail, and the derailment occurred near a point where a broad curve exitsa bridge and the line straightens into tangent track.&nbsp; A sun kinksounded fairly plausible to me, but apparently that's not correct.<p>News releases by Union Pacific spokesman Mark Davis blame the incidenton the boring of a 3-inch gas pipeline under the right of way and a buildupof mud and water that caused a hump in the tracks.&nbsp; Davis was quotedin several local media describing the rise in the tracks as, "like a skijump".&nbsp; According to these same reports, more than $1 million in damagewas done and the UP will probably file a claim with the pipeline contractor'sinsurer.<p>Before I left the area, I stopped for this picture, which shows a <a href="RI17036.jpeg">RockIsland caboose</a> on static display just west of the derailment location.&nbsp;You can see the rear portion of the MKSDM in the background of the shot.<p>That's It!</body></html>
