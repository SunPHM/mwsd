	Sunday morning my husband woke up with a stuffed nose and a cough. So I headed off to the drugstore and bought Beechams Hot Lemon and the honey-sweet black syrup King To Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa. I was not sure which remedy -- the Western or the Eastern -- he would prefer.</p>
	<p>On the way home, I stopped at the news stand. &quot;Jo San,&quot; I said to the vendor, who responded in kind, in English: &quot;Good morning.&quot;</p>
	<p>She gave me my newspaper and I smiled and said, &quot;M'goi&quot; as she giggled and said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Our daily ritual.</p>
	<p>That about sums up Hong Kong. More than three years after the handover, it is still Chinese with an English twist.</p>
	<p>People ask: Has Hong Kong changed since the switch from British colonial rule to a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; Chinese rule?</p>
	<p>The answer is: Yes. And no.</p>

	You can still take the oh-so-British, red double-decker bus to the more traditional Star Ferry, manned by brawny Chinese men in cute peacock-blue sailor suits. Outside the ferry port, other men wearing black peasant slippers and triangular straw hats stand in front of rickshaws awaiting tourists eager to pose for a photo in front of the oh-so-Asian mode of transportation.</p>
	<p>It is still common to have a long, leisurely brunch of dim sum -- Chinese dumplings with green tea or chrysanthemum tea -- and then a formal afternoon English tea with scones and crustless cucumber sandwiches on silver service.</p>
	<p>Canton pop and the top of the English charts blare in bars where Boddingtons, Tetleys and Guinness beers are on tap. Invariably these pubs are next door to stalls selling yin-yeung, a noxious mixture of milky tea and coffee. The scents waft down the street -- just as they do from the stalls selling dried sea horse or squid.</p>
	<p>That fishy smell is distinctly foreign to the foreigner, but it seems to linger 'round the neon lights in an exotic necklace that would seem even more alien if the big bright signs were not written in English and Chinese.</p>
	<p>Seemingly everywhere, bamboo scaffolding still towers up to 30 stories high, mounted by soft-shoed or barefoot men and women clambering up the precarious structures used to help build and renovate the constantly increasing number of skyscrapers.</p>
	<p>The British may have left, the Asian financial crisis of the late '90s may have stomped down on the region, but expansion continues. The jackhammer is our national mock mocking bird, its rough chirping ever-present.</p>
	<p>Perhaps to visitors, Hong Kong appears very &quot;Chinese&quot; -- but not only has it maintained some of its English influences, it has a surprising variety of international touches that make it quite cosmopolitan. Name the cuisine, we have it, from Cajun to Nepali. Name the international designer and a local will direct you to the flagship shop here.</p>
	<p>Of course, these stores are not as busy as they were before the handover, but that has more to do with the recession that rocked Asia than it does with the change of power. There used to be snaking lines of 30 to 40 customers waiting to get into Gucci and Prada, but these days the lines are gone. Discretionary income is no longer that discretionary.</p>

	<p>Every Hong Kong resident seemed to own a Mercedes or a BMW before the economic crisis, but many people sold their vehicles to save money spent on gas. Now, it seems, only the Rolls-Royces remain. And before the recession, many Hong Kongers seemed to travel to Europe every other weekend; nowadays, it is only a once-a-year European vacation for most middle-class residents.</p>
	<p>Not that Hong Kongers were anywhere near as hard hit as the Thais, Koreans and Indonesians, whose currencies essentially fell through the floor during the crisis. With billions in the bank, Hong Kong was able to ride out the storm. Now, it is predicting 8-10 percent growth, proof that Hong Kong's famous entrepreneurial spirit was not crushed by the handover or the recession.</p>
	<p>The region has changed, and yet it has not.</p>
	<p>Ironically, even during late Colonial rule, the Americans here far outnumbered the Brits. So, although English accents abounded among Chinese, that was not always the case among the Westerners.</p>
	<p>Whatever the accent, Hong Kong remains one of the easiest Asian cities to navigate for an English-language speaker. Yet, the standard of English has declined since the colonizers went home; this is evident in the courtrooms and the classrooms.</p>
	<p>Still, the average person on the street speaks enough English to communicate in that language. Street signs are in English and Chinese. And most of the Westerners did not go home -- particularly the bankers and the stockbrokers.</p>
	<p>Mainland Chinese did rush to settle here, a problem the court system is slowly working out. The fact that their applications are handled in a bureaucratic, maddeningly slow manner is proof that Beijing did not overstep its promise of &quot;one country, two systems.&quot;</p>
	<p>Sure, there have been some hiccups, but while alarmists sound the gong, most folks write it off as growing pains.</p>
	<p>In fact, in early September BBC pulled out of Hong Kong to relocate in Singapore, as Hong Kong news is simply not as &quot;big a story&quot; here as it was in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Foreign journalists fed up that there was not any great tragedy to report during the aftermath of the handover love to harp on the gradual &quot;changes&quot; to Chinese rule.</p>

	But the changes are natural, not earth-shattering. Besides, the differences are most notable for those who live here, not for those who visit.</p>
	<p>For locals, lack of faith in the current ruling power -- rocked by scandals and controversies that might not make international news but are mini Watergates here -- has resulted in continually declining approval ratings for the government, according to recent polls. Non-violent protests are becoming the norm, no longer front page news.</p>
	<p>And the Sept. 10 Legislative Council elections drew only 43.57 percent of the qualified voters. This was well down from the 53.29 percent who voted despite atrocious weather in the 1998 election. Many local folks say the government will do as it pleases, not as the people demand, so why bother to vote?</p>
	<p>But political disapproval, as long as it does not dissolve into riots, seldom affects tourism. In fact, tourism increased by 11.5 percent in 1999.</p>
	<p>About 70 percent of visitors to Hong Kong are Asian. That means that karaoke bars are replacing girlie bars. The Asian tourists outstrip the massive numbers of Navy boys who used to dock here and go on R&R. You still see lads with crew cuts and muscles squashed into tight T-shirts on a Friday night, but the numbers of military here have significantly dwindled, and that has shut down some of the dodgier bars that featured half-naked Filipino and Thai girls dancing on the counters.</p>
	<p>It has changed and yet it hasn't.</p>
	<p>The nightlife is no longer focused on the fictional Cinderella World Of Suzie Wong, the book by Richard Mason that became a 1960s film. Now the hot spots are the bankers' domains. Lan Kwai Fong, which is essentially an upscale Ybor City, is where you will find stockbrokers drinking with dot-com netpreneurs. It is quite the Western ghetto, a pickup scene filled with stereotypes.</p>
	<p>The sweeping brush strokes claim the young Chinese women here are educated and usually quite proper, the Filipinas are sadly classified as women looking for a visa -- and are marked as the easiest pick-ups -- and the Gweipos, or Western &quot;devil women,&quot; are labeled as angry because they are not as beautiful and not as sought-after as their Eastern counterparts.</p>
	<p>The men in Lan Kwai Fong usually come in one stereotype: drunk. Nights out are costly here -- expect to pay $5 for a pint of beer even at happy hour -- but that is just a cost of Hong Kong.</p>
	<p>It is an expensive city of bargains -- quite the oxymoron, but true. Upscale private boutiques discount their clothes by as much as 70 percent every July and February during the bi-annual sales that bring the jet set flocking to Hong Kong to shop. But really, how many tourists do you and I know who come to Hong Kong exclusively to shop at the boutiques?</p>
	<p>For the rest of us mere mortals, the back alleys of Mongkok and even Nathan Road are the real attraction. They sell knock-offs for next to nothing. Just be careful and inspect your purchase. A real leather belt with a fake Armani insignia or a well-knit imitation of a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt costs just $1 to $3 on Nathan Road.</p>
	<p>You could restock your wardrobe in a flash for a fraction of even the mainstream outlet prices back home. The difference nowadays is that the quality is better.</p>
	<p>I guess you could say Hong Kong is the best of both worlds. At least that's our philosophy as residents. My husband has been drinking his hot lemon and sipping his Chinese herbal medicine because, if one works well, both will probably work better.</p>
