Brian Johns sent this news flash from the northern end of the migration trail: &quot;The
			first birds are starting to arrive in Canada! There have been reports from the southern
			portions of Saskatchewan. April 18, two birds were sighted near Last Mountain Lake.
			Two birds were seen near Regina on April 19; a pair was observed near Weyburn on
			April 21; and a single was observed flying with Sandhill Cranes on April 21 near
			Colonsay, Saskatchewan. In south-eastern Saskatchewan there are good water conditions,
			but it is much dryer as the birds move north into central Saskatchewan. I am expecting
			that some of the traditional spring stopover locations will not be used this spring
			due to lack of suitable wetlands for roosting. I will have a habitat report on the
			breeding grounds for the next update.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Pull out your map and pinpoint the locations Brian mentioned. When strong tailwinds
			are combined with thermals, the cranes can travel about 420 miles in a day. This
			information, together with <A HREF="/jnorth/spring2001/species/crane/Update042401.html#Try">daily
			weather maps</A> (see link below) will give you good clues as to when the cranes
			arrive back on territory! <BR>

Tom's most recent census flight was April 17th. He had predicted finding fewer than
			50 birds. Now we know where some of them are! Here's Tom's report:<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;An aerial census of the Aransas NWR and surrounding areas made 17 April, 2001
			estimated the number of whooping cranes currently present at Aransas at 20 adults
			+ 1 young = 21. It is estimated that about 153 cranes have started the migration.
			The current size of the Aransas / Wood Buffalo population is estimated at 174. The
			peak population during the 2000-2001 winter was 180. An estimated six whooping cranes
			died at Aransas this winter.&quot;<BR>

			Tom wrote, &quot;All whooping cranes present on today's flight were thought to be
			subadults. One chick was present by itself on Matagorda and not near any other cranes.
			This chick was part of a single parent family throughout the winter. The census airplane
			made the chick nervous and it flushed a short distance on two of the three approaches
			by the airplane. This type of behavior was not noticed all winter and demonstrates
			how the behavior of a juvenile changes dramatically when it is no longer with its
			parents.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;An ongoing blue crab census indicates that crabs are finally moving back into
			the marshes. Tides became higher at the end of March, and were extremely high April
			10-11. This movement of crabs was basically too late to help the cranes substantially
			before their migration. Marsh salinities are 23-25 ppt, but bay salinities are lower,
			measured at 15 at the refuge boat canal on April 16.&quot;<BR>

			<P>Dear Journey North,<BR>
			I am so glad the whooping cranes have apparently left on schedule for their summer
			home in the Northwest Territories of Canada. An aerial count I did on April 17 found
			only 21 whooping cranes still at Aransas. These all appeared to be non-breeding birds
			that just aren't in as much of a rush to get north as the breeding pairs. I estimated
			that up to 119 whooping cranes have migrated since the previous flight on April 4.
			Migration conditions have been very good throughout that period. This is basically
			&quot;on schedule.&quot; I'll give the cranes another 10 days before I fly again
			on April 27 to see if any are still here on the Texas Coast.<BR>
			<BR>
			One of the birds remaining at Aransas is a juvenile. This bird had been part of a
			single-parent family all winter, one of the adults having died after nesting last
			summer. This juvenile was acting extremely nervous, taking flight for a short distance
			as our airplane approached. Normally the cranes don't pay much attention to the airplane
			since our disturbance as we fly past is such a quick event, but without Mom or Pop
			around, the juvenile's behavior changes dramatically when it is on its own. It has
			to be much more alert to survive. But this bird will be fine and knows the migration
			route. I fully expect it to return to Wood Buffalo National Park this summer, and
			it may make the entire migration by itself.

			<P>Do you suppose the lone juvenile crane is eating his fill of delicious blue crabs?
			The young crane learned the migration route from Canada to Texas last fall. When

			Tom has told us that cranes usually depart when high-pressure systems bring sunshine
			to Texas and winds from the south or east. Thermals and strong southeast winds provide
			ideal migration conditions. The least favorable conditions for crane migration are
			low-pressure systems with north winds because low-pressure systems are associated
			with storms. Watch the weather conditions in Texas this week to see whether conditions
			are good for the last cranes to go. Then follow the weather in Canada to see if you
			can tell whether the cranes get a &quot;good welcome&quot; this year. These daily
			weather maps will help you analyze the weather:

			<P>NOTE: There is no reporting station in NE Alberta at Wood Buffalo where the nesting
			grounds are. The nearest is about 150 miles to the south. At each reporting station

			We asked Brian Johns, wildlife biologist at the cranes' nesting grounds, how he recognizes
			the mated pairs that return each year. Brian said, &quot;The mated pairs are identified
			in two ways. From 1975 to 1988, young were banded with coloured leg bands. These
			bands are still visible on some of the adult birds and they can be identified. In
			addition, the cranes each have a territory that they return to each year. New pairs
			seek out territories adjacent to older established pairs, or sometimes they may move
			into a completely unoccupied marsh. The unbanded pairs are the hardest to keep track
			of, especially if they move around within their territory.&quot; <BR>

By our next report, many whoopers will be back on territory. What's next? Brian Johns
			describes what the whoopers do when they arrive on their traditional nesting grounds:
			<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;The cranes feed along the way north, and usually arrive on the breeding grounds
			with enough fat reserves left after their 4000 km long migration that they can nest
			soon after arrival. When they arrive on the breeding grounds they will carefully
			scout out a location for this year's nest. <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;The pairs each defend a territory on the breeding grounds from other whooping
			cranes. Within their territory they will look for a suitable nest site. It will be
			one that contains nesting material (bulrush, sedge or cattails) and the right depth
			of water (usually about 15-30 cm of water, most often in the 20-25 cm range). <BR>

&quot;The cranes build a new nest each year. Sometimes they may nest in the same
			wetland as a previous year. Other times they may move to a completely new part of
			their territory. The territory sizes vary depending on how close their neighbours
			are. Average territory size is about 5 square km.&quot;

Brian says, &quot;The nests are built in water and are about 1 metre across. Some
			nests are built from the bottom of the pond up, while others are floating nests.
			The top of the nest is usually about 10 cm above the surface of the water. Preferred
			locations are ones that contain suitable nesting material, such as bulrush, sedge
			or cattails in about 15-30 cm of water.&quot;

With whoopers flying between Texas and Canada, Tom Stehn asked you to think about
			this: &quot;What do cranes look for when searching for a place where they'll feel
			safe spending the night?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			There's plenty to think about! Tom says, &quot;Cranes want to spend the night, or
			roost, in shallow water normally between 1 and 1-1/2 feet deep. That way, they will
			hear any predator approaching as it splashes through the water and be able to fly
			away in time. This roost pond, marsh or shallow river has to have an open view and
			can't have vegetation taller than the cranes. Thus, wooded areas are not usable.
			It also should be away from roads or buildings where cranes could be disturbed by
			humans. The roost area either should contain aquatic foods for the cranes, or be
			located nearby to agricultural fields where the cranes can eat waste grains. When
			they find a good roosting area, the cranes stand (sometimes on one leg) throughout
			the night, often sleeping with their head tucked under their wing.&quot; Tom adds,
			&quot;I don't think I would make a very good crane since I'd have trouble sleeping
			while standing up.&quot; (How about YOU?)<BR>
