  Drying pontoons, deep water, tidal, and semi -tidal moorings, serviced hard 
  standing situated in a beautiful site of special scientific interest in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=po12%2B4lj&ll=50.820035,-1.140862&spn=0.099935,0.326157&t=h&hl=en">Portsmouth 
  Harbour. </a><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a name="Moorings"></a><strong>Deep water, and semi-tidal moorings</strong><br>
  We have three mooring areas based around Quay Lane, Bomb Ketch and Peewit Island. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Bomb Ketch offers 6 foot of water at low tide, thus very suitable for fin keeled 
  yachts. LOA up to 28ft.<br>
  <br>
  Quay Lane just off the yard just dry out onto mud on some low spring tides, 
  this is a popular mooring area being convenient for both the yard and the Hardway 
  Public Slipway where access can be had at most states of the tide. LOA up to 
  26ft. <br>
  <br>
  Peewit Island also offers 6 foot of water at low tide, and is a particularly 
  sheltered location further up the Fareham Channel which is of interest to those 
  looking for budget priced moorings. LOA up to 38ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="basic"><br>
  Mud moorings are available at all three locations with an appropriate reduction 
  on the advertised prices. <br>
  </span></p>
<p><span class="basic">If you are interested we would be happy to take you out 
  to view the facilities.<br>
  <strong><a name="Pontoon"><br>
  </a>Tidal Pontoon Berths</strong> <br>
  The sheltered tidal pontoon berths are ideally suited for shallow draft boats. 
  Tidal access time varies according to the draft of the boat. There is access 
  for boats for about eight hours in every twenty four, being two hours either 
  side of high tide. This tidal gate would be smaller for deeper drafts. The pontoons 
  are in the process of being refurbished, there is limited electrical facilities 
  on all pontoons and water at the bridgeheads. All reasonable use of electricity 
  and water is included in the fees - we do ask you to unplug and roll up you 
  cable when you are not on board<br>

  <em><br>
  Pontoon berths when the tide is in and out.</em><br>
  <br>
  There is a pontoon users mooring at the entrance to the boat yard channel for 
  pontoon berth holders to use should they miss the tide. For a modest charge 
  we will collect the boat and bring it in for if you are unable to do it yourselves.<br>
  <br>
  <a name="yard"></a><strong>The Boat yard</strong><br>
  We offer a serviced hard standing and storage area ashore for boats - all fin 
  and long keel boats are ususally stored in cradles and most motor boats are 
  chocked on shoes - use of cradles and shoes is free. <br>
  <br>
  Mast storage is free while your boat is stored in the yard. All reasonable use 
  of electricity and water is free. We have facilities to lift into the yard from 
  the water boats of up to 10 tons, 6 foot draft, and 36 foot in length on an 
  appropriate tide. <br>
  <br>
  The process used is the boat is floated onto a mobile cradle and secured. It 
  is then pulled ashore and the boat lifted off and chocked<br>

  <br>
  The boat yard also offers toilet facilities and a small car park. The car park, 
  toilets and pontoon bridgehead areas are locked at night - you will be issued 
  with a key for these areas for the duration of your stay with us. We have a 
  nightwatchman living in the yard and his dogs have the run of the yard after 
  it is locked of an evening - if you are staying overnight in the yard we would 
  asked to be informed so that we can issue a side gate key and alter the dogs 
  exercise patterns! The yard and pontoon area are lit from dusk till dawn by 
  security lights.<br>

  Customers at work on their boats - afloat and in the yard - or not.</em><br>
  <br>
  We welcome DIY'ers and their own contractors. All contractors have to satisfy 
  us they are adequately insured. Whilst it is not our practice to charge contractors, 
  we do however reserve the right to charge or refuse permission for them to operate 
  in the yard. This would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances.<br>
  <br>
  We offer free mast storage for storage ashore customers and there is no extra 
  charge for cradles. <br>
  It is our policy to put all fin keeled boats into cradles if at all possible. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We have a 25 ton crane with lifting frame and cradles used for fins and knees 
  used for other hulls.<br>
  Winterisation and anti-fouling is undertaken. <br>
  <br>
  There is a portable covered workspace for hire . <br>
  <br>
  We also manufacture boat cradles, which we will store for regular storage customers 
  - please ask for further details.<br>
