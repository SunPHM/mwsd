      <p><img src="images/21.jpg" width="169" height="125" vspace="5"
    hspace="10" align="left">The gears are lubricated with high viscosity and 
        high temperature resisting grease and mounted on splinted shaft instead 
        of keyed shaft. The brake is fitted on non-driving end of the motor to 
        avoid dismantling of motor for brake adjustment. Robustly built, totally 
        enclosed. Squirrel cage induction motor is truly modular. The directly 
        actuating limit switches prevent over-hoisting and over-lowering. The 
        overload clutch is provided inside the gear box to prevent lifting of 
        overload and protect the hoist from mechanical damages specially developed 
        pendent switch for hoisting and lowering. The totally enclosed control 
        panel houses airbreak type contractors for motion, reversing, overload 
        relay, control transfer and limit switches. For storing the loose chain, 
        chain collector is supplied. Each hoist is tested to 25 % overload, it 
        is supplied with a trolley. Aguarantee is provided for the repair and 
        replace. </p>
      <p>INDEF WIRE ROPE ELECTRIC HOIST :It is a medium duty and medium speed 
        hoist. These hoists are modern in design incorporating many new special 
        features. Hoist is of fabricated construction and consists of separate 
        individual units such as brake, motor, drum, gear box, electrical control 
        panel and travelling trolley. All these units are easily accessible for 
        repairs and maintenance. The main frame consists of mild steel plates 
        to which the other units are assembled. The rope drum is made of steel 
        on which wire rope grooves. The rope guide consists of hearing material 
        connected by steal bracket to make it strong. The gear box is modular 
        in construction and can be easily separated from the hoist. The brake 
        is disc type fail-safe of reputed make is provided for trouble-free operation 
        and easy for maintenance and adjustment. Heavy duty steel-forged hooks 
        are supported on thrust bearing for free swiveling safety latch on hook 
        is also provided. The trolleys can be adjusted for various beam sizes 
        for preventing over-hoisting and over-lowering, limit switches are provided, 
        robust, heavy duty push button switch with safe handling voltage is suspended 
        from the hoist. Aguarantee is provided for the repair and maintenance.</p>
      <p>INDEF Chain Pulley Blocks :INDEF short headroom chain pulley blocks occupy 
        less headroom, as they are compact, maximum height of lift can be utilised. 
        Blocks trolleys are built in one unit. These blocks are used for jobs 
        requiring robust, safe and high efficiency. Unique design of threaded 
        load pressure-brake make these blocks completely self-sustaining in all 
        positions. The hooks are steel forged-designed to withstand shock loads 
        and free swiveling. The load wheel is made of heavy duty malleable castings 
        with accurately cast chain pockets for smooth running. All the gears are 
        accurately machine cut from special alloy steel and case-hardened.</p>
      <p>The hand chain wheel made from pressed sheet steel eliminate all possibilities 
        of breakage. Alloy steel chain uniformly electrical welded from alloy 
        steel and heat-treated to give ductility, toughness and wear resistance. 
        The blocks conform to the testing requirement. There is aguarantee for 
        repair and maintenance. The other products of the company are : Travelling 
        Trolleys, Storage and retrieval cranes and H.O.T./E.O.T. Cranes. </p>
