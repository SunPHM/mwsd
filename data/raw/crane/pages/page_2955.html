<P>Charlotte and I were surprised at the large number of the
giant Canada geese we saw at the Horicon Marsh recently during a
trip there with our friends, Tom and Lucy Kile.  Our guess is
that all those we observed were the non-migratory
&quot;giants&quot; rather than the more abundant and somewhat
smaller migratory species that spend brief periods there,
especially in fall, when they number in the hundreds of
thousands.

<P>No matter where we went, on the dike roads taking us well into
the middle of the marsh, or along the boundaries including the
famous Highway 49 route bordering the northern portion of the
refuge, small flocks or pairs of the large, highly vocal geese
were present.

<P>Chances are good that the small groups making the vast marsh
their summer home are second-year, non-breeding birds who know a
good temporary home when they see it.  Strongly paired geese were
evident in virtually all parts of the preserve too.  Our guess
was that the females are already incubating eggs or, for that
matter, may have young goslings to tend to by now.

<P>It was on March 29, 1999 that we saw a giant Canada goose
already incubating her eggs on our friend Pete Husby’s pond
southeast of our place.  My journal indicates that the early
morning temperature during each of the previous four or five days
was below freezing, down to 26 degrees F. on March 26.  Migratory
tundra swans, American widgeons, and ring-necked ducks were still
in the area, and Lapland longspurs were also seen on some of the
plowed fields migrating through the county.

<P>Last year Charlotte saw a family of several giant Canada goose
goslings being led across the Kangaroo Lake causeway on May 3 by
their parents, the earliest date of our seeing them in this
region.  Obviously the frigid cold spring weather didn’t faze
these hardy creatures.

<P>Considering the fact that at least 29 days were required for
the eggs, once laid, to hatch, and that a week or more went by
before the goslings reached the size when Charlotte saw them,
those eggs may have been lain well before the end of March.

<P>The young of geese, as well as chickens, shorebirds, grouse
and ducks, are precotial (pre-COE-shul).  The incubation period
is generally twice as long as, for example, American robins, and
the young are capable of following their parents soon after
hatching.

<P>Those people living in cities who are seeing the goose and the
gander with their clutch of goslings for the first time are
pleasantly surprised at the sight.  At the other end of the scale
are those folks from large cities, such as Milwaukee or Chicago,
who are relatively unmoved.  Large corporate headquarters,
elegantly landscaped to include a spacious pond and acres of
expensive, painfully manicured lawns, are home to hundreds of
breeding giant Canada geese today.  There the geese have worn out
their welcome.

<P>The burning question is: &quot;What is attracting the geese to
so many suburban and resort areas in the U.S.?&quot;  One would
almost think the sagacious birds held a conference and decided
that the best route to take, in order to perpetuate and increase
their numbers to the greatest extreme, would be to breed on
private property that is off limits to hunting and which contains
the attractive artificial ponds for bathing and preening, and
excellent, short-clipped lawns, one of their favorite foods.

<P>Let’s face it, these wily geese, noblest of feathered game,
have been one of the most consistently and widely hunted birds in
history.  Given the choice, wouldn’t you (as a goose or a gander)
opt to breed and live most of your life on private property where
hunting is not allowed?

<P>Perhaps Wisconsin should be looking to Michigan for ideas
regarding the population control of the highly successful giant
Canada goose.  This year marks the fourth season the southeastern
Michigan’s experimental Canada goose egg replacement program has
been underway.  It is sponsored by the Michigan Department of
natural Resources (MDNR), the Humane Society of the United
States, the Detroit Zoo, and the Belle Isle Nature Center.

<P>More than 100 sites participated in the egg replacement
program last year, including city and county parks, private lake
associations, college campuses, golf courses, apartment
complexes, and other commercial sites.  Site representatives and
community volunteers worked together to remove more than 34,800
eggs from 731 nests during mid- to late April of 2000, returning
the eggs to the MDNR for study.  The goal is to gradually reduce
goose-human conflicts in the test area over time.

<P>Even though the giant Canada goose population problem, like
that of humans, is getting out of control, people could do well
to emulate these large well known birds.  They are strong,
possessed of great fidelity, sagacious, wary, and extremely
devoted to their family.  What absolutely noble creatures they
are!
