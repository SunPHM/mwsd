  <p><strong>Russ Finley has spent 20 year photographing areas such as Yellowstone, Grand
  Tetons, Grand Canyon and many other national parks and natural wonders. He graduated from
  Brooks Institute of Photography. I find his photographs inspiring and magical. He also has
  done quite a few videos of national parks and brings to life the wonders and mysteries of
  each place he has visited. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>He was gracious enough, after I requested, to allow me to share his photographs
  with you and place them on my website. I will ask that if you want to see more of his
  photographs&nbsp; please visit his website: <a
  href="http://www.yellowstone.net/russfinley/">Russ Finley Photography of Our national Park</a>.
  </strong></p>
  <p><strong>I tried to make sure all the photographs that I post of Mr. Finley's is on his
  website so you can see them upclose and personal. Remember all his photographs are
  copyrighted. I hope you enjoy his photographs as much as I do.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bighorn sheep or Dall Sheep can be found in the Grand Canyon
of Yellowstone area and the Grand Tetons. Both male and female sheep have the curved horns
and at maturity can be 3 feet wide. Dall Sheep are white and there are desert Bighorns
that are brown with a lighter color on their rump. During rut or mating seasons the males
will battle over the females by charging each other at full speed and butt heads, it is
said the noise from the collision can be heard a mile away. That gives me a headache just
thinking about it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is a pronghorn ( aka antelope) and both sexes also have horns. Males stand
about 3 feet or more at the shoulder and weigh 100-140 pounds. females are smaller and
weigh 100 pounds. They can trot along at 30 miles per hour but can burst into a run and
reach 70 miles per hour. The pronghorn is not related to the an antelope or goat, but is
in fact the last species of its own in the mammal family. This animal has made a come back
unrestricted hunting in the early 1900's. Their population went to only 200,000, but now
there are more than a half a million. You can see pronghorns in the sagebrush areas in
lower elevations.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This gorgeous bird is a Trumpeter Swan and they are the largest waterfowl in
North America. They can get up to 6ft. in length and a wingspan of 8ft. They are an
endangered bird and the biologist are having a hard time trying to figure out why most of
the babies don't make it in Yellowstone.&nbsp; There are only 70 of them in Yellowstone.
Hayden Valley is the best place to find these birds.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This was an odd sight for somebody who just came from Florida. A crane here??
This is a Sandhill Crane and it can be found in the prairies, field and marshes of the
Grand Tetons. This bird is said to be able to fly so high, a person can't see it from the
ground. Cranes in Florida love fields and marshes too.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here is another bird that just didn't seem to fit in. I thought maybe he and
his buddy crane hoped on the plane with us when we left. But, this is a Spotted sandpiper
and he acts and looks just like the ones down here in Florida. They can be found near
lakes and rivers. What gets me is there are also white pelicans in Yellowstone and Tetons.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are also Osprey (which are common in Florida), Bald Eagles, Mallards,
Raven, Mountain Bluebirds, Magpies, Gray Jays, and Clark's Nutcrackers.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp; <font color="#0080FF">A quote from Naturalist Henry Veston about humans and how
    we see animals.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#800080">&quot;We need a wiser and more mystical concept of animals. We
    patronize them for their incompleteness, for the tragic fate of having formed so far below
    ourselves and there is our error and greatly error in a world more older and more complete
    then ourselves. They move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we
    have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not
    brotherlin, they are not underlings, they are other nations caught with ourselves in a
    nest of life and time. Fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">How true are those words. Well, I know I enjoyed seeing the
    wildlife of the parks. Now how about we doing a but of hiking and walking and see some of
    the water beauty of Yellowstone and some of the waterfalls that are in the Yellowstone
    Park area.</font></p>
