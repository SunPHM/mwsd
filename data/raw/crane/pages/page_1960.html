			The oldest seven chicks of HY2002 take their first flight---INSIDE a plane. The gangly
			young cranes arrived via private jet at Wisconsin's Necedah National Wildlife Refuge
			today! A Wisconsin company generously donates their plane for this cause. X-rays
			were taken of each young bird while still in its container. Then an air-conditioned
			van drove the group (called a cohort) to their new pen on a secluded marsh. These
			oldest seven, which arrived today, will now be housed and trained at  a part of the
			Refuge called site 2 (the West site).  </P>

			<P>The youngest ten chicks will stay at Patuxent for two more weeks. After they arrive,
			cranes numbered 9 through 13 will be housed and trained at site one. Cranes 14 through
			17 will be  at Necedah's new site 4. Eventually all of the birds will be merged into
			one flock in late summer. After that, they'll contnue flight training together. The
			cohorts are kept apart because their ages mean they'll learn at different rates,
			and also because they would fight if all were together at once. The crew will give
			the new arrivals a few days to get used to their surroundings before training starts
			again. </P>

			<P>Normally chicks learn how to migrate from their parents, but that isn't possible
			for chicks hatched in captivity. Ultralight airplanes and people in special costumes
			will take over that job for these young cranes.<BR>
			<BR>
			By the way. . .Last year's tiny pioneer flock of five whooping cranes are also back
			in Wisconsin, flying free again after an absence of over 100 years! They all touched
			their home base at Necedah, but have used at least five state wildlife wetland areas
			in an equal number of counties. These yearlings (the chicks from Hatch Year 2001)
			were the first endangered species to be taught a migration route by humans. Soon
			the 17 new HY2002 chicks will follow the air trail blazed in 2001 by these now-yearling
			cranes and the ultralight they followed. <BR>

				<LI>Cranes are territorial birds. The yearling cranes were trained on the same sites
				at Necedah where the new chicks arrived today. What predictions can you think of
				if the yearling cranes hang around the new chicks? Write your predictions and see
				what happens as our reports continue.
