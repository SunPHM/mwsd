<p>The Whooping Crane lives in wetlands, pastures, and cultivated fields
in the
<br>North Eastern part of America, but the population mainly started in
the
<br>Rocky Mountain area.
<br>Due to a loss in their numbers, Whooping Crane eggs were placed in
the nests of the Sand Hill
<br>Cranes who raised them. They now migrate from Idaho to New Mexico
<br>with the Sand Hill Crane.
<br>The Whooping Crane eats crabs, clams, grains, berries, vertebrates
including fish, amphibians, and
<br>reptiles.
<br>They breed in May and have one or two eggs that hatch in about a month's
time.
<br>The Whooping Crane is a lovely, beautifully white bird.</center>
