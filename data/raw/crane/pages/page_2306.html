width=65><BR>Whooping Cranes, the largest North American crane, are an 
endangered species after reaching a low population of less than 20 in the early 
1940s. Rigorous conservation and propagation efforts have now meant that the 
main flock which winters on the Texas south coast and spends the summer in 
northern Canada now totals almost 300 birds. But to increase the Cranes chances 
of survival, a new eastern migrating flock is being established. Starting in 
2001, young cranes have been taken to the Necedah Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin 
and trained to follow an ultra light aircraft to Florida in the fall. Five 
cranes from the first group returned to Necedah in the spring of 2002; 16 from 
the 2002 group returned in the spring of 2003. A further 16 were trained in the 
summer of 2003 and 13 in the summer of 2004. If all goes well, the first group 
will reach maturity in about 2006 and then the flock may begin to be self 
sustaining. For more information on the effort to establish an Eastern migrating 
flock, see the <A href="http://www.operationmigration.org/Field_Journal.html">OPERATION MIGRATION</A> page.

<H3 align=center>FAMILY BACKGROUND</H3>
<P>Born in Pittsburgh, PA,, the youngest of four children, my family left there 
in December of 1945 to live on a small farm with a general store, gas station 
and cabins (in the pre-motel days) near Eight Four, PA (Yes, there actually is a 
community named Eighty Four, the home of the Eighty-Four Lumber Company, about 
20 south of Pittsburgh, PA). In 1950 we moved to Monongahela, PA and then in 
1955 to Toronto, OH where I finished high school. Both of my parents were 
graduates of Pennsylvania State College (now University), but I was the only one 
of their children to go to university. I attended undergraduate school at Ohio 
University in Athens, OH, graduating in 1960. Then on to the University of 
Illinois at Champagne/Urbana, IL for an MA in 1961. In 1966 I earned a PhD from 
the University of Florida (Gainesville). After teaching two years at Texas Tech 
College (now University), I came to SUNY, Fredonia in 1967 in the second year of 
the existence of the Political Science Department. And there I have stayed 
(until January, 2005) with the exception of a number of shorter or longer visits 
to the United Kingdom. My friends call me Bill (even those who are far to young 
to remember the 1940s radio soap opera, "Just Plain Bill)." In January, 2005 I 
retired from Fredonia after 37 1/2 years and moved to North Carolina.<BR><BR>

<H3 align=center>RESEARCH INTERESTS</H3>
<P>I have a strong research interest in British Politics and have published 
several articles on legislative behaviour in the House of Commons and two books 
on British Politics including the standard work on trade union sponsored MPs in 
the House of Commons (THE KEPT MEN?, 1977) and multiple editions of THE 
INTERNATIONAL REGISTER OF RESEARCH ON BRITISH POLITICS (8th edition, 1992). 
Along with several extended periods in the UK for research over the past 35 
years, I taught at Keele University for 7 months in 1979 and at the University 
of Northumbria at Newcastle upon Tyne for a year in 1993-94 and again in 
2002-03.</P>
<P>I am active in the U.S. based British Politics Group (BPG) (having created 
and edited its REGISTER OF RESEARCH [see above] through 8 editions), and serving 
as a member of the BPG Executive Committee for most of its first 20 years of 
existence, including two years as President. The BPG discussion group can be 
reached at BPG-L@LISTSERV.UC.EDU).</P>
<P>My main current research interests are: First, updating the 1976 book on the 
trade union sponsored MPs in the British House of Commons (see above) and the 
end of the system of sponsorship under New Labour in 1995.</P>
<P>And second, how has the American dream played out for real families over the 
last 300 years? This reflects a combination of my interest in genealogy (see 
below) and my interest in American politics and is concerned with how families 
have succeeded (or failed) over time. Is it chance, the environment or genetics 
that makes the difference between achieving significant success or simply living 
a quite ordinary life;</P>
<P>Other research interests include: First, Canadian politics and the LACK of 
integration between provincial and the national political elites (esp. in 
comparison with the US);</P>
<P>Second, what is the impact of multiculturalism and regionalism on political 
stability and integration in Canada, the US, Western Europe and Russia. How much 
diversity is compatable with democracy and political stability?</P>
<P align=center><IMG height=13 src="muller_files/bar3.gif" width=504></P>
<H3 align=center>TEACHING INTERESTS</H3>
<P>I regularly taught an introduction to <A 
href="http://www.fredonia.edu/department/polisci/amerpol.htm">American 
Politics</A> as well as upper level classes on <A 
href="http://www.fredonia.edu/department/polisci/Canada.htm">Canadian 
Politics</A>, <A 
href="http://www.fredonia.edu/department/polisci/westeuro.htm">Western 
Europe</A>, and <A 
href="http://www.fredonia.edu/department/polisci/Russia.htm">Russian 
Politics</A>. From time to time I also taught courses on Congress, the 
Presidency, and on the two combined and on the European Union.</P>
<P>I have been a member of the American Political Science Association (APSA) for 
over 40 years and was deeply involved in the creation of the Undergraduate 
Education Section (originally the Internships and Experiential Education 
Section) of the APSA.</P>
<P align=center><IMG height=13 src="muller_files/bar4.gif" width=504></P>
<H3 align=center>ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE</H3>In the past I have served various 
terms as Associate Chair, Acting Chair and Chair of the Political Science 
department at Fredonia, including three years from 1998 until 2001. Other 
administrative responsibilities included 12 years service as as Director of all 
campus <A href="http://www.fredonia.edu/org/internships/">Internship 
Programs</A> at SUNY, Fredonia; co-authoring the Fredonia INTERNSHIP HANDBOOK 
(with Len Faulk). I served on the Academic Liaison Board of the <A 
href="http://www.twc.edu/">Washington Center</A> until the spring of 2000, and 
was the campus liaison for the Albany Semester Programme and the New York State 
Senate and Assembly Internship programmes.<BR><BR>I also served one year as 
secretary to the Fredonia faculty in the late 1970s and was an active member of 
the SUNY, Faculty Council for much of its first 10-12 years of 
existence.<BR><BR>I have a strong interest in playing around on the computer and 
have created the original Fredonia <A 
href="http://www.fredonia.edu/department/polisci/">Political Science 
Department's website</A> as well as individual pages for most department 
faculty, several course pages (see above) and the original website for 
EUROSIM.<BR><BR>

<H3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</H3></CENTER>I am happily married (for over 28 years) 
and have two daughters. My wife, Barbara, ran a daycare business in our home 
until the summer of 2002 and was very active in Girls Scouts (for over 10 years) 
and is a collector of Girl Scout memorabilia. She took her senior Scout troop to 
London in July, 1997 (without me!). Barbara also was in charge of the Nursery at 
Trinity Episcopal Church. Her other interests include Quilting, tennis and 
collecting.<BR><BR>My wife and I have a joint interest in genealogy and have 
compiled a 60,000 name database (largely using the computer). We will be using 
our time in retirement to verify much of the information secured from the web. 
We are especially interested in the following families (click on the underlined 
names to see some of the queries put out by other amateur 
genealogists):<BR><BR><A href="http://www.genforum.com/brooks/">BROOKS</A>; 
Barb's Great, great Grandfather was Andrew Brooks from the Portville area of 
Cattaraugus Co., NY. That's about all we know about him. This is a family that 
needs a lot more research.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://www.genforum.com/mapes/">MAPES</A>; Also part of Barb's ancestry, 
Phinando Philando Mapes was another of Barb's Great, great grandfarthers. The 
Mapes family came to the eastern end of Long Island in the 1600s and some of 
that family came to Cattaraugus Co., in the 19th century.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://www.genforum.com/mitchell/">MITCHELL</A>: Part of the Scots-Irish 
dispora, the Mitchells settled in Pittsburgh, Allegheny Co., PA in the 19th 
century. My mother was a Mitchell.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://www.genforum.com/morris/">MORRIS</A>: The Morris family came to 
Barbadoes, New York and New Jersey in the mid 1600s from Wales. They were 
socially and politically important in the period up to the Revolution. Gen. 
Lewis Morris who signed the Declaration of Independence was of this line (but 
his half-brother, Staats Long Morris, was a Tory and a general in the British 
army. But Barb's descent comes from Lewis (of Passage Point) Morris who were 
only cousins of the famous family. Some Lewis (of Passage Point) Morrises' 
descendants left New Jersey for Greene Co., PA in the late 18th century which is 
where my wife's father comes from.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/dickson/">DICKSON</A>: The Dicksons were 
part of the Scotch-Irish dispora and cme to Allegheny Co., PA in the first half 
of the 19th cent. Margaret Ann Dickson was one of my Great 
grandmothers.<BR><BR><A href="http://www.genforum.com/muller/">MULLER</A>: My 
family came to the US from Germany in the 1880s and settled in Pittsburgh, PA. 
We still have 2nd or 3rd cousins in Germany.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://www.genforum.com/poling/">POLEN</A> (also POLING or POLAND): The 
European origins of this family and exactly when they came to the New World are 
uncertain at this time. One of Barb's Grandmothers was a Polen.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://www.familyhistory.com/messages/Messages.asp?category=Surname&amp;forum=negley">NEGLEY</A>: 
My maternal grandmother's family were prominent in Pittsburgh from shortly after 
the Revolution. The family came originally from Swizerland in the mid-18th 
century.<BR><BR><A href="http://www.genforum.com/sikes/">SIKES</A>: An English 
Puritan family who came to Massachusetts in the first half of the 17th cent. 
After the Revolution, some members of this family settled in Wyoming Co., NY. My 
wife's mother's family.<BR><BR><A 
href="http://www.genforum.com/turner/">TURNER</A>: The Turners were English 
immigrants in the 1840s, settling in Marshall Co., WV (next to Greene Co., PA). 
One of Barb's Grandmothers was a Turner, descended from William Turner who came 
to Marshall Co., WV in the first half of the 19th century from Bethnal Green in 
East London. We have been in touch with descendants of William Turner's wife, 
Sarah Elizabeth Ferry, and hope to visit them in the UK in the next year or two.

<P align=center><IMG height=13 src="muller_files/bar5.gif" width=504></P>My 
older daughter, Bonnie, graduated from St. Lawrence University in Canton, NY 
with a BS (Summa Cum Laude; Phi Beta Kappa) in Geology in May 1999 and completed 
an MS in Geology from Kent State University in Ohio in the summer of 2001. She 
is currently employed in the Earth Science Department at Buffalo State College 
in the SUNY system. She has been active in Girl Scouts as a counselor at the 
local Chautauqua Area Girl Scout Camp (Camp Timbercrest) in Randolph, NY. She 
was Director of the Council's Day Camp in the summer of 2000. She married Dean 
Swoger in October, 2004.<BR><BR>
<P align=center><IMG height=13 src="muller_files/bar6.gif" width=504></P>My 
younger daughter, Elizabeth, graduated from SUNY, Oneonta, in May of 2003 with a 
major in Human Ecology and Child Development. She is currently living in the 
Raleigh, NC area and working at various jobs. She likes pop. music, talking on 
the telephone and playing tennis. She was capitan of the Oneonta tennis team for 
three years and was No. 1 at 3rd Singles at the 1998 SUNYAC playoffs and No. 1 
at 4th Singles at the 1999 SUNYAC. She earned both her Silver and Gold Award in 
Girl Scouts.<BR><BR>
<P align=center><IMG height=13 src="muller_files/bar2.gif" width=504></P>I am an 
active Christian and was a long time member of Trinity Episcopal<IMG height=36 
src="muller_files/shield.gif" width=31> Church in Fredonia with service as a 
member of its Vestry and, briefly, as a Warden. Politically, I am a liberal 
Democrat with a firm belief that governments can, sometimes, to something to 
help minimize injustice in society. The Blackout of August, 2003 helps to 
demonstrate the foolishness of some efforts to deregulate and/or privitize 
"natural monopolies." Peaceful resolution of conflict is a longterm goal since 
my identification as a CO in the 1960s and work as a draft counselor during the 
Vietnam era. But in the end, individuals are still responsible for their own 
actions and must be held accountable.<BR><BR><BR>

<P align=center>BAGPIPES</P></H2>I am no musician, but like listening to Bagpipe 
music (but that's not a picture of me above). To learn something more about the 
bagpipes, see <A href="http://www.hotpipes.com/">Oliver Seeler's "The Universe

<P align=center><IMG height=13 src="muller_files/bar6.gif" width=504></P>I have

<H2></H2>The Whooping Crane is the largest American crane and most spend their 
summers in Canada and winters on the Texas Gulf Coast, but there is an effort 
being made to develope a non migrating population south of Orlando in Florida 
and an eastern migrating flock which will travel between Wisconsin and Florida 
(see above). You can see something about Whooping Cranes at at the following
