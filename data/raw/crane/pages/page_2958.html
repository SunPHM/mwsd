<P>Too many people normally assume that all owls are more or less
at the top of their food chains.  This may hold true for
especially the largest of the owls we have a chance of seeing in
this region, namely the great-horned and snowy owls, but it
surely does not include our smallest owl, the northern saw whet.

<P>Actually mortality in the wild for these eight-inch-long owls
is fairly high.  Not only must they compete with boreal owls,
European starlings and squirrels for nest cavities, they also are
commonly preyed upon by the larger owls, including the
great-horned and barred, as well as Cooper’s hawks and northern
goshawks.

<P>A phone call in 1972 from one of my fellow teachers at the
time, Hulda Hoefert, informed me that that a small owl had flown
against one of their farmhouse windows and killed itself.  In
describing its size I immediately sensed that it might be a saw
whet owl.  Several minutes later she delivered it to me and I was
correct.  Even though I had seen a few in the wild in past years,
this one turned out to be the first one that I actually handled.

<P>Upon examining the owl I was impressed with its whisper-soft
downy feathers.  Being a northern owl it has heavily-feathered
legs – warm leggings to protect against severe winter cold.  It
is chocolate-brown above with fine white dots and streaks, and is
white below with rather broad brown stripes.

<P>Its talons were needle-sharp, and I marveled at the tacky feel
of the roughened skin on the bottom of its feet.  What a gripping
surface they must provide the owl for holding onto its prey that
may include white-footed mice, shrews and voles along with a
lesser number of small squirrels, moles, bats and house mice.
Nearly all of their food consists of small wild mammals.

<P>A continuous, repeating, amplified recording of this male
owl’s courtship call, that sounds like a whistled
&quot;hoop&quot; or &quot;whook,&quot; emitted at the rate of
about three notes every two seconds, was experimented with by my
bird-banding friend, Tom Erdman, during the 1980’s to lure the
saw whets into his mist nests at night during the fall migration
of some of these owls.  The technique proved to be highly
successful resulting in Tom’s harmlessly capturing, banding and
being able to study anywhere from 600 to 900 saw whets each fall.

<P>The saw-whet’s name actually comes from its &quot;SKEew&quot;
of &quot;SWEE-aw&quot; call that it emits when alarmed.  This
sound resembles a person whetting or sharpening a saw.  Visualize
clamping a cross-cut saw in a vice and then filing one tooth at a
time.  In other words you are &quot;whetting&quot; the saw and,
in the process, producing an extremely raspy sound.  What a
descriptively appropriate name the tiny saw-whet owl has.

<P>Perhaps if its song were more owl-like, such as the
great-horned owl’s &quot;WHO-boe  WHO-boe&quot; or the barred
owl’s &quot;Who cooks for you, who cooks for YOUall,&quot; more
people who watch and listen outdoors at night would get to know
this beautiful creature.

<P>Whether the saw whet is making its monotone short whistled
&quot;whook whook whook&quot; or its saw-sharpening-like song,
&quot;SWEEaw  SWEEaw,&quot; the tone is generally near middle C
or slightly higher.  Few people, upon hearing this nighttime
music, would ever guess it is coming from a tiny owl.

<P>It is difficult to imagine an adult owl of this region
weighing only about three and seven-tenths ounces.  Many of you
can visualize the size of a northern flicker.  In fact the
saw-whet, being about three inches shorter, will frequently nest
in an old flicker cavity.  This owl’s home is usually the dark
mixed-conifer-hardwood forest where there will be a good supply
of old unused nesting cavities from flickers or pileated
woodpeckers.

<P>It is often the clamor of some robins, blue jays or even
chickadees that will lead you to one of these exquisite, almost
melancholy-looking owls perched usually within four or five feet
of the ground, extremely tame and content to sit and watch you
intently.  In the case that a small stream meanders through the
woods, you will stand an even better chance of lucking onto a
saw-whet simply because of the various small mammals and frogs
also attracted to sites like this.

<P>A feature of this owl that greatly impressed me, upon seeing
my first live, hand-held specimen from very close range, were the
beautiful bright yellow irises of its eyes.  I also got the
distinct impression that its eyes were unusually large for the
bird’s relatively small size.  Small facial discs, like shallow
little reflectors, set off its eyes impressively and help the
hunting owl to concentrate faint sounds more precisely to its
ears.

<P>Not only are the eyes capable of amazingly fast focus, they
also have two foveae enabling the owl to focus on a near and far
object simultaneously.  They have about 100 times the light
gathering ability of a human’s eyes.

<P>The saw whet owl surely is a wonderful bird – a very important
member of the natural world – in spite of its small size.
