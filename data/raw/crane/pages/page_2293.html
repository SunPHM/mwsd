morning of October 17, under clear sunny skies, Joe Duff and Deke Clark
began migrating south again in their Cosmos trikes just as they did last
fall. But this year, instead of being accompanied by sandhill cranes, they’ll
be flying with rare whooping cranes—the culmination of a dream that began
years ago.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>As a youngster, Bill Lishman, affectionately
known as "Father Goose" since the release of the motion picture <i>Fly
Away Home</i>, remembers his mother telling him that whooping cranes and
trumpeter swans were becoming nearly extinct because of human interference.
That story made a significant impression on the young lad’s mind.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="cranes3_01.jpg" HSPACE=5 BORDER=1 height=229 width=284 align=LEFT><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Fourteen
years ago, Bill decided he’d like to do something to help reverse the extinction
of one or both of these species of birds. Since then, Bill and his group
of dedicated followers known as Operation Migration have been developing
a protocol to use ultralight-type aircraft to train various species of
birds to fly new migratory routes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Beginning with Canada geese and continuing
last year with sandhill cranes, Bill, Joe, and Deke proved it was possible.
Even more importantly, they were able to enlist the support of a number
of state and national governmental agencies to create the Whooping Crane
Eastern Partnership program. That partnership includes Operation Migration,
the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (USFWS), the United States
Geological Survey (USGS), the International Crane Foundation (ICF), the
Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin, and natural resource and fish
and wildlife agencies in the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida.</font></font>
<p><img SRC="cranes1_01.jpg" HSPACE=5 BORDER=1 height=196 width=311 align=RIGHT><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Like
last year, the goal of the Operation Migration team, in coordination with
the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership, is to lead the cranes from the
Necedah (Wisconsin) National Wildlife Refuge to the Chassahowitzka (Florida)
National Wildlife Refuge, north of Tampa, a distance of about 1,250 miles.
Approximately 30 stops will be made throughout the journey.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Also like last year, Bill will fly
his two-place Rotax 582-powered Cosmos trike along with Joe and Deke, who
pilot single-place 503-powered units, providing chase for any bird that
might drop out of formation and flying scout for the flights as they approach
their landing site for the day. The flight team will also be accompanied
by a "top cover" aircraft, a Cessna 182 piloted by Don and Paula Lounsbury,
and a ground crew led by Richard Van Heuvelen. In addition, USGS team member
Dan Sprague will tow the "away pen" trailer that will house the birds while
they’re not in flight. Dan has been with the whooping crane chicks since
before they hatched and had the initial responsibility of conducting their
early training.</font></font>

<font face="Arial"><font size=-1>The hope of the Whooping Crane Eastern
Partnership is that next spring these whooping cranes will retrace their
learned migratory route, returning to the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge,
just as the sandhill cranes that were led to Florida last fall did this
past spring. If that happens, it would be the start of establishing a second
migrating flock of whooping cranes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>Currently, only 400 whooping cranes
are in existence in the world, including the only migrating flock that
travels between Wood Buffalo Park in northern Alberta, Canada, and Port
Aransas, Texas. To remove the whooping crane from the endangered species
list, three separate migratory flocks of at least 25 birds each must be
established. That could take 20 years, but Bill, Joe, and Deke are planning
to see the project through!</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>You can learn more about the whooping
crane project and follow the migration’s progress by visiting two websites,
<a href="http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/">www.bringbackthecranes.org</a>
or <a href="http://www.operationmigration.org/">www.operationmigration.org</a>.Once
the flight has begun, daily updates will be provided on those sites.</font></font></td>
