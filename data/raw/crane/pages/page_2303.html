<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">So much has happened over the last month that
I’m afraid that this letter will be ‘too wordy’, but bare with me.
The main ‘news’ is that Phyllis Williams (a friend who lives here in
La Ribera) and I went on two Elderhostel programs. Both programs were
in Texas; one to learn about, see and photograph, the endangered
Whooping Cranes, the second program was a combination of bird
watching and astronomy. Let me take you on a little tour to Texas in
December...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">We (Phyllis and I) flew to San Antonio, Texas.
A day was spent visiting San Antonio’s riverwalk, shops and the
Alamo. The next day we drove to the gulf coast at Corpus Christi. For
the week here the temperature would be hot and humid. We found our
motel in the small town of Aransas on Mustang Island. Mustang is a
long barrier island separating Corpus from the gulf, and home of our
program sponsors the University of Texas Marine Science Institute
(UTMSI). At 4:00 PM we met our 31 other Elderhostelers and our
coordinator, Judy Reynolds. During the week Judy was the best there
is. She conducts about 20 elderhostels per year, plus many more trips
for UTMSI. (see my P.S.)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The first morning was a classroom session on
shorebirds, by Ray Fisher. Ray is an old-timer, having spent over
forty years studying the Whooping Cranes. That afternoon we went to a
local sanctuary where I got lots of good bird pictures. I
photographed many close-ups of alligators, nutria (like a big rat)
and many waterfowl. A first for my life list was a Purple Gallinule,
and a Sora Rail. If White Pelicans could be sold for a dime a dozen,
I would have been a rich man, there were so many.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The next morning was the ‘big day’, a boat trip
to see the very rare Whooping Crane. The Whooping Crane is the
largest of the cranes, standing over five feet tall. This bird was
near extinction in the 1930’s and has been saved through the efforts
of many dedicated people. Our 20 mile boat ride took us to the
Aransas Wildlife Area where about 75 of the 450 (total worldwide)
birds winter over. We saw perhaps 15 pair, about half with juveniles.
The boat was able to approach within a hundred yards. With my new
‘super duper camera’ the pictures were clear and up-close. I had
finally seen, and photographed, this very rare bird. Another
check-off on my life list. Had the trip stopped at this point I would
be satisfied. But we kept at it..</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Day three was a bus trip into Corpus Christi
and a visit to the Museum of Science and Technology. We attended a
lecture on how to clean and preserve fossil bones. This museum is one
of the best that I’ve visited, and if you get a chance do yourself a
favor and pay it a visit.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Day four was a study of the waters of the gulf
and bay aboard a UTMSI research vessel. We trawled with plankton nets
and examined the critters through a microscope connected to a TV.
Next was a mud haul. A scoop brought up a sample of bottom and we
‘fished’ through the goo for worms and such. The trip ended with a
bottom trawl, where we found fish, shrimp, squid, rays, crabs and all
manner of other stuff. After disembarking we drove to the UTMSI
campus for a presentation of the ’care and feeding’ of sea turtles.
Many injured and ill turtles are brought here for care. We got up
close and personal with one of the rarest of sea turtles, the Ridley.
I got lots of photos for my next set turtle carvings. Perhaps a sea
turtle will be the subject of the bronze casting that I hope to do
next summer.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Typical of most Elderhostel programs the last
day (Friday) is short. I showed the 200 photos that I had taken, we
swapped email address, hugged each other, and promised to visit each
other someday . By noon we had finished. At the close of our program
we bid a fond farewell to Aransas (travel log lingo) and drove 250
miles north to the ‘Texas hill-country’. The ’hill country’ is
improperly named. Who but a Texas would mistake 1000 foot high mounds
for hills? </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">This program was held at a remote thousand acre
resort (Eagles Nest) on lake Buchanan in the heart of LBJ country.
The lake is an impoundment of the Colorado River and is one of the
largest in Texas. Sunday evening was a social hour and entertainment
by a ‘cowboy poet’ with a very funny routine about coon hunting in
Texas. Introductions and weekly schedule were lead by Raven Star
(sponsors) director Blair Moore. There were 34 attendees. Highlights
of the week were to see Bald Eagles, a meteor shower, visit to a
winery, a boat trip up the Colorado River, mornings for bird watching
and nights for stargazing.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The first morning was ‘Birds of Central Texas’,
followed by a bird walk. There were very few birds out and those we
saw were common species. After lunch was a ‘book reading’, which
prompted me to play ‘hookey’ and get in a siesta. To spend three
hours having someone read ‘The Soul of the Night’ (astronomical
musings) should put anyone to sleep. The leaders provided boxed wine
for happy hour and dinner, so the day was not a total
loss.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The second morning was an interesting astronomy
presentation by John Huntsberger of UT Austin. At least it was
interesting, until he cited ancient writings that the earth stopped
rotating!? for a day (and I guess started back up?!) and that the
planet Venus came close enough to the earth that lightning bolts
passed from planet to planet which is why there is oil in the
ground?! After this I cut class back to my room to read my Scientific
American. The afternoon session was titled “The most important thing
that you never heard of”. This was a wonderful discussion of diatoms
(one celled plants that make glass cases). Truly good science, well
described by the director of the Texas Memorial Museum at UT
Austin.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Each day, including this, the third, started
with a 7:00 bird walk. I skipped them all preferring that extra hour
in bed, while Phyllis braved the elements each morning. The morning
session was again by John Huntsinger, but this time we got straight
astronomy, without the pseudo-science of yesterday. At eleven we
boarded a bus for lunch and shopping in a local town then on to the
winery tour. Fall Creek Winery is very small compared to most of the
Napa Valley operations, but they produce a good product and both
Phyllis and I bought bottles for dinner the next couple of nights.
The sunset this night was one of the most beautiful I’ve ever seen,
but damn it, I didn’t get a picture as we were on the bus. At happy
hour I showed some of the 185 pictures that I had taken up to
now.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Thursday morning it was raining cats and dogs.
After breakfast we met with the staff of Last Chance Raptors who
demonstrated many of the falconer’s skills with his birds. We got up
close to falcons, Harris hawks, Great Horned Owls and a Golden Eagle.
Then we boarded a boat to travel up lake Buchanan and the Colorado
River. The rain continued for a couple of hours but cleared as we
turned back down river. We did see two Bald Eagles, but they were
very high and I could not get a picture. Luckily, I got a good shot
of a Great Blue Heron. In the afternoon we returned to the classroom
for a session on the ‘Bats of Texas’. The instructor talked of
’flying foxes’, bats with 5 foot wingspan. I related that I had eaten
flying fox (a fruit feeding bat) at a Tonga feast, much to the
chagrin of the audience. After dark we went to the Eagle Eye
Observatory. The rain had ceased and the sky had cleared. We got a
chance to look through large aperture telescopes at various stars and
planets. A meteor shower was occurring and we counted about 30 in two
hours.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">The final morning was a session on the ‘Mammal
of Texas’. Interesting stuff on armadillos, ring tail cats, and the
feral deer (Sitka and Roan). By 11:00 we were done and checked out.
It had been a great two weeks, we had met many wonderful people, but
both Phyllis and I were a little homesick for Baja. We both were
ready for some peace and quiet.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">After a night back in San Antonio, we caught
our 7:00AM flight and were home safe and sound in La Ribera in time
for me to watch the Raider’s game on TV... what a life!</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Now that we’re back home, I’m going to spend a
couple of days editing, then making CD copies of the pictures that I
took. Then will mail them out as soon as someone from down here is
heading back to the ‘states’. In all, I took over 400 pictures during
the two weeks and the more I use this camera the more I love
it.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">P.S. I enjoyed the first elderhostel so much
that I got on the net and signed up for “Ornithology, Ecology and
History” of the Texas Gulf Coast. This program is lead by the same
great UTMSI people. It is seven days cruising the Intercoastal
Waterway from Galveston to Mexico aboard a river barge. I’ve booked
for the Jan 21 thru 28 trip and would certainly like to have a
traveling companion, how about it? I’m a nice guy and my friend
Phyllis (bajaphyllis@hotmail.com) can vouch that I don’t snore too
much. The description is on the net at www.elderhostel.org course
