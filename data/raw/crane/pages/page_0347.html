<b>Host Chef 2002 &#150; Bob Hurley</b><br><img src="images/b_hurley.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="165" height="218" border="0" alt="Bob Hurley">
<br>
A mainstay of the Napa Valley Mustard Festival, Bob Hurley accepted the invitation to serve as Host Chef for 2002 at the 2001 Sponsors Dinner, as he served 100 guests at Napa Valley Grille when the 8th annual season came to a close last March.  His infectious enthusiasm, sparkling blue eyes, broad Irish grin, and enormous contribution to the Festival's renowned culinary character have helped make the season of events an               unprecedented success since its debut in 1994. <br>
<br>
Well traveled both personally and professionally, Chef Hurley learned first hand about the food, wine, and culture of Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Asia before arriving in Napa Valley to work with Philippe Jeanty as Chef de Cuisine at Domaine Chandon.  (Jeanty served as Host Chef in 1999.)  <br>
<br>
"I've had the good fortune to experience many ethnic cuisines in depth, and at their source," he emphasizes, a fact which influenced the menu and the many special events he produced at Napa Valley Grille, where he served as Executive Chef for nine years.  "I believe in the simplicity of food. It is a very important part of harmonious living, but it is not the end-all. It should be robust and tasty, and not overly contrived."  <br>
<br>
Currently taking a hiatus to negotiate his own restaurant, Chef Hurley looks forward to his tenure as Host Chef from February 2 through April 6 in 2002.   "The Napa Valley Mustard Festival has given us the opportunity to invite visitors to experience Napa Valley during a beautiful time of year when we aren't rushed because of summer vacations and harvest," he says.  "The mustard season is rejuvenating and invigorating.  It is fresh, vibrant, and a wonderful time to launch each new year with some of the most exquisite scenery and best food and wine events that exist anywhere in the world."<br>
<br>
In addition to serving as the Festival's culinary host, Chef Hurley, one of the few chefs from the region to have appeared numerous times as a Guest Chef at The James Beard House in New York City, will once again represent Grey Poupon during <a href="marketplace.html">The Marketplace</a> on March 16 and 17.<br>
<br>
"When Grey Poupon came on board as a sponsor in 1998, they called to request my assistance with selecting a chef to represent them," explains Pat Summers, the Festival's producer.  "Bob came to mind immediately.  We have worked with him extensively, both through the Festival and as publicist for Napa Valley Grille.  He is competent, creative, and a pleasure to work with.  I envision the most sensational season of events ever with Bob as our spokesperson."<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Host Winemaker 2002 &#150; Eileen Crane</b><br><img src="images/e_crane.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="166" height="223" border="0" alt="Eileen Crane">
<br>
There is no greater proponent of the Carneros Region than Eileen Crane, Managing Director of Domaine Carneros and Napa Valley Mustard Festival Host Winemaker for 2002.  This breezy wine-growing appellation produces some of the best Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes on earth; grapes used heavily in the production of praiseworthy sparkling wines exemplified by those Crane produces at Domaine Carneros.  This spectacular region, characterized by rolling hills sculpted by endless rows of grapevines, with views reaching to San Pablo Bay, bridges the southern tips of Napa County and Sonoma Valley.  <br>
<br>
These same vine covered hills also provide some of the most breathtaking views of mustard blooming in the vineyards each year.  The rolling vineyards of Carneros, boasting bare vines and brilliant yellow mustard against azure skies and powder puff clouds, are a favorite of photographers who enter the <a href="photocontest.html">Napa Valley Mustard Festival Photography Competition</a> each year.  A special Carneros prize is awarded annually, and many of the competing photographers have placed in the competition's professional and amateur categories.  <br>
<br>
Although Domaine Carneros is located on the Napa side of the Carneros, Eileen is a friend to both Napa and Sonoma, having also overseen the design and construction of Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves as Winemaker and Vice President, on the Sonoma side.  And although her winery, a joint venture of Taittinger and the Kobrand Corporation, sits outside the Napa Valley appellation in the Carneros, she is very much involved with the food and wine industries of Napa Valley.<br>
<br>
Eileen is one of the handful of women who are now in the forefront of California's wine industry.  Equally at home in the entwined food and wine industries, she was raised with a keen appreciation for rare wines and haute cuisine, originally preparing for a culinary career.  A master's degree in nutrition coupled with professional training at the Culinary Institute of America underlie her understanding of the interplay between food and wine.  After teaching nutrition at the University of Connecticut for two years, she turned her passion for wine into a profession, enrolling in the U.C. Davis Enology and Viticulture program, and launching her career at         Domaine Carneros.     <br>
<br>
"I am very proud to represent the Napa Valley Mustard Festival as Host Winemaker for 2002," says Crane.  "I applaud the efforts of the Festival to incorporate the Carneros in their promotional efforts. Not long ago,  there was no differentiation between Napa Valley and the Carneros by either the industry or in the minds of          consumers.  I appreciate the Festival's recognition of the appellation, as well as my distinction as a vintner."<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Host Artist 2002 &#150; Charles O'Rear</b><br><img src="images/c_orear.jpg" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" width="162" height="235" border="0" alt="Charles O'Rear">
<br>
Charles O'Rear First Ever Napa Valley Mustard Festival Host Artist 2002<br>
<br>
The wine country nurtures creativity, most obviously that of winemakers and chefs; and although those  who express themselves through visual, performance, and literary arts may not equally share the stage, they command a substantial and growing presence.<br>
<br>
The Napa Valley Mustard Festival has incorporated the arts in many of its forms since its conception. When Founder George Rothwell met with potential producers in 1993 to discuss ideas for a promotion during the "slow season," when wild mustard blooms in the vineyards, he was determined to incorporate a <a href="photocontest.html">photography contest</a> to broadcast images of the season's beauty.  He did not anticipate the overwhelming response of nearly 200 photographers to the inaugural competition, a number that grew to 326 in 2001's    eighth annual competition.<br>
<br>
When Summers-McCann Public Relations, a firm known for promotion of the arts in conjunction with food and wine, was selected to design and implement the Festival, incorporation of the arts was broadened  and has grown and flourished along with the scope of the season of events.  The Festival includes a <a href="artcompetition.html">Fine Art Competition</a> in addition to the <a href="photocontest.html">Photography Competition.</a> <a href="magic.html"> Mustard Magic,</a> the grand opening event at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone, features tableau scenes from French masterpieces; <a href="marketplace.html">The Marketplace</a> showcases fine art and crafts alongside regional food and wine, and all events include music as a primary component.  <br>
<br>
The position of Host Artist, created for 2002, acknowledges the importance of the arts to the Festival.  The Napa Valley Mustard Festival Board of Directors unanimously nominated photographer Charles O'Rear as the first official Napa Valley Mustard Festival Host Artist for 2002.<br>
<br>
Traveling the world to photograph exotic destinations and life-altering events, Charles O'Rear spent much of his career on assignment for National Geographic Magazine, and could have chosen most any place on earth to put down roots.  On a drive through Napa Valley up Highway 29 in 1971, he made his choice when he reached the place where subdivisions disappear and vineyards grow from road's edge to the horizon.  <br>
<br>
"There was a different smell and a different feel to the air," he recalled in an interview with Ron Hender for a story in the San Francisco Chronicle (August 10, 2001). "I knew I was someplace special.  I've spent months at a time in Paris, a year in Indonesia, a year in the South Pacific, a year on the Gulf Coast, six months in Russia.  But every time I came back to Napa Valley and hit that same spot in the road, I got that same feeling.  There's no place in the world like this.  God, there is really something about it."<br>
<br>
Chuck, as many of his friends in Napa Valley know him, has since produced four coffee table books that pay homage to the land and the people of his chosen home base.  The latest, Napa Valley, was released in the summer of 2001.  According to longtime friend Margrit Biever Mondavi, it is his magnum opus.  "It is truly a wonderful book.  He's been a great proponent of the wine industry, and this is his masterpiece," she said in the San Francisco Chronicle story.<br>
<br>
Chuck has contributed his time to judge the <a href="photocontest.html">Napa Valley Mustard Festival Photography Contest</a> at Mumm Cuv&#233;e Napa for the past three years, joining Jim and Mary Alinder of Alinder Gallery in Gualala, Ira Wolk of         I. Wolk Gallery in St. Helena, and Jim O'Shea, Curator of the Ansel Adams Gallery at Mumm Cuv&#233;e Napa.     Margrit Biever Mondavi has also served as a judge for the popular competition.<br>
<br>
"What better way to mark the arrival of spring than our annual Mustard Festival," he says, "with its show of vibrant colors, many events, and best of all, the opportunity to see it in photography.  The Festival is one of the many highlights of living in this gorgeous place."<br>
