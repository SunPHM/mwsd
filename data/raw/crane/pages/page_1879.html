      </B></FONT><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A whooping 
      crane's neck must be very long so the crane can reach down and pull up blue 
      crabs from the bottom of marshes without getting its body feathers soaked.</P> 
      </font>
      <UL>
        <LI><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Every
            bird's and  mammal's neck is a tube filled with other tubes that
            carry important 
          messages and substances from the head to the body and the body to the
             head. The <B>trachea</B> carries the air we breathe from our mouth
             and  nostrils down to our lungs, and sends carbon dioxide back up
             from the 
          lungs to the mouth for exhaling. If you touch the front of your own
              neck, you can feel your trachea through the skin; it has rings
             of cartilage 
          that keep it open so the moist air passing through won't make it collapse
              like a flattened balloon. The trachea is also where most human
             and animal 
          sounds are produced. A whooping crane's trachea is straight along the
              length of the neck, but coils dramatically as it reaches the body
             cavity, 
          inside the sternum. Although we can't see this on the outside, its
             huge  trachea allows the crane to produce especially loud, resonating
             sounds 
          in the way that a tuba can produce louder, more resonant sounds than
              those of a tiny trumpet. A whooping crane's voice can carry over
             5 miles 
          -- thanks to its long, coiled trachea. Hear the <a href="/jnorth/sounds/craneWCEP_uc.wav">unison
          call</a>, the <a href="/jnorth/sounds/craneWCEP_gc.wav">guard
             call</a>, and the soft <a href="/jnorth/sounds/crane_GEN2Brood.mp3">brood
             call</a> to babies.</font>
        <LI><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <B>esophagus</B> 
          is softer and stretchier than the trachea. It carries food from the 
          mouth to the stomach, and can stretch enough for the crane to swallow 
          large blue crabs. </font>
        <LI><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The head and body 
          are supported by the <B>vertebrae</B> -- a set of special bones that 
          each have a hole in the middle, like stacked donuts. The <B>spinal cord</B> 
          runs through these holes, with nerves that carry messages from the brain 
          to the rest of the body. (You can feel some of your own vertebrae by 
          running a finger along the back of your neck.) </font>
        <LI><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the neck 
          feathers are a very thin layer of <B>skin</B> and a thicker layer of 
          <B>muscle</B> that moves the neck around. A crane's neck can reach down 
          to the ground and water to feed, stretch up as high as the crane can 
          reach for bugling and dancing, and turn all around to look about and 
          to preen the body's back and underside. The skin and muscles have to 
          be stretchy, too. A crane's neck needs to be as skinny as possible so 
          that the crane can easily maneuver it all directions for feeding, preening, 
          dancing, calling, and watching out for predators.</font>
