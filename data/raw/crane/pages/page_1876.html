        with siblings, you might feel like a bigger or older sibling has more 
        &quot;power&quot; or &quot;rights&quot; than those who are younger or 
        weaker. That's how it is for whooping cranes, but did you know that most 
        wild whooping cranes don't grow up with brothers or sisters? Wild whooping 
        cranes almost always lay two eggs, but only about 60% hatch. There are 
        so many dangers in the wild that over a quarter of the hatchlings die 
        in their first month, especially during the first two weeks. Only about 
        1.5% of wild whooping crane nests have three eggs (none have more than 
        that!) and all in all, only about 8% of nests produce two chicks that 
        both survive through the fall.<BR>
        <BR>
        When two baby cranes in a nest DO survive, they can't waste time bickering, 
        especially in years when food is scarce. Fortunately, they don't usually 
        have to. The smaller one (the one who hatched out one or two days after 
        the bigger one) can see that its sibling is stronger and bigger, and it 
        keeps out of the way. If the smaller one isn't careful, the bigger one 
        may grab it by the back of the neck, peck at it, or chase it. But the 
        littler chick quickly figures out that it's a good idea to simply avoid 
        its big sister or brother. The bigger chick is usually first to be fed 
        and cared for, but as long as there is enough food to support both babies, 
        they both have a good chance of surviving.</font><BR>

      that were costume-raised in captivity to start forming the new reintroduced 
      Eastern flock of whooping cranes must deal with something that wild whooping 
      cranes never do--a whole group of other baby cranes, all in the same &quot;family.&quot; 
      But since these birds aren't necessarily related at all, they're called 
      a <B>cohort</B>. There's plenty of food for all of them, but they still 
      instinctively need to sort out who's top dog--or rather, top bird.</P> </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      <P><font size="2">Scientists have been raising whooping cranes in captivity 
        for many years now. They have learned that when they raise a cohort, the 
        birds eventually fall into a <B>linear hierarchy</B>. This means that 
        Crane A can &quot;boss around&quot; all the other cranes, Crane B can 
        boss around all the cranes except Crane A, Crane C can boss around all 
        except A and B, and so on. Other birds that have this kind of linear hierarchy 
        include barnyard chickens and chickadees. Sometimes a whole group of baby 
        chickens will gang up on the bird at the bottom of the hierarchy, and 
        even peck it to death. Chickens were the first birds observed developing 
        a linear dominance hierarchy, so we often call this arrangement a <B>pecking 
        order. </B>Chickadees also have a dominance hierarchy, but they work it 
        out without hurting each other. <BR>
        <BR>
        Young cranes sometimes fight to figure out their dominance hierarchy, 
        but as soon as everyone knows exactly where they fit in, they can settle 
        their disputes in a surprisingly peaceful way. This is because whenever 
        they both want the same morsel of food, or to be in one particular spot, 
        the dominant bird always wins.<BR>

        <B><font size="3">Socialization: Helping Cranes to Get Along</font></B><BR>
        A pair of wild crane siblings are usually two days apart in age, and because 
        they are different sizes it's easy for them to figure out which bird is 
        dominant without much fighting. Crane chicks in a captive-bred cohort 
        can be closer in size than sibling wild cranes, and the tiniest one might 
        have a few days or a week of being fed alone before it meets other birds 
        in the cohort. When the cranes finally meet one another, it can take a 
        while before they figure out their dominance hierarchy.</font></P>

      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scientists 
      at Operation Migration want their crane chicks to work out their pecking 
      order without too much actual pecking. They call their process <B>socialization</B>. 
      The work on socializing crane chicks starts at the Patuxent Wildlife Research 
      Center when the cranes are still tiny. The process is off to a good start 
      by the time the young cranes are delivered to what will be their summer 
      home and future breeding grounds at Necedah National Wildlife Refuge. Aviculturist 
      Kelly Maguire worked with the young cranes being trained to follow the ultralight 
      on their first migration. She described the very first chicks for the project 
      in 2001: </font> <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the 
          chicks first arrived at Necedah National Wildlife Refuge, it was difficult 
          for me to see an obvious hierarchy. But within weeks, both cohorts began 
          showing a definite and consistent one. Hierarchy can change, but much 
          of it is reinforced during exercise. When the chicks get out of the 
          pen, before the ultralight takes off, they are jumping and flapping 
          to burn energy--but you will also see some dominate and submissive behaviors. 
          If a lower-ranking chick gets a bit too rowdy, a &quot;higher&quot; 
          chick may grab the back of its neck, or mildly chase the submissive 
          one just to keep it in line. There is very little intense aggression 
          seen at this point, which seems to mean that the main structure of the 
          hierarchy has been established. The next big step will be to socialize 
          the two cohorts. This will happen when both of the groups are flying 
          well with the trike. </font></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><FONT SIZE="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><font size="3">Flying 
        Order With the Ultralight</font></B><BR>
        As the hierarchy works out among the birds in each cohort, and between 
        the two cohorts, the birds will find their &quot;place in line&quot; for 
        following the ultralight. This is a very important process. Once the socialization 
        is complete, the birds won't have to argue or fight about where they fly. 
        When 10 or 12 cranes are flying in formation, two bickering birds could 
        disrupt the whole line. When they all stay in proper formation, they can 
        each take advantage of the slip stream of the ultralight and the birds 
        in front of them, to make their long journey as easy as possible. Getting 
        along helps everyone!</FONT></P>
