			A 3-year study was conducted on a wild-flooded meadow in eastern Oregon to
			determine the response of the introduced grass, meadow foxtail (Alopecurus
			pratensis L.), to fertilizer nitrogen.  Nitrogen was applied as urea in March
			each year at 0, 36, 72, or 108 lb N/acre rates.  Forage was harvested at three
			weekly intervals in July each year.  Nitrogen significantly increased forage
			yield each year although the increases were greatest in the second and third
			years, with up to 1.5 tons/acre of additional forage produced.  Based on the
			dollar cost of the urea used in this study, the highest return in pounds of
			forage per dollar spent on nitrogen occurred in 1997 at the 72 lb N/acre rate
			with a forage yield increase of 120 lb/dollar spent on nitrogen.  Compared to
			non-fertilized plots, nitrogen costs were between $22 and $26/ton of additional
			forage in years two and three.  By contrast in year one, costs ranged from $32
			to $45/ton.  Based on this study, nitrogen fertilization appears to provide
			increased benefits during wet climatic cycles when forage production is high,
			but less benefit in the year immediately after a drought cycle when available
			soil nitrogen may be higher.
