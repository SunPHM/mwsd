			  Cuba Expedition<br />
			  February 4-16, 2002</h2>
			<p>Since 1995, ICF has been supporting 
			  work in Cuba and it's neighboring Isle of Youth to study the Cuban Sandhill Crane, 
			  an endangered subspecies or our beloved Sandhill.<img src="images/20824_30_small.jpg" align="right" alt="" /></p>
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>In the early 1950's, an American dentist 
			  from Michigan by the name of Dr. Lawrence Wilkenshaw was the first to study the 
			  Cuban Sandhill Cranes. His work focused on the Isle of Youth population and he 
			  documented such behaviors as nesting and habitat use. However, following the 1959 
			  Cuban Revolution, little was heard about the birds until the early 1990's when 
			  ICF partnered with a remarkable woman by the name of Xiomara Galvez, whose original 
			  work focused on the endangered and endemic Cuban Parrot. In 1995, Xiomara and 
			  ICF's co-founder, George Archibald met for the first time and spent a considerable 
			  amount of time putting plans together for collaborative studies of la grulla Cubana.</p>
			<p>In that same year, Xiomara took the 
			  first step towards organizing the crane program in Cuba- she organized a national 
			  survey to be distributed to many contacts throughout the country. Reports arrived 
			  that cranes survived in 7 areas of the country. As a result of the survey, ICF 
			  sponsored its first ever expedition to Cuba. George Archibald and Sam Evans, an 
			  ICF Trustee, traveled to Cuba to do aerial surveys. The surveys confirmed the 
			  presence of the birds.</p>
			<p>Since then, ICF, has financially supported 
			  Xiomara and her field crew's activities, particularly on the Isle of Youth, which 
			  hosts the largest population of the Sandhills and is the site of Xiomara's PhD 
			  fieldwork. In 1996, 1997, 98, 99, 01 and 02, ICF has sponsored expeditions to 
			  Cuba for educators, biologists, fire ecologists, GIS specialists, veterinarians 
			  and photographers to exchange information and experiences and, just as importantly, 
			  to celebrate the cranes with the Cuban people.</p>
			<h3>Current Events</h3>
			<p>In February 2002, a team of 5 Americans 
			  traveled to Cuba to be part of an education-focused expedition. The goals of the 
			  2002 expedition were to:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Disseminate information about ICF 
				to American and Cuban educators and students, and to empower them to carry on 
				or continue this mission in their classrooms and communities.</li>
			  <li>Actively participate in Cuban Crane 
				Festival activities while interacting with and supporting Cuban educators, biologists, 
				and professionals.</li>
			  <li>Develop activities, educational 
				programs and resources focusing on crane ecology and conservation. Cranes will 
				be used as a tool to build international relationships and cooperation to teach 
				and empower Cuban and American students to become involved in a common conservation 
				goal.</li>
			  <li>Plan and implement student and teacher 
				workshops to take place in Cuba.</li>
			  <li>Participate in an international 
				art exchange between American school children and Cuban school children, engaging 
				both Cuban and American students in the arts and natural sciences.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Partnership</h3>
			<p><img src="images/20827_28_small.jpg" align="left" alt="" />In 
			  order to accomplish the goals of the project, ICF has partnered with individuals 
			  and organizations that share a common conservation goal. <b>Optics for the Tropics, Inc.</b>
			  was one such organization that so generously donated five pairs of binoculars 
			  to our expedition. Many Cuban biologists, who not only participate in field research 
			  but also community-wide environmental education, do not possess the necessary 
			  equipment to continue to grow in their field of interests or to share the world 
			  of nature with others. For example, Eliser Socarras Torres, a bird guide and educator 
			  near Moron, Ciego de Avila province, lacked a pair of binoculars. Likewise, biologists 
			  studying crane ecology on the Isle of Youth lack the optical equipment that would 
			  make their work more efficient. During our expedition, the five OFT sponsored 
			  binoculars were presented to Eliser and four other bird specialists to assist 
			  in their work and continue ICF's partnership on behalf of the Cuban Sandhill Crane. 
			  The biologists will use the equipment to collect information on the cranes, their 
			  movements, their habitat use, territory delineations, and other important life 
			  cycle data. Likewise, the biologists will utilize the equipment to study and observe 
			  other birds as well. As John Muir pointed out, when we tug on one thing in the 
			  universe, we are reminded that all things are connected. </p>
			<p><img src="images/20824_29_small.jpg" width="150" height="225" align="right" alt="" />The 
			  smiles and gratitude of the biologists receiving these generous gifts more than 
			  tell the story of how this optical equipment will be used, and how well the equipment 
			  performed. On behalf of the International Crane Foundation and all of our Cuban 
			  colleagues, I would like to thank Optics for the Tropics. With your help, we have 
			  touched the lives of our Cuban friends, and have continued to promote friendship 
			  and goodwill between the two countries. After all, one does not need to seek new 
			  travels in life, but rather new eyes&#133; </p>
