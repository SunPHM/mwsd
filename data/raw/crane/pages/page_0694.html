<P>I bought a 40' shipping container and acquired most of the materials for the basic structure of the boat(about $30,000). I then built a 10 x 50 foot lofting table and began to try to work in an open field with no shelter. I spent most of the time trying to get the thing dry enough to work on. Outside at one with nature was not very productive. I built a 20 by 60 foot <A HREF="images/tent.gif">quonset hut</A> from conduit and plastic tarps for shelter. This was the most cost effective way to get out of the weather, and could be replaced in a week for about $200, should mother nature have her way with us. </P>
<P>I then followed the conventional wisdom and lofted the design, that is I drew a full scale plan. When I asked Brett for a table of offsets, he agreed to provide them, but said it would be easier to just cut out the stations and build the mold. After lofting for 6 weeks, I declared it done and began to tear up the table and build the mold. The mold consisted of plywood cut to the contours of the lofting, set up on strongbacks, and covered at 3 to 6 inch intervals with full length timber battens. The fairness of the frames and the stiffness of the battens almost insure a fair shape. Were I to build another, I would skip lofting, but at the time, I needed some more graphic guidance to assure myself that I was headed in the right direction. </P>
<P>After about a month, the mold was complete, and I was ready to start attaching the foam to the mold. This took about another month. I used plastic cable ties on the first hull, but changed to deck screws on the second. The cable ties are much stronger and allow more force to be used to bend the foam, but I decided that cutting it into smaller pieces would give a better overall product. When less force is required to pull the foam into place, screws are much faster to use.</P>
<P>I then removed all the corners from the foam, so that it would look like the shape of the finished hull. I did this mostly with a long board, with some use of a square pad grinder on the rough stuff. This is just a sander with a 1 foot square of 1/4 inch plywood screwed to the disk. An 8 inch 40 grit disk is then stuck to the center of the ply. This prevents gouging of the foam by the edges of the disk. When you get a little off plane with the surface the wood corners vibrate and make noise to tell you to flatten it out. I spent about three weeks on this. </P>
<P>At this point, I was ready to start glassing, but had been promised a work crew if I would wait a week, so I did. We managed to marshal 6 bodies with varying levels of expertise. When we all got together, we had to pause to get more resin decanted, and get some more thick nap rollers, as the little yellow foam ones are woefully inadequate for wetting out large surfaces. So, we sat and drank coffee for about an hour after sealing the foam core with resin. The first full length of cloth went on pretty well, We used cabosil to thicken the resin but ran out on the next piece of glass, and it bled out some around the top. When we began working on the other side, the experienced epoxy expert who was mixing picked up two cans of hardener and gave us some soup, which smelled funny and never set up. When we figured out what had happened, he hit the road and we stripped the glass off and called it a day. It took me a couple of weeks to scrub everything adequately and get enough nerve to continue. </P>
<P>My wife and I glassed the rest of the bottom over the next few weekends, as it is about impossible to do large surfaces alone. The tightly woven triax which gives such a thin, strong skin is extremely sensitive to distortion and must be handled very carefully. Folding it deliberately or accidentally results in kinks in the fibers, which make the layup weaker and are difficult to wet out without voids. </P>
<P>The week after we had completed the glass, a <A HREF="images/storm.gif">tornado</A> lifted the shelter up and threw it across the field to the North. The ensuing downpour washed out the base of the forward support, and the hull bent about a foot off center. Fortunately the hull is quite resilient, and I was able to bend it right back into shape with no detectable damage. </P>
<P>I gathered up the tarps and tubing, replaced the extremely mangled parts, and rebuilt the shelter. </P>
<P>I then proceeded to put gallons and gallons of filler onto the hull and sand most of it back off. This went on for about a month before I finally got the technique down with the help of a local boat repair shop owner. Most of this was done using auto bodyfile paper on a stiff 34 inch board.</P>
<P>I declared the fairing complete and began to try to figure out how to turn it over. The mold was set on posts in concrete, so the boat would have to be lifted about 8 feet higher than it was, moved aside, and rolled over. </P>
<P>I spent a few weeks trying to come up with a large forklift or <A HREF="images/crane.gif">crane</A>, but it was prohibitively expensive to rent one with an operator. One of the neighbors had one, which would have been big enough but was out doing some work. After waiting about two weeks for it to be available, it occurred to me that one of the fellow liveaboards in the marina worked on heavy equipment and had a truck with a crane mounted to the back corner. We discussed the possibility, and he volunteered to come out later that day. </P>
<P>I then built five cradles for the hull and tabbed them to the side of the hull to maintain the shape. I then build a strongback of timbers down the length, so that it could have a single lifting point. We picked it up and moved it without a hitch, but decided that we could leave it inverted for a week to make cleanup of the inside surfaces easier. The next weekend we used the crane for support and rolled it over and leveled it. I spent a couple of weeks smoothing the inside surface and getting it ready to glass. </P>
<P>The glassing took several weeks due to the small amount of room inside and my inability to handle and wet out large pieces of glass alone in such a cramped space. As I got further along, I began to master rolling the glass on a tube and pinning it in place with stickpins until wet. This allowed me to cover larger surfaces at one time.</P>
<P>We had barely completed the inner skin when another squall line with 60 knot winds tossed the whole thing to the West. I had made an effort to anchor it to the ground, but the screws in the frame sheared and the tarps tore, and most of it still went flying. It was apparent that this type of shelter wasn't adequate at this size and to assemble the boat, I would need at least 50% more space. I just covered it with tarps while pondering the next move. Five days later a hurricane passed just north of Tampa and shredded the tarps. This was getting to be a real distraction. Time to back off and get an attitude check. I covered the hull with tarps and licked my wounds. The shelter had been tossed West, North, and East, and I wasn't ready for it to go South. </P>
<P>My landlord had a yearning to have a <A HREF="images/barn.jpg">barn</A>, and I had a short term need for shelter, so we agreed to share the effort and cost, so I could build in it, and he would have the barn after we launched. Due to financial constraints, we set out to buy materials as cheaply as possible, I got a guy to cut up some telephone poles for the timbers, bought some surplus trusses, and found some factory second tin for 40% off. This took about two months to put together. The actual construction took about six weeks of me working full time and the landlord working when he wasn't otherwise occupied. Unfortunately people with full time jobs tend to think of us free-lancers as having unlimited free time and labor. As the main party being in desperate need of shelter, most of the work fell on me. The total cost was about $2400 with each of us paying half. We had only enough materials for the structure and the roof, but no siding. I wrapped it in plastic and am getting along fine as it is. Perhaps if cheap siding comes along, we will finish it, but it works okay now. I now had a pretty secure dry 30 by 56 by 16 foot shelter. </P>
<P>I spent about two weeks putting the foam on the mold for the second hull. It is much easier when you know what the finished hull is supposed to look like. I faired the second hull foam with a grinder and square pad, and accomplished a better finish than the first in about 16 hours. Once you get an eye for fairness, this moves right along. Were I to do it again, I would refill the seams after the grinding, so that the glass would lay a little smoother while wetting out. The foam is more resilient than the bog and springs back to leave depressions along the seams. They are small, but disrupt the lay of the glass on the complex curved surfaces.</P>
<P>The glassing was started one Sunday, the biggest piece went on well, but the upper section suffered from a rapid drop in temperature due to a stalled cold front that decided to come on down late in the day. This bled out a bit and needed about 5 percent rework. It was cold for about 5 days, effectively shutting us down. The rest of the glasswork took about 4 days by myself. The voids(there are always some) had to be filled and fairing compound applied to the hull surface. I am done with <A HREF="images/fair1.jpg">fairing</A> or smoothing the surface. This consisted of mixing a fairing putty of epoxy with microballoons bellow the waterline or q-cell above the waterline and smearing it in a uniform coating over the hull. Then use a longboard file to sand all the bumps until it is all smooth and fair. I bought a DA sander to take off thew big bumps, which sped things up some. With my skill level this is about 100 iterations of putting it on and taking most back off. This goes on until your either have it smooth enough to paint, or get thoroughly sick of doing it and postpone the smooth paintable finish till later. </P>
<P>I built cradles for the second hull and tabbed them to the hull as with the first one. I borrowed a few vangs(block and tackle sets) at the marina and attached one to each of the five cradle frames. It was just a matter of uniformly raising the hull up to the rafters, lots of walking back and forth pulling on the lines. When it was all the way up, I dismantled the mold to make way for the upright hull. To invert the hull, I just attached lines to the outer edge of the frames on one side and lowered the middle down on the other side. When the frames were on the ground, I lifted the other side up with blocks to get it upright. The whole process was very smooth and controlled with little excitement. </P>
<P>I filled and faired the inner surface of the foam and glassed the interior. I had to stop building the boat and build a large(12' by 24') table upon which I could layup all the bulkheads. I got an inspiration from a burned up mobile home and managed to find a frame from one, which had been demolished. This gave me a 12 x 24 steel framework upon which to attach joists and plywood to get a large flat stable surface. The hulls had to be moved to actual beam distance to make room. </P>
<P>I laid up the forward pair of bulkheads for each hull and also the bridle shelf which connects them. As usual, it is turning into more than it seems at first look, but is moving along. The bulkheads are really a pleasure so far, as you just cut a template to fit( I'm using the luan ply from my lofting), then cut the foam, fit it, and lay them out on the table to glass them. Horizontal glassing is so much easier, the resin doesn't bleed out like on the vertical surfaces, and you need only pour it on and spread it out. The temperature is much less critical as well, as I still have plenty of time to glass a whole side of one before the resin goes off, and I don't have to care about it thinning out as it gets hot.</P>
<P>I have finished installing the forward bulkheads and bridle shelf. The bows on these hulls are quite skinny and not very accessible. Fortunately I only have to do this part once for each hull. Since most of this area is watertight dead space, I am spared from having to make it too pretty. I have a vision of myself hanging from my heels stuck upside down in the deadspace in front of the number 1 bulkhead.</P>
<P>Installing the bridle shelf involved numerous iterations of crawling into a too tight space with hot bog in hand and trying to apply it in a smooth uniform fillet before it goes off. Then you wait for it to harden, crawl back in with sandpaper and try to smooth it to a surface, which will glass well. I am almost 2 meters tall and it is a real toss up over having long arms and not being able to fit in small spaces. Where are the shoemaker’s elves when I really need them? </P>
<P>For vertical or upside down glass work with small pieces of glass, I chose using pre-preg glass. Sounds hi-tech, but I just wet the glass out on a piece of plastic film on the table and then stick it in place. The first try at glassing inside this cave ended with the glass falling out of the upper fillet and landing on my head. More iterations with smaller pieces of glass were called for along with numerous hose showers in the yard to scrub off all the epoxy which was more attracted to me than the boat.</P>
<P>Ever wonder how you glass the inside of a watertight compartment? Does the Cask of Amontillado come to mind? You must make an escape port and fill it in after the rest is done. Again, a lot more work than initially envisioned, but not impossible. </P>
<P>I installed the second bulkhead in each hull. This involved some standing on my head through a temporary hole in the bridle shelf to get to the backside of the bulkhead. I will build the forward deck for each hull and install it just to have it look finished, and be a little more weatherproof.</P>
<P>The next major action was the canting of the hulls, squaring them up and making the templates for the crossbeam bulkheads. Being a bridgedeck catamaran, the forward and aft crossbeams are also the bulkheads for the saloon and the forward and aft cabins. These will be rather large, but simple to work on, or so I hope.</P>
<P>Surprise, surprise, the next major action was moving to another site and getting set up there. Landlord breath decided that he was tired of looking at the project and had other plans for the pole barn. He gave me 4 months notice, but that would only mean more parts to move and the possibility of an ugly confrontation. Having lived in the area for two years made it relatively easy to find another site; in fact I found four by the time I was ready to move.</P>
<P>I got a good site with a lease and a rational landlord. I checked his references for loony toon genes and he came up clean. I found a guy who builds steel buildings and arranged for him to build a frame for a building, so that I could strip the tin from the pole barn and use it on the new one. Moving the hulls went rather well, largely due to meeting some good people in the business. I hired a flat bed trailer and truck for $35 per hour and a guy with a crane for $30 per. I had the crane guy stay an extra hour and put up the frame for the building.</P>
<P>A couple of days later I had the same two guys move my container and the work platform and my little airstream trailer. The old landlord actually called the sheriff to report that I had stolen his barn roof. This was good for a laugh when I showed the detective the receipts from my having purchased it originally. What a moron! The new landlord even put a paragraph in the lease requesting first option to buy my new building when I am done. The total construction time on the new building was about 4 days as opposed to over a month for the old pole barn. The cost was slightly higher, but it is completely portable and should be worth more than it cost when I am done.</P>
<P>I have leveled and canted the hulls and am now building the forward deck for the hulls. Canting the hulls is an adventure in itself, as the hulls have moved in the cradles, and consequently taken my horizontal reference with them. I have measured from the keelson to establish a vertical plane to use for canting to the desired angle. I am also building templates for the remaining bulkheads.</P>
<P>El Nino has been wreaking havoc with the weather here and some of the plywood on my worktable is delaminating. What a bummer, but pretty much impossible to keep it dry in an open-ended building with severe storms every few days. I get about one productive construction day every three or four calendar days. This should get better soon, as the weather after the storms will warm up to acceptable laminating temperatures soon after they pass. I have added plastic ends to the building just to keep some of the rain out.</P>
<P>My last laminating adventure disproved some assumptions about flat panel laminating technique. I wet out the foam for the decks with resin and set it in the sun to get a jump on hardening before applying the glass. The higher temperature apparently caused the resin to shrink and curl the bulkhead causing wrinkles in the glass with attendant voids. Two steps forward and one step back. I had to grind off the offending glass and repeat the process with more uniform temperature control. </P>
<P>The beauty of building with these materials is that there is little you can do wrong which cannot be ground off and done over with little or no ill effects to the outcome. The main ill effect is a slight weight gain from patching overlays, and psychological impact from doing things over again. After a day of grinding and some re-laminating and a couple more El Nino cycles, the decks were ready to be attached. I set them in place and sanded the edges to get a best fit. The decks were then attached to the hulls by bedding them with epoxy bog and filling and sanding the edges. Glassing over the inside and outside joints is next to finish the attachment when time permits.</P>
<P>I needed to get the curved section which connect the hulls to the bridgedeck sole, so that the bulkheads could be accurately built to fit. This was a good exercise in basic <A HREF="build.htm">composite building</A>. Start with a mold(in this case a section of PVC pipe). Mask and wax the mold. Lay up a layer of glass on the mold. Cut the foam into appropriate size strips to form the desired curve section. Bed the strips on the glass with epoxy bog. Fill the gaps between the strips. When the epoxy has hardened, pop it off the mold, sand it smooth and attach it to the hulls. Repeat as needed. </P>
<P>I have built <A HREF="images/bhtmplts.jpg">templates</A> for the bulkheads, and will be working on the bulkheads for a while. I have cut one pair out so far, and will be using the flat table as the mold for all of them. This will be a simple process, but the design calls for a lot of heavily built up unidirectional glass along the edges and doorways. These will take a long time to lay up, as they must be done in stages to avoid over heating the epoxy as it hardens. I am about done with the aft or number 7 bulkhead unidirectional layup. With the current working temperature, I can lay up about 20 layers of 13 oz unidirectional without overheating them. So far I just get one layer per day, as it takes about 5 hours to cut them up, and laminate them in place. This works out to about 5 or six days per bulkhead. I have built containment forms down the sides of the bulkhead so that movement and runoff are not significant impacts. I will finish this one this week and continue with the forward bulkhead.</P>
<P>Building the large bulkheads is an involved, but finite project. I started by cutting out the templates for the hull shape, and making a section to cross over between the hulls, all from foam. The piece of foam which ran hull to hull was fitted and trimmed to the desired shape leaving space for a fairly heavy layup of unidirectional glass along the top and bottom edges. I made one edge into a gutter by cutting strips of plywood and taping them with clear packing tape to prevent epoxy from bonding to them. I then screwed them on either side of the edge of the foam to form a trough. I rolled out the full length of unidirectional glass and cut it into strips the thickness of the bulkhead. The glass was then laid up in the trough 18-20 layers thick at one time. It was cool weather, and this worked out fine, though of late it is much warmer, and I doubt I will get away with more than 10 or 12 layers at one time. This took a whole day for each layup with overnight curing. When one edge was complete, I turned the bulkhead over and repeated the process on the other edge.</P>
<P>The finished wide section was then fit to the hulls and the foam needed to complete the shape was cut and attached. When this structure fit the hulls well, the layup of the whole bulkhead took place. This happened to involve three layers of glass the width of the boat. A pretty busy day doing this all at once, but this all in one layup gives good results with much less work overall than doing one layer at a time. The piece was turned over, glassed on the other side, and allowed to cure for a couple of days. I trimmed the edges and fit it in place, and got the sensation that it is all one boat for the first time.</P>
<P>I have built the forward bulkhead in much the same manner as described above. This one is the most heavily reinforced construct on the whole boat. It has the top and bottom edges widened by sistering a tapered strip of foam to give an edge 50mm wide for the unis. There is also a doorway in each hull which is lined with 25 mm thickness of unis. It took a week to lay up the unis top and bottom as well as three days to do the doorways. My son Steven and I glassed one side on 5/11. It turned out to be a really hot day and made for a real challenge, as when the temperature gets above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, the resin is getting hot by the time it is mixed. This laminate was four layers thick and took about 6 hours. When the resin is already hot, you must pour it and get the glass wetted out in about 20 minutes before it begins to gel. The heat from the first layers just adds to the urgency to get it all out and in place in time. It was obvious that this was risky with only two pairs of hands, but once you're started, the thought of grinding 20 kg. of glass back off is enough incentive to keep you going.</P>
<P>We opted to do the other side on the weekend when Joan and another friend would be available. With 4 pairs of hands and the additional organization, which comes from having just done the same task a couple of days earlier, the other side took just two and a half hours. This also allows for finishing before the hot part of the day, making it generally easier for all concerned. This is the last heavy layup of large pieces, so a big sigh of relief was in order. I'll trim the excess glass and resin off the edges and then start to figure out how to move it into place, as it now weighs over 100 kilos and is quite ungainly due to its size.</P>
<P>As it turns out, the daggerboard cases must be in place prior to installing the next bulkhead, so I guess I will work on that for a while. The reinforcement for the cases goes under the bulkhead, so it goes in first. The boards promise to be interesting, as it involves some new techniques. I will build them from foam with glass layers reinforcing it every few inches. These should be very light and strong, but as usual, will probably be rather labor intensive. So far I have built a sheet of foam 11 feet long, glassed it on one side, and vacuum bagged another equal sized piece of foam onto it. This gives me a 60mm layer of foam to cut into strips and build up the boards. </P>
<P>I have faired the surfaces of the two full width bulkheads by laying them flat and pouring and spreading the fairing bog. By mixing it to a thick liquid consistency, it is somewhat self-leveling. This allows gravity to do most of the evening of the surface and minimizes the required sanding. On non-horizontal surfaces the fairing material must be thick enough to not sag, and thus too thick to flow.</P>
<P>I have cut the foam for the <A HREF="boards.htm">daggerboards</A> into strips and epoxied them together in the general daggerboard shape. I am now fairing them with a sander to get to the desired shape. This is going pretty quickly, so far, but like all detailed work it is 95% done in the first 10% of the time required to finish it. </P>
<P>I have layed up the unis for the doorways of the number 6 bulkhead and will build it in parallel with the daggerboards. This one has a single skin layup, so I should be able to build it without a large work crew. I have to decide when to attach the hulls to the full width bulkheads. If I attach it, I can proceed with the forward and aft decks. I will also not have to worry about keeping the hulls aligned and level any more. When the bridgedeck is in place, I will lose my access to the work table, which is between the hulls. I hope to put wheels on the table and be able to move it to an open spot when desired.</P>
<P>I have finished the construction of the remaining full width bulkheads. The process is similar for each one, though no two are the same. When I completed the last one, I recruited a couple of friends to help move them about. With three adults and my teenage son, it is a simple matter to move these pieces about. We set them all in place in about 20 minutes, something which would have taken me about one day with much sweat and cursing had I not had help. I will now use them as a guide in building the bridgedeck floor.</P>
<P>I have completed the bridgedeck floor, which is another interesting challenge. By its very design it is a fairly simple large panel glassed with a single layer on each side. The challenge comes from the size of the beast. It is roughly 14 by 22 feet and should weigh roughly 400 lbs. when glassed. It should weigh about three hundred lbs. when glassed on one side. Foam sandwich is extremely stiff when completed, but quite fragile while under construction. For this reason, I built and faired the flat sections individually and then joined them at assembly time. I built the largest flat panel by attaching 5 sheets of foam together for the center piece. This will only weigh about 250 lbs. when glassed, still not my idea of simple to handle, but by virtue of its being only 8 feet wide, I should at least be able to turn it over without destroying it. The next step was to build the outer sections with the steps. This was simple, but large pieces. The bulkheads were set in place so that I could use them as a form for the bridgedeck. The sole is shaped with a flat center section and a step down to a flat outer section. This yields a higher bridgedeck clearance in the center, but easy access to the hulls. It is also a stiffer structure than a flat one would be, thus requiring less re-inforcement. The shape is further complicated by the forward third slanting upward at about an eight degree angle. I built the horizontal components and connected them and installed them between the hulls. Picture moving all this stuff about single handed, kind of interesting. When I got the aft section of the floor in place, I set the two aft bulkheads in place and filleted and glassed them in. The structure is quite stiff at this point.</P>
<P>Next, I began building the forward section by cutting and fitting foam and glassing it on the bottom side to make a single piece. The next step was to attach it to the hulls and other section of the bridgedeck. I then glassed the top of the foam using overlays to the existing structures to secure it. The next step was to set the forward cross bulkhead in place and fillet and glass it. I have more fillet and glass work to do, but expect to have some help for a few weeks to speed things along.</P>
<P>I have set the fourth full width bulkhead and am planning on finishing the fillets and glassing in the next few days. I have also glassed in the re-inforcements for the cap shroud chainplates and about finished fairing the dagger boards. They still need the outer glass before I use them as a mold to make their cases. Lots of things to do at one time. </P>
<P>I have built and installed the last bulkheads. These are between the cross bulkheads which make up the main saloon. The process of connecting the forward cross bulkheads with the web of panels which support the mast is nearly done. I have built 9 panels and shaped the timbers to support the mast, but haven't figured out how to connect it all just yet. I am awaiting some help from the design office at this time. I have just built the cockpit seating benches and will install them as soon as I get them faired. I am building lots of pieces and using lots of foam, glass and epoxy. Using up all the materials is a good measure of progress. </P>
<P>I built the cockpit seats and tabbed them in and made the fillets for the glass. I like to do the glass when I do the fillets, as this avoids needing to sand the fillets smooth, but it was hot weather and the fillets were getting too hard to squish the glass into them. I also built a mold for the curved section across the forward edge of the bridgedeck and have begun building it in four pieces. The size of the whole thing would stop me from having workspace for anything else if I build it all in one piece. I am using a female batten mold and have made two sections so far. </P>
<P>I have built the remaining pieces of the forward edge of the bridgedeck and have connected and laminated the bottom half section. It took about one day to fit this to the hulls and bridgedeck sole, as it is huge and rather unwieldy for one person to manipulate. I built the bulkheads, which separate it into compartments and installed them. Yesterday I installed this section on the boat. I finished fairing the daggerboards, and was about to glass them when I realized that I had not yet cut the grooves for the uphaul lines. It's always something. Making some adjustments to the transom shapes before finishing them in and installing steps etc.</P>
<P>Built the mastbase structure, which consisted of 13 distinct pieces. Lots of detail work, but massively sturdy when assembled. Installed the bed platforms in both forward cabins. Built the cockpit seat benches and installed them. Built the winchdeck which makes up the aft edge of the cockpit. Finished glassing it yesterday and hope to install it tomorrow. Built the cockpit seatbacks, which are also a wall for the aft cabins. They can go in as soon as the winch deck is in place. Built the tank tops for the fuel tanks and need to finish them a bit and install. Built the floor boards for most of the hulls. .</P>
<P>Installed the winch deck and cockpit seat backs. Tried to glass a daggerboard yesterday, but big winds came up before a cold front and it was just too windy to glass. The wind can be avoided, but the amount of dirt in the air is just to much. Will try to set up an area inside the container for a more weatherproof workspace in inclement weather.</P>
<P><A NAME="lastupdt"></A>The weather has been too cold to do much lately, but we got a reprieve today. Today we stripped the starboard half of the top of the curved leading edge of the bridgedeck. I had attempted to torture a panel into shape for this, but it became apparent that the cutouts for the hatches and access panels will return to their flat shape when cut out and add a lot of work to this method. Stripping and glassing will be a lot easier in the long run. I have glassed one of the dagger boards and faired one side. I have a few bubbles in the glass, which need patches before fairing the other side. I am ready to glass the other board, but the weather has not been suitable. It would go better if I could vacuum bag these, but it is too large and complicated to handle without a few more sets of hands. I have been re-shaping the transoms of the hulls to get better symmetry, after which I will glass them. They will get the same unidirecional rovings as the bulkheads before finishing.</P>
<H4>Last update –Jun 25, 2000</H4>
<P>Finished glassing and fairing the dagger boards. Making the Cases will be next in this area. I have built much of the interior saloon/galley area, and have installed some of the floorboards in the hulls. I also built the remaining hull level deck and installed it. A little more glasswork and I will complete the hull deck joint by glassing it inside and outside. Much to do, but the summer weather pattern has arrived, wet in the morning, hot and steamy in the daytime, and thunderstorms most afternoons to repeat endlessly. Limits the quality working time to around 4 to 6 hours per day. I am continuing with the interior and trying to finish the fuel tanks and the rest of the floor in the hulls. Need to build the dagger board cases and install them before building the forward cabin floorboards.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>What key lessons have I learned?</P>
</B><P>Work in a secure protected environment. The distractions of weather events can be far more costly than the cost of a building. Had I built the barn up front, it would have saved a great deal of time and mental anguish. Oh yeah, make sure that your site agreement is for at least twice as long as you think you will need and be sure to get it all in writing. Be certain that everything you have is portable and not too hard to move if you have to. Even a well written lease is only as good as the people who sign it. Any contract can be broken. I spoke with another builder who had to move 4 times before he finished his 45' mono. </P>
<P>Mix all your own resin. There is too much damage if this goes wrong. If there is a problem, it is easier to accept the blame yourself than blame your problems on someone else. No one will be more careful or concerned than you. </P>
<P>I would buy a mechanical pump system for dispensing the resin and hardener, should I do another project. I couldn't find one that I liked for the money when I started, but think this would have sped things up and taken some of the guesswork out of it. Over the course of building a boat, I hate to think how many times I lost count of squirts of stuff and had to toss a cup full away and start over.</P>
<P>Don't fold directional cloth. This is particularly true against the grain of the major fiber orientation. My first lesson in this was an experienced boat repair guy who folded the triax, and had only worked with cloth and roving before. He was surprised that it was a problem, but I was stuck with straightening it out. </P>
<P>Watch the weather. Epoxy is extremely sensitive to temperature. When it is above 90 degrees F., it becomes very thin and runny before it thickens. When it is below 70, it takes a great deal of time to set up. This is not a problem on horizontal surfaces, but is critical on vertical ones. I have no problem at all on days that are 75 to less than 90 degrees. </P>
<P>Avoid having a work crew larger than you can carefully supervise. We found that you have to work each section of glass for around two hours and no amount of hands will make the epoxy wet out better or set up faster. I had wanted to laminate an entire hull in one day, but do the numbers and with a few hours set up time and a minimum of four pieces of glass, it just can't happen. If things aren't going to your satisfaction, stop and decide if it is really worth proceeding. Fixing screw-ups can take a lot longer than doing it right. </P>
<P>Weigh any advice you receive carefully. Some things work well for one person, but may be very wrong for another. Many practical techniques from a production setting don't really apply to custom one off ultra light projects. You will just have to sort out what works for you. I try to get anyone with a dandy idea to demo it for me and see if I can do it, before going off and trying it on my boat. </P>
<P>Most of this can be cooked down to knowing your materials and environment. Test scenarios have been of limited use to me because by the time your test has set up the weather has changed. There is no substitute for experience. I wish I had been able to help someone else do some of these things before doing them myself. Though experience may be the best teacher, it can be very costly in terms of time and material. Find others who are doing the same type of project and see what they are doing and study their methods. </P>
<P>How long does it take? Gee, between taking care of the boys and the household, and messing around with all this other stuff, it's kind of hard to tell. Longer than you think, because you always estimate based on everything going well, and it usually doesn't. Working alone is very difficult and extremely technique sensitive. I think that two skilled craftsmen could build four boats in the time it takes one to build one boat. I couldn't have used hired help initially, because I spent a lot of time figuring out what needed to happen and how to make it happen. Nothing is really terribly difficult to do, but there is a great deal of it to do. </P></BODY>
