<EM> In winter 1995, I attended the <A
HREF="http://cs-www.bu.edu/pub/ieee-rts/rtss95/"><EM>16th IEEE
Real-Time Systems Symposium</EM></A> in Pisa, Italy.  With such a rare
opportunity to travel to the other side of the Atlantic, I packed my
backpack right after the symposium and began my journey to central
Europe.  Here are some of the photos I took during the journey.

<H2>Pisa, Italy</H2>

Nobody goes to Pisa without visiting the <EM>Leaning Tower</EM>.
To delay its tilt, visitors are no longer allowed to climb up this
7-storey tower.  I was lucky enough to do this 7 years ago.  Because
of the inclining floor, the visitor would experience funny gravitational pull
when he/she circled around each floor.  No wonder Galileo chose this
place to demostrate the gravity!

<P>  Depending on where you look from, it can be
an attractive tourist place, a research center or a construction site.
The tower looks nice on this side.  But if you go to the other side of
the tower, it will look like a construction site with cranes and
workers wearing safety hats!

<H2>Salzburg, Austria</H2>

<I>0800 Dec 8 - 0900 Dec 9 </I>

<P> Salzburg is famous because of Mozart, Mozart and Mozart.  Mozart
was born here.  He lived here and he finally died here.  The yellow
building behind me is <EM>Mozarts Geburtshaus</EM> - the birthplace of
Mozart.  Mozart's family was living in one of the apartments on the
second floor.  It is a museum now.  He moved to another apartment
after he got married.  That apartment has just been converted into
another museum but is scheduled to open on his birthday, Jan 27, 1996.
Too bad that he wasn't born a few months earlier!

ALIGN = "right" ALT="Salzburg overview"></A>

This picture was taken from <EM>Hohensalzburg</EM>.  It is one of the
largest fortress in central Europe and it oversees the city of
Salzburg.  It was deadly cold when I was there.  The weather was dull
too.  But over the next few days I began to realize that I was already
lucky to have this kind of weather in Austria.

<H2>Wien, Austria</H2>

<I>1200 Dec 9 - 1330 Dec 11</I>

<P> Being the capital of the once mighty Austrian empire, Wien
(Vienna) is like other metropolitan cities in Europe.  There are just
too many places to visit.  I was forced to stay there for an extra
morning and make a further exchange of shillings for the beautiful
traveler's guides.  The <EM>Hofburg</EM> (imperial palace) in the city
center contains an extensive collection of invaluable crowns,
paintings and chinas.

<P> <A HREF="graben.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=213 SRC="graben.gif"
ALIGN = "left" ALT="Graben"></A> 

Because of the cold and dark weather, I didn't take many photos here.
The first photo shows a great sculpture on <EM>Naglerg Graben</EM>,
which is a high street with lots of shops.  On Saturday, it was
crowded with people doing Christmas shopping.

<P> <A HREF="rathaus.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=141 SRC="rathaus.gif" ALIGN =

The building is <EM>Rathaus</EM> (city hall).
There was a fun fare on that Sunday and a lot of parents and
children came here to enjoy it.

<H2>Budapest, Hungary</H2>

<P> <A HREF="buda.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=207 HEIGHT=119 SRC="buda.gif" ALIGN =
"left" ALT="Buda"></A>

Budapest is the capital of Hungary.  It is divided by <EM>Danube
river</EM>.  On the west of the river is the old town <EM>Buda</EM>,
with the castle (shown here in the photo) sits on top of the hill.
This castle has been razed and rebuilt several times for the past few
centuries.  It now contains a few museums.  The bridge connecting
Buda and Pest is called <EM>Szechenyi Ianchid</EM> (chain bridge).
It is one of oldest bridge across the river.

This photo shows the other side of the river - the <EM>new</EM> town
<EM>Pest</EM>.  The building on the river side is the Parliament
building.  It is heavily guarded by the soldiers and visitors are not
allowed to enter.

<H2>Vatican City</H2>

<I> 0900 Dec 15 - 1500 Dec 15 </I>

<P> The first time I came to Vatican city, I attended the midnight
mass hosted by Pope John II.  This time I came here early in the
morning to visit the Vatican Museum.  This museum is probably the best
museum in the world.  The tiny 
<A HREF="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sistine/0-Tour.html">
<EM>Sistine Chapel</EM></A> (15m x 40m) houses the
best fresco paintings I have ever seen.  Like many other visitors, I
spent an hour or so just watching the ceiling painted by Michelangelo
while listening to the cassette guide.  The two long corridors of
the museum also contain lots of priceless paintings, maps, carpets,
books...

<P> <A HREF="vatican.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=133 SRC="vatican.gif" ALIGN =
"right" ALT="Vatican Museum"></A>

After visiting the Vatican museum, I went to <EM>Basilica di San
Pietro</EM> (St. Peter's Basilica) and I climbed up 300 plus stairs to
the top of the dome.  It was really a good exercise.  From there, I
could see the whole Roma under my eyes.  This photo shows the aerial
view of the Vatican Museum.

<BR clear="all">


<P> <A HREF="santangelo.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=142 SRC="santangelo.gif"
 ALIGN = "right" ALT="Sant Angelo"></A>

This is castle <EM>Sant'Angelo</EM>.  The castle was first built in
4th century.  Over the centuries, it has been expanded several times
into its current state.  This place has been a fortress, a palace and
a prison.  It is a museum now.  But when compared with the Vatican
museum, it is almost empty.

<H2>Roma, Italy</H2>

<I> 1900 Dec 14 - 1200 Dec 16 </I>

<P> <A HREF="pantheon.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=142 SRC="pantheon.gif"
 ALIGN = "left" ALT="Pantheon"></A>

Roma is just a place where you will never short of visiting places.
With such a limited time, I could only go the places near the Vatican
city.  <EM>Pantheon</EM> is another historic site.  It has been
standing here unchanged since Hadrian erected it in 2nd century.
Famous painter Raphael is buried here.

<H2>Firenze, Italy</H2>

<I> 1330 Dec 16 - 1200 Dec 17 </I>

<P> <A HREF="duomo.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=139 HEIGHT=194 SRC="duomo.gif" ALIGN =
"left" ALT="Duomo"></A>

Firenze is another place where you will never get bored.  There are
so many museums here that I ran out of money.  (There is no student
discount!)

<P>
With its red dome and Lego-like walls, <EM>Duomo</EM> is very easy to
recognize.  Inside, there is a funny clock that runs `anticlockwise'.

<P> <A HREF="vecchio.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=138 HEIGHT=186 SRC="vecchio.gif" ALIGN =
"left" ALT="Piazza Vecchio"></A>

<EM>Piazza Vecchio</EM> is another landmark in Firenze.  There are
many sculptures inside.  Michelangelo's <A
HREF="http://www.dada.it/a-fol/turismo/musei-fi/david.gif">
<EM>David</EM></A> used to stand here.  But it has been moved to
another museum <EM>Accademia</EM>.  The one guarding the entrance is a
fake one.  The famous Uffizi is next to Vecchio.  A car bomb was
exploded nearby two years ago.  As a result, half of Uffizi is still
closed.  Fortunately, I was able to see the painting <A
HREF="http://www.oir.ucf.edu/wm/paint/auth/botticelli/venus/venus.jpg">
<EM>Birth of Venus</EM></A> by Sandro Botticelli.

<P> <A HREF="show.jpeg"><IMG WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=142 SRC="show.gif" ALIGN =
"left" ALT="Evening show"></A>

Right after I came out from Uffizi, there was a show outside Piazza
Vecchio.  People representing different parts of Italy are wearing
traditional costumes and carrying colorful flags.  The most thrilling
part of the show was the firing of the cannon.  Everytime it fired, my
heart broke.  It also reminded me of the car bomb.  I figured that my
life was shortened by a few important minutes after watching this
show.

A rare and peaceful sunshine over the quiet English countryside on
Christmas day.
