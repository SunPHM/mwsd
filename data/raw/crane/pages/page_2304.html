<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;<em>As for other areas of molecular biotechnology, conservation genetics is an
  applied science with the important goal of describing explicitly the composite genomes of
  small endangered populations</em>&quot; (1).<br>
  --Stephen J. O'Brien</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Analyzing DNA is common enough these days but for the most part the techniques are
applied to readily available samples. The case for threatened or endangered animals,
captive or in the wild, is much different. Extracting a tissue sample, much less locating
or being granted access to such animals, presents real problems before applying molecular
techniques. This story focuses on some of the current molecular techniques being applied
in conservation biology. </p>

<p><img src="9909b/images/whales.jpg" align="left" border="0" width="240" height="322"><em>Threatened species</em> are
those having an uncertain chance of continued survival, and likely to become an endangered
species. <em>Endangered species</em> are those 'threatened' with extinction. These may not
be the legally-binding definitions, but each conveys the meaning of the species being
challenged in the face of a dwindling habitat (&quot;threatened&quot;) versus the species
consisting of only a few extant breeding individuals (&quot;endangered&quot;). Species are
removed from the lists by one of two main ways: they recover or become extinct. For more
information on threatened and endangered animals, see the <a href="http://www.fws.gov">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> web
site. </p>

<p>Name the threatened or endangered species and molecular techniques are more than likely
being applied. For example, scientists in the genetics laboratory at the <a
href="http://www.brookfieldzoo.org/">Brookfield Zoo</a> in Illinois are collaborating on
projects using i) PCR amplification, mtDNA sequence and enzymatic restriction to determine
gender of monomorphic birds, such as the Humboldt penguin (endangered); ii) determine the
species and subspecies of three genera of captive New World primates, owl monkeys (<em>Aotus</em>),
<img src="9909b/images/enangered.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="240" height="266">spider monkeys (<em>Ateles</em>)
and squirrel monkeys (<em>Saimiri</em>) distributed throughout Central and South America;
iii) microsatellite loci and DNA fingerprinting methods for paternity analysis in gorillas
and dolphins; and in studies on African wild lions, iv) PCR amplification, sequencing of
cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase 5 genes, microsatellite analysis and DNA
fingerprinting; v) multi-locus DNA fingerprint methods were used to determine that
offspring born to a captive female Arafuran Filesnake at Brookfield Zoo had no
father---apparently females can reproduce by parthenogenesis; vi) mtDNA sequence of both
NADH dehydrogenase 5 and 6 subunits and cytochrome b were used to study the mountain
brushtail possum in Australia. And this just from the files of a single institution. For
an explanation of these and other techniques, see the Technology section of this article.</p>

<p><strong>International Crane Foundation</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.savingcranes.org/">International Crane Foundation</a>, or ICF,
is one place where the current technology is aiding the 15 species of cranes, seven of
which are endangered. The ICF was founded in 1973 by Ron Sauey and George Archibald, and
has since concentrated efforts on recovering these populations of birds in five ways:
research, education, habitat protection, captive breeding and restocking. The research
efforts involve collaborations with scientists and conservationists in Europe, Asia,
Australia and Africa, in addition to North America. Ken Jones, currently at the University
of Chicago, is just one of many scientists who have traveled to Wisconsin to study cranes
and apply current molecular techniques to the study of this species. Jones along with
Travis Glenn of the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina, address the use
of PCR for confirming sex in breeding pairs of whooping cranes in their article, <a

to Determine the Sex of Captive Whooping Cranes</a><font size="3">.</p>

<p>The next section of this article, <em>Goals</em> (arrowhead below), addresses the
desired ends of applying such molecular techniques. See also &quot;Photos and
References&quot; for some images of endangered species and suggested sources for

<p>The techniques of population genetics and molecular biology offer methods for
developing conservation plans for species that are at risk of extinction (1). The
application of population genetics to conservation work takes advantage of the wealth of
early basic research performed in the laboratory to the characterization of genomic
structure of dwindling species populations. The application of established population
genetics to the conservation field is on several levels. </p>

<p>Genetic studies first attempt to characterize the amount of genetic diversity of a
species on a molecular level and determine an estimate of heterozygosity (a measure of
genetic variation within a population). Further studies may look at the pedigrees of
existing populations, which allows assessment of mating success and correlation of certain
genetic profiles with genetic relatedness and mating success. Armed with the data from
genetics and other disciplines (epidemiology, reproductive biology, etc.), plans may be
developed for setting up captive breeding matches or plans to introduce new diversity into
the population, if possible. The genetic data also can be used to verify or correct
taxonomic classification and to reconstruct natural histories for a population. </p>

<p>A number of the molecular techniques of population genetics are described in the
following section, <em>Technology</em> (right arrowhead below).</p>

<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>

<p>There are many methods used for conservation work to identify individuals in key
populations, including <a href="#Allozyme analysis">allozyme analysis</a>, two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (<a href="#Two-dimensional PAGE">PAGE</a>), <a
href="#Sequence analysis">sequence analysis</a>, restriction fragment length polymorphism
(<a href="#RFLP">RFLP</a>) analysis, <a href="#RFLP">PCR-RFLP</a> and <a
href="#micro-analysis">microsatellite analysis</a>. </p>

<p><strong><a name="Allozyme analysis">Allozyme analysis</a></strong>, the earliest
population genetic measure using a molecular technique involves protein electrophoresis to
distinguish allelic forms of an enzyme. The first application of this work to population
genetics was by Lewontin and Hubby in 1966 to survey gene-controlled protein variants in
natural populations of <i>Drosophila pseudoobscura</i> and provide measures of
heterozygosity for those populations (2). This form of analysis is still in use today. </p>

<p><strong><a name="Two-dimensional PAGE">Two-dimensional PAGE</a></strong> combines
SDS-PAGE in the first dimension with isoelectric focusing in the second dimension to
reveal heterogeneity of charge in proteins and can be used to show genetic polymorphisms
in a population. </p>

<p><strong><a name="Sequence analysis">Sequence analysis</a> </strong>can be applied to
studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity. For example, the D-loop of mitochondria is
a segment of 500-600 bases in mammalian mitochondria where an opening of the duplex DNA
forms and replication initiates. The D-loop is displaced by a short stretch of RNA
base-paired to the complementary strand of mitochondrial DNA. Sequence analysis of the
D-loop (control region) has revealed that this region is polymorphic in many species. When
used with phylogenetic analyses, information about this sequence can be used to trace
maternal lineage of an individual. </p>

<p><a name="RFLP"></a>The mtDNA also exhibits restriction fragment length polymorphisms (<strong>RFLP</strong>).
To determine polymorphisms in restriction fragment length of mtDNA, the mtDNA is first
amplified by PCR and then analyzed for RFLPs using a number of restriction enzymes. This
combination of PCR and RFLP (<strong>PCR-RFLP</strong>) has been used to detect genetic
polymorphisms in cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1)
genes, for example. </p>

<p>RFLP analysis has been used for some time in the analysis of polymorphisms of mammalian
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and has revealed a large degree of
polymorphism, making this region of DNA targeted in assessments of genetic diversity in
many animals. Exploiting the diversity in the MHC RFLP and other genetic locations,
researchers have made &quot;DNA fingerprints&quot; for different populations. In the DNA
fingerprinting technique, DNA from different individuals is digested with restriction
enzymes and resolved on an agarose gel. Then, using labeled probes to specific sequences
in the polymorphic region, Southern blot analysis is performed to show the bands of
interest. In general, the pattern displayed on the gel is specific for a particular
individual and can be used to establish family relationships or degree of relatedness
between individuals. </p>

<p><a name="micro-analysis"></a>Other forms of analyses use PCR-based techniques to reveal
polymorphic loci. <strong>Microsatellite</strong>, or short tandem repeat (STR), loci
consist of short repetitive sequence elements 3 to 7 base pairs in length (3-6). These
repeats are well distributed throughout the genomes of many species and are a rich source
of highly polymorphic markers that may be detected using PCR (7-10). Alleles of STR loci
are differentiated by the number of copies of the repeat sequence contained within the
amplified region and can be distinguished from one another using radioactive, silver stain
or fluorescence detection following electrophoretic separation.</p>

<p>The application of genetic techniques to the analysis of population structure and
management allows a rigorous analysis of endangered species. Improvements in DNA analysis
techniques, as well as theoretical and statistical work adapted from basic science,
provide the conservation biologist with a powerful set of tools for potentially saving
populations at risk. </p>
