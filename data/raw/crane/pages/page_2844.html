        the first time in its history, the Little Traverse Conservancy has exercised 
        the conservation tool known as Purchase of Development Rights. Just this 
        past March, Matthew and Susan Bonnett sold, at a highly discounted price, 
        the development rights from 370 acres of their Munro Township farm (known 
        as Clay Ridge Farm) to the Conservancy.<br>

        “We’re breaking new ground for our organization,” said Tom Bailey, the 
        Conservancy’s executive director. “Farmland in this region is extremely 
        valuable and we know that we need to take active measures to protect land 
        with high ecological, farmland, or scenic value. Clay Ridge Farm has all 
        three.” <br>
        <br>
        The protected portion of Clay Ridge Farm includes about 1 &frac12; miles 
        of Bonnett Road frontage and more than a quarter mile of Beavertail Creek 
        frontage. The land is noted by the local Natural Resource Conservation 
        Service as some of the best farmland in Cheboygan County. It includes 
        active farmland, wetlands, and upland woods. Wildlife species that use 
        the land for habitat include turkey, white-tailed deer, sandhill crane, 
        coyote, badger, and several species of migratory waterfowl and songbirds.<br>

        <img src="../Newsletters/Summer2002Newsletter/BonnettsFamily.jpg" width="300" height="206" align="right">What 
        does this mean for Matthew and Susan Bonnett? It means they can continue 
        making their living by doing what they love and know best: farming. But 
        instead of dairy farming — which they have done all of their lives — the 
        Bonnetts will now raise beef cattle and dairy replacement heifers, pursuits 
        that will give them a little more free time. <br>
        <br>
        “My parents and I have been farming forever and over the years we bought 
        smaller adjacent farms to make our current 700-acre farm,” Matthew said. 
        “There is too much farmland being lost to development and after all of 
        these years of piecing this farm together, we wouldn’t want to sell it 
        off bit by bit.”<br>
        <br>
        “The Bonnetts exemplify what it means to be conservation-minded,” said 
        Ty Ratliff, land protection specialist with the Conservancy. “If they 
        weren’t willing to sell their development rights for less than half of 
        their value, we could not have made the purchase. They were committed 
        to making this a win-win situation for themselves and for long-term conservation.” 
        Ratliff added that this type of project (purchase of development rights) 
        also gives the non-farming public an opportunity to participate in farmland 
        protection.<br>
        <br>
        Both the Bonnetts and the Conservancy hope that the remaining development 
        rights of the 700-acre Clay Ridge Farm will be purchased in the future. 
        “Down the road, my goal is to try to find somebody, perhaps a university, 
        who will purchase the entire piece and leave it intact,” Matthew said. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Conservancy Board of Trustees views purchase of development rights 
        as a tool which will be exercised when appropriate. “Currently, we do 
        not have a large pot of dollars that we can use for this type of conservation,” 
        Bailey cautioned. But the Conservancy is on the lookout for funds that 
        can be earmarked solely for farmland conservation. It may take some time. 
        “Currently, there is very little money available for the protection of 
        farmland.”<br>
        <br>
        The Conservancy hopes to generate community awareness about the loss of 
        farmland and what it means to our region. “There are many parts of our 
        service area where farmland is the essence of the region’s beauty…and 
        way of life,” Bailey said. “It behooves us all to take just a moment to 
        try to envision northern Michigan without that piece of its personality.”</b></font></p>
