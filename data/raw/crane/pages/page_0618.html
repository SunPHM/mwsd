align="right"><font face="Arial"><strong>It's now official</strong>. I've been living in
NY for 6 months now. Appropriately, this is my sixth issue of &quot;The Barak Ori
Times&quot;. So consider this a Special Semi-Annual edition, although this is probably the
only special thing you'll find about it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As the days pass, I discover strange things about this place. Some
might be good, and some might be bad. It's very subjective. I've decided to share with you
a few of these things. You can decide for yourself if they're good or bad (not that I'll
try to hide my opinion on the matters).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The picture to the right has nothing to do with what I'm going to
talk about. I just thought it's a nice picture. I was walking on 16th street, and as I
crossed 7th Avenue I saw this crane, and decided that it looks nice enough to take a
picture.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">Almost all of the TV channels here have commercials in them. A lot
    of commercials. That's not news, and actually, I didn't want to talk about commercials in
    general. I wanted to talk about drug commercials. In Israel you can spot once in a while a
    commercial for headache pills or for something that presumably will make the winter easier
    for you. Here, there are drug commercials <strong>all the time</strong>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In both countries, if you advertise cigarettes in a newspaper, you
    have to include a warning about smoking hazards. Similarly, in the drug commercials, you
    see wonderful fields and flowers, hear a voiceover saying why you should buy the product
    and then, honestly yet still very calmly, going over all the things that are bad about
    this product. I guess there's law forcing them to specify the side effects of the medicine
    in the commercial. Not in small letters. They must be said out loud. This is so funny. The
    end of every such commercial is a list of symptoms that really scares you away. Don't
    believe me?&nbsp; Well.. reading is believing. Here's the transcript of a commercial. Word
    by word, as it appears on TV. I just cut the first 2 sentences:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">A few decades ago, an Israeli committee had to choose if foreign
    films would be dubbed to Hebrew or subtitled. We all know what was their decision, and I
    think we're all happy with that. I know for a fact that in &quot;advanced&quot; countries,
    like Germany and France, films are dubbed. It's amazing that people in these countries
    never heard Samuel L. Jackson &quot;quoting&quot; from the Bible in Pulp Fiction, or
    Robert De-Niro asking &quot;Are you talking to me?&quot;. The voice is such a big part of
    the actor and his/her acting. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">I always thought that they're smarter here in the US. I never saw
    that they dubbed films to English. Enters Roberto Benigni with his movie &quot;Life is
    Beautiful&quot;. The movie did very well in theaters here in the US about half a year ago.
    Actually it was the highest grossing foreign film ever. Now they're showing it again. In
    English. They're dubbing Roberto now. Needless to say, I will not see this version of the
    movie.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">When I was young, I remember hearing that in the US you can do
    almost anything. As long as you don't hurt others, you can probably do it. Well, I don't
    know what's the definition of hurting others, but here's a list of some things you're not
    allowed to do. I don't know if these are Federal laws, State laws or even city laws, I
    simply know that the following things are not included in the opportunities this great
    land has to offer:</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial">If you're under 17, you cannot go to a movie that is rated R
        (Restricted) without an accompanying adult. For your information, virtually any action
        movie is rated R because of violence scenes. Movie theaters really enforce this one! I saw
        an article in a newspaper in which they were asking famous people what was the first R
        rated movie they saw. They all remembered. I'm sure you don't know what was the first R
        rated movie you saw. No one cares about this in Israel.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">You cannot walk in the streets holding an alcoholic bottle. If you
        do, it must be in a bag so that it's not visible. Needless to say, you're not allowed to
        drink something alcoholic on the street.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">We went on a weekend trip, and decided to buy some things for the
        road. A friend took a six-pack to the cashier, but she wouldn't let him buy it. It turns
        out that on Sundays, you're not allowed to buy alcoholic drinks (including beer) before
        noon. You can't buy it!</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial">You know I'm not a drinker, and I know there's a drinking problem in
    this country, but this seems just a bit too much. Oh, and since I'm on the subject, I
    really like the T-Shirt here that says: <em>Take me drunk, I'm home.</em></font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">There are so many Magazines here. You can either buy them at full
    price (Usually $2-$5) in stores, or wait until someone sells them on the street for a
    Dollar or less. You'd probably do none of these. They have magazines for every subject. 10
    different magazines for fishing in sweet water, 15 on home gardening, and of course, 7000
    fashion magazines and a section of porn magazines from &quot;hot&quot; Europe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">In Israel we have women's magazines like AT and LA'ISHA. I don't
    think there are magazines for men. Here there are quite a few of those. When I visited the
    US, a bit more than a year ago, I bought such a magazine. I think it had an article about
    Seinfeld (It was around the time the last episode of the show was out). Reading this
    magazine was very funny, so when I came back to NY, I decided to buy it once in a while. I
    usually don't read a lot of it, but when I do, I must say it's quite amusing, and
    sometimes even interesting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Why am I telling you all this, if I dont even bother to read
    magazines regularly? Well... whenever I go to the basement of my building to do my
    laundry, I pass by the recycling bins and see an enormous amount of magazines. I guess
    reading them is very popular here. Consequently, this seems a significant enough
    &quot;strange thing&quot;, I feel obligated to report about.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">The magazine I'm talking about is called <em>Maxim</em>. On the
    cover it always says two things:</font><ol>
      <li><font face="Arial">Sex * Sports * Beer * Gadgets * Clothes * Fitness</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial">The best thing that happened to men since women.</font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Arial">While you will never see a breast in this magazine, and I've never
    seen any fitness article (except for one telling you how to incorporate some working out
    while drinking in a bar), there's a nice gadget section (including an article about the
    digital camera I proudly own) and a section about clothes, which I always skip. Actually,
    that's not what's important. The important thing is that the writing style is very funny.
    The pictures with the white text in them, that are scattered around on this page, were
    taken from this magazine, most of them from an article about a &quot;Strongest man in the
    world&quot; contest.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">An example of a funny article? <strong><em>Shirtless Man</em></strong>.
    A rather chubby man doing shopping in the city without a shirt. Most stores say no food,
    no drinks and no bare feet, but they don't say no shirt. It seems obvious. Allow me to
    quote: &quot;On the test drive, my skin started sticking to the vinyl interior.&quot;</font></p>
