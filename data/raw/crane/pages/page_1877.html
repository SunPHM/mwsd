                endangered whooping crane chicks flew 195.6 miles traversing nearly 
                the entire state of Georgia today. </p>
              <p>&quot;This is the longest flight we've ever made -- with any 
                species,&quot; said Operation Migration's Heather Ray from just 
                outside of Albany Georgia. &quot;All 16 birds made the flight. 
                We just needed to get over those mountains and the birds flew 
                perfectly.&quot;</p>
              <p>They are on their 1,228-mile ultralight-guided migration from 
                Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin to Chassahowitzka 
                National Wildlife Refuge along Florida's central Gulf Coast. </p>
              <p>These endangered whooping cranes, the largest birds in North 
                America, left Necedah on October 16th, 2003 following three ultralight 
                aircraft piloted by Operation Migration pilots. </p>
              <p>The whooping crane chicks have now traveled 950 miles during 
                their migration. They are in Terrill County, just north of Albany, 
                Georgia. They had flown into Georgia on Sunday morning, Nov. 30, 
                2003, after leaving Hiawassee Wildlife Refuge, managed by the 
                Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.</p>
              <p>The Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP), an international 
                coalition of public and private groups, is conducting this project 
                in an effort to reintroduce this highly imperiled species in eastern 
                North America.</p>
              <p>&quot;These magnificent creatures are almost home for the winter,&quot; 
                said Sam D. Hamilton, Southeast Regional Director of the U.S. 
                Fish and Wildlife Service. &quot;It is a great day for the whooping 
                crane and the entire partnership that is helping bring it back 
                from the edge of extinction.&quot;</p>
              <p>The ultralight migration project is in its third successful year 
                with Federal and State experts teaming with Non-Profit groups 
                with a single-minded purpose of resurrecting the cranes' historic 
                migrating route.&quot;</p>
              <p align="left">&quot;We are proud to be a partner in this exciting 
                effort to restore thismagnificentbird to Georgia's skies,&quot; 
                said Mike Harris, Georgia Department of Natural Resource's Wildlife 
                Resources Division's Non-game Wildlife and Natural Heritage Section 
                Chief. &quot;The reintroduction of the eastern migratory flock 
                of whooping cranes in Georgia is a prime example of what can be 
                accomplished with strong state, federal and private partnerships.&quot;</p>
              <p>The migration follows the natural migration of the whooping crane's 
                cousin, the sandhill crane that passes through Tennessee each 
                fall. To follow the progress of the 2003 crane migration, go to

                whooping crane chicks involved in the WCEP reintroduction project 
                werehatched at the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife 
                Research Center in Laurel, Maryland, where they were introduced 
                to ultralights and raised in isolation from humans. The Operation 
                Migration pilots, along with biologists from Patuxent and the 
                International Crane Foundation, spent the summer conditioning 
                the cranes to fly gradually longer flights behind the ultralights--the 
                cranes' &quot;surrogate parents.&quot;</p>
              <p>These sixteen cranes are the third flock to make this historic, 
                assisted migration from Wisconsin to Florida. In 2001, seven of 
                eight whooping cranes that began the first fall migration made 
                it to Florida safely; five of these seven birds survived the winter 
                and made an unassisted, successful spring migration back to Wisconsin. 
              </p>
              <p>In 2002, the WCEP migration team conditioned a second group and 
                guided 17 juvenile cranes to Chassahowitzka NWR. One was lost 
                during the migration when it collided with an ultralight. Sixteen 
                returned to Wisconsin this past spring.</p>
              <p>The WCEP monitoring team is presently tracking the location of 
                all of the 21 cranes from the &quot;Class of 2001&quot; and &quot;Class 
                of 2002&quot;. To date, all but two of the cranes from these previous 
                migrations have successfully migrated to Florida and the Chassahowitzka 
                National Wildlife Refuge. The last two are headed south as well: 
                One in Tennessee - the other in Kentucky (photo available).</p>
              <p>To follow the progress of the wild cranes, please visit: <a href="http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/back/2003fall/01-02fl-nov17-up.htm">http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/back/2003fall/01-02fl-nov17-up.htm</a> 
                <br>
                <br>
                The reintroduction is part of an ongoing recovery effort for the 
                highly imperiled whooping crane, which was on the verge of extinction 
                in the 1940s. Except for the Wisconsin-Florida birds, the continent's 
                only other migratory population of whooping cranes winters at 
                Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the Texas Gulf Coast. </p>
              <p>A non-migrating flock of about 100 cranes remain year-round in 
                central Florida as part of an ongoing reintroduction study led 
                by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. This 
                reintroduction would not only restore the whooping crane to part 
                of its historic range but also provide another geographically 
                distinct migratory population that could lead to downlisting the 
                species from endangered to threatened status by the U.S. Fish 
                and Wildlife Service and eventual recovery.</p>
              <p>In 1998, an international coalition of state and federal governments 
                and private organizations formed the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership 
                to spearhead the migratory reintroduction project for the whooping 
                crane, a federally listed endangered species. More than 35 private 
                landowners have volunteered their property as stopover sites for 
                the cranes and migration team. A temporary pen keeps the cranes 
                safe from predators between each morning's flight, and all of 
                the team that interacts with the cranes wear costumes to mask 
                their human form and use adult crane puppet heads to mimic adult 
                bird behaviors. The goal of WCEP is to establish a migrating flock 
                of at least 125 birds including 25 adult breeding pairs, restoring 
                the species to eastern North America.</p>
              <p>Founding members of WCEP include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
                the International Crane Foundation, the International Whooping 
                Crane Recovery Team, Operation Migration, Inc., National Fish 
                and Wildlife Foundation, U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife 
                Research Center and National Wildlife Health Center, and Wisconsin 
                Department of Natural Resources. </p>
              <p>Many other flyway states, provinces, private individuals and 
                conservation groups have joined forces with and support WCEP by 
                donating resources, funding and personnel.</p>
