						<p><font size="2"><a href="history/baker-jpw.html"><font face="verdana,geneva">Bernard W. Baker</font></a></font><font face="verdana,geneva" size="2"> donated the original 491 acres of the sanctuary that bears his name to Michigan Audubon Society (MAS) in 1941. The Big Marsh, as it was known then, was one of the primary nesting areas for the Sandhill Crane in southern Michigan. In 1943, 83 more acres were donated to the Sanctuary by MAS members. The Kresge Foundation donated 110 acres in 1961. Since then MAS has purchased the rest of the acreage.</font></p>
						<p><font face="verdana,geneva" size="2">Appropriately, the Greater Sandhill Crane has become the symbol of Baker Sanctuary. In 1947 there were only 27 known pairs of Sandhills in lower Michigan. By 1987 630 pairs were found in the Lower Peninsula. In 1998 over 4,000 sandhills were counted by observers during an official count. While the Greater Sandhill Crane, a resident and migrant at Baker Sanctuary, is not threatened now, many of its migratory staging areas are disappearing. National Wildlife Refuges and sanctuaries such as Michigan Audubon Society's Baker Sanctuary continue to play a vital role in maintaining stable populations of these magnificent birds.<br>

Nearly every type of Great Lakes flyway waterfowl can be seen seasonally. In recent years flocks of as many as 3,000 Greater Sandhill Cranes have been seen. Warblers, rails, bitterns, herons, woodcock, grouse, hawks and owls are all to be found. Species that have been recorded nesting in the sanctuary include Canada Geese, Wood Ducks, Blue-winged Teal, Black Ducks and Mallards, the Least Bittern and Green Heron, rails, Common Moorhen, the Marsh Wren and Henslow's Sparrow, Blue-winged and Prothonatory Warblers, Northern Harriers and others. Mammals seen include deer, raccoon, mink, muskrat and red fox. The swamp-dwelling Massasauga rattlesnake is a Baker resident. The extirpated (locally extinct) Trumpeter Swan was recently reintroduced and an osprey nesting platform has been installed.<br>

							<font face="verdana,geneva" size="2"><strong>Tamarack swamp,</strong> characterized by the tamarack trees growing in the spongy sphagnum moss mat atop a peat bed. The bog at Baker Sanctuary is a quaking bog, so named because the peat bed is floating on the remnants of an ancient lake that has been filled in over the eons with decomposed organic matter. The bog is a good winter browse for deer and rabbit. Orchids grow here in the summer. American larch (tamarack) and red and grey dogwoods are abundant in the bog.</font>
							<p><font face="verdana,geneva" size="2"><strong>Old marsh succession</strong> is represented along the <a href="#lodge">Doty Native Wildflower Trail</a> by the ponds that have evolved from an old lake bed overgrown with sedges and shrubs as the bog was formed. Red-osier, prickly ash, hawthorn, aspen and tamarack can be seen along the trail. A wide variety of summer wildflowers can be observed. American Woodcock can be seen at dusk during April and early May. Other birds found are Wilson's Snipe, Yellow Warblers and Common Yellow-throats.<br>

								<p><font face="verdana,geneva" size="2"><strong>Flooding</strong> is maintained by a dam to form <strong>Big Marsh Lake</strong>. It is best seen from the Kiwanis Youth Recreation Area. The afternoon, when glare is reduced, is the best time to see Sandhill Cranes, Canada Geese and a wide variety of waterfowl. Shorebirds are common on the mud flats when water is low during the summer. Herons and deer can be seen feeding on the shorelines. Large turtles, raccoon and muskrat can also be found. The Northern Shrike is a regular visitor in winter, and Northern Orioles, Yellow-billed Cuckoos and Bluebirds are common in the summer.<br>

The great room, ideal for meetings, has a stone fireplace at one end with the kitchen facilities at the other. Still visible are the 130 year-old tamarack beams from the original log cabin which stood on the site.
