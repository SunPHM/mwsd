      Baillie, owner of Peebles Country Retreat in Dullstroom acted as the youngest
      provincial cricket umpire in SA and served on the national cricket panel
      from 1990 to 2000.<br>
          <br>
    He started his own air-charter business (1992) running a fleet of small aircraft
    from Rand Airport. During the air-charter days he met his wife, Magda, who
    then joined the aircraft company as an administrator. The company was sold
    in 2000 and the planning for Peebles Country Retreat began. At that time
    the Baillies had a small farm near Dullstroom as a weekend get-away. During
    their visits to Dullstroom they fell in love with this romantic little town
    and after careful observation saw the need for up-market accommodation and
    decided to proceed with their project. Peebles Country Retreat, the new boutique
    hotel, opened during November 2002 in the town of Dullstroom and has just
    confirmed receipt of a five star grading.<br>
          <br>
    Evan said that he believed being graded by the Tourism Grading Council of
    SA is vital to ensure growth, especially in the tourism market. He also believes
    that it ensures an international standard for travellers and has huge marketing
    benefits. According to him the Grading Council concept is of utmost importance
    as it shows a standard for the consumer to be confident in accommodation
    venues.<br>
          <br>
    Peebles Country Retreat is named after a little fishing village just outside
    the magnificent city of Edinburgh in Scotland. Peebles' town motto is &quot;Peebles
    for pleasure&quot; and that is exactly what Peebles Country Retreat is all
    about. On your arrival your hosts Evan and Magda will make every effort to
    be on hand to personally welcome you to make sure that your requirements
    have been fully met. The main building houses a friendly reception area nestled
    into the corner of the beautifully appointed lounge and dining room area
    complete with double volume beamed ceilings, open hearth fireplaces and a
    fully stocked upstairs library area. <br>
          <br>
    The entire atmosphere reflects a tradition of personalised service. In this
    tranquil setting the scene is set for total relaxation. Indulge in a scrumptious
    breakfast served in the bright and airy dining room amidst the enticing aroma
    of freshly baked goodies. In room dining is available on request. In the
    evening elegant candlelit dinners with exquisite cuisine are served around
    a crackling open fire. Dine from an exciting and creative fusion food menu
    complemented by a fine wine selection. The Peebles conference facility is
    the ideal venue for your company getaway and exclusive executive strategic
    planning meetings. This elite venue has been designed to accommodate 30 delegates
    and full team building packages can be put together.<br>
          <br>
    Peebles can also arrange for a picnic for your day in the country together
    with bird watching, horse riding, mountain bike excursions or just lovely
    walk through the nearby village. Since Peebles opened in November it has
    gone from strength to strength. The exceptional high standards of personal
    service and extremely high quality of food put this new hotel on the map
    straight away.<br>
          <br>
    Peebles Country Retreat truly offers an exclusive experience not to be missed!
    Peebles Country Retreat is one of the founder members of the Dullstroom Platinum
    Club. Evan convey a big thank you to The Dullstroom Platinum Club whom inspires
    Peebles Country Retreat to become a graded venue. </td>

      <p>Perceptions both in South Africa and around the world is that standards 
        of service here are poor - certainly not good enough to attract tourists 
        or send them home with word-of-mouth publicity to boost our country's 
        appeal.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images_june2003/sa_host_logo.jpg" width="120" height="58" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="SA Host Logo" border="1">But 
        this need not be the last word on service in South Africa - and Adriaan 
        Rall, a registered Leader of SA Host is determined to change the perception 
        and the reality with the implementation of the SA Host customer service 
        training programme, a concept which has been road tested in 14 countries 
        around the world. The SA Host programme forms part of the Business Trust 
        sponsored Tourism Learner ship Project, which is housed within the Tourism, 
        Hospitality &amp; Sport Education &amp; Training Authority (THETA). The 
        programme is however being offered to all sectors.<br>
        <br>
        SA Host is modelled on the successful Canadian &quot;SuperHost&quot; and 
        was brought to South Africa by Afrihost funded by Anglo American. The 
        programme is currently been implemented in Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, 
        Tanzania, Kenya and Mozambique.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;SA Host is a national training project to skill and empower South 
        Africans to deliver high quality customer service and to promote national 
        pride,&quot; says Adriaan Rall. &quot;It is aimed at all businesses and 
        services in the private and public sectors with which tourists have dealings, 
        from pharmacies to banks to tourism information offices etc.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Rall points out that tourists do not only include foreign holidaymakers 
        but also those visiting the country on business or for education purposes. 
        It also includes South Africans travelling within their own country. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;In fact,&quot; says Rall, &quot;we are as concerned with the quality 
        of service provided to South African residents as we are about the service 
        delivered to foreign visitors. Visitors travelling within their own country 
        use all the services provided in a community, and take away impressions 
        of a particular area. Ultimately the tourist industry will benefit, and 
        so will every other sector of the economy. Service quality and quality 
        of life go hand in hand. Getting our service right to our internal customers, 
        will ensure that our external visitors have positive experiences wherever 
        they go.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        SA Host is delivered locally and facilitated by a trained leader in an 
        interactive two day workshop. The aims of the national programme are implemented 
        at grassroots level by 'Local Host Partnerships' to ensure that it is 
        relevant to the conditions in which communities live and work.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;We are therefore very pleased to announce that Proudly Dullstroom 
        has agreed to become the very first 'Local Host Partnership' in Mpumalanga 
        and will promote the programme amongst the communities in the Highlands 
        Meander Tourism Region. <br>
        <br>
        Costs will be kept as low as possible to provide access to a wide range 
        of communities without compromising on the standard of the programme. 
        I am passionate about this programme, as it will go a long way to raising 
        service standards throughout all industries, not just tourism. SA Host 
        is a national product, owned by our country, which will not be run for 
        gain.&quot; Says Rall<br>
        <br>
        Those who participate in the workshops become 'SA Hosts', and are awarded 
        a certificate and lapel badge after completion of the two-day workshop. 
        Businesses may become 'SA Hosts Business/Venues' if 60% or more of their 
        staff received SA Hosts certificates. The Venue can then use the SA Host 
        logo for marketing purposes and will be promoted by the various Tourism 
        Structures locally and internationally. Should a community reach a point 
        where 60% of its businesses/Venues are 'SA Host businesses/venues' the 
        community itself will receive 'SA Host Community' status. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;Service is a critical success factor for any community, business 
        and organisation and it is the only factor that gives you the edge to 
        competitors. We are determent to strive for the first 'SA Host Community' 
        in South Africa by building personal, professional and community pride 
        and we will inspire a greater commitment in giving excellent customer 
        service. If we can achieve this, Dullstroom and the Highlands Meander 
        will undoubtedly change from a weekend destination to a holiday destination 
        for both local and international tourist&quot; says Ignas Oberholzer, 
        CEO of Proudly Dullstroom and Estate Manager of the award winning Dunkeld 
        Country Estate.<br>
        <br>
        He said that the spin-offs from the SA Host status will improve profitability, 
        better customer service and a better sense of responsibility for customer 
        needs and their expectations. They will receive national &amp; international 
        recognition and the program will enhance employee pride and a better understanding 
        of their role in the community&quot;.<br>

        Executive Committee of the Dullstroom Chamber of Business gave instructions 
        to Chamber President, Ignas Oberholzer, to save the Post Office at the 
        end of September 2002. This action was taken after Arbee's gave notice 
        to SA Postal Services that he will no longer continue with the agency 
        services.<br>
        <br>
        Due to the fact that the postal Agency is not a high profit business, 
        no one was interested to manage such an agency. The Dullstroom Chamber 
        of Business took up the responsibility of the Post Office as their social 
        responsibility to the Dullstroom community, or so was the intention.<br>
        <br>
        With no assistance from any of the Chamber members, Mr Oberholzer, who 
        is also the estate manager of Dunkeld Country Estate and his staff moved 
        the postal agency to the Dullstroom Station. The station building is a 
        community project of Proudly Dullstroom sponsored by Dunkeld Country Estate.<br>
        <br>
        As president, of the Dullstroom Chamber of Business, Mr Oberholzer continued 
        with this essential service to the community of Dullstroom and took on 
        the payouts of the governments' social grants to increase the services. 
        Proudly Dullstroom sponsored financial shortages exceeding R15000 over 
        a period.<br>
        <br>
        Several attempts were made by various people, namely Mrs. Joyce Moore, 
        Treasurer of the Chamber, Mr Fanie Skhosana, Vice-president of the Chamber, 
        Mr Brian Rowlands, Chairman of the Rates Payers Association, to help raise 
        funds for the Postal Agency, but the rest of the executive members of 
        the Chamber did not do contribute in any way. Mr Oberholzer said that 
        all the work and responsibility was for the account of Proudly Dullstroom 
        and that all the credit was given to the Dullstroom Chamber of Business. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &quot;It did not matter because I tried to add face value to the Chamber 
        in Dullstroom, so that the community can see what the Chamber is doing 
        for the Dullstroom community&quot; says Ignas Oberholzer.<br>
        <br>
        Mr Oberholzer resigned as president on 7th June 2003 and subsequently 
        handed the responsibility of the Post Office over to the Chamber with 
        due notice 30th June 2003.<br>
        &quot;It is with great disappointment that we received notice from the 
        Dullstroom Chamber of Business that the postal services will be terminated 
        at the end of June 2003. This means that the pensioners and social grants 
        will be terminated as well.&quot; Says acting municipal manager of the 
        Highlands Municipality, Oscar Nkosi.<br>
        <br>
        Jane Mkalane, Mayor of Highlands received several requests for help from 
        the Dullstroom community to assist them. The already struggling people 
        from the disadvantage community in the greater Dullstroom area will suffer 
        even more from this irresponsible decision from The Dullstroom Chamber 
        of Business lead by Mr Malcolm MacRobert.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Oscar Nkosi acted on behalf of the Mayor and made arrangements with 
        Ignas Oberholzer of Proudly Dullstroom to continue with the services of 
        the Dullstroom Post Office and the payouts of social grants. The condition 
        was however that the Dullstroom Chamber of Business transfer their agreement 
        with SA Postal Services over to Proudly Dullstroom.<br>
        <br>

        At a special meeting held on Wednesday 11th June 2003 at the Dullstroom 
        Inn, the letters from both the Municipality and Proudly Dullstroom were 
        submitted by Mr Freddy Makunyane, ward councillor for Dullstroom and councillor 
        responsible for Tourism, to Mr MacRobert, Chairperson of the meeting The 
        contents of the letter were not discussed, nor did Mr MacRobert inform 
        the meeting about the contents. After Ignas Oberholzer, CEO of Proudly 
        Dullstroom addressed the meeting and explained how it worked and what 
        the problems were, other counter solutions/offers was withdrawn and the 
        only offer remaining was the one negotiated by Oscar Nkosi.<br>
        <br>
        Mr MacRobert was still not satisfied with the outcome and put the only 
        solution on the table to a vote. The entire meeting unanimously voted 
        in favour of that Proudly Dullstroom must continue with these essential 
        services to the community. Mr MacRobert did not realised the urgency of 
        the matter and informed the meeting that a final decision would be made 
        on the Chambers AGM. Mr Brian Whitehorn then said that the matter couldn't 
        wait until the AGM because the social grants need to be paid out on time. 
        A special executive meeting was called just after the Post Office meeting 
        was adjourned, where the final decision was taken.<br>
        &quot;I would like to thank all the people present at the meeting for 
        their trust and support. Especially Mayor Jane, Oscar Nkosi, Councillor 
        Freddy Makunayne, and all the members of the Rates Payers Association. 
        It is great to see that most of our community can still stand together 
        on issues as important as this.&quot; says Ignas Oberholzer.</p>

        Estate as their contribution to the community. It was done with pride 
        in the history of Dullstroom and confidence in the future of the Greater 
        Dullstroom area. Proudly Dullstroom will foster the personal, economic 
        and cultural growth of the community, contribute to quality of life, promote 
        tourism, foster economic vitality through leadership, create an active 
        network of information support and co-operatively working together for 
        the common good. <br>
        <br>
        It is the goal of Proudly Dullstroom to share with the world, the awesome 
        beauty and natural splendour that Dullstroom has to offer. Due to the 
        nature of the various venues, guests will come into contact with South 
        Africans from all walks of life, sharing in the rich tapestry of cultures 
        and people that make South Africa the &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Proudly Dullstroom is passionately committed to the development of the 
        Mpumalanga tourism industry, with the focus on Dullstroom as anchor of 
        the Highlands Trout Triangle. Proudly Dullstroom aims to offer our valued 
        guest the best of services that the region has to offer. We discovered 
        the free spirit of private enterprise and differentiate ourselves by defining 
        the difference that gives you the leading edge with a daring new concept 
        in network marketing.<br>
        <br>
        The Proudly Dullstroom team believes in ultimate service levels and that 
        tourism is indeed everybody's business. The entire community must be inspired 
        to build a culture of community pride and the best service levels. <br>
        <br>
        Proudly Dullstroom acknowledges their social responsibility, by an age 
        old problem, the struggle against poverty. To combat this, the community 
        must advance social transformation, through a concerted programme of reconstruction 
        and development. This cannot bear fruit if carried out by local government 
        alone and Proudly Dullstroom is building strong linkages with community 
        and business organisations as well as local and provincial government 
        structures. A lack of communication and positive interaction amongst community 
        members can result in a poor perception and lack understanding when it 
        comes to commitments.<br>
        <br>
        As part of the social responsibility initiative of Proudly Dullstroom 
        is the realisation of the growth of the Internet, telecommunications and 
        information network which resulted in shifts in the structure and operations 
        of the hospitality, travel and tourism industries. It is for this reason 
        that Proudly Dullstroom now delivering the Postal services by taking the

        into reality on the 22 May 2003 when he opened the new Builders Market 
        complex, 3.1 hectare under one roof in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. The project, 
        at a total cost R21 million, is undoubtedly the largest one stop hardware

        than 70 000 products.<br>
        <br>

        contractors, Sub-contractors, skilled labour, semi-skilled labour and

        Rodwell is passionate about endangered cranes in Africa. The co-ordinator 
        of the Africa Programme of the South African Crane Working Group (SACWG), 
        a project of the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT), recently received global 
        recognition for her work in conservation when she won a Rolex Award for 
        Enterprise. <br>
        <br>
        The Johannesburg-based Rodwell is one of only five Laureates selected 
        from nearly 1400 entries submitted by entrants in 113 countries. She was 
        recognised for an ambitious cross-frontier project to conserve the critically 
        endangered Wattled Crane and its wetland habitat. <br>
        <br>
        The biennial awards programme recognises outstanding men and women who 
        undertake groundbreaking projects to advance human knowledge and well 
        being. It carries a prize of US$100 000 as well as a gold Rolex Chronometer 
        watch. &quot;The prize money will go straight into continuing the project's 
        work,&quot; says Rodwell. She shares the Laureate title with four men: 
        <br>
        - Michel Andre, a French biologist who created a system to prevent collisions 
        between whales and ships; <br>
        - Jose Marcia Ayres, a Brazilian forest ecologist spearheading the establishment 
        of the world's largest rain forest corridor; <br>
        - Dave Irvine- Halliday, a Canadian electrical engineer supplying inexpensive 
        lighting systems to homes and schools in developing countries; <br>
        - and Gordon Sato, a retired American cellular and molecular biologist 
        helping the people of Eritrea establish agriculture based on mangroves.

        conservation is nothing new to Rodwell who's spent the last 11 years of 
        her life at its forefront in South Africa. That country is home to three 
        of the world's crane species - the Blue Crane, South Africa's national 
        bird, the Grey Crowned Crane and the Wattled Crane. But it is the latter 
        most at risk - it is classified as being 'critically endangered'. The 
        bird is incredibly sensitive to changes in its wetland habitat and, as 
        a result, is seen as an indicator-species for the health of wetlands. 
        <br>
        &quot;The fact is if the Wattled Crane stops breeding, it is a sure signal 
        the health of the wetlands and the communities living off those areas 
        are in grave danger,&quot; Rodwell says.&quot; <br>
        The direct link between the health of the birds, the survival and sustainability 
        of the wetlands and the health of the people means the Wattled Crane is 
        a flagship species for an ecosystem we are entirely dependent on.&quot; 
        <br>
        The greatest threat the bird faces is the loss of its habitat, primarily 
        as a result of intensified agriculture, dam construction and industrialisation 
        but poisoning, bush fires and collisions with power lines also take their 
        toll. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images_june2003/wattled_crane.jpg" width="200" height="246" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="1" alt="The Wattled Crane">Rodwell 
        and SACWG's efforts have seen the situation improve within South Africa, 
        but beyond the country's borders the position is not so rosy. It was this 
        fact that prompted her, together with Richard Beilfuss of the International 
        Crane Foundation, to set up the ambitious Africa Programme aimed at building 
        a network of conservationists that will ensure the protection of the Wattled 
        Crane across Africa. &quot;As a result of research in Mozambique we understand 
        the breeding cycle of the bird is linked to the natural flood-cycles of 
        rivers,&quot; she says. &quot;In regulated flood-plains, the impact of 
        reduced flooding on the diversity and productivity of the flood plain 
        is significant. &quot;Take for example the Zambezi River system and its 
        associated flood plains that extend across four countries. Wattled cranes 
        move between those wetland areas, sometimes hundreds of kilometres apart, 
        with no regard for political boundaries.<br>
        <br>
        If one section of the system is damaged it obviously impacts on another 
        part downstream. Rodwell and Beilfuss developed an approach that recognises 
        the vital role people play as custodians of cranes and their habitats. 
        Their programme aims to preserve the way of life of those who farm and 
        fish the wetlands, balancing environmental and human needs. &quot;By building 
        non-adversorial relationships with landowners in South Africa we aim to 
        develop communities committed to the conservation of the Wattled Crane 
        and the preservation of traditional grassland habitats,&quot; Rodwell 
        says. &quot;At the same time the programme aims to empower African conservationists 
        to lead initiatives - in contrast to traditional conservation efforts 
        that often rely on outside specialists.&quot;</p>

      On Wednesday, 18 May 2003, the Dullstroom Residents Association donated 
      85 blankets to the poor of Sakhelwe. With grateful hearts the community 
      of Sakhelwe gathered at the Cr&egrave;che where Rev E Mdluli from the Lutheren 
      Church opened the gathering with Scripture reading from the Bible and then 
      the blankets were distributed to families in need by Mr Brian Rowlands, 
      chairperson of the Dullstroom Residents Association. This is the third successive 
      year that the Residents Association of Dullstroom brought relieve to poverty-stricken

      preparing them for the Comrades Marathon. <br>
      <br>
      It started off with them coming from Sakhalwe requesting Nigel to assist 
      them in their training. <br>

      Nigel managed to get them trained up, got them going and took them down 
      for the race. This was their third race. <br>

      Last year Lazarus Ledimo and Shadrek Maphanga managed to get through to 
      run the Comrades. Participants were Lucas Mmadi, Paulos Fenyane, Lazarus 
      Ledimo, Joseph Magoroshane, Nigel Briggs and Shadrek Maphanga. Paul Clark 
      who had been training for this event took ill and had to withdraw. <br>
      <br>
      Results: Lazarus Ledimo finished in 7h18min and received a silver medal, 
      Paulos Fenyane, Lucas Mmadi, Shadrek Maphanga received Bill Rowan-medals 
      for passing the finish line under 9hours and both Joseph Magoroshane and

        on the poles and replacing it with new technology.<br>
        <br>
        To execute the work, the town has had a few planned interruptions to the

        Eskom plans to complete the major works by the end of July this year.<br>
        <br>
        The next interruption will be on 18 June 2003 from 07:00 until 19:00. 
        It will affect customers on the Dullstroom/Palmer (PDU) feeder from the

      team faced the team sponsored by Dunkeld Country Estate. The match marked 
      the presentation by Stonecutters of Soccer kit to the players, reserves

      Sponsored side 1.<br>
      <br>
      The sponsorship was the result of a combined effort by the players and their 
      sponsor. None of the club members are employed so in order for the club 
      to raise club fees a project was initiated at Stonecutters - the clearing 
      of a wattle plantation. The total effort by the team amounted to 1072 hours 
      of hard work. Not only was the wattle plantation cleared but loads of wood 
      for use at the lodge was cut. Doug Starling from Highland Run has supplied 
      transport to this team, which is highly appreciated.<br>
