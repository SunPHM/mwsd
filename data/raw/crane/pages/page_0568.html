<P><SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sheba</SPAN> (<SPAN CLASS="STORE">Sick Mind Press</SPAN>) is a book that makes you laugh, makes you think, and  takes you to worlds you've only imagined.  Rich in history, pre-history, and  philosophy, the book is also a good adventure story and a rowdy farce.   While just a smidge too "mature" for young kids, the book would be ideal for  older kids and adults into world mythology.  The set-up is as follows:  in  post-Cleopatra Egypt, the gods are feeling insecure because the other  religions of the world are starting to horn in on their territory.  The  Romans are bringing in Jupiter and his gang, those upstart kids known as the  Christians are betting on that new kid named Jesus, and over in other parts  of the world, what are those Aztecs doing, anyway?  Religious turmoil is  portrayed as a simple matter of personalities wanting to hold on to their  piece of the pie.  Amidst all this is a cat mummy who wants to go to the  Egyptian version of heaven, but has to find Anubis, who has left his post.</P>

<P>Let's say you combined <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Cerebus</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sandman</SPAN>, but cut the pretensions in favor  of broad humor and adventure.  You'd have a work of scope, one that  entertains and makes you laugh, one that makes you feel smart while still  giving you bang for your comic book buck, a work that shows how beautiful  art and a sense of humor can make an esoteric idea for a comic worth 
reading.  <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sheba</SPAN> is that work and it is worth reading.</P>

<P>As you can see by the following interview, Walter Crane IV <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sheba's</SPAN> creator, has a wicked sense of humor and a refreshing sense of honesty.    <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sheba</SPAN> reflects these qualities in spades.</P>

<P><B>Sequential Tart:</b><I>  What does the <SPAN CLASS="CON">Expo</SPAN> mean to you?</i></P>

<P><B>Walter Crane:</B>  It's a great show for Indy comic creators to hobnob with  other Indy creators, without the looming threat of the Big Publishers (like  in <SPAN CLASS="CON">San Diego</SPAN>).  Though I've often wondered about that huge party that <SPAN CLASS="STORE">Dark  Horse</SPAN> throws on the penthouse of the <B>Holiday Inn</B>. (you know, with the hot  tubs full of beer). Perhaps they're trying to get all their competition in  one place. Sounds like a plot to me!</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  What were you looking forward to?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  That party.. Oh yeah, and selling books and the <SPAN CLASS="STORE">Ignatz</SPAN> awards. And  hobnobbing. Did I mention hobnobbing? I think that's a word that should come  back into usage.</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  How does the <SPAN CLASS="CON">Expo</SPAN> compare to other conventions?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  Well, it's the first one seen that really focused on the artistic and  independent side of the medium, while still pulling in a lot of the public,  who are willing to spend money.  I've been to some 'zine shows, and it  doesn't take long to realize that most readers in the 'zine scene  are  starving artists too.  People come to the <SPAN CLASS="CON">Expo</SPAN> to buy things, and read them too!</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  What are your favorite <SPAN CLASS="CON">Expo</SPAN> memories/stories?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  Usually my most interesting/horror stories are about  <b>getting</B> to the  <SPAN CLASS="CON">Expo</SPAN>.  One year my plane ticket to DC was cancelled because of a Hurricane  Floyd, and so I ended up taking Amtrak, but because of the storm, it only  went to New York.. I had to sprint across mid-town Manhattan with my luggage  (which wore the little wheels off of the luggage!) to catch the next bus to  DC.  I finally got to <SPAN CLASS="CON">SPX</SPAN> that Friday evening, exasperated, but at least there!</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  How did <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sheba</SPAN> come about?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  Gosh.. I don't know.. I think I saw a little picture of a cat mummy in  a book and decided that would make a cute cartoon character. And I also had  this crazy idea that it would sell too. Boy, was I wrong!</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  Why did you decide to combine the mythological with the satirical?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  Because the human race needs to see that religion, all religion is more  about culture than anything to do with how we got onto this planet. There  are too many people that live in isolation and don't look at the bigger picture. I think what happened last week shows a huge need for more  people to realize this. Except for Zoroastrianism. Boy, will we all be surprised when we die to find out  that Zoroastrianism is the one true faith!</P>

<TABLE align=right border=0><TR><TD><IMG src=/images/comics/crane_02.gif></TD></TR></TABLE> 

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  What sort of research did you do for your comic?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  Lots of books, basically.  I'll be doing lots of stuff with Napoleon in  this new plot arc, so it's off to the library again.  But back when I was doing stuff with 7th century Egypt there  wasn't much out there on the Dark Ages, so I kinda winged it.</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  Who is your target audience?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  Pretty much anyone.. I remember getting that dreaded "mature audiences"  label just for the Minoan Snake Goddess. Sometimes I get people walking up  to my table at shows with their kids, and I have no idea if <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Sheba</SPAN> will  offend them or not.  One time this religious right sort of guy bought the  first issue, and pointed out "this" and "that" (I think he thought it was  about the Queen of Sheba) , but then came back afterwards and said that I  knew my stuff, so go figure!</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  What comics do you read?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  I haven't been reading quite as much as I should.  Some of my favorite  books out there are <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Finder</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Box Office Poison</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="COMIC">Naughty Bits</SPAN> as well..  But I know I have piles upon piles of books I got at conventions that I  haven't looked at yet. Shame on me.</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  How do you think people will react to comics after the events of Sept.  11th?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  I'm not sure about other comics, but in the wake of Sept 11th, I hope  people don't take my own work wrong, since I did have a character vowing to "Wipe out Islam!".  After that  issue came out, an Orthodox Jewish temple contacted me about displaying some of my art -thinking I was  some sort of Zionist or something, which couldn't be farther from the truth.</P>

<P><B>ST:</B> <I>  Where is your comic available?</i></P>

<P><B>WC:</B>  The issues and trade paperbacks are available at some comic shops, but  I couldn't tell you which ones.  The trade paperbacks are also available  through <a href=http://www.Amazon.com target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> and through my own website. Actually, if you order  through Amazon, they have to order it from me, so you might as well order it  from me, unless you really love credit cards.</P>
