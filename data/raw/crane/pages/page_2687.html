<p class="header_navy">Cranes: Messengers from the Past</p>
<p>Our connection to the crane spans time and cultures. Cranes are the oldest living bird species in the world, dating back some 60 million years. From Asia to North America, they have danced their way into the hearts of people and woven their unforgettable calls into the fabric of tradition.</p>
<p>Crane designs flow through the wedding kimonos of Japanese brides, symbolizing fidelity and a long life. Greek myth tells of the God Hermes inventing their alphabet by watching a flight of cranes.</p>
<p>Here, ancient rock art depicts the ancestors of sandhill cranes that return to Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, as they have every November and before calendars existed.</p>

<p class="header_navy">What Can We Learn From Cranes?</p>
<p>As you explore this winter home of sandhills, reflect on your own feelings for wildlife and wild places. Sandhill cranes flew along the Rio Grande and for centuries knew a river that flooded, a river that created miles of marshland.</p>
<p>Today, this refuge represents one of the few wild havens left along a much altered Rio Grande. As we face the challenge of meeting both human and wildlife needs in a finite world, we might look to our elders for guidance-the cranes. They have millions of years of experience in sustainable living.</p>

<p class="header_navy">A Legendary Bird</p>
<p>Apollo, the Greek sun god, is said to have disguised himself as a crane when he visited mortals, heralding the coming of Spring and light.</p>
<p>In Africa, the attributes of language and thought are closely associated with the crowned crane, also featured on the flag of Uganda.</p>
<p>The Chinese called them &quot;blessed cranes&quot; (xian-he) --the wise messengers that transported the legendary sages between heavenly worlds.</p>
<p>Crow and Cheyenne warriors blew on whistles made from crane wing bones to give them courage as they rode into battle.</p>

<p class="header_navy">Our Kinship With Cranes</p>
<p>Why are we drawn to cranes? Is it simply the pure joy that comes from witnessing such beauty and grace? Or do we find in these birds a model for living?</p>
<p>Cranes dance. They dance not just once a year in ritual courtship, but they dance often. They dance in synchrony, in pairs, alone or as a flock.</p>
<p>Cranes pair for life. Their lives are long, as are their migrations. When they fly, they connect one country to another, one culture to another, erasing political boundaries with a sweep of wings.</p>
<p>Cooperation pervades the community of cranes. Males and females tend the nest equally. Their chicks receive lengthy nurturing. Every individual watches out for the welfare of the flock. No wonder the word &quot;congruence&quot; (agreement) has its root in the Roman word for cranes -grues. No wonder that Crow Indians believed migrating songbirds rode on the backs of cranes.</p>

<p class="header_navy">Crane Dance</p>
<p>The dance begins with a sweeping bow and spreading wings. Swiftly, the crane lifts his head just as those magnificent wings stroke downward. At that moment, he leaps 15-feet off the ground.  But he is not alone. His mate mirrors every move.  The dance goes on with elaborate variations. They toss sticks in the air, dance slow then faster. More cranes join. The whole flock jumps and flaps in an infectious frenzy. </p>
<p>Dancing appears to release energy and prevent aggression. Australian aborigines, African tribes, the Ainu of Japan and  Native Americans have mimicked the dances of cranes. And who really invented ballet?</p>

<p class="header_navy">Crane Feats </p>
<p>A male Siberian crane lived 83 years in captivity. Cranes might survive 25 years or more in the wild.</p>
<p>Eurasian cranes soar as high as 6,500-feet, while riding thermals of air. A pilot recorded a flock of cranes crossing the English Channel at 13,000 feet.</p>
<p>The whooping crane ranks as the tallest native bird in North America at five feet.</p>
<p>Greater sandhill cranes can fly 365 miles nonstop, averaging 38 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Pairs reinforce their bonds through &quot;unison calling,&quot; a complicated series of notes they sing while standing side by side or facing each other.</p>
<p>Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge provides a winter haven for tens of thousands of greater sandhills, several hundred lesser sandhills, and an occasional whooping crane. </p>
