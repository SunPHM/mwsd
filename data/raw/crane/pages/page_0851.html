<p>Rex Brasher (1869-1960) was a Connecticut wildlife artist who produced in the
early 1930s a limited edition set of books entitled <u><i>The
Birds and Trees of North America</i></u>.&nbsp; This work included prints of 875
paintings showing over 1200 species and subspecies of North American
birds.&nbsp; Brasher, who could not afford to have his work printed in color, is
credited with having hand-colored all of the prints using airbrush and stencil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prints immediately below are from a disbound copy of Brasher's work, <u><i>The
Birds and Trees of North America</i></u>.&nbsp; The linen edge was the means by
which they were bound in the book.&nbsp; (This edge can be folded back for
framing.)&nbsp; The prints (excluding binding edge) measure about 16 inches x 12 inches.&nbsp; All are
collotypes or offset lithographs signed in the stone and hand-colored with airbrush and
stencil.&nbsp; All are in overall excellent condition with any problems noted.&nbsp; Numbers following the bird
names below are the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) numbers -- these appear on the
prints and in the text.</p>

<p>The information below refers to Brasher prints we had in the past.&nbsp; We
thought some of you would enjoy having additional photos and information about
Brasher, and so we are maintaining it here.&nbsp; All of these prints are
sold.&nbsp; The only prints currently for sale are those shown above.</p>
<p><b>OLD BRASHER MATERIAL</b></p>
<p>The prints measure about 16 inches x 12 inches.&nbsp; All are signed in the
stone, and hand-colored with airbrush and
stencil.&nbsp; If also signed with ink or pencil, a
photo of the signature is included.&nbsp; The type of print (collotype or offset
lithograph) is noted.&nbsp; Finally, condition information is provided along with price.&nbsp;
The back of the print (verso) is described only if there is anything of
significance to note.&nbsp; The last two prints are not from <i> <u> The
Birds and Trees of North America</u></i>.&nbsp; They are interesting in their own right.</p>
<p>At the <a href="what's_new.html#AHPCS"><b>2004 annual meeting</b></a> of the
American Historical Print Collectors Society, we had an opportunity to talk to
long-time AHPCS member Robert Braun about the Brasher prints following his excellent talk on identifying
printing processes.&nbsp; Bob explained that the prints we believed to be
photogravures are actually collotypes.&nbsp; The confusion concerning these
prints is widespread, and perhaps arises because the plates were printed by the Meriden Gravure Company.
Descriptions below have been corrected to reflect this information.</p>

<p>III.&nbsp; Prints not from <i><u>The Birds
and Trees of North America</u></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;Most of our prints had AOU numbers,
but two did not.&nbsp; Subsequent research shows that these two plates are not
part of <i><u>The Birds and Trees of North America</u></i>, although they are similar to the numbered prints in
the manner of printing and
coloring.&nbsp; Like the other prints, they are signed in block letters in the stone.&nbsp; One of
these prints, showing Blue Jays, was printed using collotype while the other
(titled <i>The Nightingale)</i>
was printed using offset lithography.&nbsp; My guess is that the Blue Jay printed circa 1930,
whereas <i>The Nightingale</i> is a later print, done after the completion of <i><u>The
Birds and Trees of North America</u></i>.&nbsp; <i>The Nightingale</i> is signed in
ink a manner similar to
the other hand-signed prints and includes a hand-lettered title (also in ink), which may have
been written by Brasher or a previous owner.</p>
<p><b>BLUE JAY.&nbsp; </b>This is an original hand-colored collotype.&nbsp; This
print lacks the AOU number, but is signed &quot;Rex Brasher&quot; (printed in
block letters) and includes Brasher's stylized logo (with initials and date of
original painting).&nbsp; Great image with good color, generally clean except
for a small amount of foxing in the upper margin; old price penciled into top
right corner.&nbsp; <b><font color="#CC0000">SOLD</font></b></p>

<p> <b> &quot;THE NIGHTINGALE.&quot;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;An original hand-colored offset
lithograph, signed in ink and with ink title printed in the bottom margin at
right.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Nightingale</i> is unique
among this lot of prints in that it portrays a bird in a purely artistic manner,
without showing the field marks that might help the viewer with
identification.&nbsp; Nightingales are not found in North America.&nbsp; This
bird, I believe, is a
mockingbird -- a bird known for singing at night especially when there is a

crease at the upper left corner, extremely pale foxing in the left margin, and a
miniscule tear along the right edge.&nbsp; <b><font color="#CC0000">SOLD</font></b></p>
