      Covering 1275 miles in 11 days, four of the five whooping cranes completed 
      their spring migration back to their summer home in Wisconsin's Necedah 
      National Wildlife Refuge. Led by dominant male #1, they soared in at 6:37 
      p.m. on Friday evening and landed at the pen where they were raised. Awe, 
      relief, and pure joy slowly replaced the initial exhilaration among the 
      WCEP partners who spread the good news by email and phone. What about the 
      fifth crane in the new Eastern flock? On April 22, trackers finally got 
      a visual sighting of Crane #7, foraging happily in the presence of a pair 
      of Sandhill cranes in a wetland area in south-central Wisconsin. As Heather 
      Ray of Operation Migration said, &quot;She is alive and well and simply 
      not ready to return home just yet.&quot;</P> 
      <P>Here's an instant replay of this historic first migration--which isn't quite over
			yet, at least for Crane #7:

			On Friday, April 19, the group of four whoopers seemed determined to get &quot;home,&quot;
			despite headwinds and cloud cover. They made two separate 1-hour flights with a lot
			of circling and wandering. Then it appeared the birds would overshoot and fly too
			far north, when all of a sudden they made a sharp left turn and honed in. At 6:37
			p.m. they landed right by their old pen and grass training strip. Tom Stehn was right
			when he predicted, &quot;They'll recognize the landscape where they were raised.&quot;

These are the very first whooping cranes to migrate over eastern North America in
			over 100 years! Once again, a few lucky people with their eyes on the skies may look
			up and see whoopers soaring above. After writing the crane reports for all these
			exciting months, Journey North science writer Jane Duden--that's me--wanted to welcome
			the birds home. I made the 3-hour drive from Minneapolis to Necedah NWR early Saturday
			morning, binoculars and high hopes in hand. Soon after arriving on the Refuge, I
			saw Richard Urbanek drive by in his tracking vehicle with the antenna on top. I chose
			a spot that felt &quot;lucky&quot; and settled down to wait and watch. Four hours
			later Richard drove by again, calling, &quot;They're here, I just don't know where!&quot;
			With the leaves just beginning to bud, I had a good view of the pen site where the
			whoopers made their homecoming the evening before. I saw bluebirds, warblers, ducks,
			sandhill cranes, geese and more during the wait, as Necedah NWR offers thousands
			of acres of refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Then,
			at 5:40 p.m. they came. I couldn't believe my eyes. High in the blue sky, a squadron
			of four gleaming white birds soared majestically, black wing-tips stark against the
			sky. They gracefully descended and landed right by their camouflaged pen! They stayed
			on the ground only two minutes on this glorious, breezy day. Then they rose again,
			taking off together, and began circling and soaring once more. They found a good
			thermal and kettled upwards in a wide circling pattern, higher and higher, until
			they were just specks in the sky. Then they vanished beyond the range of my binoculars,
			where I had &quot;held&quot; them for 10 breathtaking minutes. I would have returned
			to the refuge the next morning in hopes of another cherished sighting, but during
			the night a heavy spring snowfall began and continued through much of Sunday. The
			just-budding Refuge was blanketed in white, and visibility was poor. It was a good
			day for all the Refuge critters to hunker down and wait out the spring storm. Like
			them, I did the sensible thing and headed for home. Today is Earth Day, and the sight
			of those magnificent birds still makes my spirits soar. <BR>

Dear Journey North:<BR>
			Although I was unable to fly this week to look for whooping cranes due to the pilot
			being sick, I think most of the cranes have migrated. None were found April 17 on
			Matagorda Island, and I did not find any on the refuge on April 18. I estimate about
			100 whooping cranes have headed north in the last week. The weather lately has been
			ideal for migration, with some sun and strong southeast winds to push the birds north.<BR>
			<BR>
			I'm thinking there are 25 or fewer whooping cranes still here, but really my mind
			has been more on the following incident: On April 13, a dead whooping crane was found
			in Comanche County west of Waco, Texas. It was color-banded with a small blue band
			on the right leg and is the adult female that since 1991 has wintered at Mustang
			Lake in front of the observation tower at Aransas. Thus, she was the crane that most
			refuge visitors got to see when they visit Aransas. This 15-year-old female nested
			12 times in her life, hatched chicks in 8 of those years, but only brought chicks
			to Aransas three times. I'm hoping that two of those three chicks are still alive.
			If so, the female has passed her valuable genes on to the next generation, which
			is the goal of all biological life. You can see what a struggle it is for whooping
			cranes to build up their numbers since they are so slow at producing young.<BR>
			<BR>
			The death of this crane leaves the size of the Aransas-Wood Buffalo whooping crane
			flock at 173. She was found near a power line, but wildlife law enforcement officers
			did not find any marks on her. The cause of death will be determined by the National
			Wildlife Forensics Laboratory when they examine her. The landowner finding the dead
			crane saw a live whooping crane nearby, which would have been her mate. The widowed
			bird will continue on to Canada and will probably re-mate quickly. I am very saddened
			by the loss of this bird just because I have been watching her for 15 years, saying
			hello and goodbye as she moved across North America.<BR>
			<BR>
			As I write this on April 18, I am heartened by the thought of the five whooping cranes
			that followed the ultralight south last fall and are successfully in migration. All
			of them are right on course to return to the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge where
			they started their journey last fall. It is a very exciting time for all of us who
			have worked to teach whooping cranes a migration and restore a migratory population
			to the eastern United States.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4"><B>A <A NAME="Leg"></A>Leg to Stand On: Challenge Question #22 </B></FONT><BR>
			Have you ever thought about what it's like to stand on one leg in water all night?
			Once again, we're back to adaptations. YOU aren't adapted to that, but a whooper
			is. Special adaptations of their legs and feet make roosting in water a cinch for
			whooping cranes. <BR>
			<BR>

			</TABLE>
You recall that getting the whoopers to roost in water at night was an important
			challenge for the cranes' monitoring team in Florida. Whenever the water in the pond
			in their pen was too high, the cranes looked for a more comfortable place to roost.
			Tom Stehn helped us think about this, saying: &quot;I just walked over to our display
			specimens to measure whooping crane legs. Whooping crane legs are approximately 15-20
			inches long depending on body size. Females are generally smaller than males. Feathers
			cover the top 2-3 inches of the leg. As a general rule, whoopers don't like to use
			water over about 20 inches. I have observed whooping cranes feeding in water that
			covers part of the feathers on the upper part of their legs. We design roosting ponds
			in captivity to be between 14-18 inches deep. I think of the cranes using water the
			way I do when I'm hiking the marsh. I wear hip boots that go halfway between my knees
			and my waist. I really don't want to get into water that will go over the top of
			my boots. The cranes also are not looking for deep water. But I don't think they
			mind getting their feathers in the water. After all, they will spend hours probing
			with their head and neck through a foot of water into the mud to eat clams, and they
			really make the water spray in all directions when they vigorously flap their wings
			and splash to bathe.&quot;<BR>

			Last time we asked, &quot;Why do you think #7 took off on her own? If she stays alone,
			what's your prediction for her migration to Wisconsin? Why?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			You came up with an amazing list of possible answers that included:
			<UL>
				<LI>She was tired or injured or had an impaired body part.
				<LI>She might have been getting picked on.
				<LI>She was trying to be independent and more of a leader.
				<LI>She might not have liked being with the other birds.
				<LI>She might have been distracted by something that took her off course.
				<LI>She didn't think the other four cranes were fast enough.
				<LI>She wanted to prove that even though the others rejected her, she will make it.
			</UL>
			<P>&quot;She was the most submissive and had already dropped out of the group on
			the journey south between stops 5 and 6 and 11 and 12,&quot; points out Hannah from
			Madison Eagle School, &quot;so it didn't seem to me that it was a change in her personality
			to leave the other 4 cranes and fly by herself.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Thanks to everyone who responded to this question! Of course, we can only make educated
			guesses. Operation Migration's Heather Ray shared these thoughts with us: &quot;As
			for why #7 broke off, its hard to say. It could very well have been a dominance issue.
			She was more subservient than the others and tended to stick pretty much to herself
			for the most part during the winter. I don't believe it was an I'm-too-tired-to-continue
			matter because after veering off, she continued flying for another two hours! Maybe
			she felt she knew a better shortcut? Were we worried? Of course! it's always reassuring
			to know that there are other sets of watchful eyes during the evening roost times.
			A lone crane is a vulnerable crane and could become prey for a predator.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Tom Stehn said #7 could re-join the group in Wisconsin, but also may not want to.
			&quot;She left maybe because she was low in the social order and may prefer being
			a loner.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Like many of you, Kristin T. believes &quot;She'll get there, but a little later.
			And fifth grader Hannah spoke for us all when she wrote, &quot;However it turns out,
			I wish Crane #7 the best of luck!&quot; We'll keep you posted.<BR>

			&quot;According to the satellite data, how many miles did the cranes fly between

			<BR>
			The cranes flew approximately 111 miles (179 km) between the dates of April 10 and

<HR>
<A NAME="Tracking"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Tracking Team on Duty: Discussion of Challenge
			Question #18</B></FONT><BR>
			&quot;What do experts hope to learn by tracking the birds on their return north?
			Think of as many reasons as you can.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Your answers showed a variety of excellent thinking! Maddy from Eagle School said
			experts could find out where the most dangerous parts of the route are and the average
			mileage for the cranes. Karen at Columbus Elementary in Appleton, WI, summed up the
			big idea: it would help experts learn the habits of the whooping crane so they can
			help make sure the cranes survive to reproduce. Laurel (Madison's Eagle School) said
			the experts would want to learn how closely the cranes will follow the route they
			took south, and to learn more about the cranes' individual personalities. Sally thought
			they would need to know if a bird is injured, or not flying, or if it died and why.
			&quot;If they didn't track the whooping cranes they would have to rely on sightings
			that are not always accurate.&quot; Naomi believes it's important for experts to
			learn where some of the cranes' favorite resting spots are.<BR>
			<BR>
			Joe Duff adds this to your ideas: &quot;Tracking the cranes might help us design
			a more natural or accurate migration route in the fall for the next ultralight migration.
			If we can define a more natural route like the birds use in the wild, they are more
			apt to use it in the future. We hope they'll pick a natural site. If they stop at
			a site that's part of someone's property, we may decide we'll have to work with the
			landowners in order to protect that site for future migrations.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Lauren from Eagle School reminds us: &quot;All these reasons (and more!) make this
			a great learning experience for experts and even just for somebody who like cranes!&quot;<BR>

			Question #19</B></FONT><BR>
			We told you last time about a member of the Aransas flock with an injured wing. &quot;If
			you were biologist Tom Stehn, what might you do about the injured bird?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Some of you hope Tom will try to get close enough to assess the damage to the wing
			and perhaps get medical help for the bird. A few students thought the bird should
			be taken to where the others are migrating. (Remember, for the Aransas cranes, this
			is all the way to Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Canada's wilderness.) This
			is Tom Stehn's answer: <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;I haven't had time to investigate possibilities about the injured bird. We
			probably will let nature take its course, though I would prefer to catch the bird
			and have it examined. Unfortunately, catching a wild whooping crane is extremely
			difficult to do. The injured bird is a subadult, so is on no timetable to get to
			Canada. It could even conceivably spend the summer here and give the wing time to
			heal. The veterinarians I have talked to feel a wing that droops down sometimes will
			heal itself, given time. But I'm worried because it's been a couple months already
			and the wing doesn't look any better. But if the crane can fly weakly, it can survive
			all summer, and we'll have time to figure out what to do.&quot; Thanks, Tom!<BR>

We asked, &quot;How is a crane's huge trachea like a tuba?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Margaret from Eagle School in Madison nailed this question when she answered: The
			trachea is what allows the Whooping Crane to 'whoop.' The crane's trachea is quite
			long. It coils around, just like a tuba. When you blow into a tuba, it resonates
			the air that comes in, making sounds louder. The crane's long trachea works the same
			way. It lets the crane resonate sound.&quot; You can check this for yourself by visiting
