<u><i><b>

<p>Introduction</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Tipton Environmental International, Inc. wastewater treatment
system is a complete, factory built prefabricated system shipped to you, ready to be
placed into the owner&#146;s excavation site. Several of the sub-assemblies have been
shipped loose for field re-assembly where shipping height limitations would not permit
them to be attached. There are certain important details that must be checked by the
Owner&#146;s contractor prior to the plant arriving at the job site.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please review the following instructions carefully and study the
drawings of your wastewater treatment plant system to obtain a working knowledge of the
equipment you will receive. If you have any questions or need further information, please
do not hesitate to contact Tipton Environmental International, Inc.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should you notice any error, please contact us immediately. With proper
care and by following the suggested, simple instructions, much time and money can be
saved.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These suggestions are for your guidance: by carefully reading them
before you begin work.</p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scheduled Delivery Date</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will review our production schedule and keep you advised as to a
date.</p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Excavation</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A study of the shop drawings on your treatment system will permit you
to determine the size and depth of excavation needed for your installation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The size of the excavation should be at least two feet wider and longer
than the actual dimensions, allowing room for anchoring and paint touch-up prior to
backfilling. Place material far enough away from the excavation site to allow the trucks
and crane to operate safely from either side.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is best to back-fill up to a point above where the water level in
the plant will exist, and on all four sides to prevent freezing in climates where this
condition may exist.</p>
<u><i><b>

<p>Foundation</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A concrete foundation slab is necessary due to the construction of the
sewage treatment system. This slab is to be used as a tank base and in some cases, for
anchoring the vessel to prevent any flotation.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<img src="images/slab.jpg" alt="Concrete Slab Foundation" WIDTH="344" HEIGHT="234"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The customer&#146;s Project Engineer is responsible for the design and
construction of this slab. For typical designs and construction methods (based on use for
alignment purposes only), refer to the foundation slab detail drawings which are supplied.
These slabs have been designed for average soil conditions.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To determine which slab is needed, you must assume that the total
weight of the plant will act as a uniformly distributed load acting along the entire
length of the foundation pad.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is extremely important that the foundation slab be level; if not,
the system will not function properly. The slab must be level within tolerances of
1/2&quot; per each 10&#146; to 0&quot; of width and within 1/4&quot; per each
10&#146;-0&quot; of length. In instances where crowns in the slab or any other
non-standard workmanship exist, corrections must be made by resurfacing the slab, or by
placing a sand cushion on top of the slab to achieve full uniform bearing.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foundation slab should be checked by the Project Engineer before
the treatment system arrives at the job site. A foundation slab of adequate size and
weight should be supplied to equal the bearing soil pressures where flotation conditions
exist as in fluid soil. Sufficient anchor bolts and/or rods should be used to securely
anchor the tank to the foundation pad.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<img src="images/shipment.jpg" alt="Installation" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="243"></p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shipping </b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In almost every situation, shipment of the prefabricated plant is by
special lowboy trucks. When your plant is shipped through our shipping company, delivery
will be made directly to the job site unless otherwise specified. When the systems are
small enough, it can be delivered to the nearest dock instead of actual site. In these
cases, it will be the customer&#146;s responsibility to arrange for moving the system from
the dock to the site.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<img src="images/truck.jpg" alt="Plant being shipped by truck" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="229"></p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unloading</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary for the contractor to have all necessary equipment
available to unload and set the vessel on the foundation pad when the plant arrives.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The equipment necessary to unload the plant and place it on the
foundation pad must be furnished by the customer. Lifting lugs are supplied on the vessel
to ease handling. A crane of adequate size is usually the most simple method for unloading
the plant.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the plant is set, check that it is level and in the correct
position.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The package steel treatment system will be completely assembled and
shipped as one unit where shipping dimensional regulations permits. The equipment which is
packaged separately at the factory for field assembly, will be installed by the contractor
in the field.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check the inside of the aeration tank for pallets of equipment which
have been placed there for shipping. Remove these pallets with the crane. The blower motor
units and control panel are typical items which are shipped in the tank.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">&nbsp;<img src="images/crane.jpg" alt="Tank offloaded by crane" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="295"></p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unloading the Blower Motor Units.</b></i></u> The blower motor units
should be lifted by the crane onto the plant from inside the tank. The housing sits on
angle supports drilled to receive the rubber hose connection through the bottom of the
base of the blower. The blower discharge piping which extends from the bottom of the
blower housing must be aligned with the plant air supply line which is stubbed for
connection during assembly.</p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unloading miscellaneous Items.</b></i></u> Other loose items or
accessory cartons should be removed from the tank and placed in a safe place until
installation on the plant. The packing list should be checked to see if all equipment is
received before signing the shipping manifest. Please note that any shortage claims must
be made in writing.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><img src="images/ground_below.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="Below Ground Installation"></p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electrical Aspects of the Equipment</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Check data sheets and wiring diagrams, then advise the electrical
contractor and local power company of the necessary requirements for power. Special
precautions should be taken to ensure correct electrical requirements are supplied at the
job site.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A disconnect switch mounted preferably adjacent to the plant within
sight and wiring from this switch to the electrical control panel on the plant must be
furnished and installed abiding by the local Electrical Codes. The wire leads provided to
hook-up the blower motor units, spray pumps, and any other accessories must be connected
by the contractor to the control panel. All electrical installations and connections must
be made ready for inspection before the factory inspector arrives.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proper blower motor rotation must be maintained. Improper rotation will
cause damage to the blowers due to water being pumped back from the plant. </p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electrical Hook-up:</b></i></u> Final field hook-up must be done by the
electrical contractor. A general wiring diagram showing the details of this hook-up will
be found inside the door on the electrical control panel.</p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Miscellaneous Items</b></i></u></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Site Check: The excavation and foundation pad should be checked to
see that it is clear and free of any debris, water, or mud. The site should be clear of
piles of dirt around the plant area for easy access for trucks and safe crane clearance.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Unloading Facilities: Arrangements should be made for obtaining a
crane beforehand to ensure adequate time to prepare and adequate capacity to lift tank.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sewer connections are the owner&#146;s responsibility.</p>
<b><u><font SIZE="5">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">WARNING</font></u></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the system has been set and anchored, the drain plug must be
installed and the tank must be filled with water to keep it from floating because of its
buoyancy. Tipton Environmental International, Inc. assumes no responsibility for this
occurrence. </p>
