 style="border: 0px solid ; height: 20px; width: 20px;">Meccano is a
metal (some plastic parts) model construction system made
up of strips, plates, girders, wheels and gears, based on the
principles of mechanical engineering. It was invented by Frank Hornby a
clerk from Liverpool England. The system was first patented
in 1901 the sets were then sold under the name of Mechanics
made easy<span style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
but this soon was changed to the now famous name of Meccano. Click
thumb nail links on the left to see Meccano models, small to
huge and other Meccano related material.&nbsp; I have built many of the
models from an
original 1950s red and green No. 10 set. This particular set was made
in
Liverpool, England c.1954.&nbsp; This was the largest set the company
produced
between 1937-1979. The Meccano factory in Calais, France continued
producing the No. 10
set until 1992.&nbsp;Prior to 1937 much larger outfits, such as the "L"
set, had been produced but they became increasingly expensive and far
beyond the dreams of the average
boy these sets were&nbsp; for only a privileged few.&nbsp; From the
earliest days the owner of a set from 00 - 9 could purchase an
accessory set to the make their set the next in the range i.e. 2A would
convert set 2 into set 3 and so on.

its
heyday,&nbsp; the years between the 1914-18 and 1939-45 world wars, the
Meccano Company&nbsp; manufactured some of the
finest mass produced metal toys ever made in the U.K. These included:
Meccano,&nbsp; Aeroplane Constructor (a model of mine is shown on the
left),&nbsp; Motor Car Constructor,&nbsp; Hornby Trains,&nbsp; Hornby
Dublo,&nbsp; Dinky Toys and Dinky Builder.&nbsp; Other toys
manufactured by the company include: Kemex sets (chemistry sets),&nbsp;
Elektron (electrical)
sets,&nbsp; radio receiver kits,&nbsp; clockwork boats,&nbsp;
doll'shouses and
doll's furniture. In 1942 all production of toys ceased due to wartime
legislation and the
company went over to production of items for the war effort.&nbsp;

Hornby trains, Dinky builder and Hornby Dublo resumed shortly after the
end of the war
in 1945. Products were much as had been produced prior to the war
but the ranges were much
smaller and in very limited supplies, for the home market.&nbsp; The
range of Meccano parts
was reduced
from that of pre-war days, many of the more specialist parts such as
the digger bucket, and
train parts dropped. The advertisment on the right is from the April
1947 Meccano Magazine. It was not until 1954 that any new parts were
introduced,&nbsp; and plates changed to have slotted holes in the ends
(invaluable to make the holes line up when they were curved) plus
triangular flexible plates and a few other parts. Narrow strips were
introduced in
1962 along with the first plastic flexible plates. Narrow strips had
been first shown in 1920s but were not put into production for nearly
40
years. The early 1970s saw the introduction of Highway and Army
Multikits , these were sets with standard parts finished&nbsp; in
special colours.&nbsp; The sets enabled&nbsp; a range of vehicles to be
built and came with a ready made
metal cab. A crane set all in yellow was also introduced&nbsp; around
this
time.
<br>

<p><span class="bodyText"><span

 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><img
 src="images/bush.jpg" alt="[*]" border="0" height="20" width="20">&nbsp;</span></span>
A major&nbsp;
change came about in 1978 when the old set range, 0 - 10 that went
back to the 1930s, was abandoned. In its place a series of
five sets were introduced in dark blue and deep yellow, although the 9
and 10 set
was still available.&nbsp; These sets were an attempt to bring Meccano
up to date with a modern presentation
unfortunatly by then the writing was on the wall. All production of
Meccano ended at the famous Binns
Road factory, in 1979 when the company,&nbsp; by then,&nbsp; owned by
Airfix industries&nbsp;
ceased trading.

 style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"><img
 src="images/bush.jpg" alt="[*]" border="0" height="20" width="20"></span></span>One
of the great achievements of Frank Hornby was a monthly
publication&nbsp;
"Meccano Magazine" produced between 1916 and 1972. The front cover
shown obove is from December 1934. The canal lift looks like it was
built with&nbsp; Meccano and no doubt inspired many a model builder
as did so many topics in the magazine. Articles featured Meccano
construction, Hornby trains, and other products of the company plus
many other topics of interest to boys and adults of the time.
<br>
<img alt="Dinky Frobisher airliner" src="images/deHav.jpg"
 style="width: 285px; height: 102px;" align="right" hspace="8"
 vspace="8">
Many of the articles would be linked
to a new product from the company for instance, the latest
De Havilland airliner would be featured with perhaps a mention that it
was also the latest Dinky Toy. Commonwealth countries (then the Empire)
always featured strongly in articles, these countries were prime
destinations for exports from the Meccano Company. During the second
world war the magazine was reduced greatly in both content,
quality&nbsp; and size, from approximately A4 to a much smaller 210 mm
x 140 mm after the
second world war it remained at that size although with more content
than
during the war years. However it was not until late 1952 that real
improvements were made
with more pages, it was also printed on a much better
quality, semi gloss
paper. In 1961 the format size was increased but by then sales were in
a rapid
decline and so was the Meccano content. Its hey day was undoubtedly
from the late 1920s until 1939.This was era of the greatest
success for the Meccano company and its wide range of products.
The magazines are today are an excellentt source of historic
information and an invaluable aid to collectors of toys from those
years. <br>

of Meccano continues today in Calais France under the
ownership
of Nikko. Things have changed though, with an ever increasing amount of
&nbsp;plastic parts the sets are now often themed to build only one
model from the instructions supplied.&nbsp; In the years
following the closure of Binns Road&nbsp; many new and useful metal
and plastic parts have been&nbsp; introduced,&nbsp; all the new parts
remain compatible with the very earliest sets and use the same half
inch hole spacing and
5/32" BSW threads.&nbsp; The continuation of production in France has
ensured that Frank Hornby's original invention first patented in 1901
is now in to it's second century. <br>

 class="titleText"> How I became a Meccano enthusiast</span></big></big><br>
&nbsp;This slightly revised "Meccanography" was originally posted to
"Spanners mailing list" in January 1998.<br>
&nbsp;I was born at Gravesend,
Kent, England in January 1946. I cannot remember when I first
badgered my parents for a Meccano set but I must have been about 5
years old. When Christmas came around I was given a small construction
set but to my great disappointment it was not the No.1 Meccano set I
had longed for but an imitation! The
parts were tin and plated steel with the same hole spacing as Meccano
but the strips were crude, flimsy affairs compared to the glossy green
and red Meccano parts I had longed for. The rods and crank handle were
of smaller diameter than Meccano but the nuts and bolts are much
larger. I
still have most of this set but I have no idea who manufactured
it.&nbsp; I do remember it
having a very small instruction manual. If any one knows more about
this set I would love to hear from you. Most of the set is
shown in the picture
below.<img alt="first construction set" src="images/PreM.jpg"
 style="width: 228px; height: 338px;" align="left" hspace="10"
 vspace="10">
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I saved my pocket money&nbsp; to buy an
eclectic assortment of parts&nbsp; I remember buying&nbsp; two 15 hole
braced girders, &nbsp;a boiler and a 25 x 5 hole strip plate. (it made
a great deck for a bridge to carry Dinky Toys over my Hornby train
set). Gravesend enjoyed three Meccano dealers two,
W.D. Shaddick and Halfords stocked parts,&nbsp; Toy Stores the third
only sold sets.&nbsp; I must have gone on a lot about having a "real
Meccano"
set because when I was seven or eight I received for Christmas a second
hand pre war no.
7 set. It consisted of sets 5, 5A and 6A in colours I
had never seen before, I was in heaven. The parts were gold and blue
with red
wheels and pulleys! But no matter what joys! (I wish I had kept the
boxes) I still
have all the parts and the now very tatty much used manuals. I built
most
of the models in the manuals (except those involving the gross
distortion
of parts) and many of my own designs. I looked forward every month to
<q> Meccano Magazine</q> for new mechanisms and ideas . This had
to be ordered from the main local Meccano dealer "W. G. Shaddick" of
Windmill Street, Gravesend. The picture on the right is the front cover
from
that time,&nbsp; April 1957 showing "The Canadian" Trans Canadian train
in the Rockies.<img

I spent most of my childhood buying parts, sets, clockwork and electric
motors
and eventually had a No. 9 set plus loads of other parts. I bought sets
from school friends to boost my collection. Then in 1961 it was all put
away at the back of the wardrobe, when I enrolled at Art College. The
last model I can remember building was an attempt to replicate the
excavator shown on the cover of the gears set <q>A " manual</q>

 style="width: 300px; height: 239px;" align="left" hspace="12"
 vspace="12">Meccano
had always been my favourite toy and I was glad it was there packed
away to
rekindle my interest later in life.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the late 1970s I started
thinking about my old Meccano again when our two boys were playing with
Lego.&nbsp; This was at the time when the publishers,&nbsp;
New Cavendish started issuing the "Hornby Companion Series" books on
the history of products of the Meccano company. I bought a
copy of the <q>Meccano Super Models </q> and found a whole new
interest. &nbsp;
Through a business contact I found&nbsp; out where parts could
still&nbsp; be
purchased.&nbsp; It turned out to be M.W. Models of Henley-on-Thames. I
started
building the models in the book,&nbsp; at least those I had enough
parts for
and those&nbsp; I needed only to purchase a few &nbsp;additional spares
for. &nbsp;
(Hobby budgets being tight with two small boys to bring up.)&nbsp; One
of my
favourites was the Single cylinder horizontal steam engine always a
nice simple model to build. My two sons Daniel and Dominic also enjoyed
playing with my old sets and soon got hooked on Meccano too. As they
got older sets of their own were purchased and grew along with them
starting with the blue and yellow No. 2, No.4, Space 2000, Construction
and Army sets.
</p>
<p>In 1979 after the closure of Bins Road there was a scramble to buy
remaining stocks, spare parts became almost impossible to get. It
looked as
though it was the end of an era. Toy and model shops were searched for
sets
and spare parts for my sons (plus a few for me).&nbsp; All
was not lost for the enthusiast,&nbsp;&nbsp; through the efforts of
Geoff Wright in Henley-on-Thames parts were obtainable although often
in
short supply . Things slowly improved a flourishing second hand market
grew.
&nbsp;&nbsp; French Meccano continued in production in Calais and was
taken over by an enthusiast.&nbsp; For a while they produced the 1 - 10
set range
&nbsp; as <q>Enthusiasts Sets</q>&nbsp;just as they had been produced
at Binns
Road in the early 1970s.&nbsp; I continued to buy and collect parts and
build
models although rather spasmodically.&nbsp; In 1996&nbsp; I achieved a
lifelong&nbsp;
dream by buying an almost unused 1950&#8216;s red and green No.9 and 9A from
Geoff Wright of MW Models Henley <a href="#mwmodels">*</a>.

<p>I get the greatest pleasure
building from plans and improving on them. It's certainly fun to build
the large models I dreamed of as a child. Newer more innovative designs
also have their attractions for me and I do build models from my own
designs. I am certainly not in the upper league of
constructors nor do I own a vast collection of parts. I consider myself
to be a relaxed enthusiast and devoted Meccano fan. The
only problem for me is finding enough time to for my
hobby.&nbsp;
</p>
<br>
I am sure Frank Hornby would have embraced the idea of the
Internet and the web to&nbsp; promote the Meccano hobby&nbsp;
bringing&nbsp; together the world-wide community
of Meccano constructors and collectors.&nbsp; I am a member of the
"Spanner" Internet mailing list and&nbsp; the
International Society of Meccano men (ISM) .&nbsp; Through these
organisations I have found many new friends around the
world and received much helpful advice and,&nbsp; I hope occasionally
given some.

<p>The picture below is the original envelope and duplicated copy of
"Model of the month" instructions sent to me when I was age eleven in
August 1957. The model of the month was published in the Meccano
Magazine with brief instructions and photographs,&nbsp; fully&nbsp;
detailed
instructions could be obtained free of charge by writing to Meccano
Ltd. The August model of the month was a heavy crawler tractor. I don't
think I ever built the model because I had to bend two of my precious
25 x 5
hole strip plates for the tracks.
