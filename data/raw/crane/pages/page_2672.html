<p>It was well before dawn around ten years ago that Charlotte
and I were in a most unusual predicament.  We were among the more
than 2,500 statewide sandhill crane watchers listening for their
calls, observing and counting the large birds at our assigned
area on this prearranged day.  Struggling with binoculars around
our necks, spotting scope, clipboards, blankets, and folding
chairs in our hands and under our arms, we were walking at a
right angle away from the road toward our site along the edge of
a plowed field as fast as we possibly could.

<p>Suddenly Charlotte piped up with, "Hurry up before
someone sees us!"  Fortunately no cars passed by at that
early hour because surely the drivers would have been thoroughly
puzzled over our paraphernalia and mysterious
"mission."  Carrying lawn chairs through a field at 5AM?

<p>Few wild birds thrill us more than cranes, in this case the
greater sandhill Cranes.  Our Wisconsin cranes are part of the
Eastern Population of greater sandhill Cranes, estimated in 1995
to be about 35,000.

<p>In the case that you've not heard cranes, I hope you will
someday experience the excitement of their wild, far-reaching
voices.  Due to a windpipe that is about five feet long, with
nearly half of it looped within the keel of the breastbone,
somewhat like that of a French horn, its calls are clear, shrill,
and trumpet-like in quality.  The clarion-like song has somewhat
of a rattling or gargling quality and easily carries for a mile
or more.

<p>While flying, or during their courtship dances, they utter a
shrill staccato series of notes.  Charlotte and I had the
pleasure a few days ago, during a late afternoon hike, to
suddenly hear these crane notes far off in the distance.  We soon
realized that the bird was flying toward us as it suddenly came
into view.  Now we could watch the graceful flight of the crane
and listen to its continuous flight song as it passed within 100
yards of us.  We both agreed that it was one of the best lone
sandhill Crane shows we had ever seen and that it had really
"made our day."

<p>Two of the most awesome wildlife watching experiences we have
had in recent years involved cranes.  It was along the Platte
River in Nebraska that, from a blind, we experienced the
incredible sights and sounds of at least 20,000 lesser sandhill
cranes that were very close to where we were concealed.  More
recently we were treated to watching around 15,000 Greater
sandhill cranes arrive at their nighttime open-field roosting
area at the Jasper-Pulaski State Wildlife Area in northern
Indiana.

<p>Both of those mind-boggling adventures left us with the
indelible feeling that they rank among the greatest wildlife
spectacles on earth and that everyone, at least once during their
lifetime, should attempt to witness one or the other, fortunately
relatively easily accomplished.

<p>I recall in retrospect, and with great fondness, the small
groups of Wisconsin Rapids junior high students I took in
mid-April, a car-full at a time, to witness this
never-to-be-forgotten spectacle in south-central and
southwestern Wood County in the late 1950's.  The students'
first impression of the weird but wonderful music was that it
belonged somewhere in the middle of the jungle. I am convinced
that, were I able to talk with some of those students today,
they would clearly recall their exciting an memorable
introduction to the cranes.

<p>A new angle regarding the
sandhill cranes, one that concerns me very deeply, has entered
the picture.  For several years the issue of hunting sandhill
cranes in Wisconsin has remained under active consideration by
the Wisconsin Conservation Congress.  This is a group of
citizens, primarily those who hunt and fish, that provides input
to the DNR on conservation issues concerning wildlife and
wildlife management.

<p>The resolution, one of many, to be voted upon by the attendees
at the meeting this year, reads in part: "Since there is an
abundance of sandhill cranes in Wisconsin and they are becoming a
farm nuisance, many farmers and hunters feel we should have a
limited hunt for these native Wisconsin birds."  All
meetings of this group throughout the state will be held on
Monday, April 12, beginning at 7 p.m. in each county.  Check your
newspaper for the location of your county's meeting.

<p>In my opinion it is highly doubtful that a limited hunting
season on these birds, with a bag limit of one per year, will
have even so much as a noticeable affect on decreasing the
damage to especially fields of corn and potatoes.  It is true
that the cranes have expanded their range and density in the
state during the past 20 or so years.  Fortunately the world
renowned International Crane Foundation of Baraboo, WI has done
extensive research on the cranes and their habits.  One of their
findings is tha around 55% of the sandhills in the state are
found in eight counties including Waushara, Winnebago, Marquette
and Green Lake.

<p>Insecticides have been perfected with which farmers can treat
their corn seeds, thereby preventing cranes from eating the newly
planted corn.  I am definitely in favor of compensating the
farmers for crane damage to their crops and also strongly endorse
the best of cooperation between all parties through open and
thorough public discussion.  Above all I would like to see the
greatest respect given to the International Crane Foundation and
to their many years of crane research.  No one knows more about the
management of cranes than they do – worldwide!

<p>The potential crane damage to crops varies considerably
throughout North America.  Controls are definitely needed in some
areas.  My strong belief is that Wisconsin is not nearly ready to
require population management of these majestic birds by shooting
them.  I prefer live cranes to dead ones!
