<td>Washington's newly-dubbed "East End," long a neglected segment of Pierre
L'Enfant's original city plan, is experiencing a renaissance in development
activity as business and government expands into this area west of the
U.S. Capitol and east of the old downtown.
<p>Encompassing approximately twenty- five square blocks, the area, which
includes Judiciary Square as well as the city's oldest commercial district
originally centered on Seventh Street and the fringes of Chinatown, has
lured an international cast of real estate, architecture, and construction
professionals who are making their mark on this rapidly changing neighborhood.
In the past decade, more than ten new projects were initiated, with more
planned for the 1990s.</td>

<p>From earliest times, the Judiciary Square area has been a neighborhood
of change. In the early 1800s, it was dotted with shanties of Irish immigrants,
and farm animals roamed the often-flooded land. Later, better residential
and commercial structures, led by the construction of the old City Hall,
replaced the shanties. One of the seventeen public reservations originally
designated by L'Enfant, the area was intended to be the home of the federal
courts.&nbsp; Although the plan was never fully adopted, the former City
Hall became a courthouse, and other courthouses and city municipal projects
were built on and around the square in the twentieth century.
<p>The surrounding blocks experienced a similarly checkered history, barely
holding their own through the 1940s and 1950s, then losing ground amidst
the turmoil of the 1960s when retailers and other commercial establishments
accelerated their flight to the suburbs.
<p>New construction in the area began in the 1970s in response to a municipal
plan that surrounded Judiciary Square with office buildings intended for
government agencies and a few buildings of special note: the award-winning
operation control center of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority,
designed by Keyes, Lethbridge &amp; Condon on the block bounded by Fifth,
Sixth, F, and C streets, NW, and the ingeniously engineered U.S. Tax Court
by Victor Lundey on Third between D and E, NW.&nbsp; During recent years,
however, commercial developers turned increasing attention to the neighborhood
as demand for "downtown" space increased.&nbsp; By then few large sites
were available in the established section of downtown, and prices were
prohibitive, causing the development community to move east.
<p>The area is linked by several Metro stations with the central business
district, Capitol Hill, and the suburbs, an important factor in revitalization.
A project currently underway that takes advantage of Metro is One Judiciary
Square, developed by the Peter N.G. Schwartz Companies, which occupies
the city block bounded by Third, Fourth, D, and E, NW, and is set directly
over the Judiciary Square Station

<td>With increased accessibility to a sizeable work force, a mix of public
and private interests continue to comprise the new projects in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
Government agencies, trade associations, and other groups who need to be
close to Capitol Hill will be primary tenants.&nbsp; Private organizations,
like the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), have also joined
the eastward movement.
<p>"The continued demand for downtown office space, combined with a shortage
of suit-able sites between Massachusetts and Pennsylvania avenues, has
forced developers to consider what had been secondary sites," said architect
George Hartman of Hartman-Cox, the Washington, DC, firm that designed Trammell
Crow Company's impressive Market Square on Pennsylvania Avenue as well
as Sears House at Seventh and Pennsylvania, NW, and Gallery Row at Seventh
and D, NW.</td>

<p>The southern edge of the area includes distinctly different buildings.&nbsp;
The immense Frances Perkins United States Department of Labor headquarters,
completed in early 1975 is at 200 Constitution Avenue, NW. West of Labor
are two of Pennsylvania Avenue's most striking new buildings, the Canadian
Chancery, at Sixth and Pennsylvania, NW, and Market Square, centered at
Eighth and Pennsylvania, NW. Market Square, with its imposing columns and
grand proportions, offers a blend of office, retail, and residential space
in classical monumental form, while the award-winning Canadian Chancery
sets the pace for an enlightened age of government buildings with its imaginative
use of design, forging links between the old and new.
<p>"I was particularly intrigued with the vistas up the Fourth Street corridor
of John Marshall Park to the old City Hall," said Arthur Erickson, the
Canadian architect who designed his native country's Chancery. "All of
the judiciary buildings seemed to face this important space in a fitting
way.... I do think our building fills the gap well, enlivens as well as
clearly articulates the corridor."
<p>Architects who have designed buildings in the area looked to adjoining
landmarks for inspiration. For example, architect Arthur May of New York
City's Kohn Pederson Fox took cues from the old Patent Office Building
(Portrait Gallery) and NBM's own Pension Building in designing the dramatically
neo-classical facade of the AARP headquarters under construction at Sixth
and E, NW.
<p>The Lansburgh, at Seventh and D, NW, developed by The Gunwyn Company
and de-signed by Graham Gund architects, both of Boston, is unique not
only for its design, which relies more upon the turn-of-the-century aura
of the bordering residential and commercial neighborhoods than the monuments
of Pennsylvania Avenue, but also for its proposed function&nbsp; Located
at the center of what developers are calling the "Pennsylvania Quarter,"
it does not include any commercial office space, but instead combines under
one roof 381 apartments, 36,000 square feet of retail space and an arts
theatre: an important step in bringing residents into the mainly nine-to-five
neighborhood.
<p>Residential development, deemed by many real estate professionals to
be one of the most difficult aspects of revitalization, is necessary for
truly bringing a neighborhood to life. The high cost of land in the District,
combined with the abundance of residential amenities in suburban areas,
has traditionally sent urban professionals home to the suburbs at night.
The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation and the city have encouraged
developers such as Gunwyn, Trammell Crow, and others to incorporate housing
into their developments in an effort to turn that tide. Retail establishments,
art galleries, and restaurants already in the area are expected to expand
their services to meet the needs of residents.
<p>Development spurs other changes as well. The increased number of offices,
residences, and shops will create more traffic.&nbsp; However, experts
agree that the availability of public transportation and access to several
roadways will keep the area from having major traffic problems.
<p>Successful urban revitalization needs available land, careful planning,
outstanding design, and technical expertise. The past decade has been one
of major changes for the Judiciary Square area, with equally important
changes promised for the future.
