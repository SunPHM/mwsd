          only package that can be purchased and downloaded immediately. I really 
          think some of the other companies should do this. Many people have cable 
          and DSL and it is common for game demos now to be 80-100mb. Why not 
          give people the satisfaction of ordering right online and not have to 
          wait for a CD. For $40, I decided to give this product a try. I'll give 
          it a 6/10. It is not bad and it works, but it is a lot of work and still 
          very buggy. I consider it almost &quot;beta&quot; feeling. I was able 
          to enter my parameters but found it frustrating and confusing to use. 
          It just did not feel polished. It does work. It does have a money back

          is around $5,500 and is stated by Ford to have 385HP with headers and 
          a 780cfm Holley (not 750). It has 377 ft/lb of Torque at 4500 rpm. It 
          is 9:1 and uses cam M-6250-A332 which has valve lift of .520 on intake

          Jegs sell a 030 040 and 060 over bore piston. Here is what the engine

          &quot;Big Daddies&quot; of power seem to be Cam, Heads and Compression. 
          Each of them can cause a 50HP swing in HP and 30-40 ft/lbs jump in torque. 
          I used to think that heads were the most important aspect of an engine. 
          Lately I have been leaning back toward cams since they allow you to 
          choose where and when and how you want your power. Carb, intake and 
          exhaust are in the middle of the pack and have a lesser effect on the 
          performance and can grab 25HP at the high end. Over boring does very 
          little and is more about freshening up an old cylinder surface.</font></font></font></font></P>

          over today to see if the package arrived but have not heard back. I 
          think once they have all the components, the engine would be done within 
          3 days. Then it gets delivered to HOC for the install and 2 hour break 
          in procedure. I am hoping to have the red beast back by the end of February.</font></font></font></font></P>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Did I make the right choice? 
          Hee hee haa. I am not so sure now. I think it will all work out fine 
          in the wash. I wanted a high revving engine that traded some torque 
          for HP and this is what 2 crane techs recommended. With that comp cam, 
          the trade off seems minimal, but it also has lower powerbands. After 
          speaking with Richard Hudgins and Gordon Levy, they both voiced similar 
          ideas on derivability of racecars with low and high torque bands. Most 
          cobras, or race cars in general, have gobs of torque, more than can 
          be used. Since torque and HP are usually a trade off, many will sacrifice 
          some torque for HP since a) you already have more torque than you can 
          apply to the road b) the car may be easier to drive fast c) HP is top 
          speed on long course. Here is a quote from <a href="http://www.levyracing.com/">Gordon 
          Levy</a> off <a href="http://www.clubcobra.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=13667&highlight=cup">ClubCobra</a>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">&quot;Many 
          are destroking engines to get higher hp, lower torque, and higher revving 
          engines. A lower torque engine is much easier to drive quickly on a 
          road coarse than a high torque engine.&quot;</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not so sure I would 
          call it de-stroking, but I do think long rod to stroke ratio, high revving 
          engines are a good match for road racing. I want to thank Gordon and 
          Richard for sharing their experiences and information on the cobra chat
