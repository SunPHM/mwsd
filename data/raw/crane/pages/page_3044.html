<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By YVONNE PASKE</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>ANGOLA - Cranes can take
flight, lifting themselves above the cares and woes of everyday experience.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>They're an appropriate symbol
for hope and renewal. Now 1,000 of them, each carrying a wish for restored
health for a local student, have lit on the shelves, tables and display
cases in Carnegie Library.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The cranes were helped into
place by Kathy Aldrich, a seventh-grade geography teacher at Angola Middle
School, and her student, Lindsey Junk, in the culmination of a project
to show mass support for Junk and her sister, Arica, who underwent two
brain surgeries during the past month.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Angola High School sophomore
endured a nine-hour procedure during her second surgery in Indianapolis.
"I had Lindsey in two classes all year," Aldrich said. "I told the students,
'The family could use this wish for good health.' So I challenged them,
'Can we fold these 1,000 cranes for Arica before we finish school?'"</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Aldrich employed origami,
the Japanese art of paper folding, and a children's story, "Sadako and
the Thousand Paper Cranes," to inspire the children to support the Junk
family and to enhance an end-of-the-year study of Asia for geography.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In the story the protagonist,
injured in one of the World War II atomic bomb attacks in Japan, developed
leukemia. During her hospital stay, she determined that if she could complete
folding 1,000 origami cranes, she would be restored to good health.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Although the child in the
story died before completing the project, students in the four geography
classes decided Sadako's attempt should be completed in dedication to Arica's
recovery.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Soon, a collection bin in
Aldrich's classroom began to fill up with cranes folded of every paper
type imaginable - construction paper, wrapping paper, paper towels, bubble
gum and chocolate bar wrappers and magazine pages.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Students used two patterns,
one a traditional crane requiring about 30 steps, and a simple one of about
six folds. "So we had the gifted and the learning disabled folders in the
same class. And those who knew how showed the more complicated crane to
kids who didn't," Aldrich said. "The kids just kept saying, 'Have we made
1,000 yet?'"</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Students took time from geography
class and homeroom to complete their cranes, ranging in size from a quarter-inch
to one boasting a two-foot wing span.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The cranes will keep their
perches in the library for the next month. "It took Lindsey and me three
hours to hang them all yesterday," Aldrich said. "Lindsey's mother brought
Arica at the end so she could see the cranes. They just stood there and
looked and looked.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>"My kids realized that not
everybody's as fortunate as they are, and sometimes things happen. Lindsey's
a sweetheart. A lot of people know her, and they thought this would be
a great way to show support. It's a positive way to end the year," she
said.</font></font>
