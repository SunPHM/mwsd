Fairview Principal Sue Nations said when they opened the box that arrived from their sister school in Japan, everyone in the office cried.
     <P>
"It was so touching," Nations said of a box full of origami paper cranes made by children from Fozoku Elementary School in Tokusima, Japan.
     <P>
The "cranes of peace" were in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist acts.
     <P>
"I would like to send you sympathy on tragic accident in New York," Principal Katsuo Murata wrote in his letter. Nations visited his school three months ago.

If any student at Fairview did not know the story behind the "cranes of peace," they certainly know it now, Jackie Methven, Fairview media coordinator, said. The "cranes of peace" hang as a mobile above the media center desk and Methven eagerly responds to each question of "What's that?"
     <P>
Here's how Methven explains it:
     <P>
"Cranes for Peace began as a project to collect paper cranes to be sent to Hiroshima for the 50th anniversary of the Aug. 6, 1945, bombing.
     <P>
"Ever since the story of Sadako Sasaki ­ a young girl who was 2 at the time of the bombing and 10 years later died of leukemia became widely known ­ people from around the world have sent origami cranes to the Children of the A-Bomb statue in the Hiroshima Peace Park as a symbol and wish for peace.
     <P>
"Sadako attempted to fold 1,000 cranes believing she would get well by doing so. According to Japanese legend, folding 1,000 cranes so pleases the gods that the folder is granted a wish. Sadako wished to get well.
     <P>
"Though she was only able to fold 644 cranes before she died, Sadako had a profound impact on her friends and classmates. They completed her thousand cranes and raised money from school children all over Japan to build a statue to honor Sadako and all the children affected by the bomb. 
     <P>
"Her story has become an inspiration for school children worldwide to fold cranes in a wish for peace.
     <P>
"Today, in Hiroshima's Peace Park, there is a statue of Sadako standing on top of a granite pedestal holding a golden crane in her outstretched arms. At its base a plaque reads: 
     <P>
    "This is our cry.
     <P>
    This is our prayer.
     <P>
    Peace in the world."     <P>
