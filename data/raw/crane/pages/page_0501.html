			The whooping crane migration is in full swing. On April 2nd, I found only 139 cranes
			on my aerial census flight. This means an estimated 42 whoopers have started the
			spring migration!<BR>
			<BR>
			About 23 cranes (five families and four pairs) started the migration sometime between
			March 26 and April 2. And then on April 5, Whooping Crane Tour Boat Captain Ted Appell
			watched 14 cranes start the migration from the south half of the Aransas refuge.
			Departures occurred between 9:50 and 10:30 AM, and included families, pairs, and
			subadults. The Mustang Lake/Nyarling family that refuge visitors see from the refuge
			observation tower also departed that day.<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Cranes Head Home On South Winds</B><BR>
			Even with so many cranes leaving within a short time period, these cranes have staggered
			starting times and leave in small groups of 2 or 3. Sometimes, two such units will
			join forces so possibly 5 cranes, or occasionally a few more, may be flying together.
			The departure of a territorial pair often &quot;influences&quot; its neighbors to
			leave shortly afterwards. All kinds of vocalizations are going on as the cranes depart.
			I wish I knew what they were saying. We might think they are saying the equivalent
			of &quot;See you later. I'm off to Canada to nest&quot;, but in reality, the loud
			whoops are presumably more related to their territorial and dominance behaviors.</P>

			<P>I'm anxious to do my next census flight on April 09 to see how many birds departed
			in early April. Probably I'll fly over parts of the whooping crane range and find
			most of the birds still present on their territories. Other sections of marsh will
			have only a few cranes left and feel very empty. This will demonstrate just how individualistic
			the whoopers are.</P>

That is probably very fortunate since what would happen if they all flew together
			in one big flock and encountered a blizzard, or tornadoes, or got up to the nesting
			grounds too early and couldn't find food in the ponds still covered with ice? The
			fact that whooping cranes have staggered departures helps the species survive. But
			all the adult birds have to get to Canada in time to nest since the northern summer
			is so short. Thus, the whooping cranes that depart one or two weeks later than most
			will make a more rapid migration north and will nearly catch up with some of the
			birds that left first.<BR>
			<BR>
			Soon the telephone should be ringing with sighting reports of the whoopers as they
			make their 2,500-mile journey to the Northwest Territories of Canada.<BR>
			<BR>
			Until next time,<BR>

			For years, Mr. Wally Jobman of the USFWS Ecological Services Unit has organized a
			network of observers across the Great Plains who report whooping crane migration
			sightings to him. Again this spring, he will forward these to you. At the same time,
			he'll provide a brief weather summary, describing the past week's weather patterns
			as they relate to whooping crane migration. Here is his first field report, sent
			from his home town of Grand Island, Nebraska along the famous Platte River:<BR>

			Greetings from the Cornhusker State! Typical spring weather last week, warm one day
			and cold the next. Up to 10 inches of snow in north-central Nebraska on Tuesday (3/31).
			The entire whooping crane flyway in the USA appeared to be pretty wet.<BR>
			<BR>
			More recently, many sandhill cranes migrated from the Platte Valley, Nebraska, on
			April 4 and 6. Rain began during the evening of April 6, and continued through April
			8 in Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Sunshine may return on Friday, April 10
			and allow the migration to resume.<BR>
			<BR>
			Thus far during the spring migration eight sightings have been confirmed as follows:

			Last week, Tom Stehn reported on the continuing problem of crane deaths from power
			line collisions, and we challenged you to think of design changes to help make the
			power lines less harmful to wildlife. Making these design changes, however, can cause
			debate because they cost money and might cause power costs to increase. <BR>
			<BR>
			As you read Tom's comments below, take a look at the &quot;Cycling Through Controversy&quot;
			Lesson, which is available in the Teacher's Manual at pp. 65 or click below.</P>

			<P>But first, many thanks to Tim from Montana, who shared his suggestion based on
			the cranes he has seen flying in his family's rice fields. Tim said that &quot;I
			have observed cranes landing in rice fields when fog was so thick the cranes could
			hardly see me but once they did see me they were quick to leave. I have also heard
			cranes flying at overhead at night. It has occured to me the cranes need sound as
			well as sight when flying in adverse weather conditions. Powerlines need to emit
			some type of chimes or clanging noise to alert the birds of the impending object
			in their flight path. Fog horns alert humans to dangers I'm sure there is some sort
			of noise the cranes would alert to. My name is Tim I work at Polson Middle School,
			Polson,Mt.&quot;<BR>
			pmslib@cyberport.net (polson middle school library)<BR>
			<BR>
			Thanks also to Tom Stehn, who tells us what steps and devices have been used so far
			to these prevent power line collisions. &quot;The USFWS and Power/Utility companies
			have done a lot of research to address this issue of bird strikes and power lines.
			It is not just cranes - other birds can strike power lines and/or guy wires on tall
			radio communication towers, etc.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;The first step is not to allow new lines to be constructed near wetland areas
			where bird numbers are concentrated. Sometimes, based on environmental considerations,
			lines are re-routed to avoid areas of concern. Or perhaps a line can be placed underground
			to avoid the problem. I know at the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, the
			two ultralight cranes had to make two flights a day over a low power line. The refuge
			has requested, and the power company agreed, to bury the line as soon as all the
			cranes leave in spring migration so that no hazard will exist next winter.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;If a line exists and can't be buried (after all, putting lines underground
			is much more costly than above ground), researchers have found that markers can be
			placed on the lines to make them more visibile to birds. You see this around airports
			where red balls are placed on the lines to allow pilots to see the lines. This same
			technique works well for birds and reduces collisions by 50%. Materials have also
			been wrapped around the line in a candy cane striped pattern, and metal rectangular
			plates have been hung from lines too, but the balls seem to work the best.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Young first-year cranes seem more vulnerable to striking power lines compared
			to their parents. Perhaps that is because they are not as skilled a flyer when making
			a last-ditch effort to avoid a line they have seen too late, or perhaps they are
			not as skilled at recognizing lines, and probably just aren't paying as much attention
			to things around them.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;However, even if bird strikes are reduced by 50%, the continued construction
			of more utility lines in this country makes the bird strike problem grow every year.
			And that will continue as the human population continues to increase.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Are you willing to pay a few cents more every month on your utility bill to
			ensure lines are marked properly? I would love every power line in the whooping crane
			corridor to be placed underground, but unfortunately this would be too costly and
			not practical since the migration corridor is about 150 miles wide by 2,500 miles
			long. Thus, power lines continue to be the number one source of mortality for whooping
			cranes.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;This is a good example of a human-caused factor that helps make and keep a
			bird endangered. After all, man-caused changes in the landscape that affect wildlife
			habitats are what cause species to become endangered. In very few cases are species
			these days going extinct becase of natural selection that is not influenced by man.
			We as people are the culprits, and thus we have a responsibility to save species
			that are endangered.&quot;<BR>
