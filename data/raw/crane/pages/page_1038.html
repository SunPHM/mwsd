    </p>
	<p><b>Spring is here, and about time too.&nbsp; With the onset of SARS, 
    Toronto is the city nobody wants to visit.&nbsp; Television has the citizens 
    of Toronto confused with Darth Vader wannabes who wear masks and talk in 
    hushed tones.&nbsp; Yet, I have yet to see a single person on the streets 
    wearing a mask.&nbsp; Our mayor Mel (Lastman) continues to make a fool of 
    himself on television, trying to get people to once again spend money in 
    Toronto.&nbsp; I realize he means well, but his message does not seem to be 
    getting across to people.&nbsp; </b></p>
	<p><b>In the midst of this situation in decline, I have made it a point to 
    accelerate the frequency of my adventures around Toronto.&nbsp; I am not 
    scared of contacting SARS, and nor should anybody else.&nbsp; Infact when 
    SARS first made the news, I made it a point to visit Chinatown which 
    unfortunately was deserted.&nbsp; Eateries that normally had waiting lines 
    around the block to be seated had no patrons at all.&nbsp; Overall, a very 
    sad situation.</b></p>
	<p><b>This week I decided to show my support for Toronto, spend some money, 
    visit the Toronto Islands, and be crammed in a ferry with many people, and 
    according to some - unnecessarily exposing myself to SARS.&nbsp; Here is my 
    story.&nbsp; </b></p>
	<p>It never ceases to amaze me just how much Toronto has to offer in terms 
    of sightseeing.&nbsp; What makes it even better is that people are friendly, 
    the transit system is fantastic, and the city as a whole is very clean.&nbsp; 
    There is also a lot of greenery in Toronto, but unfortunately not near the 
    ferry docks where I waited to board the Thomas Renny for a trip to the 
    islands.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>I am learning to take effective pictures of trees and I looked all around 
    for one.&nbsp; This is the best I could do.&nbsp; While not organic, it is 
    somewhat of a concrete tree.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i1.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>Today there was only one ferry in operation, which meant I got a good 
    look at some of the other boats.&nbsp; There are five island ferries in 
    total, and they serve three islands - Centre Island, Wards Island, and 
    Hanlans Point.&nbsp; My initial destination was Centre Island from which I 
    could walk to any of the other islands.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>This was my view of one of the other ferries as the Thomas Renny departed 
    mainland Toronto.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i4.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>It is quite breathtaking to see Toronto's skyline from Lake Ontario.&nbsp; 
    The exclamation mark of the skyline is of course the CN Tower.&nbsp; In a 
    few of my pictures I didn't even realize the tower was in them till my 
    review session when I got back.&nbsp; The CN Tower is almost impossible to 
    leave out when taking pictures of Toronto.</p>
	<p>The area near the ferry docks is dotted with high-rise, lakeview 
    condominiums, as can be seen in this picture.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i6.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>As you get further away, the buildings begin to shrink, all except the CN 
    Tower, which still dominates.&nbsp; The skyline also begins to take shape 
    quite nicely, and the Skydome becomes visible at the base of the tower.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Of late there has been a lot of construction activity along the 
    harbourfront, with skyscrapers popping up every few months.&nbsp; You can 
    see the ever changing skyline in this picture, along with all the 
    construction cranes.&nbsp; This can't be a bad sign for the local economy.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i9.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>This next picture is a close-up of the CN Tower and Skydome.&nbsp; You 
    can also see just how small the other buildings are in comparison.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i11.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>The ferry ride from the mainland to Centre Island takes exactly 7 
    minutes.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to have a friend who works for the 
    ferries, and he was able to give me a special tour of the boat.&nbsp; I 
    actually stayed on the ferry for two trips as we chatted and took pictures 
    during his lunch break.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>I expected the ferry to be much more crowded that it was.&nbsp; You can 
    see just how many people were on the main deck of the ferry in this picture.&nbsp; 
    I think this fellow sitting at the other end of the boat was afraid of 
    contacting SARS from me.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i17.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>I was invited to go up top where the wheelhouse is.&nbsp; No way I can 
    imagine passing up this opportunity to get pictures of the top of the ferry, 
    and perhaps even the skyline.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Here is what the top of the Thomas Renny looks like.&nbsp; As you can 
    imagine, the public is not allowed up.&nbsp; You can see the one of the 
    wheelhouses in the background behind the funnel.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i22.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>The captain rotates wheelhouses depending on which direction he is 
    traveling.&nbsp; This is what the wheelhouse looks like when not 
    operational.&nbsp; Quite old fashioned if you ask me.&nbsp; On a previous 
    trip I was allowed to steer the boat.&nbsp; People should not complain about 
    numb steering in their cars until they have tried to drive one of these.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i23.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>After my visit up top, it was time to go into the bowels of the ship, the 
    engine room - earplugs mandatory.&nbsp; This is what it looked like, 
    climbing down.&nbsp; The stairs are quite &quot;thin&quot; and most people rotate 
    their bodies around to descend the stairs with their faces pointing towards 
    the steps.&nbsp; However the proper way to go down is to just walk quickly 
    down, almost sliding, while holding on to the railings.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i19jpg.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>This is what the inside of the engine room looks like.&nbsp; It is a 
    requirement to wear earplugs while inside, which makes it really interesting 
    to have conversations.&nbsp; Sign language and hand gestures are the way to 
    go.&nbsp; As you can see, there are two duplicate engines.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i26.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>It was now time to go back up on deck and disembark the ferry.&nbsp; A 
    whole day of adventure and photography awaited me, and I was eager to get 
    started.&nbsp; In the picture below, you can see where the ferry was headed 
    to dock.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i10.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>This is what it looked like when closer.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i14.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>And closer still, around the bend at the dock.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i16.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>On the other side I got a glimpse of what awaited me, trees and greenery.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i13.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Since there were not that many people on board, the exit process was 
    really quick.&nbsp; Usually it takes a good ten minutes to disembark when 
    crowded.&nbsp; I was finally free to go on my adventure, and what is the 
    first thing I take a picture of?&nbsp; Indeed, the ferry.&nbsp; You can see 
    it on the left in this picture, with the skyline as the background.&nbsp; 
    The water really was much cleaner than what you see here.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i27.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Finally I was able to come upon some greenery.&nbsp; The trees don't have 
    their leaves yet, but that makes for really pretty tree pictures.&nbsp; I 
    was somewhat happy that there weren't too many people on Centre Island today 
    because that allowed me to capture the scenery without human interference. </p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i28.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>This scene caught my eye because I am quite partial to weeping willows.&nbsp; 
    The nature quite nicely frames the city as well.&nbsp; This was one of the 
    early shots I took on Centre Island, and one of my favourites.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i29.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>More weeping willows.&nbsp; You can also see the main Centre Island 
    restaurant in the background.&nbsp; There are more pictures of that later 
    on.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i30.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>Centre Island is where Centreville, an amusement park is located.&nbsp; 
    There are all sorts of rides including a rollercoaster, train railroad, 
    paddle boats, cable cars, and other attractions like an animal farm.&nbsp; 
    Here you can see that even adults can enjoy riding a miniature train.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i31.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Another ride which involves driving an old car.&nbsp; You can also rent 
    bicycles, quadracycles, and canoes at the islands.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i32.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Close to the amusement park is the main restaurant.&nbsp; The food is 
    quite good and reasonably priced.&nbsp; They serve everything from finger 
    foods to sandwiches to full sit down meals.&nbsp; There are also pizza 
    parlours, hot dog stands, and ice cream vendors dotted around the islands.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i33.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Another view of the restaurant, which is located in quite a picturesque 
    area.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i35.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>There are lots of swans and ducks surrounding the amusement park and 
    restaurant.&nbsp; They were shy today, but that did not deter from the 
    beauty of the scenery.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i34.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>If you continue on from the amusement park and walk south, there is a 
    manicured garden.&nbsp; It is still too early to see anything in bloom, but 
    you can still see the hedges.&nbsp; The fountains were not active either, 
    but when in its full glory, the garden looks quite amazing.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i37.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>An &quot;artistic&quot; picture of a bench in the garden.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i36.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>If you continue south from the garden, there is a beach, change rooms and 
    lockers, and a bicycle rental shop.&nbsp; The beach is quite popular during 
    the summer.&nbsp; If you go further south there is a lookout point.&nbsp; 
    Not much to see really but the lake, still it is also quite popular.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>The beach looks like something in the Caribbean doesn't it? </p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i38.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>While at the lookout point taking a breather, this old bomber kept making 
    circles above the islands.&nbsp; What kind of bomber is this, and why did it 
    do what it did?&nbsp; E-mail me if you can shed some light on this.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/j68.jpg" width="451" height="391"></p>
	<p>A fishing boat from the lookout point.&nbsp; Today was a good day for 
    nice clear blue skies, which contrasted well with the water.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i61.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>The other side of the animal farm can be seen from here.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i66.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>If you walk east from the lookout point you first come up to Algonquin 
    Island, and then Wards Island.&nbsp; The next few pictures were taken en 
    route to Wards Island.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>I like the gold colour of the tree on the left.&nbsp; It was quite 
    breathtaking in person.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i40.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>More surreal trees.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i46.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>Algonquin Island is full of small houses, house boats, and sail boats.&nbsp; 
    Many people spend their summers here, enjoying the scenery and serenity, 
    while being within 10 minutes of the city. </p>
	<p>This is the view of Algonquin Island once you pass it.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="islands640/i44.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Yet another view of the Algonquin Island boats and houses.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i63.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>If big boats don't appeal to you, there is also a canoe rental place at 
    the Algonquin Island Bridge.&nbsp; Canoes seemed to be quite popular today.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i64.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>This is another view looking back after walking past Algonquin Island.</p>
	<p><img border="0" src="islands640/i65.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Soon after walking past Algonquin Island, there is a marina with lots of 
    spiffy boats.&nbsp; Here is a picture of what it looks like.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i42.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>Wards Island is 1.5km from Algonquin Island, but you should not hurry 
    your walk.&nbsp; I recommend that you stay as close to the inner shoreline 
    as possible because the scenery is stunning.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i45.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>This time of the year the trees look so surreal.&nbsp; The walk to Wards 
    Island is full of trees and greenery.&nbsp; You will pass the Fire Station, 
    the island club, the Shaw House, and a cafe.</p>
	<p>This is the cafe.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i52.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>I walked by what looked like houses for elves made out of logs.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i47.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>The reason to stay near the inner shoreline is because every once in a 
    while you come across a break in the foliage.&nbsp; This lets you get an 
    unobstructed view of the Toronto Skyline.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i48.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>I came across a truly surreal scene.&nbsp; Words cannot describe it, so 
    here is a picture instead.&nbsp; This would be the perfect spot to build a 
    house.&nbsp; It would also be the perfect spot to take night pictures of the 
    skyline.&nbsp; The picture here is less breathtaking due to its small size 
    and high compression.&nbsp; The full sized image is simply amazing.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/j49.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Here is another way of framing the shot.&nbsp; I cannot decide which I 
    like better.&nbsp; They both are stunning.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i51.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>As you continue on towards Wards Island, there are several places to dock 
    your boat.&nbsp; The contrasting foreground and background make for a good 
    scene in the next picture.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i53.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>We haven't seen a weeping willow in a while, so here is another one.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i62.jpg" width="450" height="600"></p>
	<p>You know that you are almost at Wards Island when you walk past the Canoe 
    Club.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i60.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>Finally I came upon Wards Island, which is where most of the island 
    residents live in quaint houses.&nbsp; They are all very friendly and 
    inviting towards tourists.&nbsp; There is also a ferry dock at Wards Island 
    but it did not seem to be in operation&nbsp; today.&nbsp; In order not to 
    invade the privacy of the local residents, I did not take any close-up 
    pictures of the houses.&nbsp; However, this is what Wards Island looks like 
    from the ferry docks.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/j59.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>From the dock you can also see the lakers docked near the Redpath Sugar 
    factory whish is a Toronto Landmark.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/j58.jpg" width="450" height="115"></p>
	<p>For the first time I was able to see the entire Toronto skyline 
    unobstructed.&nbsp; Here it is in all its glory.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/i54.jpg" width="450" height="177"></p>
	<p>I decided to save my visit to Hanlans Point for next time.&nbsp; I was 
    quite tired by this point and decided to return back to the mainland.</p>
	<p>This was the view as the ferry returned to the mainland to drop off her 
    existing passengers and take on a fresh batch.&nbsp; I was happy to return 
    home.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
    <img border="0" src="islands640/j69.jpg" width="450" height="338"></p>
	<p>I hope this adventure was enjoyable to you.&nbsp; Comments and 
    suggestions are always welcome.</p>

	<td valign=middle><h2><font color="#FFFFFF">ABOUT CENTRE ISLAND</font></h2>
	<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Centre Island is between Hanlan's 
    Point and Ward's Island. A carriage route along the peninsula connecting the 
    mainland to Gibraltar Point Lighthouse later evolved into Lake Shore Avenue, 
    the main east-west axis along Centre Island. By the late 1800's, many of 
    Toronto's wealthiest families built beautiful Victorian summer homes along 
    Lake Shore Avenue, east from Manitou Road to Ward's Island. </font>
	<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1884, construction of an Anglican 
    church, St. Andrew-by-the-Lake, was directed by Archbishop Sweatman. Four 
    years later Island Park was established on land previously occupied by the 
    Mead Hotel, and has continued to offer an impressive panoramic view of 
    downtown Toronto ever since. </font>
	<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana">Two distinctive bridges, still in 
    use today, were built to accommodate the increase in traffic along the 
    central north-south axis as the Centre Island Ferry, operated by the Toronto

	<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ward's Island, actually the east 
    section of the old peninsula, was named after the Ward family who first 
    settled here about 1830. David Ward, a local fisherman, raised seven 
    children. His son, William, built the landmark Ward's Hotel in 1882, just 
    south of the ferry docks at Channel Avenue. Originally the building had two 
    floors and a central, third story tower, but in 1922 the tower and upper 
    floor were removed after the structure deteriorated. The remaining building 
    operated as a grocery supply and ice-cream parlour until its demolition in 
    1966. The hotel, in addition to Wiman's Baths, built in 1881, created a 
    pleasant resort that attracted many visitors. - Source:&nbsp; City of

	<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Hanlan family was among the 
    first year-round inhabitants on Toronto Island, settling at Gibraltar Point 
    in 1862. After the islands were transferred from the federal government to 
    the City of Toronto in 1867, Plan D-141 divided the land into lots and 
    allowed cottages, amusement areas and resort hotels to be built. The west 
    side of the island, commonly known as West Point, rapidly became a resort 
    destination for the citizens of Toronto; the first summer cottage community 
    was found here. In 1878, a hotel was built by John Hanlan at the north-west 
    tip of the island and soon after the area became known as Hanlan's Point. 
    Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Hanlan, probably the most famous member of the family, earned 
    international recognition as a rower and held numerous world records. By the 
    1890's, three hotels and a summer recreation centre had been built. </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">In 1894, an ambitious lakefill 
    project by the Toronto Ferry Company added space for an amusement park that 
    included an exciting roller-coaster called the Big Scream. A baseball 
    stadium, built in 1909 and destroyed by fire one year later, was rebuilt to 
    hold 10,000 spectators. Babe Ruth, a baseball legend, hit his first 
    professional home run here. The role of Hanlan's Point as a centre of 
    recreation declined after the 1930's when the stadium was closed and the 
    Maple Leaf baseball team moved to a new facility at the foot of Bathurst 
    Street. The amusement park was demolished and in 1937 Toronto Island Airport 
    was constructed.&nbsp; - Source:&nbsp; City of Toronto Website.</font></td>
