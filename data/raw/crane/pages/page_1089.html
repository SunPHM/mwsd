      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kovai Finishing Systems has launched Texture Finish Spray 
        Gun with different sizes of nozzles for popcorn finish. The gun handle 
        is designed ergonomically to reduce fatigue of the operator. The hose 
        provided at the handle does not foul with the painter, making the useage 
        a pleasant experience. The gun has 5 sizes of nozzles for different popcorn 
        finishes. While this may be suitable for interior &amp; exteriors, the 
        same gun may be used for finishing of external walls, compound walls using 
        marble chips.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nozzle sizes of 10 mm and above are to be used for this purpose. In this case, marble chips of ‘0’ size. To improve adhesion, white cement and Fevicol are mixed together. This mixture is sprayed on the outside walls. Colours of marble chips can be chosen as per taste. This mixture can be sprayed on partially finished or even unfinished walls. The hassles of cement finishing, sanding and distempering of walls is saved. After spray, one has to follow the water treatment as specified by the white cement manufacturer. After 3 or 4 days use a wire brush and clean the surface slightly to expose the marble chips from the white cement. This leaves a glittering and beautiful finish for walls.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>ARCH Spray Gun</b></p>
