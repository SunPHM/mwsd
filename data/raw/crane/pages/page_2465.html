<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I><U><!--A HREF="sdotfamilyholidays"-->Holiday Traditions of the S-dot Family</U></I></FONT><BR><BR>
The December holiday season is quite festive here at the S-dot family lodge.  We have many family traditions that have been practiced since I was a wee nipper.  Usually the first thing to be done is decorate the house at the start of the season.  This means set up the plastic tree (my mom&#039;s allergic to pine needles) somewhere in the house where there&#039;s room, dig out the bags and bags and boxes of decorations, find places for them all around the house, dig out the box of tree lights and tree decorations and spend a day putting those on, and then play seasonal music occassionally.  Then, as the days get closer to the day of gift-giving (which fluctuates yearly depending on everyone&#039;s schedule), the family will spend quiet evenings together, watching TV or some holiday movie we have on video tape.  We always watch the same ones, so we know how they&#039;ll go, but it&#039;s fun nonetheless.  Usually we save our favorites for the day of gift-giving or the eve of the day of gift-giving.<BR><BR>

And then there&#039;s the baking.  My mother will bake cookies almost every other day.  She also makes her award-winning fruitcake.  What awards has it won&#63;  Why, the "I Say it&#039;s Tasty so DAMNIT, IT&#039;S TASTY!!" award!  You can read more about it below.  ANYWAY, there&#039;s all sorts of treats my mom makes, and we always have a ready supply of eggnog.<br><br>

As the big day draws near, the movies get better, and the gifts begin to pile up under the tree.  Anticipation also rises.  Finally, on the eve of gift-giving day, we watch a special movie.  This year we watched "A Christmas Story," the movie about a boy who only wants for Christmas a Red Rider Pump-Action Carbine Range-Model BB Rifle (I think I got that right), with a compass in the stock.  Very touching story, and completely unrelated to all that religion bologna.<BR><BR>

Then, it&#039;s off to bed to wait for the fat dude to drop off the rest of the presents.  Then, in the morning around 9:00, my mom mkes breakfast for the whole family, and after breakfast, we sit around the tree and open gifts, usually with holiday tunes playing in the background on the large stereo sound system.  Afterwards, it&#039;s time to play with said gifts while my mother goes back to the kitchen and slaves away on the most delicious dinner feast!  All the while there are snacks and punch for consumption, movies to play, and of course, South Park!  What&#039;s a gift-giving day without South Park and Mr. Hankey&#63;  Ah, the fun we have!<BR><BR>

Well, &#039;tis the season.  Happy Holidays, everyone!  This is Terence S-dot, signing off for now!</P>

So, let&#039;s say there&#039;s this guy.  Yeah.  Okay, and this guy, he&#039;s a decent fellow.  Honest, hard-working, loyal, all that good stuff.  Hmm...  And let&#039;s say, just for no reason at all, he&#039;s about 5&#039;10", long-ish dusty blonde hair, green eyes, sorta thin, narrow nose, and wears jeans and a t-shirt all the time.  So this fellow we&#039;ve created, he goes to school.  Let&#039;s say, just because we&#039;re benevolant, that he&#039;s in college.  And let&#039;s also say, just for the fun of it, that he&#039;s very smart and does generally well at things.  Alright, so, we&#039;ve got our character.  Now what&#63;  Well, let&#039;s say, for some unknown, twisted, unreasonable, and slightly perverse reason, he ends up in a parallel universe.  Why&#63;  I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t care, it&#039;s funnier this way.<BR><BR>

So our nameless hero is now in this new world, wondering where he is. (He&#039;s a hero now because he&#039;s in another world, from another world.  Whenever that happens to someone, they&#039;re immediately a hero.  Doesn&#039;t matter, they&#039;re a hero.)  And, let&#039;s say, there&#039;s...  This chick.  Yeah, this totally gorgeous woman comes along.  Doesn&#039;t matter what the setting really is, they could be on a volcano for all I care.  Hey, a volcano, that sounds like fun!  Okay, and so, yeah, that gorgeouse babe is now no longer coming along, she&#039;s hanging over the volcano, about to be dropped in.  Thus, our hero has a task!  Save the babe!<BR><BR>

So, yeah, okay, now there&#039;s got to be a fight scene before our hero can save the babe.  So, what should he fight&#63;  Ninjas&#63;  Yeah, ninjas!  Ninjas are sweet.  So there are like, maybe...  Ten ninjas.  Yeah, ten of them.  Gotta aim low, here.  So these ten ninjas who were about to drop the babe in the volcano see our hero wandering along to save the babe.  So the ninjas attack, since they&#039;re trying to drop the hot chick in the volcano.  Okay, so, the first ninja runs up to our hero and pulls out nunchucks.  Our hero blocks the nunchucks with his arms because, like in all ninja movies, blocking with the arms is always the way to go, and your arms never ever break.  But then, the nunchucks accidently wrap around his arm!  So he pulls them out of the ninjas hands and starts beating up the ninja, who doesn&#039;t block with his arms because they never do in the movies.  So that ninja is down.  The next one runs up and tries to take down our hero bare-handed.  So our hero beats him up, too.<BR><BR>

Okay, skipping ahead.  The ninjas have been beaten up, and one of them even fell into the volcano.  In fact, since one of them fell in, that ninja&#039;s explosive smoke screen ball-thingies exploded in the volcano and now the volcano is going to erupt, so our hero had better hurry up and save the woman.  So he does.  Since we didn&#039;t figure out how the woman was going to be dropped into the volcano, we can&#039;t say how he saves her.  Easy, huh&#63;  So they run down the side of the volcano, and it erupts.  But they&#039;re okay, because they make it down a mile-high volcano in less than three seconds.  Now they&#039;re running through a jungle or something.  Yeah, but...  All the trees are purple.  It&#039;s a parallel universe, remember&#63;  Yeah, so... oo!  The woman!  We never described her!<BR><BR>

Right, so, our hot babe, what does she look like&#63;  Tall, thin, long legs, long hair past her butt, big, blue eyes, and a figure that could kill.  Oh, and little to no clothing.  Hmm...  Something&#039;s missing.  Oh, right, she needs a tail and cat ears.  Don&#039;t give me that look, it was your idea!  You just don&#039;t realize it because it was sublimminally implated there by the picture at the top of this page.  Also, we need to look up sublimminally so we can spell it correctly next time.<BR><BR>

Anyway, so, our two characters make it to safety on a boat that will take them off the island.  Let&#039;s say...  Oh, I know, a cruise ship!  No need to explain how, not enough time.  So now they&#039;re on a cruise ship, but people are dying mysteriously, and things stolen.  It&#039;s murder mystery time!  Alright!  So, our hero and his new cat-girl friend attempt to solve the mysery.  Since there are too many guests to search, they look for clues at the scenes of the crimes.  Let&#039;s say there&#039;s been three murders to make it easy.<br><br>

So they go to the first place.  It&#039;s a kitchen.  The cat-girl ends up enthralled with all the hanging pots and pans.  Meanwhile our hero finds...  a shoelace!  If they can match the shoelace to someone&#039;s shoes, they&#039;ll have the murderer!  But of course, that&#039;ll only rule out half the people on the ship.  But wait!  He finds a microscope and discovers that the shoelace is from a uniform shoe used by only one company in the world.  The cruise ship company!  So it was a member of the crew!<BR><BR>

They go the next crime scene, a deluxe suite, and start looking.  The cat-girl, being a ditz most of the time since she&#039;s just there for looks to begin with, sees the suite has a private hot tub and gets in after taking off her little to nothing clothes.  Our hero faces a moral dilemma now.  Get in the hot tub with the gorgeous, naked cat-girl, or look for clues&#63;<BR><BR>

So twenty minutes later our hero gets out of the hot tub and starts looking for clues.  This time he finds....  a hair!  Using technology not available on the ship, he traces the gentic pattern and structure down to one name.  Now he knows who the murderer is.  Since going to the next crime scene isn&#039;t important anymore, and neither is solving the murder mystery, he and the cat-girl go to a party that night.  There they dance and have a good time, and eventually end up outside leaning on the railing and looking at the stars.<BR><BR>

That&#039;s when, out of nowhere, and without any possible reason, the murderer appears and tries to push our hero overboard.  Being that it&#039;s a huge cruise ship, though, our hero falls one story onto the next deck, and thus, survives the fall.  The cat-girl, on the other hand, suddenly becomes useful and kicks the crap out of the murderer, throwing the murderer overboard.  The murderer, for some inexplicable reason, falls in the water and dies.  The captain later investigates the crewperson&#039;s quarters and finds the stolen stuff: a tuna sandwhich, a towel, and a catnip toy.  At the end of the trip, all the items are returned safely to their owners&#039; families.  All except the catnip toy, which has mysteriously dissappeared again.  Everyone eyes the cat-girl, who sheepishly pulls it out of her new blouse.  Since it&#039;s the end of the story, she doesn&#039;t need to be wearing little or nothing.  Everyone forgives her with big smiles and laughs.  The end.<BR><BR>

After the credits, our hero and the cat-girl decide to move in together at the cat-girl&#039;s apartment.  But, out of some strange twist of fate, and a craving for apple pie, our hero ends up back in his own world.  All he gets to bring back with him is the knowledge he shagged the hot cat-girl.</P>

My Mom makes the awesomest fruitcake.  Seriously.  Like, totally.  It&#039;s just incredibly awesome.  It&#039;s soft, moist, fruity, and delicious.  And if you attach any connotative meanings to that beyond yumminess and food, I&#039;ll seriously knock your block off.  Do you know why there are so many jokes about bad fruitcakes that are hard as stone&#63;  Because it&#039;s a joke about people who don&#039;t know how to make fruitcake.  My Mom&#039;s fruitcake is totally cool.  It&#039;s loaded with those candied cherries, pinapple chunks, raisins, walnuts, almonds, and pecans.  Dude, seriously, her fruitcake is the best.<BR><BR>

Anyway, been hangin&#039; out around the house and trying to do things.  Mostly sleeping, though.  I read the coolest thing about guys and girls, and I feel very strongly that you should read it.  The link is here: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/vt2/g_hols/Niceguy" target="_new">http://www.angelfire.com/vt2/g_hols/Niceguy</a> .  It&#039;s all about nice guys, by Garrett Hols.  I am a nice guy, and through personal experience, I have seen this man&#039;s words ring very true.  Please read, all of you who come to this site.  As you can see to the left, I have posted this link permanently.<BR><BR>

Anyhoo, more stuff.  Well, not really.  Just putzed about the house.  Read a little.  Napped a little.  Got dragged out of bed early in the morning to monitor an incoming fax while my Mom did something else.  Yeesh.  Later I tried to do some work, but I kept falling asleep in my chair, that I just gave up and laid down again, not to wake up until 4:00.  I missed lunch because of that, so I was hungry.  Fortunately dinner was ready an hour later.  Then I got dragged into watching TV with the family.  So, now I&#039;m off to try and find something to do to keep myself from getting bored and trying marijuana.  Uhm, drugs are bad, m&#039;kay&#63;  Don&#039;t do drugs.  Too much South Park will do that to you.<BR><BR>

Took a quiz.  Yay.  Been pretty bored here.  I&#039;m such a recluse.  I sit in my house all day and do things, but I never go out.  Oh, sure, I go outside once in awhile to let a cat out or in, but I don&#039;t ever leave the property.  Ugh.  I both hate and love vacation breaks.  I just don&#039;t feel like doing anythingm, yet I&#039;d love to be invited to do something.  Problem is, I live so far from all my friends except for one (who happens to my best fridnd since 6th grade, so that works out well most of the time, heh).  Another friend of mine might be having a party in a couple weeks, so that&#039;s at least some good news.  He recently got all the episodes of Gundam X on DVD, so that ought to be entertaining, heh.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><I><U><!--A HREF="decdepression"-->December:  Joy or Depression.  Choose your weapon.</U></I></FONT><BR><BR>
So, alas, I am brought back to posting.  Why&#63;  Well, I&#039;m done with classes for the Fall semester, and I&#039;m both bored and depressed.  Yes, depressed.  Yes, I must repeat myself.  That&#039;s how depressed I am, I&#039;m repeating myself.  That depressed.  Well, no, I&#039;mm just being overly dramatic.  I personally have nothing to be depressed about.  I&#039;m just depressed because my friends are depressed.  Good friends, close friends, and especially my closest female friend.  So when they&#039;re depressed, I&#039;m depressed.  December is also a depressing month, ever notice that&#63;  Aside from all the joy and happiness, there&#039;s a lot of underlying depressing going around.  Icky.  So, either you&#039;re really happy this month or you&#039;re really depressed.  To be honest, I&#039;m both.  To my family, I&#039;m happy as a clam.  I&#039;m done with classes, done with finals, getting nice presents under the tree, and have a lot of time now to relax.  To my friends, I&#039;m a little depressed.  A friend of mine might lose there home, another has lost their will, and another has lost a close relative.  I&#039;m often brought back to remembering my ex girlfriend, which also brings pain, and so I get depressed.  But what do I do&#63;  How can I tell these people "it&#039;ll all be okay"&#63;  My ex was probably one of the most depressing people you&#039;d ever meet.  I refuse to go into that here, though, so ask me if you feel so inclined for an ego boost.  She was often one to quote that when people say "I&#039;m sorry," they really mean "I&#039;m glad it&#039;s not me."  Well, you know what, I do care.  Unlike a lot of people in this world, I do care about how my friends are feeling.  It hurts me to see a friend in need, and it hurts me even more when there&#039;s absolutely nothing I can do.  There&#039;s a lot of injustice in this world, and a lot of blind hearts.  I find myself in a constant internal struggle of what I should do and what I could do, and what I really shouldn&#039;t think of.  I think so much about the ways things could be.  Even the bad.  That&#039;s probably why I never really write any of my actual personal thoughts down here, because it&#039;s just a huge jumble of criss-crossing views and points and incoherent thoughts with too much emotion behind them.  I have to stop myself from saying something that I know to be true because it will hurt someone.  I have to stop myself from saying something that&#039;s totally uncalled for because, it&#039;s totally uncalled for.  I don&#039;t know why I get strange thoughts, or why I don&#039;t think with the same points of view every time.  I could say so much and be correct, but still be wrong.  And, I can also say things and be wrong, and know it.  Sometimes I wonder if I&#039;m the problem, if everything is just in my head and nobody is really as depressed as they seem.  But then, that&#039;s silliness.  Am I just a heart willing to ache for others pain&#63;  Am I drawn to those in need&#63;  How can I be, when I turn the channel on those starving kids in Africa all the time&#63;  Maybe I inadvertently saw one too many as a little kid.  It&#039;s strange, I have two very distinct belief groups up here in my head sometimes.  One for others, one for myself.  It&#039;s always argument and counter-argument up here.  "Feed the needy!" "At your own expense."  Sometimes I tell people there&#039;s a Good Terry, an Evil Terry, and a Terry in the middle.  It helps to explain my odd behavior at times.  Sometimes I&#039;ll be the sweetest angel, and do all sorts of nice things; other times, I&#039;ll be as rude and crude as a barbarian and think only of myself.  Then, most of the time (at least, I hope so) there&#039;s..just... me.  Like I&#039;m balanced on the edge of the knife, spinning plates on my head and dancing the Macarena.  That&#039;s when I resort to my usual stand-by:  "I don&#039;t know."  How can I when I have two opposing views in my head battling it out&#63;  Sure, it&#039;s easy for me to blame the stars.  Oh, I was born a Gemini, I <i>must</i> be two-faced!<BR><BR>

Anyway, that was a lot of gibberish and nonsense.  Enjoy!  On a lighter note, I found this really hysterical action-figure story, "Honduh", which you can find here: <a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~attse/honduh.htm"> http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~attse/honduh.htm</a>  It&#039;s all about what some guys will do to their already perfectly fine cars.  It&#039;s funny because it&#039;s true.  But the truth is sad.  Have fun!</P>

     Woo wee, what a length of time it has been!  Really sorry about the vacation, folks, but I really had a lot going on that just sort of crept up on me.  Y&#039;know, the usual rush at the end of the semester.  But, lucky you, I&#039;ve kept track of what I&#039;ve done, and compressed them down into several short blocks of text!<BR><BR>

     On top of that, now that it is December, time to tally the results of my monthly poll!  8% of you didn&#039;t realize (whether comically or otherwise) the cat-girl pictured at the top of this page and on the left was naked.  Go all one of you!  15% (2 votes) went to both "Bootiful!" and "Meow!"  Very positive results, I like those indeed!  However, 23% of you (3 people) said she needs work.  Well, can&#039;t please everyone.  However, a whoping 38% of you (5 people) said she was Shagadelic!  Well, if I can make five perverted men/women happy with a nekkid kitty girl, then I&#039;ve done my job!  Now for the post-poll diagnosis.  Thirteen people voted, which means, there was a 25% margin of error.  Less than last time!  I hope for December&#039;s poll I get a lot more voters!  (Also notice that you can select more than one answer this time, too!)<BR><BR>

     What an interesting, early day!  Had to slog through my usual early-morning on only two and a half hours of sleep.  The night before I couldn&#039;t sleep, so I got up, went to my computer, and started typing.  Mostly I was just typing to see what was on my mind, and the story of how I met my ex girlfriend appeared.  Well, I won&#039;t reproduce it here since I promised never to let any of the tripe that was my past relationship spoil my beautiful blog, but as I read it, I realized I made a lot of mistakes just in meeting her.  No, now mistakes like in ways to save outr relationship, but mistakes such as I shouldn&#039;t have had a relationship with her in the first place.  So anyway, at first I was depressed, but then I got over it after realizing my life has gotten a lot better without her.<BR><BR>

     So, I headed for bed.  Unfortunately, the birds didn&#039;t want me to sleep!  At around 2:00 in the morning, just as I layed down, there was this unusual creaking noise in my closet.  At first it sounded like the wire shelves in there were about to tear themselves out of the wall!  Then the sounds stopped...  And started up again over my head!  This was really freaky, trust me, because now it sounded like something was in the walls and scrambling around!  Then it stopped again...  And I heard this strange creaking noise on the roof, like someone was creeping around up there...  It moved slowly down the roof towards my side of the room... then suddenly ran back up the roof, scrambling and skittering as it went!  Later that day, my parents and I concluded it must have been some birds fighting on the roof.  Now, you&#039;re probably thinking of small little song birds or something.  No, the birds I&#039;m talking about are big ol&#039; three- to four-feet tall Sandhill Cranes!  Check out a picture of one <a href="http://www.ridgewoodcameraclub.org/Photo%20Gallery/Sandhill%20Crane%20.jpg" taregt="_new">here</a> to see what I mean.  Yes, these things get really big!  And, it&#039;s not uncommon for them to perch on the roofs of my neighborhood!  Just imagine, a huge bird lands on your roof...  Yeah, I&#039;d say that will make some strange noises!  But, also, it could have been some vultures as well, since we&#039;ve been getting a bunch of those around here lately.<BR><BR>

     Anyway, some great news!  I won an additional $400 scholarship for next semester from the Honors College!  This is totally awesome, since now I actually have spending money before I get my usual leftovers from my scholarship that covers my tuition!  I can actually buy my own books without getting a loan from my parents!  WOO-HOO!  Now, if only I can get more money like this...  The best part is, being in the Honors College has paid off!  I had to pay a fee of $60 to get in originally, like everyone else, but now I think they&#039;ve more than made up for it, by over $340!  Heh heh heh!<BR><BR>

     And to top off a great night, I saw a couple deer alongside the highway as I was driving home.  They were grazing under a street lamp, so it was pretty cool.  I figured if I kept driving along that country road I&#039;d eventually see something cool like that!<BR><BR>

     This was an unusual Sunday for me.  I got up at 11:40 AM, and realized, bum-bum-BUM!  In twenty minutes I was supposed to join a group of friends online to RP.  So, I lept up, and didn&#039;t even bother getting dressed or eating breakfast or anything silly like that, and just went straight online, dressing as I said hello to everyone.  Ah, the things you can do when no one can see you!  Well, since a new friend was joining the session, they had to be brought up to speed, during which time I sneaked out (after telling everyone) and got myself breakfast.  So, that was a lot of fun, and we Role-Played all day!  Finally dinner time came around and my mom made hot dogs and chilli, which, of course, resulted in Chilli Dogs!  Yummy!<BR><BR>

     Just a lazy saturday, today, so, I watched the <i>Star Wars, Episode II; Attack of the Clones</i> DVD from Blockbuster.  Didn&#039;t bother with the special features, though, just watched the movie.  It was OK, not the best one, but a nice movie on its own.  Yoda kicked major butt, so that was awesome to see, and I love all the robots and vehicles they had in there, too.  I like those big blue robots with the machine cannons on their wrists -- just the way they march and arm those things is fun!<BR><BR>

     Not much happened today.  Being the day after Thanksgiving, it was one of the busiest shopping days of the year.  So, naturally, I went out looking for a new pair of slacks!  I live about ten minutes from the mall, but it took me a bit longer to get there.  Parking was difficult, as I had to drive all the way around to the rear of the giant place to get something decent.  As it turned out, I was parked in front of Dillard&#039;s, so, I went in there and looked around for some pants.  Found a great deal on a couple pairs of machine-washable slacks!  That took maybe half an hour.  Since I was with my dad, he needed to get something for my mom at a candy store halfway down the mall, so we went there and back through the huge crowd, which only took another half an hour.  Then, it was the task of getting home.  There had already been a huge line of people wanting to leave the mall when we arrived, and it hadn&#039;t changed when we wanted to leave.  It took us another hour just to get out of the mall parking lot and on the road.  Then, it took us another twenty minutes to get home.  But, with the deals we got, it was worth it, and now, I have a pair of blue slacks and a pair of black slacks that are both very sharp!<BR><BR>

I like Thanksgiving.  A very handy holiday.  The perfect excuse for a four-day weekend!  And then, you sit around and eat until you have to readjust your belt!  I got up at 2:00PM today, got downstairs at 3:00, and didn&#039;t stop eating until 11:30!  When I got down, there were crackers and cheese and cream cheese spreads for snacking on, as well as home-made wassail (ginger ale, cranberry juice, and orange sherbet).  Later on, my mom brought out the cranberry bread, loaded with three-times the cranberries than the directions had said.  My sister&#039;s boyfriend came over, and we all watched the last three episodes of South Park which we had recorded.  Yes, what&#039;s a Thanksgiving without South Park&#63;  Just as we finished the last episode, dinner was ready!  And boy oh boy, what a feast it was!  Delicious turkey; fresh, hot stuffing; canned cranberry sauce, both with and without the berries; Betty Crocker mashed potatoes (the kind with the chives and butter baked in); and green bean casserole!<BR><BR>

Afterwards, the family went back to watching TV, including the end of the Washington Redskins vs. Dallas Cowboyws football game (Cowboys won 27-20).  During commercial breaks, I periodically went back to the kitchen for something to nibble on, heh heh.  And, all was good with the world.<BR><BR>

Today just went very well.  I had a pizza party in both classes!  I totally pigged-out in Satistics, and then got some really good news.  I don&#039;t have to take the final exam!  The proff. decided to make it optional, but if I decided to take the final, I&#039;d be stuck with it no matter how I did.  The other option was sticking with what we had.  He gave us all slips of paper with our current grades, and a spot where we would make out decision.  I have an &#039;A&#039;, so, as you can imagine, I&#039;m keeping my grade and skipping the final!  Then, in Statics, I had my group presentation of the project we&#039;ve been working on.  We were the best group there, oh yeah!  We knew all what we were talking about, and even took ten minutes like the proff. <i>wanted</i> the groups to!  Some groups could barely make it through two minutes!  Oh, and I ate some Papa John&#039;s chicken, heh, since I had filled up on pizza in Statistics.<BR><BR>

Here I was, sitting on a great traffic story, and I completely forgot about it!!  This was something that just really made my day.  I&#039;m getting out of the toll plaza on my way to class, and I see this hotdogger just tear out of the lane next to me, burning rubber and whizzing past everyone else on the road.  He was one of these Honda Civic drivers who gussie-up their car to make it look cool and accelerate fast.  I&#039;ve noticed a lot of teens who drive Civics do, and there&#039;s even been a commercial on TV about it advertising Honda Civics with gangsta rap.  I didn&#039;t think much about the man at the time, since he didn&#039;t effect me too much, but all the same I was still calling him a dumb-butt in my mind.  So I&#039;m driving down the road, and by now he&#039;s way off in the distance and beyond my range of visibility.  About fifteen minutes later and fifteen miles down the road, I see a Highway Patrol car off to the side of the road with its lights flashing.  The traffic officer had pulled over an offending vehicle.  Guess who&#63;  Mr. Need For Speed!!  I almost cheered as I drove past.  It brought back to mind that same commercial I saw:  "Civic Nation.  Represent."  Yeah, he was representin&#039; all right!<BR><BR>

I apologize for not posting on here for quite a bit of time, but I do appreciate everyone’s comments (even Dan’s little “Harry Pothead” joke...).  I think I mentioned all the exams I was taking last week, or I did to a few close friends, so I won&#039;t go over them here.  (Ooo, on a totally unrelated note, the keyboard at the lab computer I&#039;m on finally works again!)  I have gone to school every day for the past seven days; eight including today.  I will also go tomorrow and Wednesday, which means I will have gone to school for ten straight days.  Ugh.  I&#039;m going to try and cover at least some of the days in short paragraphs so you&#039;re all caught up with me.<BR><BR>

Friday after class, I went with Super Dave and a bunch of friends to a bowling alley.  It was for a friend&#039;s birthday party, a friend which I have yet to post the link to her blog.  Actually, I&#039;m trying to figure out how to post her link in such a manner that it alphabetically comes after "Fuzzball" because her name begins with a &#039;B&#039;.  You can see to the left there I have the list organized by name, and in the case of El Greatness, I put the "El" last so it fell just after Fuzzball&#039;s link.  Now, certainly I could just put my other friend&#039;s link below Fuzzball&#039;s and leave it at that, but no, I want to be clever!  Anyway, that was all off-track, so this paragraph will be a bit bigger for Friday than it should be.  So we went bowling, played pool, and had some fun.  Then I was forced to go to Steak &#039;n&#039; Shake by the Party Nazis and not allowed to drive home until we all returned to campus around 1:00 in the morning (yes, poor me).  I didn&#039;t want to voice my opinion on when I wanted to get back because I was sorely out-numbered by people who wanted to stay out until all hours of the morning (and shoot paper balls made from straw wrappers at me).  Suffice to say, Saturday morning my parents weren&#039;t pleased, and here&#039;s why.<BR><BR>

Saturday I had a leadership workshop to attend for my local ASME section as the university&#039;s student section representative.  It lasted ALL day, from eight in the morning to five in the afternoon!  Which means, after I got home at 2:00, I had only five hours to sleep until I got up at 7:00.  Blah.  So I made it out there, went to the workshop, and was actually surprised because the speaker was actually really good!  I was able to get up and grab another donut every so often while he was giving his presentation, and that was cool, so I hardly noticed the time fly by.  It was noon when I went for my third donut!  At any rate, now I need to figure out a way to explain everything I learned about how to run an ASME section smoothly to the executive board of my <a href="http://mmae.ucf.edu/students_asme/" target="_new">ASME student section</a>.<BR><BR>

Sunday I had to work on a group project for Statics.  Not much to say there, we worked on the project.  Although, Super Dave&#039;s apartment gave both me and Crazy Canadian Jew a headache, and we&#039;re not sure why.  I think the apartment&#039;s just infected.  Then again, what would you expect from four guys living together who couldn&#039;t give a rat&#039;s rear end about their health&#63;  I still felt bad when I went home at six thirty, but eventually got better.  So that was all that.<BR><BR>

Today I wore my nice, thick black half-trenchcoat.  Last week on Monday morning when I walked outside wearing only a sweater, it was way too cold, and I had a really hard time not shivering myself to pieces!  I&#039;m not exagerating, it was that damn cold out.  Today, I wore the coat, and boy was I nice and toasty!  I like this coat, I really do, it&#039;s just been too hot lately to wear it.  But not anymore!  It seems the wintry weather has finally set in down here in Florida!  I have a really cool Gundam Wing Endless Waltz pin of the head of the Gundam Heavyarms Custom that I wear on the lapel of my coat.  In Dan terms:  Major Flexage!<BR><BR>

Well, I&#039;ve just slept through half my egineering graphics lab, so I&#039;d better go get myself a second breakfast before I fall asleep before class at 2:00.  I know, you&#039;re probably thinking I&#039;m a hobbit now.  Well blah to you!  I know plenty of people who have Second Breakfast!  Off I go.  Hopefully as I enjoy my Thursday and Friday off, I shall remember to post my funny <b>R.R.R.</b> from last week instead of constantly forgetting about it like I did today.  (Fortunately it&#039;s already written down, you lucky people, you!)</P>
