		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">Each year a phenomenon of nature descends on the rural community
		of Willcox. Descending being the operative word as they literally
		come out of the sky. Just south of town is the wintering grounds
		for tens of thousands of sandhill cranes. </FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">The sandhill crane (Grus canadensis) is a large bird, standing
		up to four feet tall with a seven foot wingspan. These birds migrate
		each year from the far reaches of the arctic tundra, across the
		very north of Canada, the north slope of Alaska even Siberia on
		the shores of the Arctic Ocean. They spend the winter in the relatively
		mild Sulphur Springs Valley. Here there is food, a secure night
		roosting area and the other necessities of life for a large bird.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">A safe place for night roosting is provided by Willcox Playa,
		a large seasonal lake bed six to ten miles across just south of
		the town. Here the flocks can roost for the night with little
		chance of being surprised by a predator during the night. Pity
		the poor coyote who must trudge a mile or more through a few inches
		of water and mud to approach thousands of birds with no cover
		or concealment. His chance of finding a meal is slim to none.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">The use of the Willcox area by these birds is a new phenomenon.
		Due to the recent introduction of large automated irrigation systems
		to the area the commercial raising of corn and other crops has
		created a food source that was not present in the past. It is
		fortunate that the arrival of the birds is after the harvest is
		in from the fields, or it would be war between the farmers trying
		to save their crops and the cranes. As it is the cranes eat waste
		on the ground and leave behind a good fertilizer.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">The daily schedule for these birds is to rise from the playa at
		the first break of dawn and to fly north or south to the cornfields
		for feeding. The sandhill crane will eat a variety of small creatures,
		rodents and amphibians, but will also eat the leftover corn in
		the fields after harvest. To find food the cranes will spread
		out over more than seventy miles of valley to fields as far south
		as Elfrida and Double Adobe and as far north as Bonita. Feeding
		takes most of the morning. About eleven or so the cranes will
		leave the fields and fly to &quot;day use&quot; areas where they will lounge
		about and socialize for the rest of the day before flying to the
		roosting areas for the night.</FONT></P>

		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">Willcox is about 80 miles east of Tucson on I-10. Willcox is a
		small rural community providing services to a large area of southeastern
		ArizonaA center for agriculture including fruit orchards, corn
		and wheat growing as well as greenhouse tomatoes and other high
		value crops. In town can be found very reasonably priced hotels
		and food, a supermarket and other necessary services. See the
		<A HREF="http://www.pinkbanana.com/cityofwillcox/">Willcox Chamber of Commerce</A> web site.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">The cranes leave the playa at the crack of dawn to fly to the
		cornfields both north and south of Willcox. Finding cranes is
		usually just a matter of finding the cornfields. There are so
		many birds in the valley that not finding them is unusual. As
		you drive about keep your eye out for raptors, the valley is also
		a popular wintering area for many species of hawks, northern harriers,
		american kestrels, loggerhead shrike, as well as both golden and
		bald eagles. As the best perches are the telephone poles along
		the road you can often get a good close look. In any given drive
		about the valley in winter you can see several dozen hawks and
		harriers without much trying.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">East of Tombstone along Davis Road (two miles west of SR191) are
		located several cornfields where cranes can usually be found from
		dawn until late morning. Davis Road is only a short drive from
		Tombstone or better yet Bisbee, both good places to spend a night
		at a B&amp;B for a weekend getaway. Listen for the distinctive bugles
		when trying to find the feeding flocks.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">Arizonastate Game and Fish has opened a new wildlife viewing area
		for the 1998-1999 winter season. This is a parking lot and a raised
		burm looking out over an area used by the cranes during midday
		after feeding. Here can be found tens of thousands of birds in
		large flocks just hanging out for the afternoon. Located adjacent
		to the Apache Power Generating Station on state route 191 about
		ten miles south of interstate 10. Easy to find as you can see
		the generating station from anywhere in the valley. The cranes
		arrive at these ponds in sometimes very large groups in the late
		morning hours through early afternoon. Later in the evening they
		will move farther out into the playa for the night. </FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica">Late December, January and February are the best months to see
		this spectacle of nature. After February the birds again take
		to the wing for the long trip back to their arctic breeding grounds.</FONT></P>
