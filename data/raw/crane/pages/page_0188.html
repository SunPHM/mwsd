		Here you can view live video of the Campus Square
		construction. The motion JPEG images are 704 x 480
		pixels and are delivered at ten frames per second. To
		view these videos you need a fast network connection
		like a 10 Mb/s LAN, so don't even bother from a home
		dialup line.  Results are marginal even with a
		cable/DSL connection.

		<p>

		The camera is located on the EWFM Libary and
		Computing Center. The camera
		looks down at the central plaza and
		entrance of the new bookstore.

		<p>

		When the project started we only made available <a
		href=stills.html> sequential still images</a> captured
		using simple USB web cameras connected to PCs running
		Windows 98.  They've since been replaced by higher
		quality network cameras running an embedded version of
		Linux. Since the network cameras can efficiently
		provide a series of high-resolution JPEG stills, we
		use Perl to grab the JPEGs and produce the motion JPEG
		video.  Web browsers can also fetch a still image at
		any time for display over the Internet.

		<p><font color=blue><h2>Archived Time-Lapse MPEG Movies</h2></font>

		Once a minute we also stash images on the SGI compute
		sever, Rigel.  Using standard multimedia tools
		provided with IRIX, we've created humongous movies
		that show construction at an accelerated rate.
		Camera 1 movies are <a href="ccmovies/cc1.html">here</a>, and
		Camera 2 movies are <a href="ccmovies/cc2.html">here</a>.

		<p>

		These movies are known as "fast start" or "progressive
		download" movies.  This simply means that the client
		application - typically Netscape, Internet Explorer,
		QuickTime Player or RealPlayer - begins to upload the
		entire movie, and once enough of the movie has arrived
		the client begins playback. 

		<p>

		We also have streaming QuickTime versions of some of
		these movies available <a href="rtsp/index.html">here</a>.

		<p>

		With the exception of each camera's first movie, most of
		the MPEG movies cover a week, which works out to be
		less than two minutes of realtime video.  All these
		movies are comprised of images from the new network
		cameras, featuring better color rendition and a larger
		field of view than the original Win32 web cameras.

		<p>

		Both camera's first (and rather large) movie is
		comprised of all the images from the original web
		cameras - you'll note that these movies are of lower
		quality and have a restricted field of view.

		<p><font color=blue><h2>Self-Updating Sequential Still Images</h2></font>

                As we noted earlier, all the above work was derived
		from the simple idea of periodically displaying images
		of the Campus Square construction.  The images are
		still available, of course - you can view them <a
		href=stills.html> here </a>. The unexpected
		side-effect was the generation of yet another project,
		which took a fair amount of time and involved many IR
		staff members!

		<p><font color=blue><h2>Miscellaneous Digital Images </h2></font>

		We have to start with a picture of
		<a href="images/leroy-conduitbuster.JPG">Leroy</a>, one
		of the hardest workers on the site. He drives the
		dozers and backhoes, moves tons of dirt, and is darn
		good at it. Nobody knew Lehigh's fiber link to the
		world was where he was digging, but as soon as he saw
		orange interduct, digging stopped and Lehigh was saved.
		The conduit was <a href="images/conduits-busted3-0701.JPG">
		damaged</a> but nothing was severed. The crack Structured
		Cable team snapped into action, and
		<a href="images/conduits-repaired-0701.JPG">Pat and Dave</a>
		effected the required repairs. Roy gives his nodding approval
		of a job well done.

		<p>
		
		The monster <a href="images/crane2.JPG">red crane</a> is
		a Manitowic M250, it's been doing the heavy lifting work. Just
		one of those floor panels weighs 65,000 pounds. Here is
		<a href="images/craneoperator.JPG">Bill</a>, the operator,
		he's mighty proud of his rig. When he saw us trying in vain
		to get a picture up the boom, he grabbed the camera
		and took this <a href="images/crane-operatorview.JPG"
		width=640 height=480>picture</a> looking though the cab's
		top window.
		
		<p>

		<font color=red>M250 BONUS!</font> Although I missed the
		disassembly of the boom proper,
		<a href="rtsp/m250-disassembly.html">here</a> is
		streaming QuickTime, time-lapse, footage of the crane itself
		being taken apart and trucked away.
		Can't handle streaming QuickTime, or you want a larger
		frame size?
		<a href="ccmovies/m250.web/m250.html"> Here</a> is
		a selection of (large) QuickTime download movies.

		<p><font color=blue><h2>Resource Utilization</h2></font>

		Each Axis video camera produces a data stream of
		approximately 2 Mb/s (million bits per second), about
		1/5 of a normal LAN connection. Compare this to a 56
		Kb/s (thousand bits per second) dialup line, and you
		can see why it's impractical for the average person to
		view the motion JPEGs from home.
		
		<p>
		
		On a normal day we collect around 660 JPEG images from
		each camera, or about 40 MB of raw data daily, per
		camera, all stored on Rigel. At 17:05 the job that
		creates the time-lapse movies begins.  The first day
		it reduces the 40 MB of raw data to an MPEG movie of
		about 3 MB - a rather substantial savings.  This takes
		about 12 CPU minutes on a single processor.  By the
		end of the week the raw data is approaching 200 MB and
		the CPU time to create a 16 MB time-lapse movie is
		over an hour. At 19:01 the movies are transferred to
		the Campus Square Construction web server for viewing,
		and a Perl program updates the web pages to reflect
		the presence of the new movies. All of this is done
		completely autonomously.

		<p>

		Currently, the disk space utilization for the
		time-lapse MPEG movies on the web server is:
<pre>
    Camera 1 :              68 movies totaling     954,426,216 bytes
    Camera 2 :              68 movies totaling     970,392,568 bytes
</pre>
and the disk space utilization for the raw JPEG still images on Rigel is:
<pre>
    Camera 1 :         211,595 images totaling  12,890,354,187 bytes
    Camera 2 :         199,416 images totaling  11,065,451,248 bytes
</pre>

<!--		
		<p>

		Needless to say, we've had to move some of the raw data
		from Rigel to offline storage. So, in addition to the above,
		this information has been archived to DAT tape:
		<p>
<pre>
    Camera 1 :          31,446 images totaling   1,659,679,798 bytes
    Camera 2 :          18,645 images totaling   1,108,507,020 bytes
</pre>
