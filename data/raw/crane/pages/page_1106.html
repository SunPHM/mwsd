		ALT="Elevated highways in Shanghai" ALIGN="right">The first surprise was that
		China has made so much progress in modernizing since the Cultural Revolution.
		They told us in Shanghai that 25% of all of the world's construction cranes are
		in Shanghai alone! Automobiles are being manufactured in China including Jeeps,
		VWs, and Audis, which were apparent on the streets. Traffic jams are terrible
		in the major cities, despite new highways. Western goods are advertised
		"everywhere" -- and not for tourists, either. The people in the cities are
		smartly dressed and, yes, some of them carry cell phones!</P> 
	 <P>Those concerned about the infrastructure should be reassured by the
		modern airports and the new Boeing and Airbus airplanes. We can't comment on
		the trains, but, especially with last year's internal Russian flight on our
		minds, we were reassured about the situation in the air. Hotels that are called
		5 star are -- and more. The attention to detail and the level of service is
		very high in the 3 to 5 star class of hotels that we visited. The guides were
		interesting and professional and spoke good English -- some spoke excellent
		English. </P>

		ALT="McDonald's in Shanghai" BORDER="2">Service was excellent. We stayed in
		first-class establishments, but the service orientation was apparent elsewhere.
		For example, in the Shanghai museum, several attendants (I always thought they
		were guards in a museum) helped us if we appeared confused and even insisted on
		taking our picture with our camera in front of a display. You may not consider
		it progress that you can bargain for most items -- even in the state's
		"Friendship" stores. Salespersons are clearly on commission and are very
		aggressive not only on the street but also in shops. Show the least bit of
		interest in something, and you get possibly more attention than you wanted!</P>
	 
	 <P>In fact, English may be the second language of China! English is widely
		understood and once again, we English speakers have life made easy for us. In
		the "Silk Market" in Beijing, where there were foreigners from many countries
		(as well as Chinese), the lingua franca was English. It is the technical
		language, the language of business, and the Chinese are learning it fast!</P> 
	 <P>China truly has something for everyone. China not only has one of the
		largest populations in the world, it has one of the oldest civilizations. If
		you like culture, history, archaeology, there's plenty keep you busy. Observing
		a culture different from your own, even from a distance, is one of the
		pleasures of travel. Many find it particularly fascinating to observe a culture
		in transition, as this one clearly is. The Yangtze cruise gave us a taste of
		the natural riches of China. And today, China is a fun place to shop -- and
		there are still some bargains too. And finally, the cuisine -- China is proud
		of their culinary heritage and the Chinese people take their food very
		seriously. </P> 
	 <P>Of course, not all is well in China. The air quality in cities is very
		poor. There are no birds (to speak of), and I presume little other wildlife.
		Most trees have been cut down (although there is a serious and very visible
		reforestation program going on). China is very very crowded and their
		population control measures are under fire. A country in transition from a
		controlled economy to a more market-oriented economy goes through a period
		where people are laid off from failing businesses and need to be retrained and
		hired as workers elsewhere, and this is happening now in China. And finally,
		there is the question of human rights, which we will not touch upon here, but
		is on the minds of many of us and many of them. The China we saw appeared to be
		in an optimistic mood -- and we wish them well!</P> 
	 <P>A "Westerner" feels very much like they are in a fish bowl in China
		today. We were the people with the long noses, or was it the people with the
		funny hair... Maybe especially since we were part of a tour (i.e., a group of
		westerners), people stared unabashadly at us all over the country. We were
		stared at, but as far as we could discern, most people were friendly. When we
		would smile and wave, we almost always received smiles and waves in return.</P>
	 
	 <P>Some of our guides spoke rather more freely with us than we might have
		thought considering what we hear about the possible dangers. A local guide
		would be talking in front of a national guide and a bus driver, so it really
		isn't a private conversation or a conversation only in front of foreigners. It
		is probably not polite to bring up sensitive subjects, especially where someone
		else might overhear. On the cruise there were several discussion periods where
		we could ask questions about the new dam on the Yangtze or about life in China
		today. </P> 
	 <P>We were on a very structured tour, so we were not free to wander around
		and take the kind of candid photos we like to take. Many of the "slice of life"
		pictures were, alas, taken from a bus. We hope that we will be able to return
		soon to China and spend more time at leisure poking around in this "strange"
		(to us) land.</P>
