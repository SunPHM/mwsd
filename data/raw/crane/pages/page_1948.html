        studies and censuses Whooping Cranes at Aransas
        every winter. (Tom leads the Whooping Crane Recovery Team and is Journey
        North's Crane Expert.)  Tom notes that cranes' breeding success each
        spring is closely related to the population of blue crabs. Even if there
        are
        plenty of
        other
        food sources, the cranes must have a large supply of blue crabs to build

        <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Crab Nutrition<BR>
        </B>What's so great about blue crabs? One large blue crab has about 85
         g of meat. This provides 87 calories, with 17 g of protein, 1.5 g of
        fat, 
        and 0 g of carbohydrate. But it isn't just the protein and calories in
         blue crabs that is important for cranes. Each crab is also rich in calcium
        
        (necessary for strong bones and also for forming egg shells), iron, magnesium,
         phosphorus, zinc, copper, other minerals, and lots of vitamins. And
        this 
        is just the actual meat in the crab. Cranes pick off the biggest claw
         and some of the hard parts of the shell on the largest crabs, but they
        
        swallow smaller crabs whole and eat most of the shell even on large crabs.
         The shell is extremely rich in calcium and other minerals. A crane would
        
        have to eat a LOT of acorns or worms to get the nourishing vitamins,
        minerals,  and calories of just one blue crab!<BR>

        <P><font size="2">Tom Stehn tells us that the parents have to teach the
             baby cranes how to eat crabs. From <a href="http://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/texas/aransas/index.html" target="_blank">Aransas
             NWR</a>          Tom writes, 
          &quot;Whooper chicks are fed most of the winter at Aransas by their
           parents, with feeding tapering off as the young get older and spring
          
          approaches. With vegetable matter such as wolfberries or acorns, the
           young cranes quickly feed on their own. When an adult catches a blue
          
          crab, Junior runs over and begs for an easy meal. Small
          crabs  are swallowed whole. With a big crab, the adult usually carries
          it to 
          the edge of a pond and pulverizes it on the muddy marsh soil rather
           than in the open water ponds. Once the crab is stunned and on marsh
          soil, Junior 
          is usually pecking at the crab and trying to eat underfoot of the adult
           crane. The crab legs are pulled off and often swallowed whole. When
          crabs 
          get inactive from cold temperatures (below 18 degrees C), adults stand
           in one spot and probe the mud until they hit a crab. I assume the
          youngsters 
          also do this. George Archibald has suggested that the beaks of 6-month
           old cranes are still growing and may not be strong enough to be smashing
          
          crabs, but Felipe Chavez has observed young whoopers catching crabs.&quot;</font></P>
        <p><font size="2">Felipe writes, &quot;The cranes I observed catching
             crabs generally took the crab to the edge, an open spot to tear
            them 
          up. Occasionally, particularly with larger crabs, the crane would break
             off one of the claws before it took the crab to the edge of the
            pond. 
          A free claw is dangerous, it appears. I saw crabs cling to the cranes
             beak after the crane had let go of it. Once on the edge, the second
            
          remaining claw was generally broken off first. Then the crane generally
             flipped the crab over and proceeded to peck it repeatedly. I am
            not 
          sure if it was trying to kill it, or break it up regardless of whether
             it was alive or not. I'm not sure whether cranes kill the crab first
            
          then tear it up or tear and kill along the way. This generally left
             only the carapace of larger crabs, since the undersides, inside,
            and 
          all extremities were consumed except for very large claws.<BR>

          <B>Introducing Crabs to the Whoopers at Chassahowitzka<BR>
          </B>Would the whoopers wintering at Chassahowitzka (&quot;Chass&quot;) National
          Wildlife Refuge in Florida learn how to eat blue crabs? Without experienced
          crane 
          parents to teach them, the first &quot;ultra-cranes&quot; that arrived
           in December, 2001, had a hard time figuring it out. Early on, Heather
          
          Ray of Operation Migration wrote, &quot;Sessions to encourage birds
           to eat blue crabs took place on four days between Dec. 8th - 13th
          [2001]. Although 
          there was some interest, the crabs were too large for the birds to
          swallow  whole and they did not know how to break them up. The young
          cranes showed little 
          interest in broken pieces of crab that did not move. On Dec. 12th Richard
           caught a smaller species of crab and offered 
          it to the birds. They were very interested and #4 seized and ate this
           live crab.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Each new group of young cranes fledged in the north
             and coming to the wintering grounds will need to learn how to eat
            blue 
          crabs. (Ask your parent how easy it was for you to learn to eat with
             a spoon, and you'll realize that cranes aren't the only ones with
            eating
