These three-cent stamps presented the wild turkey, pronghorn antelope, and			king salmon--three animals that wildlife biologists had struggled to save. The first			three wildlife conservation stamps were so popular that a fourth stamp followed in			1957. That stamp, pictured below, featured one of the country's most endangered species,			the whooping crane. <BR>			<BR>						<TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1">				<TR>					<TD><A HREF="/jnorth/images/graphics/c/wcrane_envelop01.jpg"><IMG SRC="/jnorth/images/graphics/tnail/c/wcrane_envelop01.jpg"						ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>On July 19, 1957, four months before the stamp was issued, the Washington Post reported			that the whooping crane population stood at 31--the highest it had been since 1950,			when 34 whoopers were counted. Thanks to decades of joint efforts between U.S. and			Canadian conservationists, the wild whooping crane population has grown to more than			180. Still, the whooping crane remains one of the rarest species in North America.			<BR>			<BR>						<TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1">				<TR>					<TD><A HREF="/jnorth/images/graphics/c/wcrane_envelop02.jpg "><IMG SRC="/jnorth/images/graphics/tnail/c/wcrane_envelop02.jpg "						ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"></A></TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>This beautiful whooper stamp helped carry the conservation message around the country.			It also marked one of the first times more than one color was used on a stamp. Unlike			previous wildlife stamps, this one sported three colors: blue for water, green for			grasses, and orange for the two fuzzy whooping crane chicks. Fine engraving embellished			the drawing done by Bob Hines, an artist for the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service			(USFWS). <BR>			<BR>			<FONT COLOR="#AA0000"><B>Activity: Create Conservation Stamps</B></FONT>			<UL>				<LI>Have students create their own wildlife conservation stamps. Begin by having				each choose a favorite animal from your state or province to feature on their stamp.				<P>				<LI>Have students design and color their stamps, working with their preferred stamp				size and art medium.				<P>				<LI>Invite interested students to include their own conservation pledges on the envelopes.				<P>				<LI>Create a classroom or hallway display to spotlight the wildlife conservation				stamp designs and pledges.			</UL>			<P><HR><FONT COLOR="#AA0000"><B>Extensions</B></FONT>			<OL>				<LI>Watch for new stamps being issued. Start your own &quot;first issue&quot; collection				complete with postmark. <BR>				<BR>								<LI>Compare engraved stamps to those done on off-set printers. Engraving like you				see on the whooper stamp is a painstaking and dying art. Only a few commemorative,				limited-edition stamps use engraving. These include the Spanish-American War stamp				issued in March 1998 and the Pacific '97 stamp issued in 1997. Today, most stamps				are printed in full color, the artwork scanned onto a computer that digitally generates				four-color film. The film negatives are exposed on photosensitive plates (offset				printing plates). Each plate prints a different color. Offset printing is popular				because it produces bright stamps. The stamps, however, lack the fine-lined etching				characteristic of engraved stamps. Visit the post office or talk to stamp collectors				(called philatelists) to locate, then compare and contrast stamps made by engraving				with those made by offset printing.<BR>				<BR>								<LI>Find out what's new in wildlife stamps today. As the environment and wildlife				became hotter topics, more wildlife stamps rolled off the U.S. Bureau of Engraving				and Printing's presses. A 1963 stamp honored pioneer bird painter John James Audubon.				A 1966 stamp commemorating the 50-year anniversary of the Migratory Bird Treaty.				Dozens of wildlife stamps have been issued by the USPS since the 1970s, including				blocks of stamps dedicated to coral reefs, state birds and flowers, mammals, hummingbirds,				and owls. A 1996 series of stamps featured photographs of endangered species, ranging				from the Wyoming toad to the West Indian manatee. Perhaps you, or someone you know,				own some of these stamps.				<LI>Find foreign wildlife stamps. Many countries produce animal stamps. Canada's				very first stamp, issued in 1851, portrayed a beaver. Other early wildlife stamps				include an1866 Peruvian stamp depicting llamas and an 1879 Guatemalan stamp depicting				its national bird, the resplendent quetzal. Can you find pictures of these stamps				to share with other interested students?<BR>				<BR>								<LI>Take a survey. Have students collect the stamps that come into their mailboxes				at home for a week. Graph results to find out which stamps are currently the most				popular.<BR>				<BR>								<LI>Have students imagine they are whooping cranes and write a Whoop of Thanks. Students				use the background information above and their own ideas and research to write letters				describing their appreciation for the help that saved their species.			</OL>			<P>			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>			<FONT SIZE="2"><B>Copyright 1999-2003 Journey North.
