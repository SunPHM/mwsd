The result is a magnificent seven-mile stretch of the Wisconsin River, where glacially-sculpted cliffs rise 100 feet above the water. It's located in the middle of the Baraboo Range that contributes to excellent scenic tours and hiking. Wisconsin Dells is also the Midwest's most popular destination for water parks.</font>
