    <H2>Faculty Member&#146;s Documentary to Air on PBS Television
    Series</H2>

    <P>The deep divide over the issue of organized prayer in public
    schools is given a riveting treatment in a documentary &#151;
    written and coproduced by an Ithaca College faculty member &#151;
    that will air nationwide on public television this month. Ben
    Crane, associate professor of television-radio, was part of a
    crew that spent five years working on &quot;School Prayer: A
    Community at War.&quot; The documentary will be broadcast on
    the PBS series <I>P.O.V.,</I> the acclaimed showcase of independent
    nonfiction films. It is scheduled to air on most PBS stations
    at 10:00 p.m. Tuesday, July 20. (WCNY-TV in Syracuse will air
    the program on the scheduled date; WSKG-TV in Binghamton will
    air it at 11:00 p.m. on Friday, July 30.)</P>

    <P>&quot;School Prayer: A Community at War&quot; chronicles an
    impassioned clash of principles in which the constitutional right
    of an individual collides with the deep-rooted tradition of a
    community. Lisa Herdahl discovered when she moved from Wisconsin
    to Pontotoc County, Mississippi, that &#151; some 36 years after
    the Supreme Court ostensibly outlawed school-sanctioned prayer
    &#151; religious devotionals were broadcast over the intercom
    every morning at her son&#146;s high school. Herdahl protested
    to the school board and eventually sued, setting off a protracted
    personal and moral battle that pitted her family against the
    overwhelming majority of Pontotoc.</P>

    <P>&quot;Pontotoc is torn between the law of man as set down
    by the Supreme Court and the law of God as they understand it
    from the Bible,&quot; says Crane. &quot;The majority of people
    in Pontotoc believe that to respect the law of man in this case
    means to risk losing the moral backbone of their community.&quot;</P>

    <P>The documentary profiles the members of the Herdahl family
    as they stubbornly cope with isolation, economic hardship, and
    death threats. It also takes viewers inside the homes, churches,
    and schools of Pontotoc County, where people credit prayer with
    what they consider to be an idyllic life and reflect on the upheaval
    brought about by someone they regard as a troublemaker. The filmmakers
    struggled for 14 months to earn Herdahl&#146;s trust, after which
    they still had to win the confidence of the community. The result
    is an affecting portrait of the passions and soul-searching on
    both sides of this deep fissure in American life.</P>

    <P>&quot;School Prayer&quot; is 1 of only 8 films selected from
    over 900 submissions to air on the <I>P.O.V.</I> series this
    year. It was made by Log In Productions, an Ithaca-area company
    with which Crane is associated, for the Independent Television
    Service, with funding provided by the Corporation for Public
    Broadcasting, the Soros Documentary Fund, and the New York State
    Council on the Arts.</P>

    <P>Crane, who teaches courses in journalism, documentary research,
    scriptwriting, and critical thinking, has written and produced
    works for radio, television, stage, and film. His honors include
    the Gabriel Award, the Ohio State Award, and Columbia University&#146;s
    Major Armstrong Award. He made &quot;School Prayer&quot; with
    coproducer/director/cinematographer Slawomir Grunberg, founder
    of Log In Productions and a former member of the school of communications
    faculty at the College. An award-winning filmmaker himself, Grunberg
    has more than 40 television documentaries to his credit. The
    crew included editor/sound recordist Jason Longo, who earned
    his B.F.A. in film, photography, and visual arts from Ithaca
    College in 1994. Longo has contributed his diverse talents to
    over 20 documentaries, working on projects for such PBS series
    as <I>Frontline, People&#146;s Century,</I> and <I>Nova.</I></P>

    <P>While Herdahl ultimately won her suit against the school board,
    the documentary portrays the conflict as far from over. Herdahl
    was threatened and forced to change houses, and she found herself
    virtually unemployable in the area.</P>

    <P>The county, meanwhile, is bound by state law to pay Herdahl&#146;s
    substantial legal costs of $144,000 &#151; an enormous sum for
    this county of only 24,000 residents. That they end up raising
    money in their churches to pay for the legal actions that banned
    prayer in their schools is an especially bitter pill for residents
    to swallow. Meanwhile, Pontotoc continues to encourage the convening
    of student-initiated prayers in its school auditorium prior to
    the official start of classes each day.</P>
