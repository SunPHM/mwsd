<h2><font color=green>Profile</h2></font>
<I>Associated Mechanical Erectors</I> was founded in 1960 by P. M. Campbell and his son R. P. "Ronnie" Campbell as a heavy rigging, equipment installation, and plant relocation specialist. 
<p>

Since that first payroll for five employees, the company has grown to a workforce of more than two hundred in four divisions:

</td></tr></table>

In 1961, <I>Associated Mechanical Erectors</I> was incorporated, but from the beginning, customers simply called the company AME. The nickname stuck and the familiar diamond-shaped AME logo became a standard in the Carolinas industrial trades. In 1968, Mr. Campbell's other son, Frankie Campbell, joined the company. In 1989, the name was officially changed to <I>AME, Inc.</I> to reflect the popular name everybody had used for years.

From the start, Mr. Campbell infused his company with the vision that you offered clients a competitive price, but your work was always to a higher standard. Frankie Campbell expresses the company's beliefs very well when he says, "Our product is our service. That's our bread and butter. Business is built on reputation. Your reputation depends on your ethics. No matter how large we get, we'll never change our ethics because that defines who we are."
<p>

<img align=right  src="steeple.jpg" width=201 height=155 hspace=15 alt="">

In 1998, AME acquired the well-known SC construction firm of Christman & Parsons, Inc. This added depth, capability, and expertise to the construction business that AME had effectively built. In 2001, AME won the prestigious Four Star General Award for the top industrial project in the Carolinas - the Freightliner Mt. Holly, NC plant expansion. The Freightliner project, and the innovative installation of the massive viewing panels in the Great Ocean Tank of the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston, earned AME feature stories in two major southeastern construction publications.
<p>

Today, Ronnie Campbell is Chairman of the Board / Chief Executive Officer, and Frankie Campbell sits on the Board of Directors. Daily activities fall on Ronnie's son, Gregg Campbell, in his position as President and  Chief Operating Officer. The company is still family-owned, with the next generation of the Campbell family poised in key positions to ensure that the founding vision and ethics live on. And depth of experience runs throughout the AME organization - project managers average 20+ years on the job, supervisors and foremen average 25+ years on the job, project estimators average 15+ years on the job, and our subcontractors average 10+ years of experience working with us. For complete turnkey construction services, saving you time, money, and effort, AME is your best choice.
