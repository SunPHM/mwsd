        </b>A record 194 whooping cranes arrived at Aransas in Fall 2003. The 
        total included 25 juveniles arriving safely at Aransas from the 28 that 
        had fledged. This excellent production in Wood Buffalo allowed the population 
        to increase by 9 birds over last winter.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Captive breeding 
        facilities had an excellent production season in 2003 and fledged 41 chicks. 
        Chicks were provided for the nonmigratory flock in Florida (16), the ultralight 
        project (17), five held back for genetic purposes as future breeders, 
        one held back as a display bird, and two held back with health problems.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sixteen captive 
        whooping crane juveniles were released in central Florida with a high 
        rate of survival. Sixteen more juveniles successfully completed flight 
        training and followed ultralight aircraft to Florida. The migration was 
        beset by bad weather with many delays, but the migration team perservered 
        and completed the 1,191-mile migration in 54 days.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whooping 
        crane numbers at the end of February 2004, both captive (119) and wild 
        (312), totaled 431.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b><a name="spring"></a>SUMMER, 
          2003<br>
          </b></i>Two subadult whooping cranes made history by summering in British 
          Columbia, just west of Jasper National Park along the Fraser River by 
          Prince George. The two cranes were 560 miles southwest of the nesting 
          area and 522 miles west of the western edge of the usual migration corridor. 
          The spread of birds summering in Canada now spans 1075 miles east to 
          west (southcentral Manitoba in 1999 to east central B.C. in 2003). Given 
          this instance of straying from a migration corridor, it should not have 
          been so surprising that three Wisconsin whooping cranes continued their 
          migration and summered in South Dakota.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b><a name="wood"></a>FALL 
          MIGRATION , 2003<br>
          </b></i>The fall migration was the 57d migration monitored since tracking 
          began in the fall of 1975. It is a cooperative effort by private organizations, 
          state and federal conservation agencies, and Canadian Wildlife Service. 
          U.S. records are compiled by Wally Jobman of USFWS-ES in Grand Island, 
          Nebraska, who provided the following information (Jobman 2004, Cooperative 
          Whooping Crane Tracking Project (August 2003-January 2004).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 
          first dates for confirmed observations of migrating whooping cranes 
          were August 26 in Canada and October 1 in the U. S. The latest sighting 
          date was October 29th in Canada and December 19th in the U.S. Sightings 
          were reported from Saskatchewan (24), Montana (1), North Dakota (7), 
          South Dakota (4), Nebraska (6), Kansas (13), Oklahoma (14) and Texas 
          (14). Weather during September and October, 2003, was unseasonably mild 
          and dry in the northern Great Plains. The first major storm system of 
          the fall, which moved through Nebraska on October 30, brought colder 
          weather and snow to Saskatchewan and the Dakotas. No whooper sightings 
          were reported north of Kansas after November 5, an indication that the 
          storm system had pushed most cranes into Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
          This storm system stalled in northern Texas and did not reach the Texas 
          coast until November 6-7. As a result, 41 of the 59 fall sightings confirmed 
          in the U.S. were from Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Approximately 24 
          whooping cranes were sighted at Salt Plains NWR in Oklahoma. Five color-marked 
          cranes were reported out of 25 banded cranes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 14 
          sightings in Texas was unusually high, a state through which whooping 
          cranes usually migrate rapidly. A pair with two chicks was first observed 
          at Aransas on October 25, only 8 days after leaving Saskatchewan. A 
          lone juvenile whooping crane, confirmed in Saskatchewan in early October, 
          was reported in Young County, Texas on November 2 and may have wintered 
          in an unknown location with sandhill cranes. One crane was shot by a 
          hunter in Texas on November 14. The first 2 whooping cranes arrived 
          at Aransas on October 18th. About 86 % of all arrivals (i.e. 167 birds) 
          occurred between October 23 and November 19, very similar to the previous 
          fall.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An adult 
          whooping crane was shot and killed November 14th south of Dallas, Texas. 
          A suspect was apprehended by a TPWD game warden and the case turned 
          over to USFWS.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Four whooping 
          cranes had been present for several days feeding in a cornfield during 
          the day and presumably roosting at night on Lake Bardwell. One crane 
          was shot about 15 minutes before sunset apparently as it flew to roost. 
          Locals heard shots coming from Waxahachie Creek, a part of Lake Bardwell 
          near Ennis, Texas. With waterfowl season closed, the local warden was 
          called. TPWD Warden James Powell responded and apprehended the hunter 
          with 3 ducks plus 1 whooping crane hidden in a bag tucked under the 
          bow of his boat. The hunter indicated he had shot a white crane. The 
          necropsy showed bird to be an adult female with about 20 shot pellets 
          in her. The 3 remaining cranes resumed migration 2 days after the shooting 
          incident. In early February, the suspect pleaded guilty. Sentencing 
          is not expected until at least April. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any shooting 
          of a whooping crane is an unfortunate situation. In this case, the shooting 
          was done by a hunter during a closed waterfowl season and closed sandhill 
          crane season and without the required reservoir hunting permit from 
          the Corps of Engineers. This was the 7th known whooping crane to be 
          shot in North America dating back to 1989, an average of nearly one 
          loss every other year. Shootings have been located in Texas (3), Florida 
          (3), and Canada (1). Only three of the shootings were connected with 
          hunting seasons. Efforts need to be continued to implement the Federal-State 
          contingency plan, and to inform hunters about whooping cranes, including 
          annual press releases, brochures, web pages, hunter education classes, 
          and law enforcement presence. This was discussed at the Central Flyway 
          Technical meetings held in Texas on March 1, 2004.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b><a name="winter"></a>WINTER 
          2003-2004 <br>
          </b></i></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          Aransas-Wood Buffalo population in 2003 made a significant increase 
          of 9 cranes above the peak count of 185 in the 2002-03 winter. This 
          was the second straight year where the population increased by exactly 
          nine cranes. The peak population at Aransas during the winter of 2003-04 
          was estimated at 194, breaking the previous all-time high of 188 set 
          in the 1999-2000 winter. Twenty-five juveniles arrived at Aransas in 
          the fall. This included one set of twins that made the migration from 
          Saskatchewan to Aransas in 8 days. Adult mortality between spring and 
          fall, 2003 was above average and equaled 15 birds (184 + 25 - 194 = 
          15).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 
          fall, a whooping crane juvenile separated from its parents was confirmed 
          in Saskatchewan with sandhills. This juvenile may have been seen in 
          North Texas in early November, but no subsequent reports were ever received. 
          In addition to the 194 cranes, a report of 3 more cranes was made about 
          100 miles north of Aransas in mid-November. However, this report never 
          materialized into 3 more cranes ever being counted at Aransas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conditions 
          were excellent in the fall when the whooping cranes arrived. Summer 
          and fall rains kept salinities moderate, the refuge acorn crop was abundant, 
          and wolfberries and blue crabs sustained the cranes through the end 
          of 2003. Fall rains really benefited the bays, with 29 inches recorded 
          at the refuge in the last 4 months of 2003. January and February were 
          tougher months for the cranes. The wolfberry crop was over, and blue 
          crabs declined to very low levels by the end of February. Only 2 blue 
          crabs were found during an hour of walking the marsh on February 9th. 
          An influx of blue crabs is needed to provide the cranes needed energy 
          reserves for the migration and breeding season.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One whooping 
          crane juvenile may have died during the 2003-04 winter. After being 
          seen two times on their territory in the fall and then moving about 
          8 miles north the following week, the chick was never seen again. I 
          also lost track of the unbanded adult pair that apparently did not return 
          to their territory. It was hoped the family had left the wintering area 
          intact, but it is much more likely the chick died and is the only listed 
          mortality of the 2003-04 winter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hurricane 
          Claudette that hit whooping crane critical habitat in mid-July, 2003 
          played a part in re-opening Cedar Bayou, the natural pass between the 
          Texas bay system and the Gulf of Mexico in the whooping crane area. 
          Tidal action subsequent to the hurricane re-opened Cedar Bayou by September 
          23 and it has remained open throughout the fall and winter. This opening 
          into the Gulf is extremely important to allow many marine organisms, 
          including the blue crab, to travel between the bays and the Gulf to 
          complete their life cycles.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USFWS and 
          other agencies were sued by Friends of Texas Coastal Passes and the 
          Recreational Fishing Alliance over the placement of dredge material 
          at the mouth of Cedar Bayou when the natural pass had silted shut and 
          was last dredged in 1995. The law suit contends the material was illegally 
          placed and damages whooping crane marshes on San Jose Island. This matter 
          is been heard by a Federal judge in Corpus Christi.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 3-D geophysical 
          seismic exploration was completed on November 13th just prior to the 
          arrival of a significant number of cranes. The project involved exploding 
          5,177 dynamite charges 60+ feet underground located over 21,537 acres 
          on the south end of Matagorda Island and surrounding bays. Very strict 
          operating procedures were put into place with satisfactory protection 
          of the environment achieved. Most of the marsh access was done by airboat 
          only with minimal use of tracked vehicles in dry marsh.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commercial 
          crabbing continues as a major activity in whooping crane critical habitat. 
          A total of 1,136 crab traps were noted in or near crane areas on an 
          aerial census at the end of October. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 
          once again passed a 10-day closure in February of commercial crabbing. 
          A coast-wide volunteer effort collected 3,571 abandoned traps. An estimated 
          15,500 traps have been gathered since the program began three years 
          ago. A considerable number of abandoned crab traps still remained on 
          Matagorda Island due to the remote location. Tom Stehn and Dennis Pridgen 
          of TPWD organized an additional pickup operation on February 27th that 
          removed 310 more traps. Thanks go to all the 18 agency personnel and

          whooping crane critical habitat and keep the bays productive. Reduced 
          inflows mean a reduction in crab populations and less food for whooping 
          cranes. With the human population of Texas projected to double in the 
          next 50 years, there has been much talk about creating a mechanism to 
          provide conservation flows for Texas rivers as the pressure to grant 
          more water permits grows. Texas law is all aimed at granting water rights 
          to take water out of rivers, but there is currently no means being used 
          to ensure adequate flows remain in the rivers. Many river segments are 
          already over-appropriated.</font></p>

          and estuaries. Members were appointed to the Commission by the end of 
          2003, and hearings commenced in mid-February. Unfortunately, applications 
          for consumptive water rights continue to be processed. The more permits

        FLORIDA<br>
        </b>At the end of February, estimated numbers of nonmigratory whooping 
        cranes in central Florida were 64 adults and 18 juveniles (16 from captivity 
        and 2 fledged in the wild) for a total of 82 birds, including 17 adult 
        pairs. This is a conservative figure since not all whooping cranes can 
        be tracked due to failed radio transmitters. Between July and December 
        2003, the team documented the loss of 5 older birds and 1 juvenile. They 
        also captured an impressive 19 cranes for health checks and transmitter 
        replacement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sixteen juveniles 
        arrived in central Florida in two separate cohorts of 8, one cohort from 
        the International Crane Foundation and the other from Patuxent. One juvenile 
        raised at the Calgary Zoo was shipped to Patuxent and socialized into 
        a cohort. Both cohorts easily met the target size of between 6 and 9 that 
        seem to lead to higher survival.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The role 
        of infectious bursal disease virus in the health of whooping cranes in 
        Florida continued. In conclusion, it appears that IBD is a major factor 
        predisposing juvenile whooping cranes to mortality in Florida in certain 
        winters. Over 300 samples were tested, including some from the captive 
        centers prior to shipping birds to Florida. It turns out that the cranes 
        are exposed to IBD in captivity, but also the prevalence of seropositive 
        birds increases dramatically in the Florida release pen and post-release 
        in Florida. This means the whooping cranes are likely exposed in Florida 
        and continue to be re-exposed. Testing of samples continues, and samples 
        collected from sentinel chickens, wild turkeys, quail and sandhill cranes 
        will also be tested. Kristi Candelora will be starting her Master's project 
        on IBD in Florida. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Survival 
        of the birds released in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 winters continued to 
        be excellent. Water levels at the end of 2003 were fair. Four nests were 
        documented at the end of February, 2004.</font></p>

        CRANE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP (WCEP)<br>
        </b>WCEP had an excellent third year of the eastern migratory whooping 
        crane reintroduction. Since 2001, 36 whooping cranes have been reintroduced 
        successfully and are migrating along a well-defined migration corridor 
        between Wisconsin and Florida. Survival of whooping cranes after completion 
        of their first fall migration behind ultralight aircraft has been 92%.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The migration 
        with 16 juveniles in 2003 was beset by bad weather with many delays, but 
        the migration team perservered and completed the 1,191-mile migration 
        in 54 days. A highlight was a record 196-mile flight in three hours and 
        four minutes over Georgia. It was the longest flight in one day ever made 
        by an ultralight leading cranes. Nineteen of 20 older birds in the flyway 
        all migrated back to Florida, with one bird in an unknown location because 
        of a failed transmitter. Although many of the cranes returned to the release 
        site at Chassahowitzka, they subsequently dispersed to freshwater marsh 
        habitat in western and northern Florida. Several are within 10 miles of 
        nonmigratory whooping cranes, but no interactions have been documented 
        between the two flocks. Four older migratory cranes are currently wintering 
        in the release site at Chassahowitzka with the cohort of 16 juveniles, 
        kept there by the rations provided in the pen. It is becoming clear that 
        although the saltmarsh at Chassahowitzka is not suitable crane habitat, 
        it is excellent as a first-winter release site.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WCEP 
        Outreach Team continued to work with media, organizations, school children 
        and the general public to provide information and educational opportunities 
        about whooping cranes and the reintroduction. Media and public interest 
        continued to be strong, with over 300 media inquiries handled. Websites 
        for WCEP and project partners (especially Journey North) fielded over 
        6 million hits. The Outreach Team emphasized educational opportunities 
        this year and made presentations to over 15,000 people. A very successful 
        festival was held in the fall at the Necedah NWR in Wisconsin, and an 
        emotional and well-attended arrival event was organized at Chassahowitzka 
        NWR. Booths were staffed at the Midwest Birding Symposium in Green Bay 
        (Sept. 9-11), the Florida Birding and Nature Festival in St. Petersburg, 
        (Oct. 10-12), and the Colonial Coast Birding Festival in Jekyll Island, 
        Georgia (Oct. 10-12). The team also assisted with the creation of a WCEP 
        display for a new exhibit at the Smithsonian Institute's Museum of Natural 
        History in Washington, D.C. &quot;America's Wildest Places: Our National 
        Wildlife Refuge System&quot; which opened Nov. 7, 2003 to celebrate the 
        refuge system's centennial. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Monitoring 
        Team did a remarkable job of knowing where almost all the birds were throughout 
        the summer, fall migration, and winter, and helping the juveniles survive 
        in the Florida release pen. The project budget (funds outside ordinary 
        operating budgets) in 2003 was $1.2 million, with nearly half coming from 
        private organizations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Health 
        team was involved in almost all facets of the reintroduction, providing 
        health care before and after releases. In 2003, 16 of 19 whooping cranes 
        (84%) allocated to the project made the migration and were released. Of 
        particular note was a juvenile in Wisconsin with a small knee fracture 
        that was surgically repaired. A hardware foreign body (a washer) was also 
        removed from its gizzard during surgery. Recovery was accomplished in 
        isolation at ICF, and the bird reunited with the migration cohort in southern 
        Wisconsin. The bird began flying with the cohort in northern Illinois 
        and completed the migration with no problems. This is just one example 
        of the numerous situations the health team deals with on a 24/7/365 basis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A WCEP planning 
        meeting was held February 18-20th in Crystal River, Florida. This is one 
        of two annual meetings where 30+ participants from the various WCEP teams 
        gather to discuss both short-term and long-term needs. The Wisconsin DNR 
        is leading an effort to write a State management plan for whooping cranes 
        that will be a useful tool in writing a similar plan for the entire flock.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 2004, 
        the Recovery team has approved allocation of up to 20 chicks for the ultralight 
        migration. In addition, plans are proceeding for a possible supplemental 
        release where captive whooping crane juveniles would be released into 
        groups of older whooping cranes in the fall, 2005.</font></p>

        program. An endless amount of work goes into propagating cranes, caring 
        for the chicks, training them for reintroductions, and dealing with numerous 
        health issues. I cannot begin to detail all the invaluable work that the 
        captive centers carry out. Below are just a few of the highlights.</font></p>

        appropriations bill for funding a new whooping crane captive propagation 
        facility designed to hold 10 pairs. They deserve all the credit for making 
        this happen and getting it funded. ACRES currently propagates Mississippi 
        sandhill cranes and has 8 whooping cranes, including one pair that laid 
        its first eggs in 2003. The new funding will expand the whooping crane 
        program at ACRES, provide much better facilities separate from the sandhills, 
        and eliminate the current conflict for space between the two species. 
        Larger breeding pens with breeding ponds will be built, two factors that 
        we think are limiting the captive propagation effort for whooping cranes. 
        This new facility should help meet the recovery goal of an expansion of 
        the captive flock needed to be able to retain 90% of the gene diversity 
        in captivity for the next 100 years. It will hopefully be built and ready
