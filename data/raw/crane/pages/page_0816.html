The patio area is much cleaner now than it was at Closing, and will
eventually make a nice courtyard.<BR><BR>

As of 11/2/03, three walls are framed, and the last hurricane delayed
by a month the structural beam for the main doors. Maybe next
week.<BR>

Early in Jan 04, we got a day or two of nice weather, so I put up the
beams and rest of structural framing for the garage doors.  Also, the
roof trusses arrived after much delay, so you can see them wrapped in
plastic and covered with a layer of snow and ice.

Late Mar 04, I hired 2 carpenters from a friend's crew, and the three of
us put up half the trusses.  In Apr, Laura, myself, two colleagues,
and the neighbor couple and three of their kids helped finish the job.
Three people can do it, but nine people is so much more pleasant! Each
standard truss is 175 lbs and 32' by 8', and the gable ends are 215 lbs!

May 04. I've started putting the decking on the roof.  You can see a bit of the
crane I built to haul plywood from the ground up through the trusses.

July-ish. Been a busy summer. I finished decking the roof and got tar paper on it,
which took about 3 weekends. And repapering it if too big a windstorm rolled through.
Forgot to take any pictures until I started framing out the dormers, which took a 
couple more.

When the dormers were done, I got someone else to do the shingling, because of how 
much time this all is taking.  I worked on wrapping (wind allowing) and getting the
windows in.  This is how things looked in September.
