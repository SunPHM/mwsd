<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype">The jagged triangular spire of 
steel columns seen above is a portion of the service core that remained standing after the main body of the dust cloud from the north 
tower collapse had reached the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be seen in several still 
pictures and at least one video, and appears to be about 2/3 the height of the 
building, say 60-70 floors, narrowing down to just a single column at the 
top.&nbsp; This grouping of columns is only a portion of the core, most likely
one corner and the area around it, perhaps as much as a third of the core's area
at the bottom.&nbsp; For some reason this group of columns has not fallen 
with the rest, though many of the cross-braces that tied them together are gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>Given that the rest of the
core disappears so completely it is hard to understand how the collapse could
slice so cleanly around the spire without pulling it down as well.&nbsp; The core was extremely robust, 
designed to be able to support the entire weight of the buildings several times
over and was the principal gravitational support of the building.&nbsp; Far from
being&nbsp; mere "service cores," they comprised 47 rectangular steel 
box columns tied together by thousands of steel cross braces.&nbsp; The largest of 
these box columns were 18"x36", the smallest about 16&quot;x16&quot;, all with steel walls 4" thick
at the base and 
tapering in stages to 1&quot; at the top the top, and were anchored directly to the 
bedrock.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>&nbsp;The outer walls' 
primary function was&nbsp; to brace against wind loads,&nbsp; and they were not 
counted upon for weight bearing, though they did of course carry some weight in 
the resting state.&nbsp; By placing the support against wind loading right at 
the surface where the loads occur the whole structure could be lighter with the 
same amount of lateral stability.&nbsp; But under static conditions the core
carried most of the load.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT 
face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>&nbsp;This construction picture gives a sense of 
how massive the core really was.&nbsp; Notice the four construction cranes
standing on the corners of the partially built core.&nbsp; These sat on&nbsp; built-up
columns created at each corner and were formed by tying together the four columns
closest to each corner.&nbsp; Diagonal braces were also added on the vertical
sides to make them more rigid.&nbsp; These corner columns were very substantial structures that were
gradually added to as the building grew, and were designed to support the massive cranes
and the weight of the materials they lifted into place.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>In this view the spire can 
be seen in the wake of the debris cloud just as it reaches the ground.&nbsp; 
(And incidentally at that moment the scene to the left of the dust cloud gets 
much brighter, a brightness visible in many images.&nbsp; Its possible source is 
beyond the scope of this discussion.)&nbsp; This remnant of the core remains 
standing for a little less than 20 seconds, swaying a bit from side to side but 
showing remarkably little inclination to topple over.&nbsp; It then abruptly 
begins to drop straight down on itself in an apparent free fall, but after 
falling for about a quarter of its height it suddenly turns to dust.&nbsp; It is 
heavy dust that continues to drop straight down in place with very little 
dispersion or wind drift, suggesting that the particles were dense, more or less 
what one would expect to see if the steel of the columns had turned all at once 
into a coarse powder.</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>Beyond the mysterious 
shattering and disappearance of the upper ~30% of the core, there is a much more 
serious anomaly.&nbsp; The "spire" stood for about 20 seconds after the debris 
cloud fell away from around it, swaying slightly without tipping over despite 
its height and lack of support.&nbsp;&nbsp; It then began to drop straight down 
in place, but after dropping only a little way it abruptly&nbsp; turned&nbsp; 
into dust <B>in place</B>, very much as the towers themselves did.</FONT></P>

<P align=left>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype">We can use the left-hand edge of 
WTC-7 as a reference to mark the position of the spire relative to the original 
tower.&nbsp; The framing of the picture changes and the view pulls back to a 
wider angle as we go through the sequence, making WTC-7&nbsp; get smaller and 
move a little to the right.&nbsp; Despite this shift we can see that the top of 
the spire as seen in the last picture just matches the midline of the intact 
tower in the first frame, indicating that it was part of the 
core.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype">But if the spire represents a part 
of the core, there is something else shown here that is very unusual.&nbsp; Why 
does main dust cloud from the collapse move off to the left, leaving the spire 
off by itself?&nbsp; In fact the spire has a smaller dust cloud of its own that 
can be seen in the second and third frames, a remnant left behind as the axis of 
the collapse shifts, but most of the material in the cloud is now off to the 
left, still in a more or less cylindrical distribution.&nbsp; The midline of the 
collapse actually shifted <B>during</B> the collapse; this very dense 
pyroclastic slurry of pulverized concrete, gypsum and building contents somehow 
shifted its center of mass away from its original location, centered on the 
core.&nbsp; And what is that odd vertical cloud of smoke at the center?&nbsp; A 
gravitational collapse should create a net downward movement of the dust cloud, 
without such a vertical jet of smoke.&nbsp; In fact close-up pictures of the 
WTC-2 collapse show the&nbsp; debris cloud being pulled back in toward the 
center of the collapse, indicating a negative pressure.</FONT></P>

<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><B><font face="Palatino Linotype" size="5">Some Thoughts in the 
Face of the Impossible</font></B></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>What could possibly be going 
on here?&nbsp; I really wish this were an artifact, that the resolution of the 
images wasn't good enough to quite make out what is going on.&nbsp; But the 
remarkable consistency between what we see in the video clip and in the still 
images, particularly the single shot taken the instant after it had turned to 
dust, creates the unavoidable impression that in some mysterious way the steel 
columns shatter into dust.</FONT>&nbsp; <FONT face="Palatino Linotype" 
size=3>Could stresses generated during the collapse have weakened the 
steel?&nbsp;</FONT> <FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>Perhaps the shockwaves 
of those "dust ejections" (whatever name you may apply, they look a lot like 
explosions) that we saw during the collapses has&nbsp; changed the 
microcrystalline grain structure of the remaining steel in such a way&nbsp; that 
it became extremely brittle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something very unusual has happened to 
these particular steel beams, something that caused them to not merely topple or 
crumple in segments but to disintegrate in place.&nbsp; It is difficult to 
imagine any mechanism during a gravity driven collapse that could so alter the 
structure of steel that it might disintegrate under its own weight - no amount 
of shaking can create that kind of metal fatigue.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>The selectivity of the 
initial collapse that left behind this portion of the core while removing the 
rest is also difficult to explain. &nbsp;Consider how cleanly the cross-braces 
have been sliced off along that single column at the top, short pieces of the 
vertical plates welded to each of the core columns sheared off without so much 
as generating enough force to pull down this single unsupported column.&nbsp; 
Something very energetic has removed the rest of the building from around this 
slender structure with remarkable delicacy, shattering and utterly removing all 
but this small bundle of surviving columns.&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the same time 
something has caused the center of mass of the thousands of tons of 
debris&nbsp;from the building to shift several hundred feet from the 
original location during the ten seconds or so of its collapse, leaving the 
spire well outside the debris cloud that has spawned it.&nbsp; This cannot be 
wind drift, for the debris cloud was much too dense and fast-moving to drift 
like smoke.</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>Could electrostatic forces 
generated by movement of particles account for some of this?&nbsp; Could the 
pyroclastic slurry of the collapse function like a thunderhead or Van de Graff 
generator, perhaps accounting for the visible glow as well as the displacement 
of the dust cloud?&nbsp; Could electrostatic repulsion somehow push the dust 
cloud off to the side?&nbsp; The final bimodal dust cloud seems very 
inconsistent with the extreme symmetry of the early stages of the collapse, so 
some asymmetric force must be at work.&nbsp; And could the force involved also 
have created the bright glow visible in so many images of the collapses?&nbsp; 
The following picture (from Eric Huffschmid's <A 
href="http://members.aol.com/erichuf/PainfulQuestions_1.pdf">"Painful 
Questions"</A>)&nbsp; shows the glow on the upper left, with debris flying out 
in all directions, but in an oddly asymmetric pattern:&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT face="Palatino Linotype" size=3>Something inescapably strange 
is going on in these pictures, something no official explanation of the 
collapses has come close to accounting for.&nbsp; Beyond this I make no claims, 
and have no insider knowledge.&nbsp; Based on the photographic evidence there
can be no question that explosives, and 
possibly other weapons systems based on &quot;black technologies&quot; were used in the WTC demolitions.&nbsp; 
Otherwise one can only suppose that the laws of physics underwent a profound but temporary change on 
September 11, 2001, as indeed the political and moral climate of our country
underwent a dark and fateful change.&nbsp; And it is precisely this change that
was clearly the intent behind the vast high-tech magic show that was 9/11.&nbsp; In politics as in physics, things do not happen for 
no reason.</FONT></P>
