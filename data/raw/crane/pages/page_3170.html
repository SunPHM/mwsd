      <td><P><strong><font size="5">I</font>n early April of 1998 while driving 
          cross-country on my first visit to the Peace Pilgrim Center in Hemet</strong>, 
          I found myself outside of Lincoln, Nebraska on a cold, gray, rainy afternoon. 
          I was looking for Don Tilly and the Prairie Peace Park, a 28 acre teaching 
          center dedicated to peace.<br>
          <br>
          I had met Don in New Jersey a week earlier and was taking him up on 
          an invitation to visit on my way west. I pulled up to the gate of the 
          Peace Park as it was getting dark. Don took me to dinner at a nearby 
          restaurant and we returned for a tour. The rain and darkness prohibited 
          a visit to the outdoor attractions so we walked slowly through the rooms 
          of the main building as Don explained the significance of the various 
          displays.<br>
          <br>
          One story in particular captured my attention. It was about a Japanese 
          girl named Sadako Sasaki. Sadako was two years old and a resident of 
          Hiroshima when the first atomic bomb used on a civilian population was 
          dropped on that city on August 6, 1945. When she was eleven, Sadako 
          developed leukemia a common disease among children exposed to atomic 
          radiation.<br>
          <br>
          While being treated in the hospital, Sadako was visited by a friend 
          who taught her to fold paper origami cranes. An old Japanese legend 
          stated that anyone who folded 1000 cranes would be granted a wish. In 
          Japan the crane is symbolic of long life, health, and peace. Sadako&#8217;s 
          wish was to be returned to good health and beyond that that all children 
          who innocently suffer from the consequences of war would be healed and 
          that in the future no children should so suffer. Inspired to realize 
          this dream, Sadako began her quest to fold 1000 cranes.<br>
          <br>
          In the following months Sadako managed to fold over 600 cranes. But 
          her disease gradually worsened and finally claimed her life. Her classmates, 
          inspired by her courage, folded the remainder and she was buried with 
          1000 origami cranes. The story of Sadako&#8217;s quest and courage spread 
          all over Japan and children throughout the country folded &#8220;Peace 
          Cranes&#8221; and raised money to build a children&#8217;s memorial 
          in the Hiroshima Peace Park. In 1958, three years after her death, the 
          monument became a reality. It shows Sadako standing on the mountain 
          of paradise holding a giant golden origami crane overhead in her outstretched 
          arms. At its base is the inscription, &#8220;This is our cry, this is 
          our prayer, Peace in the World.&#8221;<br>
          <br>
          I had never heard this story before but was deeply moved by it and fascinated 
          by the delicate paper cranes. Don kindly let me unroll my sleeping bag 
          on the floor in a room not far from the Sadako display and I spent the 
          night safe and dry as the cold rain fell in the darkness outside.<br>
          <br>
          The next morning I continued west across Nebraska. The clouds had begun 
          to break up and light slowly began to seep back into the wet landscape 
          as I traveled through the rolling grasslands bordering the North Platte 
          River. I was surprised to notice some large birds standing in the fields 
          along the highway. As I drove on into the morning, the flocks grew larger 
          and larger until these tall gray birds with huge wingspans and red spots 
          at the top of their heads filled the fields and the sky.<br>
          <br>
          In the midst of my amazement at this awesome sight, the memory of a 
          news story heard a few weeks earlier came to mind. It had described 
          a major migration that was taking place in the American west &#8211; 
          that of the Sandhill Crane. With a rush of association that brought 
          goose bumps to my arms and a tingle to the back of my neck, I connected 
          the story I had heard the night before with the spectacle unfolding 
          around me. Over the next 150 mile I drove by as many as 50,000 migrating 
          Sandhill Cranes who flew Sadako&#8217;s story across the Nebraska sky. 
          I felt I was receiving a great blessing and have since thought of it 
          as my &#8220;Gift of Cranes.&#8221;<br>
          <br>
          But the story doesn&#8217;t end here. The next chapter unfolded about 
          two weeks later when I arrived at the Peace Pilgrim Center in Hemet, 
          California. One of the very first things I noticed when I entered the 
          house was a large bowl of paper origami cranes sitting on the kitchen 
          table and almost immediately after that discovered a copy of the book 
          &#8220;Sadako and the 1000 Cranes&#8221; on top of a pile in the front 
          room. That tingle was back in my neck.<br>
          <br>
          I read the book immediately and a few days later met the woman who had 
          folded the cranes and had her teach me how to create them myself. I 
          have since tried to fold at least one crane every day, and think of 
          each as a &#8220;prayer for peace&#8221;. I have had the great pleasure 
          of passing along these messengers of peace as I travel and enjoy sharing 
          the story of my &#8220;gift&#8221; and teaching others the magic of 
          turning squares of paper into delicate origami cranes.<br>
          <br>
          In early 1999 I discovered a website about a grammar school in Hiroshima 
          that sponsored a yearly &#8220;cranes for peace&#8221; project. Working 
          with a group of children and adults at my local church, I told the story 
          of Sadako and gave instructions in folding origami cranes. Over the 
          course of the next few months, our group folded cranes and strung them 
          in groups of 100 until we had collected 1000. These were sent to the 
          school in Japan and joined 87,000 others from all over the world that 
          were brought to the Children&#8217;s Peace Memorial in the first week 
          of August as part of the school&#8217;s annual peace ceremony.<br>
          <br>
          I have since completed a personal 1000 origami cranes. They hang, for 
          now, in the sanctuary of the church I attend in Connecticut. But I have 
          other plans for them. On December 12th of this year, 2001 people will 
          gather in Hiroshima to pray for peace. I plan to be there with my cranes. 
          They and I will complete a journey that began over two years ago: one 
          that will take them home to the source of their inspiration. To rest, 
          at last, in the shadow of the statue of Sadako - a young Japanese girl 
          I never knew &#8211; who changed my life on a rainy night in the middle 
          of Nebraska.
