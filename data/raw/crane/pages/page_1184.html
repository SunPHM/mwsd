<br><b><font size=+1>A VIDEO ON JOB SITE LIFTING WITH&nbsp;<a NAME="RIGGING MOBILE"></a>MOBILE
CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT</font></b></center>

<p>BURLINGTON, WI (April 1, 1997) <a href="http://www.deere.com/">Deere
&amp; Company</a>, <a href="http://www.industry.net/crosby">the Crosby
Group</a>, National Utility Contractors Association and VISTA have come
together to create an instructional video on correct rigging and lifting
techniques when using mobile construction equipment, other than cranes
<a href="../../prodserv/videos/Videodes.htm#RIGGING_AND_LIFTING_WITH_MOBILE_CONSTRUC">(Rigging
and Lifting With Mobile Construction Equipment)</a>.
<p>Engineers and safety experts at the John Deere Industrial Division realize
that equipment owners will use their backhoe, excavator, or wheel loader
to sling load materials on job sites. This is a practice as old as the
invention of mechanical lifting&nbsp;<img SRC="Rigging.jpg" ALT="Rigging with Deere" height=166 width=250 align=RIGHT>equipment.
While only cranes and forklifts are specifically designed as material handlers,
owners of mobile construction equipment will load and unload all types
of materials with any equipment at hand. The problem is - how to do it
safely.
<p>Deere approached VISTA and while VISTA was doing research for the project,
the Crosby Group, the nation's premier manufacturer of rigging hardware,
became involved as a sponsor and technical advisor. NUCA, the National
Utility Contractors Association also volunteered to participate by providing
the services of George Kennedy, CSP, the NUCA on-staff Certified Safety
Professional in an advisory capacity.
<p>Ray Peterson, President of VISTA, said, "The level of support we received
from these high-quality organizations brings together a pool of qualified
talent not ordinarily available on a project of this nature. The wealth
of practical, real-world advice VISTA received in creating this video is
simply not for hire. We are extremely fortunate in being involved in the
creation of this video that provides such a wealth of down-to-earth safety
information about rigging and lifting of loads on working job sites."
<p>Video taping was done in a variety of locations lifting everything from
trench boxes to buried liquid storage tanks. Loads, such as odd shaped,
unbalanced pre-cast concrete structures, require special considerations.
Knowing how to select the right sling and rigging hardware, the type of
hitch to use, how to adjust the hitch for balance and equal stress on each
leg are all covered in this twenty-five minute video.
<p>How and why to use special attachment points on excavators, backhoes
or wheel loaders becomes very clear when you see the possible results of
doing it incorrectly. The reason to discard damaged rigging hardware and
slings also becomes clear as the viewer watches a sling break in less than
1/30th of a second. Seeing is believing, and this video will make a believer
out of anyone who ever threw a chain over a bucket just to pick up this
one little pipe.
