<P>Yesterday, January 5, the outdoor air temperature at 39
degrees F. in the afternoon, you would think that someone had
sprinkled coarse black pepper or iron filings all over the snow.
Literally millions upon millions of infinitesimally tiny
snowfleas were having their day on the surface of the snow.  The
tracks I made on my hike into the woods were, upon my return,
absolutely &quot;peppered&quot; with these tiny
one-sixteenth-inch creatures.

<P>All one had to do to detect their movements was to concentrate
upon a small area having a dozen or more of the outwardly
immobile &quot;specks.&quot;  Suddenly, like magic, one of the
specks simply disappeared, and if you watched very carefully you
could easily follow its short movement through the air to where
it landed.

<P>Henry David Thoreau, in his journal, said of them: they are
tiny specks of life &quot;…whose summer and prime of life is a
thaw in winter.&quot;  The winter thaws &quot;…call to life the
snowfleas.&quot;  It is a rare occasion to see these miniature,
primitively wingless insects during any other time of the year
except on a day above freezing when the ground is covered with
snow.

<P>Fortunately these amazingly small but agile insects are not
even remotely related to the fleas that many pet owners hope
won’t affect their cats or dogs.  In fact, of the 314 species of
snowfleas, better known as springtails, that have been recorded
in North America, most feed upon disintegrated organic matter in
the forest-floor duff, especially pollen found in leaf litter.

<P>They have no metamorphosis and, during growth, shed their
skins at intervals.  Their life cycle is an example of growth by
direct development from the embryo to the adult.  After mating,
their eggs are scattered in holes in the soil.  The young feed
and grow during the summer and mature by early winter.
Springtails are most active on warm winter days and especially in
early spring when they mate.

<P>Their name, springtail, originates from the fact that the
fourth abdominal segment bears a forked &quot;furcula&quot; or
spring that normally is folded forward under the abdomen.  The
third body segment is equipped with a &quot;tenaculum&quot; or
triggerlike catch.  Indeed, they neither walk nor fly – they
catapult!  Their random &quot;leaps&quot; can be anywhere from
three to four inches in length, really quite a feat for an insect
this small.  Well, they may walk but at such a slow rate of speed
that one would practically need a hand lens to detect this
movement.

<P>I estimated the depth of snow in the woods last Friday to be
around ten to twelve inches.  My guess is that the springtails
definitely were not moving through that much snow but rather
slowly climbing and springing their ways upward along tree trunks
of all sizes.  In examining even half-inch-wide tree saplings I
could easily detect space between the trunk and the snow and also
invariably some springtails near the plants.

<P>In addition to the &quot;thunderous&quot; movement of the
 springtails in our woods, we’ve also been enjoying plenty of
 activity in our butterfly garden.  The &quot;butterflies&quot;
 in this case happen to be tree sparrows, American goldfinches
 and dark-eyed juncos actively feasting on the seeds of the plant
 remains.  Those having very strong and rigid stems, thereby
 holding seed heads well above the snow, are purple coneflowers,
 black-eyed Susans and the tall species of tithonias, better
 known as Mexican sunflowers.

<P>The pecking by the birds of the seed heads naturally causes
plenty of seeds to fall to the ground, so at one instant there
may be a dozen or more birds feeding anywhere from ground level
up to the tallest of the dried plants.  Experience has taught us
to not clean up the butterfly garden, come late fall, but to
rather leave the dried seeds for the birds.  Give them a while –
they’ll eventually find them.

<P>Next year we’re going to enlarge upon the plantings in the
butterfly garden by adding several kinds of sunflowers,
rudbeckias, gaillardias, some of the taller daisies, and other
annuals or perennials whose dried remains are rigid enough to
withstand the rigors of weather.  We’re open for suggestions.

<P>Within the first couple of years after moving into our new
home in the woods we were quite surprised to encounter hundreds
of weeds surrounding the house. They obviously had been brought
here, in the form of seeds, with the so-called &quot;fill&quot;
that was used to bring the east and west banks of our property up
to grade along the foundation.  I think it was during the second
winter that we looked out our east kitchen window one winter day
to see around 50 common redpolls feasting on the seeds of the
many pigweeds that grew there.

<P>Indeed, the seeds of dozens of common weeds, plus the
overwintering flower seeds in your garden, help to sustain many
birds throughout the winter.
