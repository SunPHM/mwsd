<b><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT  COLOR="black" SIZE=2 FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> In the far Northern lands,
during the Summer days, when even the nights, are still day, arrives a
bird named, Whooper, the Whooping Crane.&nbsp; This flying creature of
the earth, is a tall, skinny legged bird, with a long bill and blue eyes.
This is the story, about how Whooper, and all the other Whooping Cranes
got blue eyes.
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; Now, as told to me, by a man
of the Native Clan, whom I'd just met, by him, asking me, the most unusual
question I'd ever been asked.&nbsp; It appears, this was his way of starting
a new friendship, by using this question as a conversation opener.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; He asked me this query,
as if, I might know the answer, "Do you know how Whooper, the Whooping
Crane got blue eyes?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind, unprepared for
a question such as this, thought silently, "What did he ask?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Being unsure of what this
man had asked and being a person, whom I have never spoke with before,
I answered his question, with questioning words, "Excuse me?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; He repeated his question
to me again, "Do you know how Whooper, the Whooping Crane got blue eyes?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, wanting to
return friendly words, as his voice was a friendly voice, yet, my mind
was wondering if maybe this man might be touched in the head or something,
I answered, "No, I do not know how Whooper, the Whooping Crane got blue
eyes."</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; I, then reversed the question,
by asking him, "Why? Do you know how Whooper, the Whooping Crane got blue
eyes?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I do!" Answered
the man who'd first asked me this silly question.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at this time, I
asked him, "Then, why did you ask me?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, "I just wanted
to know if you knew the story about how Whooper, the Whooping Crane got
blue eyes!"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This Storyteller, of the
Native Clan who was talking to me, proceeded with this story, and this
is the story I was told, as I remembered his words:</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago, there
was a Whooping Crane, by the name of Whooper, who flew about, gliding in
the crisp spring air. His wings were spread out in majestic array, as he
looked the land over, by flying up high in the sky. The bird looked far
and wide, to be sure there were no foxes around, or other creatures who
might bother him when he lands on the ground to finally take a bath and
build a nest. He had to find a place before the female</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whooping Cranes arrived, so one of
them would choose him as a mate.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; As Whooper, the Whooping
Crane viewed the land, with his huge huge eyes, he spotted a pond to wash
himself, after this long journey from the South.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This large bird, angled
his wings, for the descent from the sky and came slowly down to the ground,
landing in the water of the pond. When Whooper,&nbsp; the Whooping Crane
had landed, as a protective measure, and, to be sure there were no foxes
around, he looked far and wide again. It was the only way to be sure, he
was safe before he plunked his head under the water, filling his bill,
to spray water on himself and clean his feathers and body.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, Whooper looked around and proceeded
to wash.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the pond water went
his head. Then, his head popped back up and out of the water to look all
about again. After looking all about,&nbsp; Whooper, the Whooping Crane
cleaned, what needed to be cleaned!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, his Eyes became
tired of opening and shutting, not to mention, bobbing in and bobbing out
of the water, time and time again.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Whooper's Eyes
spoke up. "Whooper, why don't you take each of us Eyes out of your head,
while you wash and set each of us on a separate rock? We can keep watch
for foxes and other creatures of alarm, while you wash. Then, we won't
get tired from bobbing in and out of the water all the time."</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whooper, the Whooping
Crane thought about this and decided, that indeed, this was a very good
idea. So, he took out his Eyes and placed each of them on a separate rock,
to keep watch for foxes and any other creature, whom may want to disturb
or cause him</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">alarm, while he took a bath.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; By Whooper's, placing
his Eyes on two separate rocks, his Eyes, were able to look in two different
directions, at the same time, while Whooper, the Whooping Crane continued
to wash.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, a Fox who just happened
to be wandering, not far from this pond, and who like all the other foxes,
had a very keen sense of sight and hearing, overheard this conversation
between Whooper and his Eyes. The Fox immediately took cover and hid behind
a Blueberry Bush.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the Fox's ear's
keen hearing, the Fox listened to what the conversation was about.&nbsp;
After the Fox heard this conversation, the Fox kept himself hidden behind
the Blueberry Bush, as he watched this large bird take out each of his
Eyes and</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">place each of the two Eyes, on a rock.
It happened, just as it was spoken and agreed to, between the bird and
his eyes. Each one of the Eyes were now, looking in a different directions,
as guards for Whooper, the Whooping Crane.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Human saying goes,
"As sharp as a Fox!" So, it was in this situation, too! And, what the humans
say, surely has merit, for the Fox using his wit from the very beginning
of this encounter had hidden behind a Blueberry Bush.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching these happenings,
the Fox reasoned that&nbsp; Whooping Crane's Eyes could only look in two
directions, and by his wit, recognized that there are four directions that
must be observed for safety's sake. The Fox thought about the matter and
decided what to do.&nbsp; So the Fox, still under the cover of the Blueberry
Bush picked two Blueberries from the Blueberry Bush and positioned himself
to approach the Whooping Crane and his Eyes, from one of the directions
that the two Eyes could not properly observe.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, that
the Fox was creeping closer, the Whooping Crane's two Eyes were continually
keeping watch for a fox or other creatures, in directions, where neither
Eye could see the Fox or the Fox's approach.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fox snuck closer and
closer without being seen.&nbsp; He was so close, that finally, the Fox
came up from behind one of the rocks, that held the First Eye. The Fox
reached from behind the rock and grabbed the First Eye. He then replaced
the First Eye with one of the Blueberries he'd picked from the Blueberry
Bush.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fox then, snuck over&nbsp;
to the other rock and replaced the Second Eye, with the Second Blueberry,
he'd picked. After replacing each Eye of the Whooping Crane's with a Blueberry,
the Fox then quietly snuck away with both of&nbsp; Whooper's Eyes.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whooper, the Whooping
Crane was unaware of what has happening.&nbsp; After Whooper had dunked
his head under the water for the last time of his bath, he then went to
each of the rocks that held each of his Eyes. Unknown to him, his Eyes
were not there!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whooper, the Whooping
Crane grasped the Blueberries, from each of the rocks that held his Eyes,
and put them back in his head.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What Whooper thought were his Eyes
were really Blueberries!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whooper could never figure out why
his Eyes never spoke to him again.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; And, because Whooper was
the first Whooping Crane in the Northern land, all the female Whooping
Cranes, came to him first.&nbsp; And, from that time on,&nbsp; all of the
baby Whooping Cranes had blue eyes, just like Whooper's. And, this is how
Whooper, the Whooping Crane and all the other Whooping Cranes got Blue
Eyes, except for every once in a while, there would be a brown eyed Whooping
Crane name, Whoopee, the Whooping Crane!</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at this point in
the story, that the Storyteller spoke no more words to me.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, me being the man,
who was listening to this story, I asked the Storyteller. "But, what happened
to the Fox and Whooper, the Whooping Crane's huge huge eyes, that the Fox
had stolen? And, who is this Whoopee, the Whooping Crane that has brown
eyes? Where did this Whooping Crane come from?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Storyteller, who had
just finished telling me this Story started to giggle and answered my question
by saying, "I do not know!"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; I confusingly responded,
"What do you mean, you don't know?"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Storyteller repeated
himself, adding, "I said, I do not know! The story was told to me when
I was a child, by my Grandfather. I fell asleep before Grandpa finished
the Story. It</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was his misfortune to pass away, that
very night. In fact, I have always wondered what happened to the Fox and
Whooper the Whooping Crane's Huge Huge Eyes myself, not to mention I have
always wondered, who this Whoopee the brown-eyed Whooping Crane is!"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; This response left my
mind a blank and my only reaction was to say, "Oh!"</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the Storyteller
began to chuckle, after, observing my dumbfounded expression, to his answer
of my question.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as the Writer of these
words, and as the new Storyteller, this is what I know about how Whooper,
and all the other Whooping Cranes got blue eyes! Except one, who, as a
Whooping Crane named Whoopee, every once in a while, some how, is born
with brown</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">eyes.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
