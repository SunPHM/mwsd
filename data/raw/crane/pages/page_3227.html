<p>The Grade 5/6 class at North Queens Elementary have been involved in an
on-line exchange program called, 'Kids from Kanata'.&nbsp; We have been grouped
in a triad including two other schools from British Columbia, North Poplar Fine
Arts School and Trout Creek School.&nbsp; We have become pen pals on-line with
the students in these schools.&nbsp; Along with exchanging information about our
interests, hobbies, favourite subjects, sports and music, etc., we have also
been working throughout the year compiling a package that represents us, as a
people.&nbsp; We have prepared an ancestor study which presented our heritage on
a personal level, a community study, giving recognition to the local features of
the area, a collection of pictures that tell a story of growth in the time we
have shared together at school, a First Nations study acknowledging the rich
culture of the Mi'k maq in Nova Scotia and finally, we have made a connection to
our past.</p>

<p align="center"><b><font size="4">McGowan Lake Fish Hatchery</font></b></p>
<p align="left">This facility is operated by the Nova Scotia Department of
Fisheries.&nbsp; It is open to the public for tours.&nbsp; Its main goal is to
help ensure the future of trout fishing in western Nova Scotia.&nbsp; The area
is one of many acid-stressed lakes and streams. Evidence concludes that the
chances of fish surviving in the area are limited.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="kids_f6.jpg" width="340" height="223"></p>
<p align="left">The speckled (brook) trout raised in the McGowan Lake Hatchery
are reared from eggs.&nbsp; About one million fish start out as fall fingerlings
or yearlings and are raised yearly at this location.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="kids_f8.jpg" width="337" height="228"></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="kids_f10.jpg" width="337" height="230"></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="kids_f7.jpg" width="338" height="227"></p>
<p align="left">The water supply for the hatchery comes from McGowan Lake which
measures a highly acidic pH level (&lt;5.0) for much of the year.&nbsp; However,
the hatchery possesses two unique features for dealing with high acidity.&nbsp;
One such feature is an 'intake control building' that was designed&nbsp; and
constructed to treat the 22000 litres per minute of water.&nbsp; The mixing
chamber allows temperature and oxygen levels to be regulated and the lining bed
buffers the naturally acidic water.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="kids_f9.jpg" width="335" height="230"></p>
<p align="left">Another feature is the 'oxygen generation and injection
system'.&nbsp; This provides additional oxygen to maintain the ideal growing
conditions that are required for the trout.</p>

Presentations</font></b><p align="left">Through the various First Nations
visitors that have come to North Queens Elementary School, we have learned more
about the Mi'k maq culture.&nbsp; They brought their knowledge and experience
with them and presented to us through a variety of ways their history, language,
stories, beliefs, art and music.<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>I
learned a lot about the art work.&nbsp; When we made our own bracelets and
necklaces, we had to represent something about the person that was making
them.&nbsp; Mine, represented the keys on the piano, black and white, because I
play the piano.</b></font><p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">We had to
tell the group why we chose our colours for the jewelery.&nbsp; My colours were
blue and green.&nbsp; Mine represented the water and the land.&nbsp; I wished
that everything on the water and land would have a happy life.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">I
learned how to say the words bear, eagle, lobster and beaver in the Mi'k maq
language.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#800080">The group that I
was in did a study on the spirit helper.&nbsp; We found out that everyone has a
spirit helper.&nbsp; A spirit helper can be any kind of animal or person.&nbsp;
We also learned that there are different ways to awaken the spirit helper.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#FF0000">I
found out that the eagle feather is of great significance to the Mi'k maq
culture.&nbsp; It is given only when someone does something special or
accomplishes something great in life.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#808000">We
learned about the sweat lodge.&nbsp; It is a place where one goes to get in touch
with the Creator.&nbsp; People can pray in silence once inside the lodge.&nbsp;
When one comes out of the sweat lodge, one feels reborn.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#00FF00">I
learned that you&nbsp; have to pay a lot of respect to your siblings and
elders.&nbsp; I think it is a fascinating culture and I would like to learn as
much as I can.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#808000">I learned that
the Mi'k maq only took from the earth what they needed.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#800080">The
circle is very significant to the Mi'k maq people.&nbsp; The circle represents
the universe.&nbsp; It symbolizes the life cycle.&nbsp; It is the shape of a
drum, a fire pit, a wigwam, the path an eagle takes when it soars, the sun and
the moon.&nbsp; All of these things are important to the Mi'k Maq.</font></b><p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>We
were in a group that did a study on the traditional Wigwam.&nbsp; It was made
out of spruce poles, birch bark and spruce roots.&nbsp; Inside there was an
arrangement to the seating.&nbsp; The elders were seated on the opposite side of
the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The adults were seated on either side of the elders
and the children were opposite the elders.&nbsp; The fire pit was in the middle
of the wigwam.&nbsp; The wigwams were made with great care.</b></font><p align="left"><b><font color="#FF00FF">We
saw many items that were made by the Mi'k maq.&nbsp; There were baskets, snow
shoes, tools to cook with and tools to make things with, small canoes, drums,
musical instruments, clothing and beadwork.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#0000FF">We
learned of hunting techniques and cooking techniques.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#008000">We
looked at artifacts that have been preserved from the past.</font></b><p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>&nbsp;We
learned of games that were played by the&nbsp; Mi'k maq children.</b></font><p align="left"><b><font color="#800080">We
learned of the natural medicines.&nbsp; There are many plants and herbs that
when used, will help with colds, toothache, fever, pain, etc.</font></b><p align="left"><b><font color="#FF00FF">We
learned of the traditional roles of men and women.&nbsp; One such role of the
men was to hunt and fish and the women would always prepare the food.</font></b><p align="left"><font color="#0000FF"><b>The
'Talking Circle' was an interesting idea.&nbsp; The people would sit in a circle
and the one that held the stick would be the one permitted to speak.&nbsp; When
that person was finished talking, they would pass the stick to the next person
to speak.&nbsp; In this way, nobody would interrupt anyone.&nbsp; They only
spoke when they had the stick.</b></font><p align="left">&nbsp;<p align="center"><b><font size="6">Student's
