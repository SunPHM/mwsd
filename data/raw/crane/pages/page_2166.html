		  <h3>Crane Update</h3>
         	  <p>October 17, 2001</p>
		  
		  <p><b>Lift Off and Recovery of a Wayward Crane!</b><br>
Necedah National Wildlife Refuge<br>
by Bob Manwell, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership</p>
		  
		  <p align="center"><img src="../../../images/photos/nwr-event1.jpg" width="400" height="280" border="3"></p>
        <p>At 7:15 A.M. central daylight time, a group of eight whooping cranes 
          left the ground following two ultralight aircraft on the first leg of 
          a human-led migration that will teach them a route to wintering grounds 
          at Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in Florida.<br>
          This is the first group of what wildlife biologists, crane experts and 
          pilots hope will become a migrating flock of whooping cranes in eastern 
          North America.</p>
          <p>Shortly after take off one crane, known as number four, dropped out 
          of the flight formation and proceeded to lead tracking and recovery 
          teams on a day-long chase across Adams and Juneau counties. <br>
          The following is a chronology of the days events. </p>
        <p><b>7:15 A.M</b>. - Take off from Necedah National Wildlife Refuge. 
        </p>
        <p><b>7:30 A.M</b>. - First report by radio that #4 had dropped out and 
          landed approximately eight miles south of the refuge along the western 
          shore of Castle Rock Lake. The report included a position fix from a 
          chase aircraft flown by Operation Migration's Bill Lishman. </p>
        <p><b>8:00 - 10:00 A.M</b>. - Crane biologist, Richard Urbanek, drove 
          to the position fix and scanned the area with his truck-mounted directional 
          radio antenna, attempting to pick up the signal from a transmitter each 
          crane in the study wears on its leg. Richard was unable to hear anything 
          at that spot and began to work his way back toward the refuge take off 
          site, monitoring the radio as he went. </p>
        <p><b>10:20 A.M</b>. - Second and third tracking vehicles with Barry Hartup 
          and Sarah Zimorski, both from International Crane Foundation, also began 
          searching for the crane's signal along the eastern shore of the lake. 
          "I knew all the transmitters were working when the birds left ," said 
          Urbanek. "Not finding the bird where the pilots said it dropped out 
          meant it probably took off again right after landing, before we could 
          get there. The transmitters only have about a three mile range. If the 
          bird has moved beyond that or is in a low spot, we can have a difficult 
          time picking up the signal." </p>
        <p><b>11:27 A.M</b>. - From opposite sides of Castle Rock Lake both Urbanek 
          and Hartup, who was now at Quincy Bluff, picked up a weak signal that 
          appeared to come from the area near where the crane was last seen. Following 
          the signal, Urbanek headed down a dirt road to the lake shore hoping 
          for a visual sighting. </p>
        <p><b>11:40 A.M</b>. - No visual sighting but the directional antenna 
          indicated that the bird was moving to the north. Urbanek decided to 
          cross over to the east side of the lake as it appeared the bird had 
          crossed the water. Hartup called Zimorski to join him and rendevous 
          with Urbanek. </p>
        <p><b>1:14 P.M.</b> - Urbanek met up with Hartup/Zimorski at Castle Rock 
          County Park and the two crews continued to scan the skies with binoculars 
          and monitor the directional radio receiver. "The direction of the signal 
          kept changing," said Hartup. "This indicated the bird was in the air, 
          riding thermals in an upward spiral. We couldn't see him, and that was 
          frustrating, but at the same time, he was flying like a wild crane, 
          drifting upward on rising thermals, letting the warm air carry him. 
          This is exactly the way we hope these cranes will fly on their own." 
          "With the bird in the air, there wasn't much we could do except continue 
          to monitor his signal and wait for him to land," said Urbanek. </p>
        <p><b>2:25 P.M</b>. - Joe Duff, Deke Clark and Rebecca Cohen-Pardo of 
          Operation Migration and Dan Sprague of USGS-Patuxent arrived and almost 
          immediately, the bird's signal began to fade indicating he was descending. 
          The combined tracking team began to move north. </p>
        <p><b>2:39 P.M</b>. - Within a few miles, the signal was lost altogether. 
          After zig-zagging north on dirt and gravel roads without picking up 
          the signal, the team decided to split up again and continue to search 
          for the signal in different areas. </p>
        <p><b>4:00 P.M.</b> - Urbanek returns to Necedah NWF and meets with the 
          OM crew of Duff, Clark and Cohen-Pardo. He picks up a weak signal to 
          the northwest. The other members of the search crew are called and head 
          toward Necedah. </p>
        <p><b>4:30 P.M</b>. - The OM group remains at Necedah, monitoring the 
          signal while Urbanek moves in the direction of the signal hoping to 
          get the bird between him and OM's location. In the meantime, Hartup, 
          Sprague and Zimorski arrive and begin to zero in on the bird's location 
          which is now determined to be along a lakeshore on the Wisconsin Department 
          of Natural Resources' Meadow Valley Wildlife Management Area. </p>
        <p><b>5:05 - 5:20 P.M</b>. - Sprague and Zimorski put on crane costumes 
          and with a hand-held radio receiver and a loudspeaker head into dense 
          woods along the lakeshore. The loudspeaker is used to play crane calls and attract the cranes. 
          "Sarah, Richard and Barry did an excellent job of tracking the bird 
          all day," said Sprague. "They deserve a lot of credit for the eventual 
          recovery of #4. "Sarah had the radio receiver and was directing us toward 
          the signal. The bird was on the shore of a lake with woods right to 
          the edge of it. We reached the shore near the bird and played a contact 
          call which brought the bird to us.</p>
          <p>I carefully lifted the bird, Sarah slipped a hood over its head and 
          we carried it out to the road where it was put into a crane- transport 
          box and driven to the landing site where the other cranes were resting 
          overnight.</p>
          <p>Bob Manwell: "As a public affairs manager for Wisconsin Department of 
          Natural Resources, I've accompanied wildlife biologists tracking wolves, 
          moose, rattlesnakes, turtles and trumpeter swans but this was by far 
          the most exciting search I've participated in. <br>
          Watching the birds and aircraft depart in the early morning mists, being 
          in the radio- tracking vehicles, glassing the skies and shorelines and 
          finally after an all-day search finding the crane, left me with the 
          incredibly good feeling that I've personally helped this bird and its 
          mates on their journey. A journey that will restore one more piece of our state's natural 	  heritage."</p>
