        engineers the project using CAD/CAE, while the Planning Group schedules

        interact - civil &amp; structural, process, instrumentation, mechanical, 
        electrical, piping, among others.

          out errors at this vital stage so that an accurate Bill of Materials 
          is produced. The result is a more reliable and safer plant at a considerable 
          saving of project time and cost.
