&nbsp;&nbsp;One foggy day, we took a trip to the Imperial Palace, not knowing that in order to be allowed to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;most of it, you need to apply for Imperial permission in advance.  However, anyone can see the grounds.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many <a href="palace1.JPG">old buildings</a> around, most of which are of undiscernable function.  We<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;saw <a href="palace3.JPG">little boy</a> playing in the water near a building we weren't allowed to enter.  Your guess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as to his identity is as good as mine.  The <a href="palace4.JPG">trees</a> in the area were mostly quite stunning.  There<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were a LOT of gardeners out working on them.  The palace, if you are wondering, is still home to Japan's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial family today, which is why most of it remains off-limits without special permission.  Even the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="palacebench.JPG">benches</a> in the area were old and fairly ornate.  There was also a nice <a href="palacebridge.JPG">bridge</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that connects the main area to a small back area, but which is nonetheless very pretty.  <a href="palacebridge2.JPG">Here</a>is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shot of the bridge as viewed from one of the sides.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace is also home to a <a href="palacegarden.JPG">garden</a> which is probably a lot prettier if you aren't visiting it during an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;off-season for flora.  I personally think that Japanese maples are some of the prettiest trees in the world, and <a href="palaceleafy.JPG">these</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are certainly no exception.  As you can tell, fall was beginning to set in (we went in October!).  I like that picture a lot.  There <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were also <a href="palacetrees.JPG">trees</a> at the lake the bridge ran over.  A <a href="palacetrees2.JPG">close-up</a> of some of the flowering trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you could see in the previous shot.  There was also a single small <a href="palaceisland.JPG">island</a> out in the lake, with a small tree living on it.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When we did manage to get inside one of the palace buildings, which was the only one sitting on this lake, I got another shot of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="palacelake2.JPG">the trees and lake</a>, this time from above.  Also, on the lakeshore near where the building was, a rather sizeable amount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of <a href="palacelake.JPG">ivy</a> was growing off of what we were told used to be a little dock.  <a href="palaceivy.JPG">This</a> is a closer shot of the ivy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendrils hanging down into the water near the shore.  A little ways off, a <a href="crane.JPG">crane</a> flew down for a little while.  I hear they are a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty rare site, even in the palace, where they are kept as pets.  I know this one looks fake, but we did see it land and leave, so <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;we're pretty certain that unless it was an advanced water-proof robot, it was real.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, as we left, I got a picture of one of the <a href="palacegate.JPG">gates</a> leading in that has not yet been restored and is currently closed.<br>
