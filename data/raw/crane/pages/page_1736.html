        <span class="body">It's easy to get worked up about West Nile. Courtesy 
        of birds that carry it to new locations, and mosquitoes that inject it 
        into new species, the virus has reached large parts of the Americas, and 
        infected 175 species of vertebrates.</span> </p>
      <p> <span class="body">Not bad for less than four years work.</span>
      <p><img src="images/transmission_cycle.jpg" width="420" height="303" alt="Diagram shows how West Nile virus circulates between birds and mosquitoes, sometimes infecting people or livestock incidentally."> 
      <p> <span class="body"> In the future, the virus could appear almost anywhere 
        in the hemisphere, says USGS biologist Paul Slota. "There's an awful lot 
        of [bird] migration to Alaska, and to Central and South America, the Caribbean, 
        and there's a lot of concern that it will follow bird populations north 
        and south."</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> The peril of bird extinction is particularly acute 
        in Hawaii, where the native birds have already been decimated by mosquitoes 
        carrying bird pox and bird malaria.</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> Epidemics and other ecological changes are most 
        threatening to rare species like the Hawaiian honeycreepers or the California 
        condor since small populations are more susceptible to any problem.</span> 
      <p><img src="images/whooping_crane.jpg" width="324" height="262" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Two tall, long-billed, white whooping cranes stand in clear water, with grass in background."><span class="body">Of 
        particular concern is the whooping crane, a majestic wading bird that 
        almost went extinct in the 1940s. Although whoopers have come back -- 
        about 400 now live in captivity or in the wild -- they remain highly endangered. 
        Fortunately, while West Nile has infected 158 bird species, no whoopers 
        are known to have gotten sick from it, says veterinarian Barry Hartup, 
        who minds the health of dozens of cranes from around the world living 
        at the <a href="http://www.savingcranes.org">International Crane Foundation</a>.</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> It's a slightly different story with the more numerous 
        sandhill cranes, he adds. In 2002, seven chicks of the Mississippi subspecies 
        died at the <a href="http://laregents.org/menu/rescenters/uno/audubon/">Audubon 
        Center for Research of Endangered Species</a>. The center is in New Orleans, 
        where the virus is active.</span> 
      <p> <span class="header"> Cranes shot</span> <br>
        <span class="body"> The threat to endangered birds has sparked test vaccinations 
        against West Nile. At the Audubon Center, six captive whooping cranes, 
        and some Mississippi sandhills, have gotten a vaccine originally designed 
        to protect horses from West Nile. California condors have also gotten 
        an experimental, recombinant DNA vaccine.</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> Tests of West Nile vaccine on greater sandhill cranes, 
        a non-endangered subspecies, at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center 
        and the National Wildlife Health Center were inconclusive. Neither the 
        control nor the experimental animals got sick after being experimentally 
        infected, but the vaccinated birds "developed higher antibody levels and 
        had shorter periods of virus in the bloodstream," says Hartup.</span>

      <p> <span class="header"> Confounding virus<br>
        </span><span class="body">Predicting 
        the future of West Nile is a fool's errand - perfect for Why Filers, in 
        other words. But responsible scientists shy away from predictions. "Nobody 
        really knows, anything anybody says is speculation," says CDC expert Nicholas Komar. 
        So far, West Nile has not followed a path toward lower mortality seen 
        in some epidemics. This welcome, gradual reduction in mortality confers 
        an evolutionary advantage: A virus survives better by infecting its host 
        without killing it. Dead hosts spread less disease than live ones.</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> The virulence -- infectivity and mortality -- of 
        West Nile has been fairly stable since it arrived, says Komar. And while 
        it's true that mutations can help diseases lose their viciousness, he 
        says, "It can work the other way around as well. They occasionally evolve 
        into being more deadly, and this may be one of those instances. ... In 
        this case, we are probably dealing with a mutation that leads to greater 
        virulence, allows the virus to spread more quickly."</span> 
      <p><img src="images/airplane.jpg" width="263" height="149" align="right" alt="A jet airplane soars amid stormy clouds."><span class="caption">For 
        long-distance disease movement, nothing beats a jet plane. A jet may well 
        have imported West Nile to New York in 1999. </span><span class="courtesy"><a href="http://www.nycwasteless.com/gov-bus/">City 
        of New York</a>.</span><p> <span class="header"> A flying start</span> <br>
        <span class="body"> One thing is certain, however. West Nile, like SARS, 
        is a disease of the jet-plane era. Just as SARS jumped the Pacific Ocean 
        from China to Canada, West Nile apparently moved from Israel -- site of 
        an identical viral strain -- to the United States via jet plane. The outbreak 
        "is a consequence of environmental change," says Komar. "Something happened 
        in the environment that allowed it to come to this country."</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> Like the Spanish galleons of old, the jet an equal-opportunity 
        transporter, hauling people and pathogens alike and creating opportunities 
        for other <a href="../121emerg_infect/index.html">emerging infections</a>.</span> 
      <p> <span class="body"> But if the future of West Nile is not predictable, 
        history does offer a sobering caution. "West Nile has spread a lot in 
        the last four years, and it will probably continue to spread," says Komar. 
        "It has infected a large number of species, and will probably continue 
        to infect a large number; the affected species list will probably continue 
        to grow. But whatever happens from here is anybody's guess."</span>
