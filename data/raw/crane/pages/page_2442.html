<h1>Sandhill Crane</h1>

<i>Grus canadensis </i>(Linnaeus)
<p>

<b>Status</b> Nine records. The first was discovered on 30 October 1976 by Sherman Bleakney as it fed warily in cornfields near Port Williams, Kings County, and it was seen by several others during the next three days. Later that year, on 18 December, census-takers on the Halifax East Christmas Bird Count were thrilled to see one of these great birds circling overhead, calling loudly and then heading southeast over the sea (photographed by B. Mactavish). On 2 May 1977, one appeared near Great Village, Colchester County (E. Cooper).<p>
 A most unusual series of events occurred in 1981. On 24 July, William Crins, a knowledgeable birder from Ontario, observed a Sandhill Crane soaring and calling over barrens and bogs inland from Chezzetcook, Halifax County. Another appeared at Grand Pre, Kings County, on 30-31 August (B.F. Forsythe), and one spent some time in autumn on Cape Negro, Shelburne County (E. Turner). Finally, in early September a wild bird appeared at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park, Hants County, evidently attracted by the captive flock of Sandhill Cranes there. It became attached to one (already mated) crane in particular, and when that crane died in summer 1983, the wild bird departed. A bird near Smelt Brook, Victoria County, in late May 1982 (J. and R. MacKinnon), and two near Middle Musquodoboit, Halifax County, on 9 October 1983 (W. Owen et al.) complete our records.

<b>Remarks</b> The Nova Scotia occurrences appear to be part of a larger pattern of expansion by the species. In June 1982 a pair occurred near St. John's, Newfoundland, and two trans-Atlantic wanderers appeared over Fair Isle, in the Shetlands, in April 1981.<p>

	Unlike the pinioned captives, which are of the subspecies <i>Grus canadensis tabida</i>, the wild individual at Shubenacadie Wildlife Park was clearly of the small northern form, <i>Grus canadensis canadensis</i> according to Eldon Pace, the park director (personal communication, November 1982).
