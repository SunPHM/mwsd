      <P align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Canadian 
        poet Own Neill wrote this poem as a gift for his friend Bill Lishman, 
        co-founder of Operation Migration--the Canadian non-profit organization 
        that conducts thejultralight-led whooping crane migrations featured in 
        Journey North. Mr. Neill wrote &quot;Goose Send-off&quot; to celebrate 
        Operation Migration's first migratory crossing of Lake Ontario with Canada 
        geese in 1993, when leading endangered whooping cranes on a long-lost 
        migration route by ultralight was still a dream. (This Lake Ontario crossing 
        was the migration experiment featured in the motion picture<a href="http://www.operationmigration.org/fly_away_home.html"> 
        <I>Fly Away Home.</I></a>) Mr. Neill couldn't be at the send-off to celebrate 
        with his friend Bill Lishman, so he wrote the poem and gave it to Bill 
        as a gift to mark the historic event.<BR>
        <BR>
        Owen R. Neill is a now-retired high school school teacher who is also 
        dubbed Canada's Wolf Poet. The author of over 6,000 poems (many about 
        nature), he has published several books of poetry. These include <I>My 
        Wild Colonials, Gone to Gossamer, Six Windows of the Giant,</I> and <I>Under 
        Moonleaves. </I>The latter deals &quot;with wolves, their narowing world, 
        and human attempts to come to terms with a loss we cannot afford.&quot;

        19, 2003 marked the tenth tenth anniversary of the subject of this poem: 
        the launch of the very first human-directed bird migration, which involved 
        Canada Geese and was carried out by Operation Migration co-founders, Bill 
        Lishman and Joe Duff.&nbsp; It was a day when Bill Lishman said, &quot;...the 
        thought of flying south with a flock of rare Whooping cranes-- a bird 
        which neither of us had ever seen--was just a hazy, far off dream&#8230;&#8221;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
