              of World Cultural and Natural Heritages' in 1972. Since signing 
              the 'Convention concerning the Protection of World Cultural and 
              Natural Heritages' in 1988, Korea has 7 cultural properties registered 
              on World Cultural Heritage. The World Heritages are heritages registered 
              on World Heritage List, deemed to be of outstanding universal value, 
              which must be preserved by all mankind and transmitted to posterity. 
              They are divided into three categories : cultural, natural, and 
              mixed. To be registered as a World Heritage, the cultural or natural 
              property concerned must have international recognition of its authenticity, 
              invaluable quality, and good preservation. The World Heritages in 
              Korea are Seokguram Grotto &amp; Bulguksa Temple, Haeinsa Temple 
              Janggyeong Panjeon, Jongmyo, Changdeokgung Palace Complex, Suwon

      construction of Bulguksa was started by Prime Minister Gim Dae-seong in 
      751 during the reign of King Gyeongdeok and completed in 774 during the 
      reign of King Hyegong of the Silla Kingdom. In Bulguksa Temple, the Silla 
      people recreated &quot;Buddha Land&quot;, a Buddhist paradise on earth. 
      It is representative of a particular Buddhist architectural period in layout 
      and structure. Especially the stone properties embody the artistic and philosophical 
      essence of Bulguksa Temple. Seokguram grotto was built with white granite 
      in the form of a niche and enshrines a seated Buddha in the center surrounded 
      on the wall by 39 Bodhisattvas, ten disciples, and Devas and guardian kings. 
      It represents the Pure Land in which Buddha resides. This stone cave temple 
      is the crystallization of Silla's religion, science and art, a monumental 
      achievement of Buddhist culture of the Unified Silla period.</font>

">The 
        Royal ancestral Shrine enshrines the tablets of successive kings and queens 
        of Joseon, and those who were posthumously enthroned where sacrificial 
        rites were performed. The Shrine was continuously expanded as the number 
        of deceased kings and queens increased. Jongmyo is an important cultural 
        monument which transmits to posterity the ethical and moral values of 
        the Joseon dynasty which espoused the cause of loyalty and filial piety 
        of Confucianism as its basic ideology. There are in the Jongmyo shrine 
        many buildings ; the Main Hall and the Hall of Eternal Peace, the Jeonsacheong 
        where sacrificial vessels are preserved ; Akgongcheong where musicians 
        rehearse ritual music, the Hall of Meritorious Retainers, the Hyangdaecheong 
        where sacrificial food is prepared and the Subokbang where lower administrative 
        officials reside. The Main Hall was built in a simple style but it is 
        the longest standing wooden building in Korea with the Moon Terrace in 
        the front. It represents the shrine architecture of Korea with dignity 
        and majesty. Ritual ceremonies linking music, song and dance still take 
        places there, perpetuating a tradition that goes back to the 14th century.</font></p>

        cultural heritage of more than 80,000 printing woodblocks of the 13th 
        century. The buildings consist of two long buildings placed on the north 
        and south with two smaller ones on the east and west between them thus 
        forming a rectangle. The buildings showing the architectural style of 
        the early Joseon period are noted not only for their beauty but also for 
        their scientific devices for the prevention of humidity, and also for 
        ventilation and climate control, the devices which enabled the preservation

        in the 5th year (1405) of the reign of King Taejong, the third king of 
        the Joseon Dynasty, Changdeokgung (Historic Site No. 122), the &quot;Palace 
        of Illustrious Virtue&quot;, is the glorious quintessence of traditional 
        palace architecture harmoniously integrated with a beautiful natural setting 
        landscaped garden. Centering on Injeongjeon, the throne hall, the whole 
        place compound of Changdeokgung is broadly divided into two areas, one 
        containing the main palace buildings and the other constituting the rear 
        garden, Huwon. Besides Injeongjeon, the former area contains Seonjeongjeon, 
        the hall of government affairs, Huijeongdang, the king's residence, containing 
        his bedchamber, Daejojeon, the queen's residence, and annexes including 
        Gajeongdang House and Nakseonjae Manor. The latter area contains Juhamnu, 
        the court library, Buyongjeong and Yeon-gyeongdang Pavilions, and Buyongji 
        and Aeryeonji Ponds. Making the best use of the topography, the rear garden 
        is superbly designed with rare flowers and trees, lotus ponds, and exquisite 
        pavilions on gentle slopes, all of which make it certainly the zenith 
        of Korean garden landscapes.</font></p>

        Joseon Dynasty's 22nd king, King Jeongjo (r. 1776-1800), ordered the construction 
        of Hwaseong Fortress (Historic Site No. 3). He did this out of filial 
        piety towards his deceased father, Crown Prince Sado. He moved his father's 
        tomb to Mt. Hwasan near Suwon and at about same time, from 1794 to 1796, 
        moved the provincial government office and residences to Suwon and built 
        the impregnable Hwaseong Fortress. The fortress was designed for both 
        residential and defensive functions. Each facility in the enclosure has 
        a beauty of its own that does its part to make the entire fortress an 
        architectural masterpiece. Under the influence of &quot;Silhak&quot; (Practical 
        Learning), a sophisticated technique involving cranes, pulleys, and other 
        special machinery were mobilized to build these advanced fortifications, 
        which were furnished with diverse weaponry. Filial piety as the underlying 
        motive for construction of the fortress, advanced engineering, and unique 
        design - all these make Hwaseong Fortress the treasure of the Joseon dynasty 
        in the 18th century, a marvel unsurpassed to this day.</font></p>

">The 
        Gyeongju Historic Areas contain a remarkable concentration of outstanding 
        examples of Korean Buddhist art, in the form of sculptures, relief's, 
        pagodas, and the remains of temples and palaces from the flowering of 
        this form of unique artistic expression. There are three major components 
        (belts) that make up the Gyeongju Historic Areas; in addition, the nomination 
        covers Hwangnyongsa and the Sanseong Fortress. Mount Namsan, which lies 
        to the north of Gyeongju City, covers 2,650ha. There are a large number 
        of prehistoric and historic remains within the designated area. The Buddhist 
        monuments that have been excavated up to the present include the ruins 
        of 122 temples, 53 stone statues, 64 pagodas, and sixteen stone lanterns. 
        The main monuments in this area are the ruined palace sites of Wolseong, 
        the Gyerim woodland which legend identifies as the birthplace of the founder 
        of the Gyeongju Kim clan, Anapji Pond, on the site of the ruined Imhaejeon 
        Palace, and the Cheomseongdae Observatory. The Tumuli Park Belt consists 
        of three groups of Royal tombs. Most of the mounds are domed, but some 
        take the form of a half-moon or a gourd. Hwangnyongsa, built by the order 
        of King Jinheung (540-576) was the largest temple ever built in Korea, 
        covering some 72,500ha. An 80m high nine-story pagoda was added in 645. 
        Mongol invaders destroyed the entire complex in 1238; it was never rebuilt, 
        but was occupied by more than a hundred families, who were relocated in 
        1976. </font></p>

        The Gochang, Hwasun, and Ganghwa sites contain the highest density and 
        greatest variety of dolmens in Korea, and indeed of any country. They 
        also preserve important evidence of how the stones were quarried, transported, 
        and raised and of how dolmen types changed over time in north-east Asia.
