<h3 class="title">Iran</h3>

<p>Disaster in Iran, I have difficulty in comprehending  loss of lives of that magnitude. Help is needed and it is time to set religion and political believes a side. This is a good place to start <a href="http://www.ifrc.org/helpnow/donate/donate_response.asp">The international Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a> It is good to see the people unite and help. I can remember when disaster struck In Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974 (Cyclone Tracy) I was travelling on the Pacific Hwy north towards Brisbane and encountered a traffic jam. Volunteers collecting money in buckets somewhere around Taree I know we did dig deep in to our pockets at that time. I like to think we can help people in Iran in the same way. For more have a look at <a href="http://aliparvaresh.com/">Ali's blog</a></p>

<h3 class="title">The Blog and Howard Dean</h3>

<p>The Howard Dean political campaign in the USA is using the Internet  and the Blog  to spread a political message . It is working well and it opens up a lot of opportunities for people and organisations that has political aspirations. This article in<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58554-2003Dec12.html"> the washingtonpost.com by Everett Ehrlich </a>explains how it is now possible for people with smaller budgets to maybe make an impact on the political system that we have.  </p>

<h3 class="title">Tannum Sands Shopping Centre</h3>

This type of construction really fascinates me. I just love the speed of construction,<br />
Large slabs of concrete a couple of big cranes a few people franticly putting together props and bingo you have a new building. This is part of the new Shopping centre in Tannum Sands the complex is scheduled to be finished in the middle of 2004. A Coles supermarket and specialty Shops sure to give Woolworths and Boyne Plaza Shopping Centre in Boyne Island a bit of competition.<br />

<h3 class="title">Changing World</h3>

<p>Saddam Hussein captured that was bound to happen I guess. The interesting part I think is the way the world got to know this news item. Most Newspapers in the Us had already gone to print. The Internet is the place for news as <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1028_3-5123172.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news">CNET</a> says in this article. It is a changing world and both Newspapers and Telephone companies will have an interesting 2004.</p>

<h3 class="title">Don't Type Skype</h3>

<p>I downloaded  <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype </a> a few weeks ago but since I had no one to test the program with it just sat there for a while. So the other day I went to work and installed Skype on or computers at work and we started to use it. A great program and the quality of the phone calls are fantastic. It has a few hiccups now and then but after all this is a Beta version. Almost 4 million downloads of the program to date. It almost reminds me of early ICQ days. VOIP is getting better and better and the clever use of a P2P makes this program stand out from the rest or as Mark Andreessen  said in a reascent interview "they have nailed it". </p>

<h3 class="title">Lost your phone lately?</h3>

<p>Ok you know when you lose your  mobile phone at a party  or in the office or where ever <br />
You start calling your own number in hope of finding your trusted devise.</p>

<p>This happened to me the other day . I had looked everywhere and my phone was gone. <br />
The only possible place I thought  was in the garbage, accidentally tossed my phone in the garbage!<br />
Stupid I know but …. I am in luck the bins has not been emptied<br />
Easy phone the number  m…… well what is the number? Never really use it so I can't remember <br />
Phoned a friend.  Can you tell me what my phone number is ? By this time you feel pretty stupid<br />
But not as stupid as when you together with another friend are  walking up and down rows of garbage bins your ear close to every lid ………NO not there……</p>

<p><br />
I would have needed this,  An application that would on my remote  command  make my phone take a photo and send it back to me via MMs or email . This is it  <a href="http://www.handango.com/brainstore/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?siteId=308&jid=1BXXC1B17951D8X3FFCC1X253D5DE86F&platformId=4&productType=2&productId=50512&sectionId=0&catalog=20">MMS CAM for Series60</a>. "Just send the command SMS   '//YMMSCAM' and in the twinkling of an eye it takes a photo and sends it back via MMS or via e-mail." If I had that app that day I would have seen a photo of the rig of my yacht Yes the phone was on the deck.</p>

<p>I think you could have a lot of fun with this app Santa please……… <br />
