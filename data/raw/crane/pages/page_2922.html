  <p>At A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, the Headquarters Area is 
    especially popular with the visiting public. This area is located west of 
    Boynton Beach on Lee Road, just west of U.S. 441. Here the open marsh areas 
    and cypress swamp are a magnet for nature lovers. This area of the refuge 
    contains the Visitors Center, administration office, walking trails, observation 
    areas, a boardwalk, a boat ramp, a bike trail, and a canoe trail.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/199002-11-E-students-c7-tower.jpg" width="200" height="145" align="left">Compartment C and the Marsh Trail are to the south of Lee Road, the entrance 
    road at the Headquarters Area. Compartment C is composed of ten numbered impoundments. 
    In these impoundments, water levels, vegitation, and  soils are manipulated to provide feeding and nesting habitat for many species of birds. One of these impoundments in 
    Compartment C (C-7) is rimmed by an 0.8-mile-long levee that forms the Marsh 
    Trail. Interpretive signs and an observation tower make this walk especially 
    interesting. The other nine impoundments in Compartment C are also surrounded 
    by dikes that provide dry paths for visitors to observe and photograph the 
    birds and other wildlife in a natural setting.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/199300-06-B-anhinga.jpg" width="150" height="82" align="left"><img src="../images/000000-06-E-ducks.jpg" width="175" height="117" align="right">Birds are the primary attraction in Compartment C. Herons, egrets, and ibises 
    feed quietly side by side. Moorhens and coots cackle raucously and limpkins 
    search the water's edge for apple snails. Less easily spotted are the purple 
    gallinules, least bitterns, sora rails, and even an occasional roseate spoonbill 
    or sandhill crane. Snail kites and wood storks are two endangered species 
    that are seen here, although they are more common in the interior of the refuge.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/turtle-on-log.jpg" width="200" height="118" align="right">Although birds are a principal reason to visit, Compartment C is not without 
    other species. Pig frogs, with their barnyard-like grunt and crichet frogs which sound like two marbles being knocked together are often heard. 
    The Florida red-bellied turtle is common, and soft-shelled turtles with their 
    snorkel-like snouts can be seen, especially in the spring when they are nesting.

    The Cypress Swamp and the Visitors Center are located north of the Headquarters 
    Area entrance road.</p>
  <p>The Visitor Center is a modern, air-conditioned building with<img src="../images/vc-1.jpg" width="200" height="151" align="right"> educational 
    displays, an auditorium for viewing nature-oriented videos, and a sales area 
    with books and other items for adults and children. A visitors guide, describing 
    the trails, plants, and animals, is available for 50 cents. Refuge staff and 
    volunteers are available to assist visitors and answer questions. The Cypress 
    Swamp boardwalk begins and ends at the Visitor Center.</p>
      <p><img src="../images/shady-boardwalk.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left">The Cypress Swamp is a shady wet forest with a 0.4-mile circular boardwalk 
    featuring interpretive exhibits and three rest stops. The boardwalk allows 
    easy viewing of the plants and animals that live there. There is a canopy 
    of bald  trees which are deciduous conifers. Around the base of the 
    trees are the "cypress knees." There are several theories about the function 
    of these knees. One is that they provide support for the trees. Another is 
    that they help in gaseous exchange, since the roots are below water much of 
    the time. Still another theory is that the knees store starch as a food source 
    for the trees in times of stress.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/lichen1.jpg" width="150" height="199" align="left"><img src="../images/lichen2.jpg" width="120" height="203" align="right"><br>
    <br>
    Lichens also thrive in the swamp environment. (A lichen is a mutually beneficial 
    relationship between an alga and a fungus.) Lichens form colored patches on 
    the trees, almost giving the impression of paint splotches. Baton rouge, which 
    is French for "red stick," is the name of the dramatic red lichen.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/fern1.jpg" width="200" height="201" align="left"><br>
    <br>
    A wide variety of ferns grow in the moist conditions of the swamp. The giant 
    leather fern, the largest North American fern, can grow as tall as 14 feet. 
    Sword, shield, strap, royal, and swamp ferns are among the other types found 
    here. In contrast to the enormous giant leather fern, water spangles are tiny 
    ferns that float on the surface of the water.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
      <p><img src="../images/air-plant.jpg" width="200" height="165" align="right">The Cypress Swamp is also home to a profusion of epiphytes, or air plants. 
    Cardinal airplant (when blooming) has bright red bracts that almost hide the 
    small purple and yellow flower inside. Spanish moss is another epiphyte. Its 
    narrow hairy gray leaves grow draped over branches. These plants are harmless 
    to the trees they grow on. They use them only for support.  They obtain their nutrients 
    from the decomposing plant and insect matter that falls on them and from the 
    rain and moisture in the air.</p>
  <p>The variety of life in the swamp seems almost limitless. There are anoles 
    (little lizards), fish, snakes, raccoons, river otters, and bobcats. Wax myrtle, 
    coastal plain willow, pickerelweed, buttonbush, pond apple, and primrose willow 
    are only a few of the plants that grow there.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/great-horned-owl.jpg" width="150" height="209" align="left"><img src="../images/cardinal.jpg" width="150" height="246" align="right">Although not as easily seen as in the more open areas of the refuge, several 
    bird species call the cypress swamp their home. The most commonly found are 
    Carolina wrens, common yellowthroats, cardinals, as well as red-bellied and 
    pileated woodpeckers. Although less common, the yellow-billed cuckoo, common 
    flicker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, screech owl, and great horned owl also 
    live there. During the spring and fall migration, warblers, vireos, and other 
    species can also be spotted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><img src="../images/gator.jpg" width="200" height="114" align="left"><br>
    Alligators may be seen almost anywhere on the refuge. They are often sighted 
    near the boat ramp, in the ponds in front of the Cypress Swamp by the Visitor 
    Center, and in the impoundments of Compartment C.</p>
  <p><br>
    The other access to the Refuge is at the Hillsboro Area, located on Rt. 827 
    (Loxahatchee Road) west of Deerfield Beach. Bank fishing and alligator observation 
    are especially popular there.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/000000-11-C-two-men-fishing-in-boat.jpg" width="200" height="148" align="left"><img src="../images/000003-11-F-people-on-canoe-trail.jpg" width="200" height="127" align="right">Boating, fishing, and canoeing are permitted in the perimeter canal at both 
    entrances. State regulations for fishing licenses apply. A 5.5-mile canoe 
    trail loop begins near the boat dock at the west end of Lee Road (Headquarters 
    Area).</p>
      <p>A 12 mile bicycle trail runs along the L-40 levee (main levee) between 
    the Headquarters and Hillsboro Areas. Mountain bikes are recommended and hybrid 
    bikes can be used. Street bikes are discouraged due to the rough nature 
    of the trail.</p>
      <p>Waterfowl hunting is permitted in a designated area most closely accessed at the Hillsboro 
    Area at the south end of the refuge in the late fall and early winter months.
