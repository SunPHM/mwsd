<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4">The sandhill crane is very tall with a long
neck and legs. Though mostly gray, adult cranes have a red forehead--it almost
looks as if they're wearing a red cap! They have white cheeks that contrast with
their gray neck and bodies. The birds are about 1.2 meters tall and have a wing
span of about 2 meters. Both sexes look alike.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"> These birds live around freshwater marshes,
prairie ponds and marshy tundra. They are also found on grain fields, hay
fields, and pastures during migration and in winter. The species ranges from as
far north as Alaska and the coast of the Artic Ocean south into the Great Lakes
region and westward across Idaho, Nevada and Oregon. Populations also occur in
the southeastern United States and Cuba. Populations are also found in
northeastern Siberia and on Wrangel Island. The three migratory subspecies- the
Lesser, Greater, and Canadian sandhill cranes-are relatively abundant. They are
distributed across a broad breeding range in northern North America and eastern
Siberia, with wintering grounds in the southern United States and northern
Mexico. With a total population of more than 500,000, the sandhill crane is the
most abundant of the worlds cranes.</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"> Sandhill cranes are omnivorous birds that use
their bills to probe for subsurface food and glean seeds and other foods. The
bird feeds on land or in shallow marshes with vegetation. Cultivated grains are
a major food source in their diet when available. Foods vary depending on what
is available. In northern latitudes, a wider variety of foods are consumed,
including berries, small mammals, insects, snails, reptiles, and amphibians.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="sandhill_crane.gif" width="481" height="324"> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"> Sandhill cranes often travel in large flocks
except during the mating season. The mating dance of the sandhill crane is
unusual and spectacular. Facing each other, two courting cranes will leap into
the air with wings extended and feet forward. Then they bow to each other and
repeat the performance, uttering loud croaking calls. Courting birds also run
around with their wings flared and toss tufts of grass into the air. Young birds
will also dance suggesting that it serves other functions such as thwarting
aggression, facilitating pair formation, and sexual synchronization.</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="4"> Sandhill cranes are perennially monogomous and
provide extended biparental care of their young. Families stay together for
about nine months. The species is migratory with northern populations moving
south during the winter months. The strongest social units are pairs and
families that combine into large, socially unstable flocks. These social groups
often congregate at migratory staging areas and on the wintering grounds.</font> </p>
