<P>	Predator problems with piscivorous birds are
encountered on fish farms throughout Ontario. 
Although predatory birds consume and injure fish,
they also spread disease by acting as a host for
parasitic organisms.
<P>
<P>	The aim of this factsheet is to inform
aquaculturists about the bird species that are
common predators to their freshwater aquaculture
operations.  Information on those species of birds
that are not predators but are visitors to areas of
and around fish farms is also given.  Correct
identification of birds is necessary in order to
recommend and implement proper control
methods.
<P>
<H3>LEGAL ASPECTS</h3>
	The birds associated with fish farms and of
interest to fish farmers are all protected by law. 
There are two Acts which cover these birds, the
Migratory Birds Convention Act of Canada
(MBCA) and the Game and Fish Act of Ontario
(GAFA).  Some of the birds covered by either Act
can be hunted in season with appropriate
licenses.  For birds which pose problems to fish
farmers and are covered by the MBCA, kill
permits may be hard to obtain.  The Canadian
Wildlife Service can assist fish farmers with
permits and other problems concerning predatory
birds.  Killing protected birds or destroying their
nests and eggs without a permit is a Federal
offence.  Land owners are permitted to kill birds
covered by GAFA if the birds are damaging
property.
<P>
<H3>KNOWN PREDATORY BIRDS ON FISH FARMS</h3>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic2.jpg"><P>
<B>The Great Blue Heron</b>:  Very large, long-legged,
1.25 m tall or more, mainly grey with a white head
with two black stripes.  They have a long bill. 
Their lower neck and breast has a ruffle of long,
thin, hanging feathers.  They often nest
communally in rookeries.  They hunt for various
aquatic wildlife, including fish, mostly during the
day.  Protected by MBCA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic1.jpg"><P>
<B>The Double-crested Cormorant</b>:  A large, very
dark bird (0.75 to 1 m in length).  They often stand
with their wings partially outstretched.  They
inhabit open, larger bodies of water where they
fish by diving from the surface.  Protected by
MBCA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=left SRC="birdpic3.jpg">
<P><B>The Belted Kingfisher</b>:  Grey-blue and white bird
with a pronounced crest.  They are about 30 cm
long with a heavy pointed bill.  Kingfishers mostly
perch above their fishing station and dive
headfirst into the water to catch small fish and
other prey.  Protected by GAFA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic5.jpg"><P>
<B>The Osprey</b>:  A powerful hawk-like bird,
sometimes called the Fish Hawk.  The birds,
brown above and white below, stand about 30 cm
high and have a wing span of nearly 2 m.  They
nest on dead trees, utility poles, pylons, and
floating buoys.  Protected by GAFA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=left SRC="birdpic4.jpg"><P>
<B>The Black-crowned Night Heron</b>:  A medium-sized bird about 30 
cm long.  They are mainly fish
eaters, feeding mainly at dusk and dawn.  The
adults have a black crown and back, grey wings,
and white neck and underbelly.  They have short
legs by comparison with Great Blue Herons so
only their feet show when they are in flight. 
Protected by MBCA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic6.jpg"><P>
<P><B>The Green or Green-backed Heron</b>:  A small
heron with a green back and reddish underbelly. 
Occurs mainly in southern Ontario.  Occasionally
sighted at fish farms.
<P><br>
<P><br>
<H3>BIRDS WHICH MAY BE MISIDENTIFIED
AS PREDATORS</h3>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic7.jpg"><P>
<B>The Sandhill Crane</b>:  Very large, long-legged,
1.25 m tall with a wing-span of over 2 m.  They
are browny-grey with a reddish cap over their
heads above the eyes.  They lack the head
stripes and ruffle (bib) feathers of the Great Blue
Heron, have a shorter bill, and are generally paler
in colour.  Although they feed on various aquatic
animals, they are NOT known to consume fish. 
They also eat much aquatic and terrestrial plant
material.  They are uncommon in Ontario and
found mostly in the northern and western parts of
the Province.  Protected by MBCA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic9.jpg"><P>
<B>Ducks and Geese</b>:  These birds are largely
herbivorous although several species also feed
on aquatic animals.  Some also feed on very
small fish from time to time.  They are not
considered to be problems for fish farmers. 
Protected by MBCA.
<P>

<H3>FISH-EATING BIRDS NOT PROBLEMATIC
AT FISH FARMS</h3>

<B>The Common Loon</b>:  They are the characteristic,
handsome, black and white birds associated with
the yodelling cry of the lakes of the north woods. 
Protected by MBCA.
<P><br>
<IMG align=right SRC="birdpic8.jpg"><P>
<B>Mergansers</b>:  These are the Fish Ducks.  They
have narrow bills by comparison with other ducks
and geese.  Three species known to occur in
Ontario: the Hooded Merganser, the Red-Breasted Merganser, and the Common
Merganser.  Their bodies are long and slim and
their bills are reddish and narrow.  The males and
females are differently coloured: female with a red
head and shaggy crest; the male with a green
head and crest inconspicuous in the Common
Merganser.  Protected by MBCA.
<P>
<B>Grebes</b>:  The species which occur in Ontario are
the Pied Grebe, the Horned Grebe, and the Red-necked Grebe.  Protected by MGCA.
<P>
<B>Bitterns</b>:  The American Bittern and the Least
Bittern both occur in Ontario.  Protected by
MBCA.
<P>
<B>Gulls</b>:  The Ring-billed Gull and Herring Gull are
year round residents of Ontario.  Protected by
MBCA.
<P>
<B>Terns</b>:  Slender, gull-like birds with long, narrow
wings and forked tails.  The Common Tern and
Black Tern are the two species which occur
frequently in Ontario.  Protected by MBCA.
<P>
<B>Coot and Moorhen</b>:  The American Coot and
Common Moorhen.  Protected by MBCA.
<P>
<H3>METHODS OF PREVENTION AND CONTROL</h3>
	The most effective methods for deterring bird
predators on fish farms in Ontario would be
complete or partial enclosures.  Enclosures can
be built with a combination of fencing, top
screening, netting, and wires.
<P>
	Bird scaring devices such as gas-operated
exploders, electronic noise-makers, and animal
silhouettes (eg. owls) have been used but with
variable success.  The devices work best for
temporary, intensive harassment programs.  It is
best to put these devices in more secluded
areas of the farm site or in areas where newly
stocked fry are kept.

<P>	Before establishing a fish farm one should
carefully consider the location.  Building
aquaculture facilities away from an established
heronry or breeding area can reduce potential
predator problems.  Maintaining netting and
screens in good working order will help to keep
birds out of ponds and raceways.  Removal of
dead fish, and removal of vegetation that may
encourage birds to perch and nest, is
encouraged.
