<h4>Please join us in one of the most beautiful parts of the world for the Guild's Annual Eastern Conference</h4>

							<p>This year's Trade Show, with dozens of vendors of tools, timbers and enclosure systems, will take place in the large Exhibition Hall at the hotel, which means we will have plenty of room (at last!) for ongoing demonstrations in conjunction with the Show.</p>  
    
<h3>IN THE EXHIBITION HALL</h3>
<p>
<img src="japanese_carps.jpg" alt="Carpenters" width="200" height="186" border="0" align="right" hspace=15 vspace=10>
<img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">We will have a group of <strong>Kezurou-Kai carpenters from Japan</strong> (the same who were at the Guild's Western Conference in 2001) building a compound roof model. These daiku will astound you with their technique and understanding of wood and tools.</p>
<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Josh Jackson will lead an ongoing scribing demonstration; a small gazebo will be the project, with milled and raw naturally curved braces and valley framing. Frenglish scribed, bubble scribed and mitered joinery will all peacefully coexist at junctures between square and square (or out of square, as the case may be), round and square, and round and round.</p>
<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">More carving demonstrations from <strong>Richard Cormier and Les Jozsa,</strong> sharing their techniques with each other and us.</p>
<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Math Whizzards, led by <strong>Curtis Milton</strong>, will be on hand to solve your vexing math and layout problems one-on-one. Conversations are likely to involve roof work, basic load calculations, rigging and raising issues, math of all kinds, and perhaps a business question or two.</p>

<h3>MEANWHILE, OUT IN THE PARKING LOT…</h3>
<p>
<img src="crane.jpg" alt="Crane" width="225" height="300" hspace="25" border="0" align="left">
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">We are  transporting the medieval <strong>Norwell Crane</strong> (see the June issue of <em>Timber Framing</em>) to Burlington and will have presentations on the safe use of modern cranes and test drives of medieval ones. Assembly of the Norwell Crane will take place on Friday with the help of a modern hydraulic crane, and operation will take place on Saturday. Disassembly on Sunday.</p>
<br clear=all>
<br>
<h3>FEATURED PRESENTATIONS</h3>

<p> <img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Featured speaker <strong>Matthys Levy</strong>,  author of <i>Why Buildings Fall Down</i>, on "Why Buildings Don't Fall Down." Based on his book and vast experience, he will show by examples how these principles apply to the design and construction of timber buildings. Mr. Levy has also written the books <i>Structural Design in Architecture, Why the Earth Quakes,</i>  and <i>Earthquake Games and Engineering the City</i>. He is the recipient of the ASCE Innovation in Civil Engineering Award and is a director of the Salvadori Center that serves youngsters by teaching mathematics and science through motivating hands-on learning about the built environment. He is the principal designer of many well known buildings, and is the inventor of the Tenstar Dome structure, a unique tensegrity cable dome used to cover large space with minimal obstruction. He has taught at Columbia University and Pratt Institute and lectures at Universities throughout the world.</p>

<p>
<img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Featured speaker <strong>Prof. Thomas D. Visse</strong>r will present "Historic Barns: Preserving a Threatened Heritage." Whether still surrounded by hay fields or scattered through developed residential areas, historic barns and farm buildings linger as vulnerable survivors of the past. Each has a story to tell about the cultural traditions and technological innovations that helped shape the history and appearance of rural places. Today, however, historic barns are among the most threatened heritage resources. This presentation will trace the history of barns in New England and explore national barn preservation strategies and initiatives. Prof. Visser is Director of the University of Vermont's Historic Preservation Program, and the author of the award winning Field Guide to New England Barns and Farm Buildings published by the University Press of New England.</p>

<h3>SEMINARS</h3>
<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Guild President <strong>Rudy Christian</strong> will give a half-day seminar on the principles of the Square Rule technique, one of the basic layout methods used by timber framers today. This workshop is ideal for those who are new to the trade or those who want to learn more from one of the masters of the craft. </p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Furniture makers <strong>Bruce Beeken</strong> and <strong>Jeff Parsons</strong> will give a slide presentation about the evolution of their design and manufacturing process. Included will be a description of Beeken Parsons' association with forestry and their use of local sawmills and dry kilns in the procurement of native character woods. Bruce Beeken and Jeff Parsons formed a partnership in 1983 after receiving degrees in Furniture from Boston University's program in Artisanry. Their partnership has created an approach to furniture making that integrates their interests in design, process, and the use of local forestry.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Harrelson Stanley</strong> will explain and demonstrate efficient tool sharpening techniques from his experience as an apprentice in Japan.  Attendees should try to bring their own tools and waterstones if possible. Harrelson lived in Japan for 12 years and apprenticed for 9 years under two master craftsmen.  Prior to his Japanese sojourn, he graduated from the furniture making program at the North Bennett Street School.  Today, he is operating a school dedicated to hosting Japanese craftspeople in Pepperell, MA.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Gordon Macdonald</strong> will present "Building the Impossible - A Ballista for the BBC."  Gordon's team recently completed the construction of a 22,000 lb, oak-framed siege weapon called a Ballista for a BBC science documentary. Working as a multi-disciplined team that included historians, engineers, scientists, carpenters, riggers, blacksmiths and axe-throwers, the crew of more than thirty people built and then fired this awesome machine in less than two weeks on site in England. Gordon is a Director of Carpenter Oak &amp; Woodland, and manages their Framing Yard in Scotland.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">"Penguins in Bondage - Height Safety for Framers"  with <strong>Gordon Macdonald, Jaime Ward</strong> and <strong>Steve Lawrence</strong>. This hands-on workshop will demonstrate the tools and techniques that are used to stay safe while putting up frames in Europe. Building on the fun that we had during the Banff Conference, these guys have broadened the scope of the presentation to include ropes, nets and a third Penguin. It's a chance to see the newest gear, and to untangle some of those tricky access problems that are peculiar to timber framing. Gord, Steve and Jaime all work with Carpenter Oak &amp; Woodland Co in Scotland. When they found themselves facing the prospect of hiring roped-access experts a few years ago in order to solve a complicated frame raising, they opted instead to take the specialist training themselves. Since then they've developed the height-safety curriculum for COWCo's apprenticeship programme, demonstrated at various events, and helped to teach scores of timber framers how to work at height more safely and effectively.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Anders Frostrup</strong> from Tonsberg, Norway, will give two presentations. One will be on the timber frame construction of stave churches and will feature slides of 28 built from 1100 - 1300 and still standing today. These small masterpieces in wood are some of the oldest all-wood buildings in the world today. His second talk will promote building timber frames with small timbers, and will question the notion of "big is beautiful." Anders is a master carpenter and has written several textbooks on carpentry, drawing and building. He runs the only timber framing business in Norway.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Simon Gnehm</strong> will show us the Swiss Carpenter Apprenticeship program; the administration and structure of the program, the curriculum, how it's financed, and the future of those graduating. After working in the U.S. for many years fueling a great passion for traditional timber frame structures, he is now back in Switzerland pursuing a degree in timber engineering. </p>

<h3>OTHER PRESENTATIONS</h3>
<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Michelle Kantor</strong>, President of MFK Consulting and an attorney working in the field of construction law for more than 14 years, will speak on the topic "Construction Law and Contract Management: Identify and Negotiate Your Risks.  Contract Management is key to assuring profitability.  Contract Terms and
Conditions are crucial to manage risks for both the contractor and supplier.
This Program will help you to identify risks associated in the contracting
process from bid submission to close-out.  She will discuss contract
management, risk identification techniques, and identify key contract terms
and conditions to understand and negotiate before the work is done.
Michelle has negotiated numerous construction contracts and provided consulting in construction law and claims. She previously worked as General Counsel to a Construction Internet company and worked as in-house counsel for a large HVAC company.</p>


<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Frank Baker</strong> on Healthy Businesses.<br><br>
<img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Jan Lewandoski and Duncan Keir</strong> on historic truss case studies.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Joe Howard</strong>, Vice-President of Sundried Wood Technologies, will discuss the quality of kiln-dried timber. "Many misconceptions about the quality of kiln dried timber exist in the timber framing community," Joe explains. "In my talk I will present test results comparing the strength and fracture characteristics of green timber beams and timber beams dried in a high frequency vacuum kiln." Joe received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the University of Kentucky and his graduate degrees in civil engineering (structural engineering) from Virginia Tech. He has twenty years of combined experience in consulting, manufacturing, and academia.</p>
<p>

<img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">Guild Apprenticeship update.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Les Jozsa</strong>, the "Wood Guy" from Forintek Canada - a humor and illustration filled examination of the nature of wood from tree growth to wood properties, plus a demonstration on the decorative uses of wood.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0"><strong>Vitold Karwowski</strong> will present a possible Guild project in Poland rebuilding a historic 17th century wooden synagogue. His topic, "Anihilated Heritage," will discuss the only remaining knowledge about wooden synagogues of Poland completely destroyed during World War II and
the outline of the planned international project of reconstruction. Witold Karwowski is a historic preservation architect from Poland currently in
New York running Arteco and Design Restoration Corp.</p>

<p><img src="checkmark.gif" alt="" width="24" height="13" border="0">A five-session Engineering Track coordinated by Dick Schmidt and featuring <strong>Ben Brungraber, Ed Levin, Dave Fischetti and Grigg Mullen</strong>.  
Topics will include:
Building codes and building officials: Codes and Standards, what are they, why do we have them, what's being done to make them relate to timber framing; How to keep the building official satisfied.
Historical forms still popular today: Traditional covered bridge forms; Hammerbeams
Engineering day to day: The engineer's toolkit: what a timber-frame engineer knows and does with it;  Career opportunities for engineers; When to hire an engineer.
Structural Analysis - don't try this at home:  Basics of statics, mechanics of materials, and structural analysis.  Structural analysis software is not CAD. Open forum: Issues that were not fully addressed during the previous sessions, plus those posed by the audience.</p>
