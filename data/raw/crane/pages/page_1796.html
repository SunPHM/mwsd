The whooping crane is an endangered species with a success story to tell.  Their population hit an all time low
			in 1940 when there were only 22 cranes left in the wild. Their numbers have been steadily building, year-by-year,
			to a total of 183 today.<BR>
			<BR>
			Each spring the entire flock of wild whooping cranes takes the annual 2,700 mile journey from their wintering grounds
			in Texas to their nesting grounds in northern Canada. They usually arrive in late April or early May, just as the
			ice and snow are melting from the marshes.  <BR>
			<BR>
			Also each spring, before the cranes begin their journey, Tom Stehn, Whooping Crane Coordinator for the U.S. Fish
			and Wildlife Service provides updates for us from the cranes' winter home on the Texas Gulf Coast.  He filed his
			first report today. Once the migration is underway in April, weekly weather reports and migration news will be
			shared once again this<BR>
			year by Wally Jobman.  Wally is based at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Grand Island, NE. Finally,
			from the far north, Canadian biologist Brian Johns, of the Canadian Wildlife Service, will share the excitement
			when the cranes arrive once again on their ancient nesting grounds.  <BR>
			<BR>
			We hope you enjoy traveling with the whooping cranes this spring!</P>

Dear Journey North: </P>

			<P>Greetings from the Texas Gulf Coast where the whooping cranes are preparing to start their spring migration.
			Hormonal changes in the cranes are now allowing them to gain weight and build up the fat reserves that they will
			need for the long migration. The entire population will travel to Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories
			of Canada (60 N, -114 W).<BR>
			<BR>
			The first whooping cranes normally start the migration about mid-March.  A few could leave a little before that,
			but most of the population leaves during the first half of April.  I'll be flying in a small airplane once a week
			all spring to record the number of whooping cranes that start the migration each week. I'll let you know how the
			count is going.  Despite warm spring weather here, the whoopers &quot;know&quot; it is too early to start their
			journey since it is still frozen up north.</P>

<A NAME="Blue"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Blue Crabs Can Mean More Cranes</B></FONT><BR>
			Conditions for the whoopers at Aransas were excellent this winter. Blue crabs are the whoopers' favorite food item--and
			important to help them built up enough energy reserves to have a successful nesting season. Blue crab counts in
			November and December were extremely abundant and, although declined in number, remained available into February.
			In 1994, when blue crabs had been scarce, about half of the whoopers failed to nest that summer! We think this
			was because they weren't in good enough condition. (See impact on 1994 population size, chart below.)<BR>
			
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<A NAME="Population"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Population Climbs by Only One Crane</B></FONT><BR>
			The past year has been a struggle for the whooping cranes--and disappointing for us.  The flock managed to INCREASE
			their numbers, but by only ONE crane. The flock now consists of 183 birds: 100 adults, 65 subadults, and 18 young.
			This is a record number, but average mortality apparently kept flock size below the 190+ cranes we hoped for. Production
			of more than 20 young, and mortality of less than 10 adult/subadult birds over the summer, is needed for the population
			to show a big increase.<BR>
			<BR>
			Below is a brief chronology of their year.  If you read carefully, you should be able to answer these important
			questions--the kind I'm concerned with every day in my work:</P>

<B>Summer, 1998 Wood Buffalo National Park:  </B>In Canada this summer, 49 nesting pairs produced 48 chicks.  This
			included 12 pairs with twin young-- but none of the sets of twins young survived. (Only ONCE in 33 years have twins
			reached the wintering grounds, when a set of twins arrived safely in 1997. This hadn't happened since 1964! <A
			HREF="/jnorth/spring1998/critters/crane/update111797.html">Read about the successful twins here!</A>)  In mid-August,
			1998, as they began flying lessons at about 10 weeks of age, only 24 chicks were still alive.<A HREF="/jnorth/spring1999/species/crane/Stehn030199.html"><B></B></A></P>

			<P><B>Fall Migration, 1998, Canada to Texas:  </B>Sixteen adult/subadult cranes (9% of the population) failed to
			arrive at Aransas. Another indication of mortality during the fall migration was that, of the 24 juveniles fledged
			in August in Wood Buffalo, only 18 made it to Aransas by the end of the year. This indicates 25 % mortality of
			the young post-fledging, an above average figure. If mortality had been less than average, this would cause the
			population to grow above the peak of 182 last winter. (This compares with 30 chicks that reached Aransas last year.)
			In some cases, family groups were reported in Saskatchewan but failed to arrive at Aransas with their juvenile.<B></B></P>
