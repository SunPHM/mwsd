In the morning around 6 Damu was ready to see a doctor after he had realised he
is allergic to penicilline. He looked like he had had a round or two with Mike
Tyson with predictable results. Being a tourist in a civilized country, we
managed to haul him to see a doctor to get new medication and in a few hours
he was in the condition to play a tourist again.

<div class="paragraph">
From the again overwhelming breakfast table we headed to the city again. To
Alexanderplatz to be specific where we visited some record stores and saw some
famous buildings. As soon as the sun started shining, we found ourselves a bar
wit a terrace and surprisingly in 10 minutes it started to rain again and we
drank our beer inpeace, accompanied only by sparrows that were searching for
something to eat on the tables. Afterwards we toured around the museum island,
Reichstag, Brandenburgerplatz etc. The Art museum we saw from 50m distance
which we thought is a very good distance indeed. The bus #100 took us nicely
via Grosser Stern on the way to Zoologischer Garten again. Only parts of the
wall remaining were found on the tables of people selling junk for tourists,
we thought that there should be a bit of it left somewhere for  tourists like
us to get those compulsory "I banged my head to the Berlin wall" photographs.
The city itself is a huge playground for cranes and construction workers, I
hope in 5 years the place will look very fancy and modern, now it looks like a
series of holes in the ground.

After getting ourselves T-shirts from Hard Rock Café it was time to go to KaDeWe
in search for a suitable gift for Matthias' parents. For persons who do not drink
and 50% of whom is diabetic, it is not that easy of a task, I can tell you...
After giving it a thought we settled in a box of the best possible Ethiopean
coffee which we hoped they will like...accompanied by a humorous card with a
mouse sitting on the floor with his stomach full... The place had on offer also
some nice alcoholic beverages as well, cognacs 2500DM, whiskey 850DM... and still
that whiskey was only 12 years old!
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
And so we managed to spend yet another day of our holidays, paying special attention
to the local selection of pretty girls who were on display on the way. And yes,
Warsteiner from the tap is exactly what a thirsty tourist needs! This evening
will be spent listening to our purchases from the record store and playing cards,
this peaceful evening I cannot remember spending on this holiday...
