<FONT SIZE =3> This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Wings Over the Platte celebration, set for March 19 through 22.<P>

 "The celebration has grown by leaps and bounds," said Tricia Beem of the Grand Island Convention and Visitors Bureau. "National and international recognition has increased. This year, 44 states have shown interest in the celebration, and the bureau sent out over 1,000 packets of information."<P>

 Beem added that groups come from a variety of countries around the world -- including Germany, Japan, England, Singapore and the Netherlands.<P>

 "The cranes have put the Tri-Cities area and the Central Platte Flyway on the map," she said. In 1997 Forbes FYI Magazine named the area the No. 1 birding place in the world.<P>

 Guest speaker this year's event will be Kent Clegg, an Idaho rancher who is famous for his historic nine-day, 800-mile journey in an ultralight plane leading 6-month-old cranes on their first migratory trip.<P>

 Clegg will speak at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, March 21, at the Interstate Holiday Inn.<P>

 A video of him flying his plane painted like a giant whooping crane leading six sandhill cranes and three whooping cranes from Idaho to New Mexico will also be shown.<P>

 The Grand Island/Hall County Convention and Visitors Bureau, which sponsors the three-day celebration, will provide different nine tours. Experienced guides will seek out the sandhill cranes and other migratory waterfowl in the Platte River and adjoining wetlands.<P>

 The tours will range from two and a half hours to four hours and cost $15 to $25. For one to two people, there is an additional registration fee of $10, and for three or more people, the registration fee is $15.<P>

 The celebration will begin on March 19 with "Crane Lore 'Round the Campfire" from 5:30 to 8 p.m. and a crane bunker excursion from 5:30 to 9 p.m.<P>

 Cost for the banquet on March 21 is $20 per person. For further information or to register for the banquet, contact the convention and visitors bureau at 382-4400 or (800) 658-3178.<P>
