<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Zacatecas along with San Luis Potosi support the most southern distribution of wintering sandhill cranes. 
Zacatecas City, where the meeting will be held, is located in the southern Chihuahuan Desert.  Founded
in 1546 after the discovery of a rich silver lode, Zacatecas reached the height of its prosperity in the 16th
and 17th centuries. The city of Zacatecas is not only a veritable labyrinth of winding streets but also a
fascinating labyrinth of artistic and cultural treasures.  Built between hills and on steep slopes, Zacatecas
(the name is derived from zacatl = grass and tecatl = people) is one of the few Mexican cities to have a
maze-like street plan which makes wandering it a delight, even if it is easy to become disoriented!  The
town has breathtaking views and there are many old buildings, both religious and civil. The cathedral,
built between 1730 and 1760, dominates the centre of the town. It is notable for its harmonious design
and the Baroque profusion of its fa&ccedil;ades, where European and indigenous decorative elements are found
side by side. The people of Zacatecas are especially proud of having preserved and restored so many
ancient architectural and artistic monuments that the city was designated a "Cultural Treasure of
Humanity" in 1993 by UNESCO. The result is a happy city, with relatively few above-ground utility
poles and no billboard advertising in the historic center. The city is at 2,460 meters (8,000 ft) elevation.
February temperatures are cool and average 53<SUP>o</SUP> F, however, the lows can be near freezing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">* A <EM>callejoneada</EM>, is a unique local street event.  It involves a stroll with a brass band which features a
couple of drummers and a man with a burro loaded with a couple of barrels of mezcal. You get a cup to
hang around your neck for the mezcal and off you go on a tour of the town, pausing frequently for drinks,
singing, dancing and general merry-making.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">CALL FOR PAPERS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Dear potential presenters and participators,</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3"> A deadline of 30 June 2005 is set for the receipt of abstracts for presentation at the 10th North
American Crane Working Group meeting in Zacatecas, Mexico, February 2006.  Papers on
any topic relative to cranes are welcomed and need not be limited to North America.  Proposed
sections include genetics, distribution, migration, reproduction, habitat management, health,
conservation, monitoring, and behavior.  In addition workshops on genetics and GIS are
planned and students are encouraged to attend.  Abstracts for poster presentations and
proceedings publication-only will also be accepted.   Abstracts and papers should follow the
guidelines of the Wildlife Management Journal.  Assistance will be given with translation if
needed.  Please indicate the type of presentation you would like to give (powerpoint, slides,
overhead, poster).  Also student papers should be indicated so that they can be recognized for
their participation which is greatly encouraged. The deadline for the first draft of papers to
be included in the Proceedings will be 30 September 2005.  Abstracts and papers can be sent
to Marilyn Spalding by email (preferred) at SpaldingM@mail.vetmed.ufl.edu or snail mail at

sure to mention you are with the Crane Group (Grupo Grullas). Rooms and special group

</P>

<P><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Several other small and very unique hotels are available in downtown Zacatecas which would
be with in walking distance of headquarters hotel and meetings at Museo Rafael Coronel. 
Most of these hotels in downtown Zacatecas offer more expensive room rates than Hotel
Emporio, ranging from 150.00 USD (Meson de Jobito) to around 200.00 USD (Quinta Real).</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">REGISTRATION</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Registration fee for workshop is 160.00 USD which includes all workshops, opening reception,
3 lunches, a one day field trip, closing banquet, and social events as planned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">TRANSPORTATION</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Direct flights from the US to Zacatecas are only available through Los Angeles, CA. Several
options are available from the US if traveling through Mexico City with several flights on a
combination of US and Mexican airlines. Transportation from Zacatecas airport to hotel is
available via taxi for less than 20.00 USD and shuttle service for less than 10.00 USD. Both
alternatives are easily found in the airport terminal.  An alternative to arriving in Zacatecas
is the Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes Airport which has direct flights from the US through
Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, and Los Angeles.  Aguascalientes is only 150 km (about 100
miles) south from Zacatecas.  Transportation from Aguascalientes Airport can be arranged for
workshop participants for 20.00 USD. You must sign up in advance, in the enclosed
registration form, to be picked up at Aguascalientes airport.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">FIELD TRIP</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">A field trip is being arranged and will be finalized pending some surveys conducted in
January. We will likely visit several wetland areas where sandhill cranes are known to be
present during winter.  In addition, we will observe the landscape and scenery of the southern
Chihuahuan Desert and adjoining mountain systems. Depending on time and availability we
could visit a working ranch of the area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">POST-MEETING FIELD TRIPS</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" size="3">Possibilities for extended post-meeting trips include site visits to nearby natural areas to
include deserts, mountains, wetlands, and tropical and subtropical forests within Zacatecas
and/or on the boundary with state of Jalisco and in San Luis Potosi.  It is important to know
how many people would participate in post-meeting trips in order to make the appropriate
arrangements.  Make sure to check appropriate item if you are interested in field trips in the
enclosed registration form. If you can send an email expressing your interest even before
registering that would be better (fchavez@whoopingcrane.org).</FONT></P>

<font face="Times New Roman">The North American Crane Working Group
hosted the </font><b>Ninth North American Crane Workshop</b>, January 21-25,
2003, in Sacramento, California. The Workshop allowed participants to observe
sandhill cranes in the Pacific Flyway and learn about the problems they face,
especially from the continued development in California. The North American
Crane Workshop is held every 3-4 years and is an important event for crane
recovery because it allows scientists from all over North America to exchange
ideas and publish research findings. Special thanks go to Dr. Dave Ellis, who
edited the last Proceedings, and to Dr. Felipe Chavez-Ramirez who will edit the
2003 Proceedings. Board members Mary Bishop, Wendy Brown, Steve Nesbitt and
Scott Hereford of NACWG decided to step down after more than a decade of
service. New board members elected were Dr. Glenn Olsen (President), Dr. Gary
Krapu (Vice-President), Tracy Grazia (Secretary) Tom Hoffmann (Treasurer), Dr.
Felipe Chavez-Ramirez, Dr. Marilyn Spalding and Dr. Richard Urbanek. The
Lawrence Walkinshaw Award was awarded to Dr. George Gee of Patuxent. Lifetime
achievement awards went to C. D. Littlefield, Dr. Rod Drewien, and Steve
Nesbitt. A special achievement award was given to Xiomora Galvez and Cuban
biologists for their work on the Cuban sandhill crane. The next workshop will be
in Mexico in February 2006.

techniques, captive propagation, disease, mortality, genetics, breeding biology, and
reintroduction. The evening of the 12th included an open meeting of the Whooping Crane
