<P><FONT SIZE=+4>A</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1> 12 1/2 foot high pair ofbronze whooping
cranes, the newest addition to the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum's permanent
collection, was dedicated on June 29. Kent Ullberg's <I>Rites of Spring</I>
graciously welcomes visitors from its prairie green granite base located
near the entrance to the Margaret Woodson Fisher Sculpture Gallery. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sculpture and its installation are a gift from John
E. Forester in loving memory of his late wife, Alice Woodson Forester. Together,
they provided the vision and leadership to create and build the Woodson
Art Museum in the mid-1970s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The bold diagonal lines of Ullberg's cranes provide a strong
upward lift that draws the viewer's eye skyward. But not to be overlooked
is the base, where Ullberg captures nuances of both the cranes' summer and
winter habitats. The left side presents the salt marshes of the tidal biotope
around Padre Island in Texas, where the cranes winter, and where Ullberg
could observe them closely from his boat. On the right can be seen the freshwater
marsh grasses of the cranes' summer habitat north ofArctic Circle in Canada's
Wood Buffalo Park. A closer look reveals numerous examples of animal life
that share these habitats with the cranes and upon which the cranes rely
for their livelihood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ullberg included these telling details to provide a narrative
context in which to view the sculpture. It is a work that invites discovery
and exploration. On one level, it is about the abstract form of the birds
and the imposing diagonal created by their wings, suggesting the powerful
thrust that carries them thousands of miles twice each year. On another
level, it is about the whooping cranes' habitat, and more important, their
triumph as a species. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rites of Spring took two years to finish, from concept
through clay modeling, molding and casting in bronze. It was cast by the
cire perdue method in approximately 70 welded pieces at a Colorado foundry.
A stainless steel infrastructure supports the cranes. Landscape architect
Joe Pepitone of the Zimmerman Design Group, Milwaukee, designed the installation
site, and Ullberg supervised the actual placement of the work in late May.</FONT></P>
