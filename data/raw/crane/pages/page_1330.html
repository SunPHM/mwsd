	<b>Welcome to my first day walkabout</b><br>
	<br>
	We start with a squat-house<br>
	<img src="d1c00008.jpg" width=432 height=576 alt="" border="0"><br>
	Now normally, squat-houses don't make it into photo sequences, but this was a special squat-house, look closely at the blob at the top, it's actually the identifier for the squat, so when someone asks you which squat you're at, the people there say "we live in the <b>Plastikman</b> squat."<br>
<br>
	Something nice ruined by my finger, I'll try to get another shot later<br>
	<img src="d1c00009.jpg" width=432 height=576 alt="" border="0"><br>
	<br>
	Oh, these are some nice towers to the Berlin landscape, I find out later that this is the heating and power plant for Potsdam Platz and some houses, in the background is that TV tower.<br>

<br>
	My first close encounter with sweet Berlin architecture<br>
	<img src="d1c00011.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Ooohh, public transit, gonna have to try that out, nice thing to have running through the city.<br>
	<img src="d1c00012.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Cross over into East Berlin now, oh look, classic Bauhaus architecture, well if you ever need more proof that good architecture <b>won't</b> fix a society, here's a start.<br>
	<img src="d1c00013.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Oh how nice, some words of encouragement from father Karl for those in the East looking to get a Big Mac in the West<br>
	<img src="d1c00015.jpg" width=432 height=576 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	And brother Lenin chimes in too, warning all East Berlin men that if they let their pretty wives eat Big Macs in the West that they will become fat and decadent, like Americans, and will <a target=new href="http://www.portalofevil.com/fatchicksinpartyhats/">always want to party.</a><br>
	<img src="d1c00016.jpg" width=436 height=576 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Wow, East Berlin sure is a happening place on a Saturday afternoon, probably because everyone is over in the West getting Big Mac's and party hats.<br>
	<img src="d1c00017.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Oh look, an old building now dirty from lots of pollution, bodes well, I love cities with lots of pollution.<br>
	<img src="d1c00018.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Now look how big this building is, see the little guy on the steps, that's a big impressive building.<br>
	<img src="d1c00019.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	The Brandenburg Gate, I'll be leaving the East and back into the West in a sec....<br>
	<img src="d1c00020.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	Wow, lot of construction going on here, count the cranes.  I count 13 and &#189;, that's a lot, they're building the new government centre, this photo cannot do justice to the magnitude of this undertaking.<br>
	<img src="d1c00021-24.jpg" width=900 height=205 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
	And then there's Potsdamer Platz<br>
	<img src="d1c00025.jpg" width=576 height=436 alt="" border="0"><br>
<br>
<br>
	<a href="berlin3.html">Let's take a closer look at Potsdamer Platz.</a>
