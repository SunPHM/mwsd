    cranes in North America produces the largest and most spectacular concentration of cranes
    in the world. &nbsp; Up to 500,000 birds linger along an 80 mile stretch of the Platte
    River in central Nebraska each spring.&nbsp; Seven people joined GPNC naturalists Connie
    Elpers and Jim Mason for a two day trip to see and hear these birds on March 19 &amp; 20,
    2001.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our trip up included a stop at <a href="http://www.naturalkansas.org/rockcity.htm">Rock City</a> near Minneapolis,
    Kansas.&nbsp; This extraordinary collection of large sandstone concretions is unique in
    the world.&nbsp; Click <a href="images/wigglers/rocks1.mpg">here</a> to see a 475K mpeg
    video of Rock City.<br>
    <font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived in late afternoon and went by the
    visitor center at <a href="http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/parks/guides/parksearch/showpark.asp?Area_No=97">Ft.
    Kearny</a> to see their slide show on the cranes and pick up local maps.&nbsp; Afterwards
    we drove the back roads along the Platte River and observed the birds feeding and dancing
    in the fields in the afternoon sun.&nbsp; We checked in at <a href="http://www.rowesanctuary.org/">Rowe Sanctuary</a> to confirm our morning reservation
    in the blind, and then drove to <a href="http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/parks/guides/parksearch/showpark.asp?Area_No=98">Ft.
    Kearny State Recreation Area</a> to hike out on the old railroad bridge and watch the
    birds fly in for the evening.</font></font><p><font SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
    second day we were up at 4 AM to get to the viewing blind before daybreak.&nbsp; Phil, a
    volunteer from Victoria, British Columbia, met the group at the rendezvous point, gave us
    all instructions on viewing etiquette and led us to the blind.&nbsp; The weather was all
    we could hope for - just a little wind and not too cold with a scattered cloud cover that
    promised excellent viewing at sunrise!&nbsp; As our eyes adjusted to the dark, we listened
    to the distinctive, spine-tingling chortles and bugles of the birds only a short distance
    in front of us.&nbsp; All we could see were grey swaths on the river.&nbsp; As sunrise
    approached, the bugling became louder as the birds greeted the day and we became aware
    that what we thought were islands in the river were actually tens of thousands of sandhill
    cranes!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at the panorama below to see what the
    view upriver looked like.&nbsp; Another large group of cranes was immediately in front of
    the blind (to the right of this picture).&nbsp; Phil told us this was the largest number
    of cranes he had ever seen there!&nbsp; An estimated 400,000 cranes were on the Platte
    that day.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
