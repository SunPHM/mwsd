The rare and once near-extinct Whooping Crane can be seen from time to time in Florida's 
Lake Kissimmee area, and is the cause of much excitement this year. As of March, 2000, a nesting pair of Whooping Cranes had hatched the first chicks in the wild in more than 60 years. The chicks, born 3 days apart, were first spotted on March 19th. In 1999, the birds laid eggs, but none survived to hatch.
Biologists are watching closely in hopes they manage to escape predators.<br> In the 1930's,
only 2 flocks remained, 6 birds in Louisiana, and another flock in Canada. The birds in Louisiana all died by 1950 without ever laying another egg.<br>Whooping Cranes were reintroduced into the Lake Kissimmee area in 1993. For more than 40 years researchers have been trying to raise them in captivity and reintroduce them into the wild.

They can be recognized by the black feathers on their wingtips and the black plumage on their heads.
