    are not insensitive to the loss of human life during the actions of war; but 
    the current war in Iraq has brought to mind the fact that military actions 
    have long term effects on ecosystems not only from bombing, troop 
    activities, landmines, refugees, and poaching, but also from political 
    instability resulting from the warring that prevents the return to normal 
    activities. Reports point out that landmines are particularly onerous; mines 
    left from as long ago as World War II are still killing people, livestock, 
    and wildlife. The retrieval of landmines in Iraq after the first Gulf War 
    has had a detrimental effect on the environment. Bomb disposal units plowed 
    up large areas of desert, tearing up and damaging fragile and slow-growing 
    vegetation and destroying habitat for numerous animal species.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    The effects of war are many, but perhaps the greatest environmental impact 
    is from the displacement of people and the large numbers of refugees. The 
    arrival of large numbers of refugees in an area previously containing few or 
    no people creates intense pressure on the environment.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Come join us when Doug Crowe shares his first hand knowledge about the 
    effects of War and Wildlife. The program will be May 1, 2003 at the Oil and 
    Gas Conservation Commission Building, 777 West First Street at 7 PM. The

    <p align="justify"><b><font size="6" face="Gallery Caps">M</font></b><font face="Comic Sans MS">urie Audubon used to receive 
    about $2,000 a year from the National Audubon Society as our share of the 
    dues. However, National can no longer afford to share dues with the 
    chapters. Last year we received about $1,200, and next year will be the last 
    year we receive dues share from National. The problem facing Murie, and all 
    Audubon Chapters, is how to make up for this shortfall in revenue. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Murie is a very active chapter. Our biggest expenses are the Bird 
    Hospital, Audubon Adventures for classrooms, the newsletter and the bird hot 
    line. We also monitor sage-grouse leks, teach bird ID classes, help take 
    care of the Audubon Center at Garden Creek and participate in other 
    activities that don't cost the Chapter a lot of money. All these expenses 
    and activities are important functions of the Chapter; reducing them should 
    only be done after very careful consideration. We can, and should, do some 
    economizing, but that is not going to make up for the $2,000 shortfall. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I see it, there are three main options: 1) we could increase our 
    membership because National now sends us $20 for each new member. While we 
    need to recruit new members to help National and because we need more people 
    just in order to accomplish all that we want to achieve, we are unlikely to 
    find enough new members every year to cover the $2,000 shortfall; 2) some 
    Chapters are starting a &quot;Friends of the Chapter&quot; with a modest charge, such 
    as $15 per year. A &quot;Friend of Murie&quot; would receive the monthly newsletter, 
    but would only be a member of National if they also joined National. (Ed's 
    note: We are developing a membership brochure that will list several 
    donation options to specifically support one or more of our activities at 
    the donor's preference.); 3) a third way would be to obtain $2,000 in a fund 
    raising event or through donations. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Murie Audubon Board members want to decide on a viable option or 
    combination of options and implement the program by this fall. To make an 
    informed decision, we want to hear comments regarding your preferences of 
    the above options or other ideas you may have. I would be glad to explain 
    the options in more detail. Please call or email me or another Board

    field camp experience is intended for beginning and intermediate birders, 
    educators and resource managers and stresses avian identification outdoors. 
    The AVES method of bird identification, as it is called, was developed by 
    Gene Wilhelm, former Vice President of Education, National Audubon Society, 
    over decades of active birding. The concept is simple: remove oneself from 
    the daily routine and responsibility of human endeavors, escape for a time 
    to a milieu conducive to learning and immerse oneself in birding. The AVES 
    method uses six keys in field identification: eye, ear, behavior, habitats, 
    field marks and ecology during a period of intense but FUN AND EXCITING 
    BIRDING with experts. The method works and the end result is a raising of 
    consciousness of how birds interrelate and interconnect with the rest of 
    nature in the dynamic ecological setting of Tensleep Nature Preserve. 
    Experience daily field identification sessions watching birds with experts 
    in diverse Tensleep Nature Preserve habitats ranging from high mountain 
    meadows and Ponderosa pine stands to lush canyon forests and wetlands to dry 
    sagebrush steppes. These hands-on activities are linked to presentations and 
    discussions, giving participants a richer awareness, understanding and 
    appreciation of birds and ecology in the beautiful Big Horn Basin ecosystem. 
    Led by nationally known ornithologists, this program has been developed for 
    both novice and intermediate birders, educators and resource managers alike.</font></p>

    history and the local environment once provided the basic foundation from

    session is primarily intended for science and non-science educators who are 
    either already incorporating environmental education into their lesson plans 
    or would like to. Curious parents and guardians of elementary through high 
    school age children also are welcome. Daily field trips in the beautiful and 
    biodiverse Tensleep Nature Preserve, discussions, special presentation and

    April 11, ten birders from Wildcat Audubon Society of Scottsbluff, NE made 
    their way to the Casper area; their main objective was to visit the Hat Six 
    lek to view strutting Sage Grouse.
    <img border="0" src="Images/p1.JPG" width="324" height="219" align="right"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Upon their arrival in Casper, Murie embers hosted the group with a pot luck
    at Casper College's Werner Wildlife Museum. We all enjoyed great food and 
    talking birds, wildlife, and conservation before turning in for a good 
    night's sleep in preparation for early rising. <br>

    <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At 5:30 the next morning, we met the Birding Class led by Bart Rea and went 
    out to the Hat Six lek, where the grouse put on a great show. (For many of 
    the Wildcat members, the Greater Sage-Grouse was a life bird.)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Before leaving the Hat Six area, we checked out McDonald's Pond (just down 
    the road from the lek). There we found a raft of American Coots, 
    Buffleheads, Redheads, Lesser Scaup, a Ruddy Duck, an immature Bald Eagle, 
    and our highlight there - a Red-necked Grebe (unfortunately this bird wasn't 
    in breeding plumage, but still provided many of the group with another life 
    bird). The Bald Eagle provided some additional excitement when he &quot;buzzed&quot; 
    the raft of coots, scattering them. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    After making our way back to town (and getting some breakfast), Rose-Mary 
    King led the way to Casper's east side to find some Chukars - luck was with 
    us, we did find a couple of these birds (another life bird for some of the 
    folks). From there, we went up on Casper Mountain - which still has quite a 
    bit of snow left over from the 4 feet received a few weeks ago. Frank and 
    Ellen Vayo again generously allowed us to observe their feeders. Birds seen 
    included Red Crossbills, Evening Grosbeaks, Pine Siskins, Cassin's Finches, 
    Downy and Hairy Woodpeckers, Dark-eyed Juncos, Mountain Chickadees, 
    Red-breasted Nuthatches, and a Clark's Nutcracker with a demonstrated 
    fondness for peanut butter. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The last stop was at the home of Lynn and Merlyn Herold to see the work they 
    have been doing on bird and wildlife rehab. As many of you may know, Frank 
    and Lois Layton have been doing bird rehab for 30+ years; and the number of 
    &quot;patients&quot; has steadily increased. Lynn and Merlyn have greatly helped with 
    the handling of these patients by taking over the care of the smaller birds, 
    while the Laytons continue working with the large raptors. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    With the conclusion of a very enjoyable get-together, the Wildcat Auduboners 
    prepared to make their way back to Nebraska, and we headed home with that 
    wonderful feeling of having had a good time with both old and new friends.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thanks to all who helped make this a great weekend!!!! Thanks to Doug Crowe 
    for staying after work to talk to the group about the Werner; and a big 
    Thank You to those who contributed to Friday night's pot luck: Lynn Herold,

    and Lynn Herold have expanded their facilities to include three new 
    aviaries. They have also expanded their rehabilitation area to include 
    flight enclosures for bats, swallows and hummingbirds. In addition, new 
    caging has been added for songbirds, and an expanded area is being build for 
    waterfowl. These additions now bring the total aviaries to five, not 
    including a small flight barn, two rehab rooms and the garage. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Also included in the expansion is an incubator for the &quot;wee&quot; ones that is 
    temperature and humidity controlled, a special box for small mammals such as 
    bunnies which has its first occupants, and a three-tiered two column cage 
    set up for recovering hatchlings. If injured or baby bats are sent to the 
    Herolds, they can put a heating pad behind one of these cages with a blanket 
    on the inside for the bats to cling to a warm place.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Herold's welcome and encourage visits to view the facilities through the 
    month of May, hopefully, prior to &quot;baby bird season&quot;. If interested in a 
    visit, please call (307) 234-0196 to arrange a time.</font></p>

    shared with me. In November Betty Rickman, when not reading mystery stories 
    or bird watching, made us some Lemon Graham Squares from a recipe used by 
    Janis Plourde in Ontario. Here are the needed ingredients: 1 can (14 oz) 
    sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 c. lemon juice, 1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs 
    (about 24 squares), 3/4 c. all-purpose flour, 1/3 c. packed brown sugar, 1/2 
    tsp. baking powder, pinch salt, 1/2 c. butter or margarine melted.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    In a bowl, combine the milk and lemon juice; mix well and set aside. In 
    another bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, flour, brown sugar, baking powder 
    and salt. Stir in butter until crumbly.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Press half of the crumb mixture into a greased 9-in. square baking dish. 
    Pour lemon mixture over crust; sprinkle with remaining crumbs. Bake at 375 
    for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack. Yield: 3 
    dozen. Thanks Betty for sharing this treat!. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

    one had even heard of web sites and e-mail when I came up with the names for the 
    chapter and the newsletter and drew up the sketches for the grouse and the 
    mountains way back when we changed from being the Wyoming Audubon Society to 
    being chartered as the Murie Audubon Society. At that time it was apparent 
    that new chapters would be formed within the state and that any geographical 
    name would become obsolete. So, with Mardie Murie's consent, we adopted the 
    Murie name in honor of the entire Murie family for their work as biologist, 
    naturalists and environmental activists.&quot;<br>

    is the time of year that intrigues birders to no end! Every outing is full 
    of possibilities - how many new birds for the year will I get today? Maybe a 
    new species for the state? Maybe a new life bird? The impact of the drought 
    heightens the uncertainty of what may be seen - the usual may not be &quot;usual&quot; 
    this spring. But conversely, those same conditions may bring in the unusual 
    that we all hope to see. <br>

    Turkey Vultures are definitely back, as are the Killdeer, Tree Swallows, and 
    Mountain Bluebirds; Red-tailed Hawks and Am. Kestrels are being seen in 
    increasing numbers. Shorebirds are starting to show up in earnest - 
    Yellowlegs, Marbled Godwits, Am. Avocets - keep looking, there will be more 
    to come!! Common Loons were sighted at Alcova, a Long-tailed Duck at Grey 
    Reef, and Blue-winged and Cinnamon Teal are now being reported. Seen at 
    McDonald's Pond, a Red-necked Grebe, a Red-breasted Merganser, and a young 
    Bald Eagle. At Dave Johnston Power Plant, Dave Baskett reported Mountain 
    Bluebirds, a few Oregon Juncos and about 200 Canada Geese. Sally Lund 
    reported an early Rose-breasted Grosbeak in the Lund yard.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Spring migration is picking up momentum and more birds are arriving daily; 
    try to get out as often as you can. To keep up with what is being seen, call 
    the Murie Bird Hotline frequently (265-BIRD, or outside of Casper 
    1-888-265-BIRD); and take part in the WYOBirds list serve. (If birds are not 
    your key interest, go out and walk across the prairie or through a wooded 
    area - the wildflowers are starting to bloom - watch for phlox, bluebells (Mertensia), 
    Townsend's daisy, wild onion, golden pea (Thermopsis), sand lily (Leucocrinum),

    plans for a Saturday trip up on Casper Mountain were changed when snow 
    started falling on the Mountain Friday evening. In spite of a winter-like 
    overcast sky and a chilling northeast breeze, it was decided to walk parts 
    of the Platte River Parkway. Our starting point was Garden Creek Center 
    (where we had good views of Cassin's Finches); we then headed for Morad Park, walking from there into Murie's Bird Sanctuary where robins, 
    red-wings, and Song Sparrows were singing. We also were fortunate to catch 
    sight of a Wood Duck and watch a Caspian Tern working that part of the 
    river. Other interesting birds seen included a White-breasted Nuthatch and a 
    Downy Woodpecker drumming on a utility pole. The group also had excellent 
    views of several Ring-billed Gulls and California Gulls, giving us a great 
    opportunity to compare and identify these two species.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We then drove over to Mills to walk the Parkway path behind Wotco; that 
    section of path yielded good views of two Ospreys, cormorants, and two more 
    Caspian Terns (one carrying a freshly-caught fish in his mouth). From there 
    we headed home, a little chilled, but happy with the sightings of the 
    morning.<br>
    Species seen: Cassin's Finch, Pine Siskin, House Finch, Am. Robin, 
    Black-capped Chickadee, W. Meadowlark, Red-winged Blackbird, Mourning Dove, 
    Song Sparrow, Canada Goose, Mallard, Am. Kestrel, Red-tailed Hawk, 
    White-breasted Nuthatch, Ring-billed Gull, California Gull, Wood Duck, Downy 
    Woodpecker, Am. Crow, Common Grackle, Caspian Tern, No. Flicker, European

        <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">1.&nbsp;
        If your feeder is on a pole, mount about a foot of aluminum duct tubing 
        under it. The squirrels will climb the pole, encounter the duct and 
        climb into it-but they'll have to retreat once they realize they have 
        nowhere to go.<br>
        2.&nbsp;
        Run your feeder pole lengthwise through the center of a slinky. Attach 
        the slinky to top of the pole and let the rest of it hang. Squirrels 
        will try to climb up the slinky, but will get dumped back down to the 
        ground.<br>
        3.&nbsp;
        Punch holes in the bottom of a few two-liter juice bottles, large enough 
        to get around the post of your bird feeder. Hang them lengthwise, 
        securing them a few inches below the feeder with duct tape-the squirrels 
        will slide right off.<br>
        4.&nbsp;
        Buy a clear plastic dome and place it directly above a hanging feeder. 
        Squirrels planning a raid from the top of your feeder will slip right 
        off-just make sure your feeder is high enough in the air to prevent 
        ground assaults.<br>
        5.&nbsp;
        Mount a feeder on top of a length of PVC pipe. Squirrels won't get any 
        traction when they try to climb it, and will slide off. <br>
        6.&nbsp;
        Some people wire their feeders with electricity to keep squirrels 
        away-but this can be extremely dangerous. A safer alternative is a 
        feeder with a built-in, battery-operated charger that gives invading 
        squirrels a light shock without hurting them. The shock only triggers 
        for four-legged visitors, so birds won't notice a difference.<br>
        7.&nbsp;
        Buy a hanging feeder surrounded by wire screen. Small birds will be able 
        to enter and feed, but larger bully birds and squirrels will be 
        excluded.<br>
        8.&nbsp;
        Switch from sunflower seeds to safflower seeds. The change in diet is 
        popular with cardinals, house finches, chickadees, nuthatches and 
        mourning doves, but the safflower doesn't appeal to squirrels. <br>
        9.&nbsp;
        String wire through the tops and bottoms of two-liter plastic soda 
        bottles, and hang bird feeders in between or in the middle. Squirrels 
        walking the wire to get to the feeders will roll off when they step on 
        the bottles.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If you don't mind furry visitors or want to do your part to accommodate 
        squirrels, you can distract them away from bird feeders by setting aside 
        a few dried corn cobs just for them. Impale the cobs lengthwise on 
        spikes, then drive the spikes through a wooden board (so the cobs are 
        perpendicular to the board). Attach the board to a tree limb or trunk 
        where squirrels can reach the kernels. <br>

        The Bureau of Land Management has released the Supplemental Draft 
        Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Jack Morrow Hills 
        Coordinated Activity Plan/Draft Green River Resource Management Plan 
        Amendment. This supplemental draft environmental impact statement 
        represents the
        culmination of a comprehensive planning process involving the public, 
        Tribes, and numerous cooperators at the federal, state and local level 
        to analyze options for a balance of uses in the planning area. The BLM 
        undertook the process in full compliance with the National Environmental 
        Policy Act (NEPA) and other applicable legal requirements.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        The supplemental draft EIS considers five alternatives for addressing 
        the issues in the JMH planning area, including a continuation of present 
        management (No Action Alternative) and a Preferred Alternative. These 
        alternatives provide a variety of management choices regarding the use 
        and development of public lands in the planning area. When the planning 
        effort is completed, it will provide an integrated, multiple-use 
        activity plan for balancing resource use and resource protection.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Decisions on fluid minerals leasing and locatable minerals for the JMH 
        area that were deferred in the Green River Resource Management Plan (RMP) 
        will be made in the JMH CAP. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        The preferred alternative includes an adaptive management strategy that 
        allows for resumption of surface disturbing activities in much of the 
        area using current management practices. In the balance of the planning 
        area surface disturbing activities may resume, provided they meet 
        proposed management objectives. &quot;Balancing the rights of the lease 
        holders and developing the oil and gas resources, while protecting the 
        wildlife and other values was an important consideration in selecting 
        the preferred alternative,&quot; said Wyoming BLM State Director Bob Bennett.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        The supplemental draft EIS for the JMH CAP documents the BLM's 
        commitment to working with the public and cooperating agencies to 
        provide a full range of alternatives. The Bureau's integration of 
        Secretary Norton's Four C's: Communication, Consultation, Cooperation, 
        all in the Service of Conservation, has been vital to producing a 
        comprehensive product. <br>

        Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The Jack Morrow Hills planning area contains about 622,330 acres of

    its September meeting in New Orleans, the ABC Policy Council adopted a 
    resolution &quot;to encourage programs aimed at reducing the threat of lead 
    poisoning to birds.&quot; The resolution, passed unanimously by the Council, also 
    supports manufacturers' efforts to develop non-toxic alternatives to lead 
    shot and lead fishing weights. The lethal nature of lead to birds, 
    particularly waterfowl such as Trumpeter swans, and other species including 
    loons, eagles and condors has been <br>
    known for decades. Yet even with viable alternatives available, lead remains 
    the primary material used in hunting shot and fishing weights. In 1991, FWS 
    imposed a ban on the use of lead shot for waterfowl hunting and laws have 
    been passed in Maine, New Hampshire, and New York that ban the sale and/or 
    use of certain sizes of lead fishing sinkers, but the U.S. still lags behind 
    other countries Britain, parts of continental Europe, and Japan, that have 
    banned lead ammunition and fishing tackle outright.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    By enacting the resolution, the Policy Council hopes to encourage outreach 
    programs that both educate hunters, shooters, and anglers about the dangers 
    of lead to wildlife, and promote the uses of suitable, non-toxic 
    alternatives. The resolution cites the U.S. Department of Defense, the 
    largest single user of ammunition in the U.S., as a model for the work it 
    has undergone to develop lead-free
    alternatives through its &quot;Green Bullet Program&quot;.<br>

    International, which recently launched it Wildlife Lead Poisoning Reduction

    example of the danger facing Golden Eagles occurred in Wyoming in the summer 
    of 2000, when a wildlife rehabilitator near Thunder Basin National 
    Grasslands was brought almost 100 eagles suffering from lead contamination.

        tell us much about the stewardship of man on this planet. Sometimes 
        indications of a problem aren't recognized in time and public concern is 
        too late in developing. We can learn, for example, from the demise of 
        the Passenger Pigeon. Three excellent monographs deal with its 
        extirpation: W. B. Mershon's The Passenger Pigeon in 1907, Margaret H. 
        Mitchell's The Passenger Pigeon in Ontario in 1935, and A. W. Schorger's 
        The Passenger Pigeon, its Natural History and Extinction in 1955 and 
        1973. But these works came too late. <br>

        The failure of eastern Bald Eagles to produce young was part of the 
        motivation for Rachel Carson to write Silent Spring in 1962. The 
        Peregrine Falcon and Osprey, other species at the top of the food chain, 
        collecting large burdens of organochlorine pesticides such as DDT, were 
        also on the verge of extirpation throughout the eastern half of North 
        America (Peregrine Falcon Populations, their Biology and Decline, edited 
        by Joseph J. Hickey, appeared in print in 1969, reporting the results of 
        a 1965 conference). As a result of widespread concern, DDT was banned, 
        and all three species are doing better, aided by management and 
        reintroduction programs.<br>

        Whooping Crane numbers reached a frightening low of only 19 wild birds 
        in 1946. A photo of these magnificent birds in flight by Saskatchewan's 
        Fred Lahrman was Canada's &quot;News Photo of the Year&quot; in 1953. The nesting 
        grounds of the few remaining birds were located in 1954. In response to 
        much publicity, the railway to Pine Point was re-routed at considerable 
        expense, to avoid disturbing the breeding cranes. Public interest has 
        been steadily supportive and as a result these birds are closely 
        monitored, with extensive research and management programs. The Whooping 
        Crane now has an excellent chance of avoiding the fate of the Passenger 
        Pigeon.<br>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, 
        then, has the Eskimo Curlew&nbsp;received so little attention, apart 
        from Ontario writer Fred Bodsworth's best-selling novel, The Last of the 
        Curlews, published in 1954? Why has there been no monograph to detail 
        the history of this species?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Once one of the most numerous birds in North America, the Eskimo Curlew 
        has hovered at the very brink of extinction ever since its drastic 
        decline about 100 years ago. Although its extinction has been treated as 
        a foregone conclusion, this hasn't happened yet. In striking contrast to 
        the larger, more easily identified species mentioned above, virtually no 
        money has been spent to study or protect this bird. Apart from 
        Bodsworth's book and one or two sightings a year by keen birders, 
        recorded in specialized journals of relatively small circulation, little 
        has been said about it or done on its behalf. No habitat change or 
        pesticide threat has been identified. The Eskimo Curlew has failed to 
        excite the interest of the general public.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The present monograph is an important contribution, since it adds 
        another landmark case history to the annals of species near extinction. 
        We must learn from our mistakes if we are to avoid perpetuating them, 
        yet it is difficult to determine what lesson is to be learned until we 
        have collected and attempted to understand the relevant facts. Gollop 
        and his collaborators, Tom Barry and Eve Iversen, deserve great credit 
        for their thorough collation of the available observations, from past 
        through present, and their interpretations of this information. Such a 
        complete synthesis has never before been attempted.<br>
