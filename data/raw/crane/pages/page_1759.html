<meta NAME="abstract"
CONTENT="The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has held a        leading international position in wildlife research and management since its                                         founding in 1936 as America's first wildlife experiment station and research refuge.
In 1940 there were less than 20 whooping cranes alive in the world. Changes in habitat, egg collecting, and hunting almost led to its extinction. There are now 188 whoopers in that wild flock, another 100 in captivity, and over 60 in an experimental flock in Florida. This recovery was directly due to conservation efforts, scientific research, and changes in land management.
	Unique to North America, the whooping crane stands 5 feet tall with a long neck and long legs. Its pure white body feathers are accented by jet black wing-tips and a red-and-black head with a long, pointed beak. The wings measure about 8 feet across.
	Breeding whooping cranes in captivity at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center began in 1967 with 12 eggs collected from the wild flock.  The Patuxent flock currently has 44 adults, with 9 experienced breeding pairs who generally lay around 50 eggs a year in total. From these eggs last year, we raised 26 chicks most of which were released in Florida.  ">

      <p ALIGN="CENTER">A Wild Whooper Fledges in Florida!</p>
      </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">
      <p>We apologize for postponing this report, but we think you will agree
      that it was worth the wait.</p>
      <p>For the first time in over 60 years, a wild whooping crane has
      successfully fledged in the United States. (A bird is considered
      &quot;fledged&quot; when it is capable of flight.) Prior to the fledging
      of this chick, the last whoopers which fledged in the United States lived
      in a non-migratory flock in Louisiana. The last members of that flock were
      lost in the 1940's.</p>
      <p>The whooper chick, appropriately dubbed &quot;Lucky&quot; by the
      biologists and volunteers documenting his development, was hatched and
      reared by two Patuxent-raised whoopers who are part of the experimental
      non-migratory Florida flock. This is the second clutch from the
      non-migratory flock to be produced in Florida. The first clutch hatched in
      2000 (see <a href="chick66.HTM">Whooping Crane Chick, Day 66</a>). The
      surviving chick from that clutch was
      just a few days from fledging when it was tragically killed by a bobcat.</p>
      <p>Lucky's life has been full of drama, and the Florida staff has been
      diligent in sending us their fascinating reports. Gene and Tina Tindell
      volunteered their yard as an observation post for the past 3 months; they
      not only gave the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission staff
      and volunteers an excellent place to film the chick's progress, they
      actively participated themselves, keeping a close eye on events, and
      communicating regularly with the Florida staff. They've probably seen more
      of a wild whooping crane chick and its parents than anyone ever has. Their
      help has been invaluable. Patuxent graduate student Nichole Allison
      observed the chick at night and provided important information.</p>
      <p>We at Patuxent especially want to thank biologists Marty Folk and Steve
      Nesbitt for sending us all the wonderful reports, photos, and video clips.
      For the Patuxent staff, it was like getting precious news about a distant
      grandchild!</p>
      <p>Both of Lucky's parents were costume-reared at Patuxent in 1998, and
      released into the non-migratory flock in Florida in January, 99. (These
      birds are part of the first whooper release project, which is separate
      from the more recent migratory release project that involves the
      ultra-light aircraft. The non-migratory flock and the migratory flock use
      different areas in Florida and will remain separate.)</p>
      <p>This young pair was first observed building a nest platform around
      Christmas, 2001, the earliest anyone's ever documented this. They started
      incubating on February 11, 2002, and Lucky hatched overnight March 12th to
      March 13th. A second chick hatched overnight between March 14th and March
      15th.</p>
      <p>Tragedy struck quickly just two days later. A bald eagle carried away
      the younger chick while the parents were away from the nest feeding Lucky.
      (A surveillance video camera, placed on the Tindell's property, filmed the
      predation.) Cranes learn parenting skills through experience, and this
      young pair had just learned a terrible lesson. Having lost their youngest
      chick, the pair became much more attentive to Lucky, and moved him away
      from the nest to a clump of buttonbush, where he would be safe from
      further eagle strikes. But the biologists feared that the eagle, having
      found an easy meal for her own chicks, would simply wait for the new
      parents to become distracted again.</p>
      <p>At Patuxent, we were following the events in Florida closely. Lucky is
      the embodiment of our hopes for the future; he's the reason we do the work
      we do. Ironically, some of us who've worked at Patuxent for a long time
      have also spent years raising eagle chicks for release into the wild, when
      those birds were more endangered than they are now. So, hearing that these
      two endangered species we have worked to save were in a life-and-death
      competition was frustrating. The lack of rainfall in Florida has impacted
      all the species living there, making the struggle for resources fierce.</p>
      <p>However, the whooper parents had learned their lesson. They remained
      extremely attentive to Lucky, and he grew and thrived. Every night, the
      parents would return to the nest platform and the female would brood the
      chick while the male stood guard over them. During a thunderstorm, the
      female brooded the chick on the nest to protect him. We were fascinated to
      hear that Lucky's behavior during thunderstorms was much like our own
      chicks: he would hunker down, peep, or run to his parents. Our own chicks
      do the same thing during noisy thunderstorms, cuddling up against the
      stuffed brooder models that serve as their surrogate parents.</p>
      <p>When Lucky was 3 weeks old, the eagle attacked again. This time, the
      female whooper crouched over Lucky with her wings spread, protecting him,
      while the male whooper jumped up at the eagle to drive her away. A pair of
      protective whooper parents are formidable foes and the eagle left, no
      doubt in search of easier prey. Later that same week, 3 boys on bicycles
      rode up to the edge of the marsh. The female whooper fearlessly charged
      them, and the boys decided it would be best to leave!</p>
      <p>Lucky's diet largely consisted of earthworms the parents would dig out
      of the soil at the edge of the marsh (enough to stock a baitshop, as
      biologist Marty Folk told us), or some of the large flying insects like
      dragonflies and katydids easily caught among the vegetation. At one time,
      the Tindells counted the parents feeding the chick 37 food items in a 5
      minute period! As Lucky grew and needed more and more food, the parents
      actually caught mallard ducklings to feed their growing chick!</p>
      <p>When Lucky was 6 weeks old, the marsh began drying up due to the lack
      of rain. The loss of water was dangerous to the chick, allowing predators
      like bobcats or dogs to make inroads into the marsh. Most predators won't
      wade through water to catch prey, so the nest platform, when surrounded by
      water, is a safe haven, as is water deep enough for the birds to roost in.
      When the water receded, exposing the nest platform, the parents built
      another one where the water was deeper. This was a surprise to the
      biologists, since they weren't aware that platform-building behavior would
      continue at this stage of chick-rearing. As the water continued to recede,
      the parents would eventually build more nest platforms whenever they
      needed a new, safer haven to keep Lucky protected.</p>
      <p>When Lucky was almost 10 weeks, the marsh had dried up considerably,
      leaving only a small basin of water in the center. Roaming dogs became a
      serious threat. The Florida staff consulted with the local police
      department and animal control authorities, who gave a lot of support to
      help control loose dogs in the area. When a chick is close to fledging,
      it's very vulnerable to predation as its practice flights often take it
      farther from the parents than at any other time. It was during this period
      that the chick reared in 2000 was lost to a bobcat. Everyone anxiously
      worried about the drying marsh and the dogs, and hoped Lucky's luck would
      hold out.</p>
      <p>But even though Lucky was now a large young crane, almost as big as his
      parents, they hadn't seen the last of the eagles. A pair of bald eagles
      landed in the marsh, no doubt looking for food. Whether these were the
      same eagles who had snatched Lucky's sibling is impossible to say. But
      Lucky's parents didn't care if they were the same birds or not. The
      whooper pair immediately attacked the eagles. One of the adult eagles,
      startled by the attacking whoopers, flushed immediately, but the other
      eagle wasn't as quick to get off the ground. The whooper parents pounced
      on that eagle, stomping on it. Satisfied that they'd made their point
      about the sanctity of their marsh, the whooper family regrouped some
      distance away. The volunteer who had observed the interaction checked on
      the battered eagle and called local wildlife officials to get the bird
      some help.</p>
      <p>By June 6th, Lucky was fully fledged, capable of flying 200-300 yards
      at a time, often leading his parents into flight. He is now fully capable
      of flying well enough and long enough to avoid predators and keep up with
      his parents wherever they decide to go. Cranes are vulnerable to predation
      all their lives, but Lucky has gotten through one of the most hazardous
      periods. He will, most likely, remain with his vigilant parents until he's
      around a year of age. Assuming he survives, we might hope that these
      parents, with the valuable experience they now have, will nest again,
      conditions permitting, and produce more healthy chicks.</p>
      <p>And let's hope the eagles have learned to hunt elsewhere!</p>
      <p>Other whoopers in Florida did nest and lay eggs this breeding season,
      but the lack of rain fall and decreasing water levels didn't permit them
      the same success as this pair had. The Florida biologists continue to hope
      for the return of normal rainfall which, they are convinced, will
      encourage a very welcomed whooper baby boom in central Florida.</p>
