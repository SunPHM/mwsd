&nbsp;This site at the Marshall University School of Medicine allows you
to pretend you're a doctor and attempt to diagnose a virtual patient. &nbsp;You
can take a history, order labs, and perform a physical exam. &nbsp;And if
you really are a physician, you can get CME credit for spending some time
on this site.

<A HRef="http://205.158.47.41/index.html">Jelly Belly Online</A> &nbsp;I
love this site but I must admit that I originally found it through a link
on the homepage of my college roommate Lou (which, sadly, no longer exists).
&nbsp;Try to win free samples! &nbsp;If you don't win, you can always order
Jelly Bellies online (they're Kosher, you know).

<A Href="http://www.3dflags.com/">3D Animated Flags</A> &nbsp;This site is
cool because you can find animated flags here for most countries and several
US states. &nbsp;I personally find the Canadian flag particularly attractive.
Or you can check out <A Href="http://thepage.simplenet.com/">The Page</A>,
which has a more extensive collection of flags, including all the US states,
Canadian provinces and territories, and most countries (including Nepal,
the fabled home of Bikas).

FlyLab</A> &nbsp;A very cool page. &nbsp;Perform hundreds of virtual crosses
between different types of <I>Drosophila</I>. Learn genetics by designing
your own experiments. &nbsp;See what kind of bizarre mutants you can make!
&nbsp;If you're really feeling twisted, you can then mate the mutant offspring
with each other and see what fruit-fly incest is all about (this happens
every day in genetics labs around the world).

<A HREF="http://www.starwars.com/index.html">Star Wars</A> &nbsp;One of the
best and most important movies of all time (yes, I barely remember being
five years old and seeing the original release)! &nbsp;This is the official
Star Wars site, containing images, character sketches, and production notes
from Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and the soon-to-be
released Episode I. If you're a fan of Industrial Light &amp; Magic (George
Lucas' production studio) you should also check out
<A HREF="http://www.ilmfan.com/">this site</A> which has a very complete
list of films and other information on ILM.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.slanguage.com/">American Slanguages</A> &nbsp;This site
is hilarious! &nbsp;Learn how people talk in different parts of the country.
&nbsp;My favorite slanguage is Bostonian, of course, but New York-ese is
pretty amusing too.

<A HREF="http://www.crimescene.com/"><IMG border=0 Src="crimescene.gif" Align=right
    width=269 height=55 Alt="Crimescene"></A>
<A HREF="http://www.crimescene.com/">Crimescene</A> is a site which allows
you to play an interactive role in fictional murder investigations. &nbsp;The
site is updated weekly with new evidence, including photographs, witness
interviews, and expert insights. &nbsp;The site is so thorough and realistic
that it's easy to forget that the crimes being "investigated" are entirely
made-up.

<A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html">The
Nine Planets</A> &nbsp;Though it looks pretty plain at first, this site has
some pretty neat stuff. You can look at photos and read about each of the
planets in our solar system as well as all of the known satellites and many
other "small bodies". &nbsp;Some of the pictures are breath-taking and the
amount of information available is staggering. &nbsp;Most sections include
not only basic scientific information such as size, mass, and orbit, but
also include the history surrounding the discovery of many celestial bodies
and the origins and pronunciation of names.

<A HREF="http://www.pantheon.org/mythica/">Encyclopedia Mythica</A> &nbsp;I
found this site while I was looking around
<A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html">The
Nine Planets</A> one day. &nbsp;I was curious about the name of Pluto's moon
(Charon) and found a link leading here. &nbsp;They have pantheons of Greek,
Roman, Norse, Egyptian, Hindu, Aztec, and other mythologies as well as important
maps and genealogy tables. &nbsp;When I got my newest guinea pig this summer,
I went here to find a name for him and finally settled on Loki, the Norse
god of mischief.

<A HREF="http://www.antitelemarketer.com/">The AntiTelemarketer's Source</A>
&nbsp;Do you hate getting calls from telemarketers? &nbsp;Vince Nestico does.
&nbsp;In fact, he hates those calls so much he's dedicated an entire web
page to fighting back. &nbsp;His site includes antitelemarketing methods,
information on hang-ups, how to get onto "Do Not Call Lists", and ways to
torment the people who call you. &nbsp;All I can say is that Vince is
<B>very</B> angry and has a lot of time on his hands....

<A HRef="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/">Web Pages That Suck</A> &nbsp;A
very amusing page by Vincent Flanders that details many common faults of
pages throughout the web. &nbsp;It can be very helpful if you're designing
your own page (I learned, for example, that my page sucks because I have
a counter and I use the "passe" rainbow bar graphic). &nbsp;I highly recommend
you check this one out, if for no other reason than that it will keep you
laughing for around an hour or so.

&nbsp;Pixelsight will allow you to design and then download custom graphics.
&nbsp;It also has a vast library of icons, background textures, symbols,

to be a free site, it now costs $49/year to be a member (which is why no
new graphics have appeared on my pages in a while).
