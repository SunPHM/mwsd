<P>This has been a spring to remember for the wildflowers.
Generally cool weather and abundant moisture resulted in an
incredibly good blossoming season for many of the native flowers.

<P>A surprisingly large number of our large-flowered trilliums
have already turned to their rosy-pink &quot;fading&quot; color
by mid-May, somewhat earlier than usual.  The hepaticas, the true
&quot;Mayflowers&quot; to many people, were largely finished
blossoming before the end of April in our inland woods.

<P>The names of wildflowers have fascinated me ever since, as a
small child, I learned mostly the colloquial names of the area
plants, names frequently coined by the local people.  Our Sunday
wildflower hikes with our parents into our favorite
&quot;Toonerville Trolley Woods&quot; near Casco Junction fanned
the spark that has glowed ever since.

<P>I learned as a teacher that young children benefited greatly
during our wildflower classes in the woods by making up their own
names of wildflowers they carefully observed for the first time.
In so doing they paid attention to the shape and colors of the
blossoms, the margins and colors of the leaves, the texture and
placement of the leaves along with many other interesting
features.

<P>Their favorite name of the Dutchman’s breeches was the
&quot;tooth flower.&quot;  Streamlined leaves speckled with
earthy tones of tan and green reminded third graders of a trout
or even a fawn.  Hence the &quot;trout lily&quot; and
&quot;fawn&quot; lily became their chosen names.

<P>Years ago it was the scholars, intent on choosing appropriate
common and scientific names for wildflowers, who often allowed
their imaginations to run freely.  Take the wild columbine that
will soon be flowering.  The Latin word, &quot;columbinus,&quot;
meaning dove-like, refers to the resemblance of the five-arched
nectar spurs on a columbine flower to doves sitting in a circle
around a dish.

<P>Another person’s imagination interpreted the nectar spurs to
be the talons of an eagle (aquila in latin).  Still another
claims the scientific name of <I>Aqualegia</I> is derived from
aqua, meaning water, and legere, to collect.  Personally I prefer
the dove interpretation and so do the children and adults to whom
I have told the story while admiring this spectacular common
roadside flower.

<P>We can thank the French for the name of the ubiquitous
dandelion.  Examine the margin of one of its leaves and, with
some imagination, you should see the teeth in a lion’s mouth.
The French would generally pronounce if
&quot;DON-de-lay-OWN,&quot; meaning tooth of the lion.  How
simple it has been to Americanize this into dandelion!

<P>It was an elderly friend years ago who introduced me to the
ripened fruit of the May apple.  He had grown up in the South and
told me that they especially enjoyed the flavoring that the juice
of the ripe, lemon-shaped yellow fruit added when squeezed into a
glass of Madiera, a fortified dessert wine from the island of
Madiera.

<P>We recently visited with friends in the Kickapoo Valley area
of southwestern Wisconsin where we enjoyed enormous sprawling
patches of May-apples, thousands upon thousands of individual
&quot;green umbrellas&quot; decorating one hillside after
another.  These colonies spread quickly both by seed and creeping
roots.

<P>Any time a wildflower has eye-catching unusual shape, is
plentiful to the point of virtually carpeting both open and
woodland edges, and also contains a portion that is edible, it is
bound to take on numerous common names.  May apple, Mandrake, hog
apple, wild lemon, Puck’s foot and raccoon berry all describe the
same wildflower.

<P>Its scientific name, <I>Podophyllum peltatum</I>
(po-doe-FILL-um pel-TAY-tum), can be interpreted to mean a
&quot;leaf like a foot, shaped like a shield.&quot;  I’ll let you
figure that one out!  The plant really does have an enormous
beautiful leaf that, once you see it you’ll never forget it.

<P>The large white flower, situated in the crotch of the two
large leaves, opens in May.  The so-called apple forms quickly
and will be green until well into mid-summer before it turns to
its lemon-like yellow color and will only then be edible.  All
parts of the plant including the large leaves, the stalk, root
and also the green fruit are very poisonous.

<P>It is only after fully ripe that one can safely consume the
fruit which, when eaten by different people, will result in
various reactions.  Asa Gray, the famous American botanist,
described it as &quot;mawkish, eaten by pigs and boys.&quot;
Some might even describe it as nauseating while others simply
characterize it as having a peculiar flavor.

<P>The first one I ever consumed was simply cut in two and fleshy
insides sucked out.  I thought it was quite interesting.  There
are those people who claim that the fruit can  be made into an
excellent marmalade and also into beautiful jelly.

<P>Above all, enjoy the enchanting names of wildflowers along
with the unusual ways in which many of them came about.
