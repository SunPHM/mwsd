	<div class="posts"><a name="81916076"></a><b>Backdated Posts...Pay Attention</b><br>As some of you know, I've been out of town (ha!) the past three days.  For those of you who don't know, I paid exhorbitant amounts of money to ride the shinkansen (bullet train) to Hiroshima, and I stopped in Kyoto on my way back.  It was a three-day adventure, and the following is a brief summary (no matter how long it is, trust me, it's brief).<br><b>Wednesday, 9/18</b><br>I wake up at 6:30 (okay, 7) and, since I've packed the night before, I give my stuff a quick once-over to make sure I have everything, then eat my toast (real Skippy!) and drink my milk (skim!).  I walk to Mujina - the bus station nearest home - and wait for the 8:04 to Kofu.  I'm there plenty early, because sometimes so are the busses.  Today, however, the bus is late.  No wait, it's nonexistant.  I don't know why it never showed up, it just didn't.  So the next bus comes at 8:24 and off we go.<br>At Kofu station, I buy a ticket for the local to Fuji, where I'm planning on transferring to shinkansen.  I go into the ticket office to buy advance shinkansen tickets, show the guy the local ticket I just bought, and he takes the ticket, gives me my money back, and sets me a completely different schedule.  Oh well, he should know better than me.  At 9:30, I'm on the Limited Express bound for Shizuoka.  All my tickets have times and train numbers and station names on them, so I'm confident to the point of cocky.  I have a CD of travel songs I burned the night before, and I'm listening to it full blast.  U2 tells me I still haven't found what I'm looking for, and Rusted Root sends me on my way.<br>I transfer to shinkansen in Shizuoka, then transfer to another one in Nagoya.  I arrive in Hiroshima around 3:30.  I look for the bus that will take me to the Youth Hostel, where I'm staying the night.  I tell the driver I'm going to the YH, and that I'm not sure which stop to get off at.  He mumbles something in Japanese and I head for a seat, hoping he'll just wave me off at the right stop.  He does, and as I depart, he says in very good English, "It's 220 yen.  Do you have coins?  Okay.  Thank you, have a nice day," and points toward a sign that tells me how to get to the YH.<br>The hostel is much like what I would assume staying in a YMCA is like: three sets of bunk beds to a room, communal showers, a cafeteria with a bountiful but not great dinner.  It's nice enough, though: I get to sleep in a bed instead of on a futon on the floor, and it's cheap.<br><b>Thursday, 9/19</b><br>The next morning I check out, my bookbag on my back, my carryon dragging behind me.  I grab the bus into town and head for Carp Castle (it sounds nicer in Japanese, and anyhow most people just call it Hiroshima Castle).  Of course, the castle is a replica, because the original was destroyed in the bombing.  The inside, however, is a museum rather than a replica of the original castle.  It's nice, but museum-ish.  The outside is better than the inside, though the inside is packed with samurai armor and katana blades (which all look somewhat the same to me).<br>After the castle I hoof over to Shukkein-en Garden, which my tourbook says "attempts to recreate grand vistas on a miniture scale".  Having never been to a Japanese garden before, I didn't think it was that miniture.  However, I suppose the individual pieces were small, but the whole garden covered a fairly large area.  It was...garden-ish.  Pretty, quiet, babbling small brook - but once again, there was a plaque about how it had been destroyed in the bombing.<br>I grabbed lunch on the way to Sogo department store, where I wanted to buy a towel.  I was working on the assumption that the place I was going to stay that night in Kyoto wouldn't have towels, because to my chagrin, the YH hadn't had them, either.  After purchasing the cheapest towel I could find (1500 yen), I continued down the road.  Suddenly, the top of the <a href="http://www.hiroshima-is.ac.jp/Hiroshima/Images/Photo%20Gallary/a-bomb%20dome.jpg" target="_blank">A-Bomb Dome</a> appeared over the trees in front of me, and I stopped in my tracks, thinking "I'm really here.  I made it."  I crossed the street and wandered around the building, taking some video and some still photos.  The building was left exactly as it was, and an effort to eternally preserve it as a reminder is being made.  It's definately a statement.<br>I crossed down to a statue of an <a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/dannyboy/hirochild2.jpg" target="_blank">angel</a> that had been draped with chains of origami cranes.  As I walked away, the most poignant moment of the entire trip occurred.  An old Japanese woman wlaked up to me and asked, "America?"  I said yes.  She asked, "hitori dake?" (only you?)  I told her yes, I was travelling alone.  She reached into her purse and pulled out a laminated piece of paper that had one sentence handwritten on it in several languages.  The English one read "Would you mind if I prayed your happiness?"  This amazed me.  She was probably only 2 or 3 at the time, but I knew this woman had seen the bombing.  Had lived through it.  She knew I was American, a descendant of the people who had destroyed her home...and <i>she</i> wanted to pray for <i>my</i> happiness.  I accepted.  I thought I'd have to give her money or something, but when she was finished, she simply told me (in Japanese) that I must go see the museum, it would make me cry.  Then she thanked me in both English and Japanese and turned and walked away.  As I went towards the Peace Park, I suddenly felt very small and overwhelmed.  I stopped and shed a tear or two.  When I collected myself, I looked at the plaque I had stopped next to: I was at the epicenter.<br>I saw the <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~candpn/japan/ch_mem.jpg" target="_blank">Children's Memorial</a>, where thousands and thousands of paper cranes are delivered each month, and was lucky enough to see two groups of school children hang cranes in the plexiglass boxes around the memorial.  I passed the <a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/~michj/tokyo2000/images/hiroshima/peace-park-cenotaph-flame-genbaku-dome.jpg" target="_blank">cenotaph</a>, which is an eternal flame that isn't meant to be eternal - when the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed, it shall be extinguished.  Then I went to the museum.<br>The museum was horrible.  It was a brutal assault on the heart and the mind.  It was simple, beautiful, well put together, and horrible.  There were models of the city of <a href="http://fugu.cs.columbia.edu/images/Japan%201999/June%20Travel/Hiroshima%20before%20bomb.JPG" target="_blank">before</a> and <a href="http://www.danciprari.com/images/worldtrip/japan/ja-hir-peace-memorial-museum-city-view-post-600.jpg" target="_blank">after</a> the blast, a video showing the Enola Gay shaking from the shockwaves of Little Boy, a full-size reproduction of the top of the A-Bomb Dome, photos of women whose kimono patterns had been seared into their skin, pieces of clothing from victims, roof tiles that had been cracked and melted from the heat, and a life-size <a href="http://www.therealteanna.com/images/Hiroshima-4.jpg" target="_blank">diorama</a> of a woman and two children hobbling from the rubble - their clothes in tatters and the flesh hanging off their fingers and faces.  Visitors are allowed to touch the roof tiles...I did, and when I pulled my hand away, I could still feel the bubbles and cracks.  I wanted to rub my hand against my jeans like you do when you've got something sticky on them, but I couldn't bare to do it.  I felt like I deserved to have that disturbing feeling stay with me.  I was very quiet the rest of the day. (This is saying something for me - I'm and only child...I talk to myself all the time.  this habit has escalated since I've been in Japan, because I'm the most fluent English speaker I know, and it's nice to talk to me.)<br>I caught a bus to the station, and a shinkansen to Kyoto.  I checked into my accomodations (a word I use in a loose and yet affectionate way).  Uno House is constantly packed with gaijin (foreigners).  You sleep four futons to a room, you have access to the kitchen to cook your own meals, it's dark, it's down a very narrow alley, non-guests are threatened with a 5ooo yen fine if they enter without permission from the management, and it's cheap.  I thought about staying an extra night.  I had dinner with two other guests: Corry - on holiday from Holland, and Kanna - a Japanese from Tokyo who was staying at Uno House because she wanted to practice her English.<br><b>Friday, 9/20</b><br>I get up earlier than expected because someone's chatter in the next room wakes me.  I try to sleep until 8:30, but end up just lying there listening to the ambient noise until my travel alarm clock goes off.  I dress, pack up my stuff, check out, and head for what should be a group of six temples (according to my guidebook).  Corry has convinced me to walk because there is so much culture to see along the way.  I'm still on adventurer's high, so my legs don't care.  I've got my temple book with me, which folds accordion-style and you pay the monks to write pieces of sutra and stamp it with the temple crest.  I'm looking forward to getting at least six more pages filled up.<br>I can only find two of the temples before I have to get back to the station.  This is not because they're hidden.  Temples are not like churches in that they are not just a building.  Temples are grounds with several buildings and the main reason I can't find more than two is that I'm not sure where one ends and thenext begins.  So I get two pages stamped and call it a day for that.  1600 temples in Kyoto (literally) and I find two.<br>I spend another half hour looking for a path behind the temples called the Path of Philosophy.  Originally I was going to skip it, since it's supposed to be prettiest in April when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, and it's another half hour walk.  But I can't resist the name (if only so that someday I can tell Brad about it), and eventually I find it.  It's pretty - there's a canal to follow, and no traffic.  The Path of Philosophy is also, ironically, lined with souvenier shops.  It takes me about 45 minutes to walk the length of it, because I stop at a couple of the shops.  I also get a lot of thinking done, and finish the path with a clearer head than I started with.<br>I get on the nearest bus, thinking it will get me somewhere near the station.  I find out it won't.  I get on the right bus, but just barely, because there are probably 75 people on this bus and that's MORE than full, and no one's getting off at any stop because we're all going to Kyoto station and it's the last stop, but the bus stops at all the stops and picks up people who keep pushing and pushing us tighter into the bus.  We get to the station an hour later, which is precisely a half hour too late to catch the train I needed to catch so I could get the last bus back to Shirane from Kofu.  Oh well.  I'll call Christina from Kofu and have her pick me up.<br>So I get the shinkansen from Kyoto to Shizuoka, and the Limited Express from there to Kofu.  I've missed the last bus by 20 minutes.  I call Christina's house and cell.  No answer.  She's at English Cafe.  Crap.  I call Gaby's cell because even though she's probably at English Cafe, she always answers her cell.  No luck there either.<br>I take a cab home from Kofu.  It's 3200 yen.<br>I'm finally home at 8:30, approximately $600 poorer in pocket, but immeasurably wealthier in soul.<br>The next day, my legs hurt like a bitch.<br>

	<div class="posts"><a name="81707804"></a><b>What a Weekend</b><br>Okay, so I had to be at school at 8am Saturday and Sunday, as well as yesterday.  Saturday was a rehearsal for the school festival, and Sunday and Monday actually was the fesitval.  On Sunday, each class performed a play they had been working on.  This event lasted from 8:30 to 4:30.  Some of the plays were really good, and I was frankly impressed with all of them...simply because when I was in junior high, we never did anything like it.  These kids built their own sets and cotumes, memorized the lines (in Japanese!  - that's not really impressive, considering), and ran sound and lights during the performance.  Not only that, but some of the subject matter was way beyond what American junior high kids would (be allowed to) do.  There were plays about ancient Japanese families who couldn't pay their taxes and so were abducted and crucified.  There were plays about spirits before birth and having to choose whether they wanted to be born with birth defects or fade out of existence completely.  There was an abridged version of Romeo and Juliet, complete with blood packets.  Heavy stuff.  The day got over at 4:30 and Kim and I went back home and made spaghetti and tempura for dinner (Kim stayed with me all Saturday night, all day Sunday, and then took off Monday morning while I was at...)<br>The grounds part of the festival was Monday.  This is basically track and field, but with ridiculous events.  Keep your peepers peeled for video soon, since I shot a lot.  (Unfortunately I had forgotten to bring my video camera to the plays, but I do have some still shots.)  Anyhow, this started at 8am, and it began to lightly sprinkle about 9.  The games went on because it wasn't bad.  "Games" in this context means things like fighting for tires, 35 people jumping one rope, rolling huge medicine balls across the field 35 times, and so on.  Then we broke for lunch.  When lunch was over, the rain escalated and it had cooled off significantly.  But do the Japanese call things on account of rain?  No.<br>So here are 350 kids, in gym shorts and t-shirts, jumping rope in the pouring cold rain (mothers everywhere are gasping).  They finally decided to stop for a little bit, just to see if the rain would let up.  When it did, the field was speckled with puddles and the clouds were still threatening more precipitation; any rational American would have cancelled the rest of the event...but we weren't dealing with rational Americans.  So the 3rd grade boys ran and got wheelbarrows and shovels from somewhere, and the girls went and got buckets and sponges...<br>And while the boys dug up dry dirt from under the tents and filled in the big puddles, the girls sponged up the water from the little puddles and wrung it out into the buckets.  <i>I am not making this up.</i>  I could never in my wildest improv scenes come up with something like this.  (I think I now know why Bob Kelly does such weird things on stage.  He learned it all from the Japanese.)  Anyhow, so once enough sponging and puddle-filling had been done, they went back to running and jumping and shivering.  After the events were over, I thought I was free....a half hour early, even.  <br>Oh, no.  Then I noticed the kids were all filing back outside after having changed into their regular uniforms.  And the vice principle came to me and said "I know it's past your going-home time, but we'd like you to stay and have fun with the students during their closing ceremonies."  Oh....okay.  So at 5, we all went outside and watched a slide show of digital photos from the events we'd just spent 8 hours watching.  Then they presented awards.  Then we did a folk dance (imagine 5'8" me dancing with the 1st grade boys, some of whom are 3'9" on a good day).  Then a couple of the kids sang karaoke.  Then a few more kids played a live song on thei instruments.  Then we watched fireworks (cool, and halfway on par with a small town's July 4th fireworks in Iowa.  These people do it right.)  The whole thing lasted until 7pm, when I went home, took a hot bath, and went to bed around 9.<br>I slept through my alarm this morning, and was ten minutes late to school.  Thank god starting tomorrow we have a six-day break.  Hiroshima, here I come.<br>
