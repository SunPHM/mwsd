<FONT SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER">Original Wild Whooping Crane Flock</P>
</FONT>
</B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Whooping Crane, known as the symbol of conservation, is one of the better known endangered species. They symbolize the struggle to maintain the vanishing creatures of our world.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original wild flock of Whooping Cranes is made up of birds that have always lived in natural circumstances. This flock is the only naturally occurring wild population in the world. Two other flocks are formed by Whooping cranes hatched and reared in captivity and reintroduced into the wild. Until these two flocks establish themselves by reproducing and adapting to the natural environment, they are deemed experimental.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The wild Whooping Crane flock spends its summers in Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories of Canada. They nest and rear their young here. During the fall season, the Whoopers migrate 2,500 miles south to Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas where they spend the winter and early spring. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About 1,400 whooping cranes are believed to have existed in 1860. Their population declined because of hunting and habitat loss until 1941 when the last migrating flock dwindled to an all-time low of 16 birds. The wild flock has slowly increased to over
179 in late 2002. This flock winters in and around Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the Gulf coast of Texas. In spring, they migrate north, nesting in Wood Buffalo National Park, which straddles the border of Alberta and Northwest Territories in Canada.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> </P>
</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER">Florida Whooping Crane Reintroduction Project (experimental)</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is involved in a large-scale project to restore Whooping Cranes to their former range in the southeastern United States. Records show Whooping Cranes in Florida during the 1930's. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The project was initiated in 1980 at the request of the Whooping Crane Recovery Team. The Commission is the lead agency in Florida, but this project is a cooperative effort involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, the Canadian Wildlife Service, and the International Crane Foundation (ICF).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first objective was to determine if a population of
non-migratory Whooping Cranes (as had persisted in Louisiana until the late 1940's) could be developed from genetically migratory stock (the only remaining Whooping Cranes are migratory). Migratory and
non-migratory subspecies of Sandhill Cranes were used in place of Whooping Cranes to answer the question of whether migration in cranes is an acquired (learned) or innate (genetically dictated) characteristic. Initial studies proved that
non-migratory cranes could be produced from migratory stock. Also, research on Sandhill Cranes in Florida and elsewhere identified the most appropriate technique to reintroduce cranes into former range.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1990 Florida's Kissimmee Prairie was selected by the USFWS as most promising for attempting the first reintroduction of Whooping Cranes in eastern North America. One reason Florida was selected is that a large and successful population of
non-migratory Sandhill Cranes is there. The other 2 populations of non-migratory Sandhill Cranes (Cuban and Mississippi) are far less successful. So it seemed reasonable that if
non-migratory Whooping Cranes could succeed anywhere, Florida was the most logical place to try.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first release of 14 Whooping Cranes was in February 1993. Between 19 and 48 cranes have been released each year since, for a total of 255 (as of fall 2002). Soft-release or gentle-release techniques are being used to release the birds. The technique involves a protracted period of acclimation in a specially constructed release pen. This is followed by a gradual transition to life on their own.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of birds that have released were 8 to 10 months old. They had been hatched and reared from eggs of captive Whooping Cranes at the U. S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Environmental Science Center and the ICF. Additional birds have recently come from the Calgary Zoo and San Antonio Zoo. Because of the experience with Sandhill Cranes it was expected initial mortality would be high (40 to 60%) and that predation would be the major source of mortality. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the first 2 release years, annual mortality averaged 66%, with predation by bobcats being the major cause. The third year a decision was made, in consultation with USFWS, to try something new at the rearing sites. The goal was to introduce birds into habitat that favored cranes but not predators. Smaller, temporary release pens made of lightweight plastic that could be quickly erected and taken down were used. This allowed use of the most suitable habitat for introductions based on marsh and pasture conditions. This allowed biological personnel to respond as water levels and habitat conditions changed through the release period.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major component of this new approach was cooperation by local private landowners, because the most appropriate crane habitat was often on their lands. In 1995 and 1996 64 birds were released on 6 privately owned sites First year survival using this new method averaged 70%. Minus cooperation by private landowners this exceptional improvement in survival would not have occurred.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drought and bobcat predation has been the major problems faced by Whooping Cranes in Florida. Drought that impacted Florida since 1998 increased effects of predation and reduced nesting efforts of reintroduced Whooping Cranes and Florida Sandhill Cranes.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reintroduced Whooping Cranes began nesting in 1999. Since then there 14 nesting attempts have been documented. In the 2002 nesting season 7 nests were monitored, one of which hatched 2 chicks. One of these chicks fledged on 7 June and became the first of a second generation of non-migratory whooping cranes in Florida. This historic bird, nicknamed Lucky, was also the first bird to be produced by captive reared, wild released, parents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently (as of December 2002) there are 86 Whooping Cranes surviving in Florida. With more normal water levels returning, it is expected that 12 to15 pairs of Whooping Cranes will be nesting in Florida during 2003. The ultimate project goal of 25 pairs of
non-migratory cranes reproducing at a self-sustaining rate in Florida does not seem as far-fetched now as it did in 1993.The Florida Commission crew is aware that success of this project is the culmination of a broader team effort. The Whooping Crane Conservation Association has been and integral part since the 1960’s..</P>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="Whoopie"></a>Whoopers Making Whoopee in Florida !!</p>
</font><font SIZE="4">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first whooping crane nesting behavior of the season was
observed in Florida on January 7, 2003 according to Kristi Candelora, Florida
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Whoopers dubbed 901 and 897 are
&quot;newlyweds&quot; and may not be old enough to successfully produce a chick,
but you never know. The male (901) was hatched in 1999, and the female (897) was
hatched in 1998. The birds were observed on an island in a marsh, both moving
wet vegetation as if nest building. Then on January 11, again some nest building
behavior by both birds was observed. This relationship appears to be getting
serious! Yet, when Biologist Jeannette Parker’s plane flew over the nest area
yesterday, no nest was evident. It is common for Whoopers to exhibit some
&quot;practice behavior&quot; before they are physically capable of nesting.
Jeannette did take a picture while flying over and she plans to enlarge it to
see if there really is anything there.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In another Whooper family incident Lucky's parents kicked him
out on January 6 and they haven't been seen together since. Wildlife parents
normally disassociate themselves with their young when the young are old enough
to fend for themselves. As our readers know, Lucky was hatched and fledged in
Florida last year. This was the first chick fledged in the U.S. dating back to
the last nesting of Whooping Cranes in Louisiana in 1939.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With Lucky out on his own, it appears his parents are now
planning for another &quot;blessed event&quot;. The parents (898/800) were
observed in what appeared to be an attempt at copulation on January 8, 2003. A
few days later they were observed building a nest and then they laid an egg on
January 30. The marsh where 898 and 800 are nesting this year is in a less human
dominated site than the one they chose last year (a mile or 2 to the west). It</font>
<font SIZE="4">is near the Tindell’s property and they made these important
observations. Remember the Tindell’s? They are the people whose house Lucky’s
parents nested behind last year. They have become keen Whooper watchers, and
provide Florida biologist with important information. Importantly, most
landowners are being very use of their property whenever needed by Florida Fish
and Wildlife Conservation Commission biologists.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As of February 7, there are still only two pairs of Whooping
Cranes on eggs. However, several others have been observed nest building or
acting territorial. In addition to Lucky’s parents, it appears that a new
Whooper pair has &quot;tied the knot&quot; according to Biologist Kristi. A
group of 5 birds, 1 male and 4 females were observed in each other’s company.
They were all together for a while. Then, about a month ago the group was
narrowed down to 3. Two girls didn't make the cut. The male made his final
selection this week, Monday, January 20, when he was observed with just 1
female. So 915and 920 are the newest pair in the Florida non-migratory flock.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conditions have improved considerably for Florida’s
non-migratory Whooping Crane project during the past several months. Rains
returned after two dry years and water levels in wetlands are currently normal.
Optimism is high that these improved habitat conditions will help Whoopers have
a more successful nesting season. With improved habitats there will be more
suitable foods, enhanced protection from land predators such as bobcats and
better nesting sites.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, on February 5, 2003 six new young Whoopers arrived
from Patuxent’s bird breeding and rearing facility. All birds arrived in great
shape. Six other young Whoopers that arrived from the International Crane
Foundation’s facilities last month are also doing well and are remaining in
their release area. With all the recent activity six other Whooping Cranes that
have been around much longer (Lucky among them) are watching with interest.
These older cranes are visiting the release sites regularly.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lucky has begun to regularly associate with a 1996 hatch year
female. Together, they are trying to make connections with another group, but
are only tolerated at a distance.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned and we will keep posted. Things are getting very interesting.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UPDATE...The second group of juvenile Whooping Cranes that
completed their ultralight led migration in November from Wisconsin to Florida
continue their daily routine on the isolated salt marsh of the Chassahowitzka
National Wildlife Refuge according to Heather Ray, Operation Migration. At the
refuge they are under the watchful eyes of the International Crane Foundation
monitoring team composed of Richard Urbanek, Sara Zimorski, Colleen Satyshur and
Lara Fondow. Members of this team venture out to the large release site twice
each day to perform their monitoring duties. Each morning and early evening the
crane caretakers make the airboat ride to check and record water depths and
salinity levels; replenish the gravity feeders with crane chow, and ensure that
the water bubbler is working so that a supply of fresh water is available should
the salinity count be higher than the acceptable level of 21 parts per thousand
(ppt).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The monitoring team determines, each morning, the whereabouts
of the young birds. They check to determine if the Whoopers are still inside the
enclosure or have flown to some other location on the refuge. The birds can move
in and out of the pen on their own. Then, each evening before departing, the
monitoring team ensure that the cranes are inside the safety of the predator
proof pen. The young Whoopers seem to have settled into a routine that involves
early morning foraging excursions out of the enclosure and on a couple of
occasions they have moved to areas out of sight and were only detectable by the
beeps of their radio transmitters.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first group of Whooping Cranes that used the site last
year was reluctant to roost inside the enclosure on several nights due to
fluctuations in tide levels. As a result, two of these cranes were lost to
bobcats. To overcome any additional losses, caretakers would lead the cranes
back inside the pen before departing for the mainland. The addition of an oyster
shell roosting platform this year has reduced the need for the monitoring team
to retrieve the birds before departing. Now, the cranes are utilizing the new
roosting area inside the enclosure.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As each day passes the 16 juvenile Whooping Cranes grow
stronger and become better adjusted to their environment. Hopefully all the
cranes will survive and become a major part of the new migratory flock.</p>
<P ALIGN="center">__________________________________________________ </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On November 30, 2002 16 juvenile Whooping Cranes reach their new winter home at Chassahowtizka National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) on Florida’s west coast. The young Whoopers, led by ultralight aircraft, had departed Necedah NWR, Wisconsin on October 13 and reached Chassahowtizka NWR 49 days later. The birds actually flew only during 21 of the 49 days due to weather conditions unsuitable for flying in ultralights. The total distance traveled on this migration was 1,204 miles. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second generation of ultralight led Whoopers are now foraging in the newly enlarged release pen, constructed by the staff and many dedicated volunteers at the Chassahowitzka NWR. Over the winter they will be monitored by biologists with United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the International Crane Foundation as they learn the fine art of dining on Blue Crab and refine their skills necessary to become wild adult Whooping Cranes. Then, when nature calls the cranes should return to their Wisconsin habitat in the spring of 2003.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the second year of this project that young Whooping Cranes, reared in captivity, have been trained to follow ultralights and were led from Necedah NWR to Chassahowtizka NWR. Eight Whoopers, produced from captive breeding flocks, began the 2001 migration. One of these was killed when it flew into a power line and two were lost to bobcat predation on their wintering site. During the spring of 2002, the remaining five Whoopers successfully migrated back to Wisconsin where the spent the summer. Of the whooping cranes that were ultralight-led on migration last year (2001), four have independently returned to the winter site at Chassahowtizka. The fifth bird, whooping crane #6 was last reported in Meigs County, TN.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Whooping Crane Conservation Association congratulates the entire Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership team that manages this project. Their dedication, determination and countless hours of hard work have paid off. Although the migration was long for the migration team (and cranes), their work has been a huge success. The spring and fall migration of last year’s birds reconfirmed the value of the ultralight-led migration technique and North America now have a flock of 20 (soon to be 21) migratory whooping cranes in Florida. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=6><P ALIGN="CENTER">RECENT HISTORY OF WHOOPING CRANES IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first experimental effort to establish a second migratory population of Whooping Cranes began in 1975. Whooping Crane eggs from the wild and captivity were placed in nests of Sandhill Cranes in southeastern Idaho. The Sandhill Crane foster parents raised the Whooping Crane chicks and led them in migration to their wintering sites in New Mexico. Using this technique called "cross-fostering", from 1975 through 1988, 289 eggs were transferred and 85 chicks fledged. Unfortunately, the Whooping Cranes were improperly sexually imprinted on Sandhill Cranes, the foster parent species, and would not breed with one another. The Whooping Crane Recovery Team then began to search for another technique for use in establishing a migratory population. The last surviving wild cross-fostered Whooping Crane died in the spring of 2002. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William Lishman worked with Canada Geese in an effort to develop a technique that would be useful in establishing a migratory population of cranes. From 1993 to 1995 he was the first to lead captive-reared Canada Geese, with an ultralight aircraft, in migration from Ontario, Canada, to Virginia and South Carolina. These historic first flights with geese were successful and the geese returned unassisted to Ontario in their first spring seasons.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kent Clegg, a rancher, biologist, and pilot, had assisted on the cross-fostering project for many years. Drawing from that experience he proposed to lead captive-reared Sandhill Cranes in migration using an ultralight aircraft. The primary purpose of the research was to test the technique's suitability for establishing another migratory population of Whooping Cranes. He hoped the technique could be used to continue the reintroduction effort in the Rocky Mountains. In 1995 and 1996 he led the historic first migrations of Sandhill Cranes, 750 miles from Idaho to New Mexico, using an ultralight aircraft. The following year in 1997, Bill Lishman led Sandhill Cranes in migration, guiding them from Ontario to Virginia.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In subsequent springs the Sandhill Cranes trained by Kent Clegg migrated back to Idaho unassisted. Based on the initial success, in 1997 Mr. Clegg led Sandhill Cranes and 4 Whooping Cranes along the same migration route from Idaho to New Mexico. This was the historic first ultralight-led migration of an endangered species. The Whooping Cranes responded in the same way as Sandhill Cranes and the surviving birds returned to their natal area without human assistance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Whooping Crane Recovery Team then evaluated areas in North America where the ultralight technique could be used to establish another migratory population of Whooping Cranes. Eventually the choices were narrowed to three areas, the Rocky Mountains, and routes from Wisconsin to Florida or Wisconsin to Louisiana. The Wisconsin to Florida route was their final choice. A primary reason for not continuing the project in the Rocky Mountains was the opposition of the Game and Fish Commissions of Idaho and Wyoming to further releases of Whooping Cranes in their states. They felt the presence of Whooping Cranes would jeopardize their hunting seasons for Sandhill Cranes. The State Wildlife Agencies in the East were cooperative and supportive of the experimental introduction being held in their areas.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Whooping Crane Recovery Team was also concerned that mortality of Whooping Cranes had been high in the Rocky Mountains during the cross-fostering project. They hoped that Whooping Cranes would survive better in the Eastern site. Bill Lishman was selected to lead the migration training for Whooping Cranes in the East. Whooping Cranes were led from Wisconsin to Florida in the fall of 2001. That project is continuing and if successful in establishing a self-sustaining population it is hoped the Whooping Crane Recovery Team will select the Rocky Mountains for a future reintroduction effort.</P></FONT></BODY>
