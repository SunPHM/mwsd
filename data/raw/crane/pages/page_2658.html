      </b>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">September 15, 2002</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">It was perhaps
      fortuitous, a little serendipitous, and a tad bizarre that they should end
      up at the same table in Mabel's Rib Shack in downtown Minot, North
      Dakota.&nbsp; But, when Bill Johnson and Jim Marshall placed their order,
      the only two seats left in the Rib Shack were at a table next to a rather
      large man with a walrus mustache wearing a US Geological Survey cap.</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">After receiving
      permission to sit down, Jim asked, &quot;So, you study rocks?&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;No,&quot; replied
      Jack Coffee.&nbsp; &quot;I'm with the Biological Resources Discipline--BRD--a part
      of USGS.&nbsp; I study Sandhill cranes.&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Yer kiddin'!&quot;
      replied Bill.&nbsp; &quot;Me and Jim were just out huntin' this
      morning.&nbsp; Got us a nice Sandhill, too.&nbsp; Been out for 3
      days--those suckers are smart!&nbsp; Hard to kill, but fun to watch crash
      down to earth when you finally do get one...like a B52 bomber!&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">As the conversation
      continued, Bill and Jim discovered that Jack used radio telemetry to study
      the movements of Sandhill cranes during migration.&nbsp; He was following
      the cranes southward as they soared towards their wintering grounds.</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">Bill and Jim were from
      Fremont, Nebraska.&nbsp; Since Nebraska was the only state in the Central
      Flyway that did not allow harvest of cranes, Bill and Jim made an annual
      migration of their own to North Dakota to have first crack at the birds as
      they came south out of Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;You've got a rough
      assignment studying these birds in a remote place like Minot,&quot;
      commented Jim.&nbsp; &quot;I have a buddy that works at Valentine National
      Wildlife Refuge in Nebraska--he manages grasslands and is charge of their
      pronghorn herd.&nbsp; He doesn't put in the travel like you
      do.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Migratory species
      will do that to you,&quot; grinned Jack, still bemused at his luck at
      finding two crane hunters.&nbsp; Crane hunters were few and far between,
      and most people didn't even know you could hunt Sandhill cranes.&nbsp;
      &quot;But, it's an important task to monitor migratory species.&nbsp; They
      have some unique needs, and every step of their migration is important to
      their success.&quot;</font></p>
    <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">As they waited for their
    lunches, Bill noted that there seemed to be more Sandhill cranes than he
    remembered seeing during previous hunting seasons.&nbsp; Jack nodded, but
    added, &quot;Did you know that some Sandhill cranes are on the Endangered
    Species list?&quot;</font></p>
    <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">Bill and Jim's jaws
    dropped.&nbsp; &quot;I don't understand,&quot; interjected Jim.&nbsp;
    &quot;How can we hunt cranes if they're an endangered
    species?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Well, not all
    Sandhill cranes are endangered,&quot; Jack replied.&nbsp; &quot;But, one
    subspecies--the Mississippi Sandhill crane was one of the first animals to
    be listed after the ESA passed in 1973.&quot;</font></p>
    <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;How can a subspecies
    be on the list?&nbsp; That makes no sense!&quot; stated Bill.&nbsp;
    &quot;Our government has to be nuts--is the entire species is doing OK, then
    why list a 'subspecies'?&nbsp; I'll bet that was a Democrat that thought
    that one up...kind of like a pork barrel budget item--I'll bet some Democrat
    from Mississippi passed that bill to put a Sandhill crane on the endangered
    species list!&quot;</font></p>
    <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">It was one of those times
    that Jack decided not to go any further down that topic--he didn't know if
    Bill and Jim understood the distinction of 'subspecies, and he really didn't
    want to explain that animals weren't listed by senators.&nbsp; Luckily, the ribs arrived, which ended that conversation.&nbsp;
    But, as they began to hammer away at their juicy ribs, Bill and Jim began to prod Jack about the lack of a crane hunting season
      in Nebraska.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;I don't understand
      it for a moment,&quot; Bill stated.&nbsp; &quot;There are over 500,000 of
      the birds.&nbsp; How could a few ornery cusses like us put a dent in the
      population?&quot;</font></p>
		<p style="margin: 10"><font face="Arial">Jim jumped in with a comment.&nbsp; 
		&quot;Just yesterday,&quot; he said, &quot;I was talking to a local farmer who let us 
		hunt on his land.&nbsp; This farmer said he lost over half his wheat 
		crop to the cranes last year--sounds like the type of crop damage that 
		deer cause to corn fields in Nebraska!&nbsp; </font>
		<font size="3" face="Arial">You'd think folks would want to reduce the
      	crane population a little to avoid the crop damage they do each fall.&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Actually, you'd be
      surprised,&quot; replied Jack.&nbsp; &quot;Our harvest surveys show a fair
      proportion of the population is killed each year.&nbsp; You're
      right--harvest is seen as a management tool in places where crop damage is
      a concern.&nbsp; And, when a species can be <u> sustainably</u> harvested, we
      usually view that as an opportunity for hunters.&nbsp; But, biologists are
      actually concerned that harvest mortality may be additive to overall
      mortality in Sandhill cranes.&nbsp; In the past, most folks believed that
      harvest mortality was compensatory for this species, but recent habitat
      losses have been reducing reproductive efforts.&nbsp; It's not the same
      ballgame anymore.&nbsp; Some states are reporting a leveling off in the
      population.&nbsp; That's why I'm out here--to monitor the harvest and the
      migration.&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;Aren't some people
      afraid we're messing up the cranes' pair bond system,&quot; asked
      Jim.&nbsp; &quot;Is it true they mate for life?&nbsp; Still, we're
      harvesting them in the fall--I just don't think we can be having much of
      an impact.&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">Before Jack could reply,
      Bill jumped in.&nbsp; &quot;I've heard some people say they don't like the
      way we decoy the animals in as they pass over,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
      &quot;And I've also heard that the bow season for cranes in some states
      makes some animal rights people cringe.&nbsp; But, I'll tell you what, if
      a person can hit a crane with a bow and arrow, I think we ought to let 'em
      take all they want!&nbsp; I know I couldn't hit one of those skinny things
      with an arrow!&quot;</font></p>
      <p style="margin: 10"><font size="3" face="Arial">&quot;There are some
      ethical decisions that hunters and state agencies have to make,&quot;
      replied Jack.&nbsp; &quot;We don't allow baiting with food, and we don't
      allow recorded calls.&nbsp; So, why decoys?&nbsp; Well, where to draw that
      line is a question for another lunch!&nbsp; I've got to get back to
      radio-tracking my birds.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
