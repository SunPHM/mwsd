<H2>Rekindling Hope for the Coastal Prairie:<BR>Using Fire Against the Invasive Tallow Tree</H2>

  <P><A HREF="../images/prairie.jpg"><IMG SRC="../images/prairie.gif" alt="Prairie" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Wildfire 
    helped create the coastal prairie. Fire, intentionally set, is helping to 
    preserve its remnants from unwanted invasive species like the Chinese tallow 
    tree.</P>
     
<P>Jim Grace, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's 
     National Wetlands Research Center, is one of a handful of scientists 
     studying the coastal prairie that once stretched from Louisiana to 
     south central Texas, covering 9.4 million acres.</P>
     
<P>In little more than a century, the coastal prairie has largely 
     disappeared. In the late 1800s, the railroad made its way to the 
     coastal regions of Texas and Louisiana. People displaced the bison, 
     antelope and red wolves. Agriculture replaced native plants such as 
     grasses and colorful wildflowers.</P>
     
<P>"In Texas, 99 percent of the prairie is gone. In Louisiana, 99.99 
     percent has disappeared," said Grace, who works at the Center's 
     headquarters in Lafayette, La.</P>
     
<P>Before the area became settled, fire was a sustaining force on the 
     coastal prairie. Fires, set by lightning, fed on the grasses and kept 
     trees in check. The roots and bulbs of the native prairie plants were 
     unaffected by fire at the surface.</P>
     
  <P><A HREF="../images/tallow.jpg"><IMG SRC="../images/tallow8.gif" alt="Chinese Tallow tree being burned" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>"The 
    prairie is adapted to fire," Grace explained. Grace and some of his colleagues 
    were curious as to whether fire could be used to combat a modern threat to 
    the coastal prairie, the Chinese tallow tree.</P>
     
<P>The tallow tree, or chicken tree as it is also called, is believed 
     to have been introduced to North America in 1772 by Benjamin Franklin. 
     The species, which reproduces abundantly, was sought after for the 
     oils and waxes in its seeds and fruits.</P>
     
<P>Since the 1980s, tallow has become so prevalent that it has been 
     recognized as one of the exotic plants of greatest threat to native 
     habitat in the southern United States, according to Grace.  Tallow 
     resists both flooding and drought, and to some degree, fire. Since 
     1996, Grace and other researchers have conducted experiments at Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge near Houston, Texas, to determine whether "prescribed fire," an 
     intentional, controlled blaze, might be useful in regulating tallow. 
     Fire was considered as an alternative to controlling tallow trees with 
     chemicals.</P>
     
<P>"There were several reasons we were not optimistic," said Grace. 
     "Tallow does not burn easily. The trees require a high temperature to 
     burn and actually have an ability to suppress fire by shading out the 
     native grasses." Under ordinary conditions, "a fire will go up to a 
     stand of tallow, then simply go out," he said.</P>
     
  <P><A HREF="../images/tallow2.jpg"><IMG SRC="../images/tallow2.gif" alt="Former Chinese tallow forest that has been cleard by prescribed fire" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Beginning 
    in 1996, researchers conducted "controlled burns" of prairie land in Brazoria 
    during both the growing season and dormant season. At first, the results were 
    not encouraging. "The tallow quickly resprouted and did not appear to be heavily 
    damaged by the fire," Grace said.</P>
     
<P>But an examination of the trees at the end of the growing season in 
     1997 showed greater evidence of the fire's effects. "There was more 
     damage than we initially thought."</P>
     
<P>The researchers have conducted additional burns and are still 
     studying the impact and usefulness of fire in preserving what is left 
     of the coastal prairie. "We have some evidence that burns (conducted) 
     during the growing season are more effective than traditional 
     dormant-season burns," said Grace.</P>
     
<P>"The remaining prairie contains a lot of important biodiversity 
     that we don't want to lose, and we have already lost a lot of 
     biological information," Grace explained. Although bison, antelope and 
     wolves no longer roam the coastal prairie, Attwater's prairie chicken, 
     a federally endangered bird, makes its home there. The coastal prairie 
     also is the exclusive wintering ground of the federally endangered 
     whooping crane. And a number of rare and valuable plant species remain 
     there.</P>
     
  <P><A HREF="../images/tallow3.jpg"><IMG SRC="../images/tallow3.gif" alt="Tallow forest that has been pushed back by fire" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT></A>Grace 
    said researchers are "more optimistic that we may be able to use fire to help 
    protect and restore the coastal prairie. It appears that fire will hold the 
    tallow at bay. It won't completely eradicate it, but we now know that we have 
    some tools to work with."</P>
     
<P>As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and 
     civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 
     2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial 
     scientific information to resource managers, planners and other 
     customers.  This information is gathered in every state by USGS 
     scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural 
     disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound economic 
     and physical development of the nation's natural resources and to 
     enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy 
     and mineral resources.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT></P>
