        <p><font color="#000040" size="2" face="Arial">While we
        were waiting for our new home to be built, we stayed in a
        cosy, one bedroom cottage, about a mile north of town.
        Cosy it might be, but we could not wait to enjoy the
        spacious living areas of our new home. One advantage
        though was that we got plenty of exercise walking to and
        from town. It is always a great experience because you
        stop and talk to so many people on the way</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000040" size="2" face="Arial"><img

        border="1" width="360" height="288"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000040" size="2" face="Arial">By the end
        of May the hardest part of the construction was over.
        Because the house is built on pine posts, there has been
        a lot of energy expended moving dirt, digging holes and
        carrying the posts. No cranes or excavators here - just
        pure muscle and ingenuity! </font></p>

        height="273"></p>
        <p><font color="#000040" size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps
        the hardest and most delicate operation so far has been
        the manoeuvering and placement of the post that holds up
        the roof of the main house. At 10.2 metres long, 250mm
        wide at the top and 500mm wide at the bottom, it is the
        'mother' of all the posts. To get it to its final resting
        place in a hole 2.2metres deep by 1 metre square (dug by
        hand) was at times frightening, funny, something to be
        marvelled at and a tribute to the dedication, good humour
        and teamwork of our builders. Thanks, guys!</font></p>

        <p>In the middle of June we completed the roof on three
        of the guest bedrooms. As we did with the placing of the
        first post, we enjoyed a small Fijian ceremony by one of
        the local Talatalas (Minister) followed by a few bowls of
        kava.</p>

        <p>The main house was well under way in August and by the
        end of September, the major construction was completed -
        just waiting for plumbing and electrical work to be
        finished.</p>

        <p>By mid-October and painting was well under way. All
        the little finishing touches were happening and we were
        growing more impatient every day as we saw our dream
        coming to reality. In December we were looking forward to
        welcoming our first guests.</p>
