Plan Provides Safety, Better Viewing.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Safer and better areas for viewing sandhill cranes
in the spring have been developed as Phase I of the Central Platte Historic,
Scenic &amp; Trails Project. The multi-year project will promote awareness of
the historic importance of the Central Platte Valley as a transportation
corridor dating from the 1800s as well as an important part of the migratory
path of waterfowl.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><img border="0" src="cranev_gib.jpg" align="left" width="217" height="130">Safety
also is a primary purpose of the project, since the migration of sandhill
cranes, ducks and geese each year attract thousands of tourists and local people
to the river and feeding areas.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">A top priority was given to getting people off
roads and bridges during the crane viewing season for their safety and for the
safety of those using the roads and bridges. Viewing decks were constructed at
the Gibbon and Alda bridges to give the crane watchers a better and safer
opportunity to see the cranes. All-weather parking areas were built near the
decks to reduce dangerous traffic congestion.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Three roadside turnout areas between Doniphan and
Shelton on the road along the south side of the Platte are also being developed
in Phase I.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">A portion of the cost is being paid under the
federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). The remaining
cost was contributed by Central Platte NRD and participating counties (Hall and
Buffalo). The Audubon Society provided land for a roadside turnout near Shelton.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The project is part of a comprehensive plan
developed by a task force of various governmental and private agency
representatives. Central Platte NRD brought the various interests together to
discuss the safety issues, and the task force looked at the broad scope of
needs, including ways to enhance tourism and recreation opportunities.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">As a result, the task force’s comprehensive plan
includes parking areas, access to the river for canoeists, scenic roads, bridges
and turnouts, historic trail designations and proposed recreational trails. The
task force will continue to study the needs and to seek funding to implement
additional phases.</font></p>
<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Historic features will highlight the Platte River
routes taken in the early 1800s by explorers such as Stephen H. Long and John
Charles Fremont and by fur traders who passed back and forth on and along the
Platte River. These routes became the major transcontinental trails of the
covered wagon migration and became known as &quot;The Great Platte River
Road.&quot; The Union Pacific Railroad and Interstate 80 use the Platte corridor
today as major links between the East and West coasts.<a href="new_page_4.htm"><br>
