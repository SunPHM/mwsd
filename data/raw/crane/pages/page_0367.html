<P><B>In March, 2003, at the insistence (really!) of my wife,
I joined a Rail Study Tours group to see the last of the regular
service mainline steam operations in the world--in China. My friend
and fireman at MidContinent, Stan Searing, joined me and twelve
others for two weeks of railfanning devoted to steam locomotives.</B></P>

WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="130" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="1"></B></A><B>The
trip started in Beijing with some added time to visit a few of
the famouns sites there; Tiananmen Square and the Mutanyu section
of the Great Wall north of the city. In fact, there are actually
five Great Walls in addition to walls that existed around cities
throughout China. The Square was bustling with people, perhaps
more than usual because the People's Congress was in its last
day of the session. In addition to the street vendors, natives
would ask us if they could take pictures of themselves with us.
Guess westerners are still an oddity there. The Great Wall had
been restored in this section and was quite a sight to see and

upon.</B></P>

<P><B>The first railroading activity was a trip to the newly-opened
railway museum in Beijing. A big hall held 6 tracks with a variety
of steam and diesel era equipment, with enough space and light
that you could actually photograph it. Included was a 2-8-0 built
by Baldwin and a 4-8-4 built by Vulcan of England. Of note on
the engine cabs were what appeared to be mail bag catchers. In
fact, they were for the block system in use on the railroad where
authority to occupy a block was given by a catching a baton at
the entry point and dropping it off at the exit point. Click to
see more of the <A HREF="chinamuseum.html">Beijing Railway Museum</A>.</B></P>

<P><B>Our first live steam locomotive was <A HREF="china%20graphics/dahuichang1.jpg">engine
#1</A> at the Dahuichang Limestone Railway. This is a narrow gauge
railroad operated by <A HREF="china%20graphics/dahuichang3.jpg">0-8-0
locomotives</A> on 30&quot; gauge track. The little engines run
from a loader inside of a tunnel in the mountain back to the crushing
plant. Small 4-wheel cars are brought to the unloader, where the
<A HREF="china%20graphics/dahuichang2.jpg">engine cuts off and
executes a flying switch</A> to escape the cars. Crewmen place
small steel rods in one wheel of several cars so that the wheel
locks up and brakes the cars to a stop on the slight downgrade.
One by one, the link and pin couplers are disconnected, the rod
removed and the car rolls slowly toward a rotary dumper. The loaded
car kicks the empty off the loader and is locked in place. The
barrel unloader then rotates until the rock is emptied. The empty
cars then roll out the back of the unloader and are captured by
another worker, who couples them one-by-one into another string
that will eventually be rolled down onto a tail track to be picked
up by the locomotive and taken back to the loader.</B></P>

<P><B>Once the locomotive is cut off from the loaded cars, it
immediately heads for the tail track to pick up empties and heads
back to the loader at the other end of the line. The line is mostly
upgrade and <A HREF="china%20graphics/dahuichang4.jpg">the little
engines work pretty well up the hill</A>, bouncing and hunting
side-to-side on the undulating track. Two trains work the line
simultaneously, meeting at the loading facility. This is a fascinating
line and great to fan as you can easily walk from the unloader
to the loader and find all kinds of interesting vantage points
along the way.</B></P>

<P><B>We then took China Rail train #2559, the overnight train
to Chifeng and points north. We had soft-class sleeping compartments,
meaning a closed compartment with four berths. Being the smallest,
Stan and I opted for the uppers, an interesting feat of entry
without ladders. It had been a long time since I had ridden a
sleeper on a train and considering the Chinese music piped in
right over my head, the excess heat in the coal-heated car, and
the strange bedding provided, it was a restless night, but interesting.
We left the train at Chifeng and after breakfast, headed out for
more steam on the coal railroad at Yuanbaoshan. But first, we
witnessed such a unique machine, we had to stop and get a photo:
<A HREF="china%20graphics/yuanbaoshan%20street%20sweeper.jpg">the
Yuanbaoshan street sweeper</A>.</B></P>

<P><B>The railroad brings coal from several mines south to a power
plant at Yuanbaoshan. As we arrived, <A HREF="china%20graphics/js8218%20yuanbaoshan.jpg">two
JS class 2-8-2s</A> were switching gondolas in the yard. The power
plant's diesel then came down to leave empties and pick up loads
for the plant. We then went down to the shop area to find <A 
HREF="china%20graphics/js6246%20yuanbaoshan.jpg">JS 6246 steaming
quietly</A> outside while 8246 was having some work done on it
in the shop. Not wanting to delay any longer, Stan and I talked
our way up into the cab of 6246 for a look around. My poor Mandarin
didn't help with communication with the fireman but we stuck around
long enough for the engineer to join us, then after starting the
injector, he just headed us off down the track. It wasn't a long
ride, <A HREF="china%20graphics/js8250%20%26%206246%20yuanbaoshan.jpg">just
down by the coaling facility</A>, but it was our first Chinese
cab ride.</B></P>

<P><B>We hung around a while longer, watching the mixed train
arrive and shuttle around the yard. Then we watched the gantry
crane fueling #8250. Then it was off to lunch and the open pit
mine Pingzhuang.</B></P>

<P><B>We arrived at the mine Pingzhuang in mid-afternoon with
the overcast becoming heavier. We caught sight of a steam locomotive
as we crossed the tracks entering town but were unable to find
a way to get closer. We caught a couple of the steeple cab electrics
shuttling cars up and down in the open pit. <A HREF="china%20graphics/pingzhuang%20mine.jpg">It
is amazing how big this pit is</A> and how much trackage there
is. Down in pit, in two different locations, there were steam
locomotives on steam shovel duty, acting as the power to move
the shovels as needed. The videocam brought them close but not
close enough to get any engine numbers. A steam locomotive went
by in the distance on the above-pit track pushing a spreader but
otherwise, steam was hard to spot. We did go looking for the engine
shop and after a lot of wrong turns and asking directions, we
were able to locate it at the far end of some industrial buildings
that were being demolished.</B></P>

<P><B>We walked through the shop finding SY 2-8-2 engines 0463,
0271, 6245 and <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy0766%20%26%201025%20pingzhuang.jpg">1025
cold and 0766 hot</A> in the shop. <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1083%20pingzhuang.jpg">#1083
was outside</A> having some <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1083-3%20pingzhuang.jpg">work
done on either the engine brakes or the valve motion</A>, it was
hard to tell. At one point, the engineer <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1083-2%20pingzhuang.jpg">hauled
out the throttle</A> so the drivers spun wildly, sending a great
exhaust plume into the air.</B></P>

<P><B>We stayed at the Post Hotel in Reshui, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region with the loops of the Ji Tong Railway outside our window.
We could hear the QJ class 2-10-2s going up and down the mountain
all night long. An early start the next morning began the seemingly
endless parade of steam trains on the Jing Peng pass line. Most
freights were doubleheaded; only a handful were single engine
trains.</B></P>

<P><B>The next day was cloudy but we started with a westbound
freight with QJs 6986 and 6230 climbing the hill behind the hotel.
<A HREF="china%20graphics/qj%206986%20%266230%20simingyi%20bridge%2001.jpg">We
then chased it</A> to Jing Peng, stopping along the way for photos.
After watching them <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6230%20taking%20water%20at%20jing%20peng.jpg">take
water </A>and the fires being cleaned at Jing Peng,</B><A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6986%20%26%206230%20at%20jing%20peng.jpg">
<B>we waited for a meet</B></A><B> with an eastbound, we headed
back down the hill to Shang Dian. We caught what appeared to be
#6517 doubleheading eastbound at Hahashan, I believe.</B></P>

<P><B>As we arrived in Shang Dian, the wind was stronger, the
clouds darker. A <A HREF="china%20graphics/caboose%20at%20shang%20dian.jpg">Westbound
freight rolled into the siding</A> behind singleheaded 7143 as
it began to snow. The wind was so cold that we were waiting in
the entrance to the station. A young woman came out of what looked
like the office and offered me one of those furry hats with a
railway badge on it. I had just bought the same style badge from
someone else and her price seemed too high. We dickered back and
forth but after thinking about the prospect of freezing in my
baseball-style cap and another in our party offering to buy the
badge I had, <A HREF="china%20graphics/Shang%20Dian%20hat%20lady.jpg">I
closed the deal with her</A>. I was exceedingly glad I did for
the next four days. The headings on the board behind us read:
&quot;Start Spring Career Inspection, Guaranteed Safe Production.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>With the westbound on south passing track, I waited for
the eastbound. It wasn't a long wait as <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6630%20arr%20shian%20dian%20semaphore.jpg">#6630
came rolling in</A> under those beautiful lower-quadrant semaphores.
These would be the only daylight trains we would see with headlights
on. (In the US, steam locomotives typically did not run with their
headlights on during good daylight weather. With the advent of
the diesel, headlights in daylight became the norm.)</B></P>

<P><B>Before 7143 could leave, it had to wait for <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6356%20in%20snow%20shangdian.jpg">two
light engines</A> heading east as the snow got worse. Though we
still did a little chasing after that, the snow was beginning
to accumulate so we called it an early day.</B></P>

<P><B>Friday morning was clear and bright with a fresh blanket
of snow. We were off! Again, we did some great chasing, lots of
meets and time to get to special vantage points. Back and forth
between Reshui and Jing Peng we shuttled. I shot video the whole
day but as the sun was getting low in the afternoon sky, <A HREF="china%20graphics/light%20engines%20simingyi.jpg">two
light engines</A> headed east over the Simingyi bridge before
we called it a day. Then we all had to pose with the <A HREF="china%20graphics/mafia%20sign.jpg">Simayi
Bridge District sign</A>.</B></P>

<P><B>Saturday morning was the time Stan and I waited for. We
headed for Linxi, east of Reshui. We wanted a long ride up to
the Pass and we made it just in time to grab a 32 car doubleheaded
westbound freight behind #7007. The crew was very friendly and
we settled down inside, me sharing the fireman's seat with <A
HREF="china%20graphics/meng%20quing%20long.jpg">Meng Qing Long,</A>
the man I called the Little Fireman and Stan riding the jump seat
directly behind. On these engines, the engineer is on the left
and the fireman is on the right, just the opposite of US practice.
Our engineer was Xia Qing He and the man I call the Big Fireman
was <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7007%20big%20fireman1.jpg">Yuan
Yong Sheng</A>.</B></P>

<P><B>It was relatively easy going on level track out of Linxi.
Stan and I had brought photos of us working at MidContinent to
show the crews we were familiar with steam.</B> <B>Somewhere near
Yuzhoudi, I believe, the engineer beckoned me to his seat so I
could sit there while the rest of our group, who were chasing
us with the bus, took photos of our train. I sat quietly, looking
out the window, occasionally putting my hand on the throttle so
the photos would look like I was actually doing something. At
one point, the engineer was over on the other side of the cab
with Stan and the firemen when all of a sudden, the drivers began
to slip. Without even thinking, <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7007%20eng%20ken.jpg">I
reached up and grabbed the overhead throttle</A> and shut it,
waited a few seconds, then opened her back up.</B></P>

<P><B>I didn't see it but Stan swears that when the crew heard
the drivers slip, they all looked at me. When they saw me shut
the throttle and work it, they stood there stunned for a few seconds,
then smiled and gave a thumbs up sign. From that point almost
to the tunnel above the hotel in Reshui, I was actually running
the train by myself. They just let me go. What a thrill!</B></P>

<P><A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7007%20stan%20eng.jpg"><B>Stan
took over</B></A><B> as we drifted across the SiMayi Viaduct,
an almost complete circle of track, mostly on the viaduct. He
did all right keeping the train speed in check. We pulled in for
a meet at Xiakengzi and the engineer called me back over to try
some downhill running. We pulled out of the siding and drifted
toward to Jing Peng. The brake system on these engines is the
same 6-ET system we use at MidContinent so I was right at home.
The handle moved very stiffly but otherwise seemed to work ok.
I had brought with me a conversion table to convert the US pounds
per square inch (psi) to Chinese pressure measurements in kilopascals
(kPa) so I could understand what the pressure gauges were reading.
However, I just ran it by feel and worked the brakes just like
I do at North Freedom. We cycled between 45kph and 35kph. I suppose
if I had more time to play with it, I could have taken less air
and tried to get it to stay at one speed for a longer time. Oh,
well, there's always next time.</B></P>

<P><B>Roughly three hours from leaving Linxi, we rolled to a stop
at Jing Peng. We thanked our crew with Union Pacific hats (because
of their red, white and blue design) and pins. Early on, the Little
Fireman admired Stan's gloves so Stan now had a pair of Ji Tong
Railway gloves while the Little Fireman had Stan's. Going thru
one of the tunnels, the Llittle Ffireman caught a cinder in his
eye. I gave him the plastic safety glasses I brought and he thought
they were cool. I gave him the glasses at the end and gave the
Big Fireman my gauntlets. <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7007Stan%20group.jpg">We
all gathered around 7007's pilot</A> for a group shot and vowed
it didn't get any better than this.</B></P>

<P><B>We did a little more chasing the rest of the day, then on
Sunday, we left for Daban, Chabuga and Tongliao. Sunday was quiet
in <A HREF="china%20graphics/dabangate.jpg">Daban</A>, just a
few locos and crew around. The <A HREF="china%20graphics/dabancrane.jpg">steam
cranes</A> were working, moving ashes and coal around the engine
terminal. Coal was also being unloaded by workers (mostly women)
shovelling out the side-door gondolas. We chased a few trains
to Chabuga, one reminiscent of the <A HREF="china%20graphics/ebfreightwyoming.jpg">Union
Pacific in Wyoming</A>, and including catching the afternoon <A
HREF="china%20graphics/wbpassenger%20chabuga.jpg">westbound passenger</A>
train just east of Chabuga.</B></P>

<P><B>The <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6638-2%20chabuga.jpg">next
day we spent</A> catching trains <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6638-3%20chabuga.jpg">in
and around Chabuga</A>. No one bothered us all day long and we
had the run of the place. Still had some doubleheaders but the
flat terrain meant more single engine consists. This was also
an engine change for some trains, including the passenger trains.
We saw a highly decorated engine <A HREF="china%20graphics/chabuga%20depot%20passenger%20engine.jpg"><IMG 
SRC="china%20graphics/chabuga%20depot%20passenger%20engine.jpg"
WIDTH="188" HEIGHT="126" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A>cut
off the morning <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6358ebpassenger%20chabuga.jpg">eastbound
passenger train</A> and be replaced by <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6358ebpassenger%20chabuga2.jpg">a
more humble #6358</A>. We actually got to see some freight switching
and some real industrial sidings with cars being unloaded. There
was a small engine terminal with just a <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7105%206576%20chabuga%20depot.jpg">few
engines there</A>. We did witness a special event we know they
planned for us. At the depot, the <A HREF="china%20graphics/chabuga%20crane%20z151.jpg">steam
crane Z151</A> was working the ash pit until it came over onto
one of the service tracks and stopped across from one of the locomotives.
The crane dropped its bucket and we were trying to figure out
what the crowd was doing there. Everyone then backed off and the
crane proceeded to lift the main rod off the ground and up onto
the back of another engine. We surmise that it was easier to move
the locomotive over to the shop and have the shop gantry crane
put the rod down where it could be worked on--a nice impromptu
exhibition for us. We assume the rod was going into the shop for
some work. Another interesting site reminded me of stories my
mother told of picking coal during the Depression. Here, the <A
HREF="china%20graphics/chabuga%20coal%20pickers.jpg">coal pickers</A>
were everywhere, including under the cabs of stopped engines where
by picked coal that fell thru the deck.</B></P>

<P><B>Due to the SARS problem, we had changed our plans to go
south and instead headed east to Tongliao on our bus and then
China Rail from Tongliao thru Beijing and on to Xuan Hua, site
of a steel mill railroad. We did chase along the way and stopped
at Kai Lu to catch both passenger trains. A <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj6825%20kai%20lu.jpg">freight
train</A> was already there, switching covered hoppers at a large
elevator near the station. While waiting for the eastbound train
to arrive, we watched a maintenance of way crew working on the
west end and I was surprised at the facilities at the west end
of the station siding. Here was a <A HREF="china%20graphics/kai%20lu%20pit.jpg">water
column (no surprise) but also an ash pit</A>!</B></P>

<P><B>The <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7105-1%20eb%20pass%20arr%20kai%20lu.jpg">eastbound
passenger train </A>with <A HREF="china%20graphics/qj7105-2%20eb%20pass%20arr%20kai%20lu.jpg">#7105</A>
came first and the <A HREF="china%20graphics/kai%20lu%20eb%20pass%20vendor.jpg">vendors
were out </A>providing light refreshments. The platform was busy
with <A HREF="china%20graphics/kai%20lu%20eb%20pass%20platform.jpg">lots
of people coming and going</A>. The engine crew was doing their
<A HREF="china%20graphics/kai%20lu%20eb%20pass%20inspection.jpg">inspection
and oiling </A>around before departure.</B></P>

<P><B>We had an hour before the westbound showed up so we headed
for the <A HREF="china%20graphics/kai%20lu%20lunch3.jpg">little
restaurant near the station</A>. It was one of the <A HREF="china%20graphics/kai%20lu%20lunch1.jpg">best
meals</A> we had anywhere, especially the local ginger beer. I
highly recommend both the action and the food at this spot.</B></P>

lunch, the westbound passenger arrived with engine 7163 as 6825
waited in the siding with the freight. The crew was taking it
easy during the lull in the action but was up and gone as soon
as the passenger train and the signals cleared.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Because of the SARS problem, we elected to remain up north
instead of traveling to Hechi. Our train from Tongliao found us
aboard a <A HREF="china%20graphics/sleeper.jpg">soft class sleeper</A>
for the trip through Beijing and westward to the steel mill town
of Xuan Hua. Here, the Director of Transportation gave us a short
tour of the mill and the locomotive shop. An SY class engine was
undergoing heavy repairs. <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhua%20shop.jpg">All
the tubes and flues</A> were out, <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhua%20rods.jpg">the
rods</A> were all machined and <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhuadrivers.jpg">all
the drivers</A> and engine truck wheels had just been turned to
a gleaming contour and workers were swarming around the boiler.
The <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhua%20shopcrew.jpg">shop crew</A>,
who does this kind of maintenance every 18 months on their locomotives,
posed for a picture. Our group then posed outside with <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhuagroupsmall.jpg">engine
0250</A>. Class <A HREF="china%20graphics/yj0269xuanhua.jpg">YJ
2-6-2 #0269</A> sat on the turntable lead, looking very derelict.</B></P>

<P><B>The <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhua%20mgmt.jpg">Director</A>
(in red hat between shop formen) then took us to a busy grade
crossing inside the plant. Here, we watched <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1528-01xuanhua.jpg">SY
1528</A> switch <A HREF="china%20graphics/xuanhua%20ladles.jpg">hot
metal ladles</A> out of the furnace building and take them to
another part of the plant for pouring. <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1177%20xuanhua.jpg">SY
#1177,</A> with two front headlights, sat nearby waiting for an
assignment. After watching the action here, we moved to a public
grade crossing at the head of an interchange yard. This is where
China Rail connects, although we did not see any of their equipment.
<A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1219xuanhua.jpg">Engines shuttled
back and forth</A> picking up hoppers of raw material or <A HREF="china%20graphics/orecarcut%20xuanhua.jpg">dropping
off empties</A>. <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy0782-01xuanhua.jpg">Engine
0782</A> was the most decorated engine we saw. In addition to
the front plaques, the fireman's side also had two large brass
plaques. The front letter around the smokebox translates roughly:
(on the left side-&quot;Long Journey on the Road;&quot; on the
right side-&quot;Best Way Face First&quot;; and on the bottom-&quot;Young
Age.&quot;</B></P>

<P><B>On the way back to the hotel, we stopped at a grade crossing
to catch several <A HREF="xuanhua.html">China Rail freights</A>
roaring thru behind electric locomotives.</B></P>

<P><B>The next day was our <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1528-02xuanhua.jpg">last
with steam</A> and we hit the <A HREF="china%20graphics/sy1121xuanhua.jpg">interchange
yard</A> one more time. 1522 was the last steam locomotive we
saw up close. That night it was back on the train to Beijing,
where SY 1177 gave us our last glimpse of steam in China. On this
trip, we occupied several hard class sleeper compartments. Glad
we only sat as that third bunk was maybe 18&quot; from the ceiling.</B></P>

<P><B>Our last full day in China we spent riding the new light
rail system and shopping. Everyone was tired and I think ready
to head home. The souvenirs were carefully packed and everyone
arrived home safe and sound. Now to plan for the next trip!</B></P>
