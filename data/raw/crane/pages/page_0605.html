        Lewis' Black Belt presentation</strong></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">A great celebration was held on 3rd April 2004 in the Fudoshin 
        Honbu in Frankston.</p>
      <p align="center">Richard was presented with his colour: Navy Blue and his 
        animal: the Crane<strong><img src="../images/crane_clan.jpg" alt="The Crane" width="128" height="128" align="middle"></strong></p>
      <p align="left">The evening's MC was the fabulous Mark Wilson who kept the 
        activities running smoothly. Mark also helped with the organisation of 
        the night. His play pal Marty also provided much assistance in bringing 
        the whole night together.</p>
      <p align="left">A hearty spit roast meal, with salads and a number of yummy 
        homemade deserts kept us going all night.</p>
      <p align="left">The highlight was Soke offering Richard's son Tristan the 
        opportunity to present the black to his dad. </p>
      <p align="left">For many though the highlights would be the demonstrations 
        performed to celebrate a new Yudansha in the ranks.</p>
      <p align="left">Three of the youngest members of Fudoshin Connor, Kieran 
        and Dominic performed a demonstration including aspects from a number 
        of early grades.</p>
      <p align="left">Sempai Josh and ???? performed a composite demonstration 
        of techniques including real attacks with a live knife. (we know it really 
        was sharp!)</p>
      <p align="left">Sensei Richard performed one of his favourite katas, the 
        Fudoshin Battle Kata with the katana. For him it was an honour to perform 
        in front of so many friends and family.</p>
      <p align="left">Sempai Graeme and one of his students from the Tuncurry 
        Bamboo Warrior Dojo in NSW performed an interesting demonstration which 
        was a personal favourite of Soke. Sempai Graeme began as an instructor 
        studying a book who is approached by an eager student . The instructor 
        demonstrates progressively more difficult techniques which the student 
        easily manages to accomplish. EAch time the instructor hopes to return 
        to contemplation of his book the student returns for more instruction. 
        Many techniques use the book as part of the defense and counter attack. 
        Finally the instructor finishes with a technique that locks the student 
        on the ground enabling the instructor to hold him in place while he provides 
        a comfortable seat from which to contemplate the book. The book used so 
        effectively in the demonstration was then presented to Sensei Richard.</p>
      <p align="left">Finally Senseis Darren and Daniel treated us to high flying 
        and spirited demonstration of a number of techniques which also contained 
        advanced principles of Fudoshin.</p>
      <p align="left">A competition was held for guessing the animal and colour 
        that would be presented to Richard. There were many guesses from the monkey 
        and cat families and a large range of colours with a few more purples 
        and blues. While no one guessed the Crane two people guessed the colour.</p>
