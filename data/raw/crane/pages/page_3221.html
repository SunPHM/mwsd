      <p class="style2">On the 9 March, two senior students, Georgina (Year 13) and Rena (Year 12), competed in the Race Unity Speech competition with distinguished success. </p>
      <p class="style2">Run by the Hedi Moani Charitable Trust and New Zealand Baha'i community, the competition involved delivering a speech of approximately seven to eight minutes on the topic “ <em>The earth is one country and mankind it's citizens </em>”. The speech was to consider how this idea applies to New Zealand with focus on “ <em>thinking globally and acting locally </em>“ as well as stereotypical ways in which some cultures are regarded and how these damaging views can be combated by young people. </p>
      <p class="style2">The competition was held over two evenings. Both Georgina and Rena spoke on the second night with Georgina winning first place closely followed by Rena who was runner up. </p>
      <p class="style2">Georgina's speech emphasised how our differences should be used for the common good, not division; that New Zealand can act as a world leader by improving it's race relations; how education is important to combat fears of other cultures and how we should encourage each other to be proud of our heritage. </p>
      <p class="style2">Rena spoke eloquently and convincingly by delivering her speech entirely in Te Reo Maori which was a first time occurrence in the contest's five year history. </p>
    <p class="style2">As the winner of her heat, Georgina will be travelling to Auckland in April to compete in the national semi-finals. We wish her all the best! </p>    </td>

Two days before the Wellington International Sevens Tournament in February the school received a visit from members of the South African Sevens team. Members of the school's touch and rugby teams spent the morning getting to know four members of the team. They then introduced themselves and the players to students at PioPio College, Te Kuiti High School, Taumaranui High and Raglan High via a video link set up by Telecom Schoolzone.

of enthusiastic and talented students at the regional biannual Catholic Colleges 
Polynesian Festival this year. A team of dedicated Year 13 leaders organised the 
three groups who represented the school with pride and passion. The opening powhiri 
and karakia made an impact on the audience as candles were used while singing 
E Te Ariki; uniting representatives from Kapa Haka, Tokelauan and Samoan groups 
of our school. This year the Tokelauan group added volume and rhythm with the 
backing of Saint Bernard's students playing the pokihi drums. The sa sa movement 
used in the closing item was a challenge for the Samoan group as timing and co-ordination 
is vital. </font> <p><br> </p><table border="0" width="99%" vspace="0" hspace="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" height="165">

a safe haven where you reflect on the people, events and actions that shape your 
daily life. The school chapel is such a place. It is a place of worship and reflection 
that forms the very core of the college. The recent up grade of this sacred space

for all to share and enjoy.</font></p><p><font size="-1">Over a two year period 
project manager Graeme Ferguson worked with many people such as an architect, 
an interior designer, an electrician, glaziers, painters and carpet layers to 
help complete it. Mr Ferguson literally did the behind the scenes work, his first 
task was to put framing and panels over the existing bricks. The original amber 
glass was replaced with white opaque glass. The feature of the chapel, the stained 
glass windows were designed by Motu Samaeli, HOD of Graphics and Design and Art. 
Through geometric designs and vibrant blues and greens, reference has been made 
to the order of the Misson Sisters and their journey to New Zealand. Of special 
significance are the altar dressings carved with wood from the old Tulip tree 
cut down in 2001.</font></p><p><font size="-1">The chapel now has clean lines, 
modern d&eacute;cor and excellent acoustics. The significance of this project 
not only lies in the finished product but also the community effort and planning 
involving such a diverse range of talents and expertise. Many thanks must go to 
everyone who contributed in some way, in particular the financial assistance from 
the school Board of Trustees, the Lower Hutt Mission College Trust Board and donations 
from various parties such as the Past Pupils' Association.</font><br> </p></td></tr>
