Science and History Museum which is located across the jetty from
the USS Lexington, near the State route 181 bridge. A spacious
fountain display fronts the building. </strong></font><img

hspace="10" width="197" height="148"><font size="4"><strong> Just
after we walked in, a gentleman overhearing Laura's comments
about an impressive collection of stones in a wall display,
walked up and asked her if she was interested in stones. When she
replied yes, he led her away to another room where he showed her
an enormous split crystal geode on display in a stand. </strong></font><img

hspace="10" width="126" height="223"><font size="4"><strong> We
spent the rest of the afternoon being informed and entertained by
this delightfully informed individual, who demonstrated a zest
for the museum which I found marvelous. Having taken his picture,
I had forgotten to get his name, and so I asked the receptionist
who he was, showing the picture I had taken. There was a flutter
of conversation among the workers, who seemed to be looking
around for our now vanished guide. Finally the receptionist
smiled and said. &quot;He is Donald Luriz&quot;, the museum's
curator. He had never let on that his zest for the museum came
from the fact that he had created the exhibits himself. Of the
many exhibits in the science area was a mounted speculum of the
all elusive celebrated guest of the Port Aransas area. The
Whooping Crane, who each winter flies the thousands of miles from
northern Canada to Port Aransas. </strong></font><img

hspace="10" width="197" height="148"><font size="4"><strong> With
the actual habitat on an outer uninhabited island, it is most
difficult to view them. I was glad to find this one for and up
close look. The other exhibit was a complete life cycle of the
Lightning Whelk. A sea snail that can grow to fairly large
proportions from a near microscopic start inside an egg sack. The
Lightning Whelk is the state shell of Texas and as such is a
prized possession of the local population. </strong></font><img

hspace="10" width="246" height="186"><font size="4"><strong> The
science side of the museum has displays on many of the industries
that came up through the ages in America. Oil, photography, and
many others. I found one particular display on the history of the
clothing iron, so interesting I called Laura over so that she
could familiarize herself with its history and proper use, as it
had been many decades since she had used one, and then only used
as a door stop. <br>
