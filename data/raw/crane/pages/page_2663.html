    overwhelming at first. I think especially with the sounds that they make. 
    I mean, when the large numbers of them take off in the morning, the sound 
    is just sort of all encompassing, you know, just completely surrounds you.&quot; 
    <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">&quot;I think I have met people all around the country who 
    are fanatical about cranes. I don't know what it is about this bird besides 
    the fact that they're just fun to watch, that makes people so dang interested 
    in them.&quot; <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">What you're going to see here today in simplest terms is the 
    largest concentration of sandhill cranes in the world in this stretch of the 
    Platte River. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">On an exceptionally warm evening in early March, Paul Tebbel 
    of the<a href="http://www.rowesanctuary.org/" target="_blank"> Audubon Society's 
    Rowe Sanctuary</a> explains what this group of crane watchers will see. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">So what they're going to do is come over to the river and 
    roost here all night and leave. So it's the concentration of these cranes 
    coming to the river that brings people to the Platte to see this whole thing. 
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Phil Cafaro and Kris Bronars have heard this before. This 
    would be their fourth trip to the blind in two days. They came from Fort Collins, 
    Colorado. They had read about the crane migration and some friends told them 
    they should go. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Kris</B>] &quot;We did get specific encouragement from 
    people who made the trip themselves.&quot; <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2"><IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" 
ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Phil</B>] &quot;People 
    in Nebraska might not realize that the cranes here are world famous. People 
    all around the country and beyond know about them. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">&quot;We actually had them landing in the river and coming 
    over in large bunches about this time yesterday. It's about ready to get going.&quot; 
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">At the Rowe Sanctuary near Kearney, you can watch the cranes 
    from blinds right on the Platte River. In the evening they fly in from surrounding 
    fields where they have spent the day eating. They spend the night in the river 
    channel where the water protects them from predators. In the morning visitors 
    go to the blinds well before dawn. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Kris</B>] &quot;I would actually recommend going in the 
    morning. First because in the morning you come in and it's completely dark 
    and you can't see the birds at all but you can hear them and you know they're 
    out there but you're not quite sure exactly where or how many of them there 
    are or what exactly they look like. And then it stpers getting lighter and 
    you start being able to make out their shapes and then it gets lighter and 
    lighter and they start to lift off and take off for the fields.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Phil</B>] &quot;You start to realize how many of them 
    there are. You don't really understand that and you keep seeing raft upon 
    raft of cranes. It's incredible.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This is the magnet that draws thousands of people to the central 
    Platte Valley every year. <IMG SRC="images/crane_center1.jpg"
WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="343" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="2"><BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Roger Jasnoch, Kearney Chamber of Commerce</B>] &quot;Because 
    for that six-week period, we are a national, international destination. We 
    wish we could get the cranes to stay here a little longer but that's not going 
    to happen, I don't believe. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">&quot;People start calling to ask about the cranes in December. 
    The cranes usually begin to arrive in February. So the peak time would be 
    any time the last three weeks in March. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">By the time the cranes and crane watchers leave in early April, 
    they have left quite an impression on the local economy. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Jasnoch</B>] &quot;It's really difficult to get a handle 
    on that. Specifically Kearney, we probably book maybe 2,500, 3,000 room nights 
    in properties specifically for the cranes.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Three years ago, the Crane Meadows Nature Center moved into 
    this former truck stop near Grand Island. The location next to the interstate 
    makes it a perfect place for crane watchers to stop. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Larry Keller, Crane Meadows</B>] &quot;That has changed 
    us slightly as a nature center from strictly an educational institution to 
    also one that focuses on tourism.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Some stop in for a souvenir. Others want advice about roadside 
    crane viewing. Crane Meadows also takes visitors to its blinds in the morning 
    and evening. Last year 22,000 people visited the nature center, and Keller 
    estimates that about 15,000 of those guests came during crane season. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Keller</B>] &quot;It's hard to count because sometimes 
    it gets real busy that we don't have a real accurate method of counting all 
    those visitors.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Crane Meadows is planning a $2 million expansion and improvement 
    project. A foot bridge will be built to allow better access to the river and 
    a network of hiking trails. The current building will be remodeled and a new 
    educational center will be built. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Keller</B>] &quot;There's a lot to learn and a lot to 
    see in native Nebraska. That has brought on the tourism.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Tourism that is leading the Rowe Sanctuary to take on its 
    own building project, a replacement for the old farmhouse that serves as headquarters.

    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">People like Phil Cafaro and Kris Bronars, people who find 
    other things to do besides watch the cranes. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Phil</B>] &quot;We have been staying in Minden. We went

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Kris</B>] &quot;The Hastings Museum today.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Phil</B>] &quot;A wonderful museum. So we're spending 
    a couple hundred dollars with meals and being here and driving around and 
    doing different things.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Tebbel</B>] &quot;That's really what we wanted to do so 
    they're here longer. They spend more money, but we don't necessarily have 
    more people.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">That's important to Paul Tebbel because he knows if you aren't 
    careful, you could kill the crane that laid the golden egg. <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Tebbel</B>] &quot;And even though I've got the most blind 
    space here on the river and I'm always adding it on, I'm unwilling to compromise 
    the cranes' safety and the reason that they're here on behalf of a tourist. 
    I can't do that. But I can take care of a lot of people here as long as I 
    do it carefully.&quot; <IMG SRC="images/crane_blind3.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT=

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Seeing the cranes glide through the air, hearing their haunting

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This is the first time Harold Johnson has seen the crane migration

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Harold</B>] &quot;They'd come over the schoolhouse and 
    I knew where they was going to go, so I would get my horse out and away I 
    would go and I'd always be late for supper. Get a little reprimand.&quot; 
    <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Harold</B>] &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Those cranes made an impression that stuck with him, an impression 
    so strong that he told his daughter he wanted to see the cranes one more time. 
    <BR>
    <IMG SRC="images/trans.gif" HSPACE="10" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">[<B>Harold</B>] &quot;I told them I said we better go pretty

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">For some, the sandhill cranes are just a bunch of big, gray 
    birds that hang around for a few weeks every year. That is true, but there 
    are plenty of folks who think there is something special about the way those 
    birds hang around, folks like Phil and Kris who plan to come back. They might 
    bring Phil's parents along, too. <BR>
