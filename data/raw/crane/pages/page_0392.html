          </span>Up to 10 pairs of sandhill cranes are believed to nest on the
          installation, Mello said. This has been based on crane courtship calls
          and observations in the spring. The regionwide population, including
          the state of Wisconsin, is believed to be more than 11,000 birds,
          according to the International Crane Foundation (ICF) of Baraboo, Wis.<o:p>

          </span>Cranes are large birds with long necks and legs, which project
          in flight, according to the ICF. Cranes usually live on or near
          wetlands, fields or prairies and eat vegetation, rodents, amphibians,
          fish, reptiles and insects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>Of the 14 known species of cranes, the sandhill crane and the
          nearly extinct whooping crane are the only two species of cranes found
          in North America.<o:p>

          </span>At Fort McCoy, sandhill cranes are found throughout the
          installation, usually near wetlands, which cover approximately 4,000
          acres of the installation's 60,000 acres, Mello said.<o:p>

          </span>&quot;The cranes are an indication of the rich species
          diversity we have at a military training installation - Fort McCoy -
          birds, mammals, plants and reptiles,&quot; Mello said. <o:p>

          </span>David Beckmann, a wildlife biologist contracted through
          Colorado State University, said the installation does several things
          to help support the crane habitat.<o:p>

          <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>Prescribed burns help keep the areas where the cranes are found
          open and free of shrubs and brush, he said. This helps cranes spot
          potential food sources, as well as predators, and keeps areas open for
          courtship interactions.<o:p>

          </span>The installation's work to control exotic plant species, such
          as glossy buckthorn, also helps keep the vegetation conditions
          favorable for the crane population to establish nesting areas on post,
          he said.<o:p>

          <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">chairman,
          said the county has had a good group of volunteers to count cranes
          over the years.<o:p>

          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>&quot;No matter what the weather, the volunteers get up and are
          in the field by 5:30 a.m. the day of the survey (usually in
          April),&quot; Lanier said. &quot;They observe and listen for the
          cranes.&quot;<o:p>

          <p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>The work is being rewarded. Lanier said the county population
          of sandhill cranes counted in the survey has increased from 167 cranes
          (31 breeding pairs) in 2001 to 202 cranes (52 breeding pairs) in 2002.<o:p>

          </span>Sandhill cranes are believed to be the oldest surviving species
          of bird in the world, according to the ICF. Fossils more than 6
          million years old have been found in Nebraska.<o:p>

          </span>The numbers of sandhill cranes declined as the steady
          encroachment of civilization and land cultivation eliminated their
          habitats, however, the population has rebounded in recent years.
          Sandhill crane habitats have made a comeback as more waterfowl
          projects were undertaken by the Wisconsin Department of Natural
          Resources, and hunting prohibitions and protection and restoration of
          wetlands were enacted.<span style="mso-spacerun:

          </span>Sandhill cranes are well known for their graceful, leaping
          courtship dances. The birds migrate south for the winter, and
          generally spend their time in Florida or Georgia.<o:p>
