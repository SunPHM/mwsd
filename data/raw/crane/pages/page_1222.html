      <H1>Dallas Transportation</H1><IMG alt="HighFive1" src="high501.jpg" height=380 width=450 align=right border=1> <B>
      <P>Dallas is at the heart of a regional metropolitan area spanning eight North Texas counties with a population of nearly 5.2 million people. The development trends during the past 30 years in which this population virtually doubled has been, in a word, "sprawl." Transportation systems have been both a major contributor to this dramatic growth and a victim of its nature -- an ever widening spread of residential areas and business centers that requires constant movement of people and materials. Dallas has been a leader and innovator in the development of transporation that supports the entire "metroplex" region. But the dramatic increases in overall traffic and the ever-widening reach of urban sprawl threaten to make the progress made thus far inadequate to meet the needs of even the next decade. This page will focus on key issues and projects related to transportation systems in and around Dallas at any given time. Pictured above is current construction at one of the busiest intersections in the Southwest, the LBJ Freeway and North Central Expressway interchange on the north edge of Dallas. A separate section below details the "High Five" project underway at this site. <BR>
      <H2>Dallas' Transportation Infrastructure</H2>
      <P>Like most cities, Dallas has tried to at first support suburban growth and then cope with it through the construction of "loop" arteries. Integrated with major interstate and state highways, the result is a
      typical "metroplex" grid resembling multiple wheel and spoke patterns. Unfortunately, such grids tend to "interlock" more often than they "interact," thus, predictably, creating "gridlock." A continuous program of highway upgrades and maintenance
      contributes as much to gridlock as it does to resolving it. Within the past six years, Dallas did have the foresight and backbone required to upgrade the major north/south freeway corridor that runs through the very center of the city, Central Expressway. This project arguably has saved the city from becoming virtually impossible to navigate.
      <BR>
      <P><IMG height=400 alt="Dallas Map" src="map.gif" width=400
      align=right border=1> 
      <P>The innermost loop system encircling Dallas dates to the 1940s and is known as Loop 12. Oldtimers describe "real Dallas" as that part of the city inside Loop 12. The next loop is IH635, which was developed in the 1960s and 1970s. IH635 generally is within the Dallas city limits or separates Dallas from some of its large suburban cities. The thrid loop out, Beltline Road, actually pre-dates IH635 and parts of Loop 12. Beltline was a rural road system 
      mostly within Dallas county long before the onset of urban sprawl. Today, very few stretches of Beltline Road have any rural flavor at all. Known by various names as it passes through suburban areas -- Main Street in the northern suburb of Richardson for example -- Beltline Road is now a recurring blur of chain restaurants, malls, office parks and housing developments.<BR>
      <P>Travel into and out of the Dallas area has also contributed significantly to the region's development. The first 50 years of Dallas is, in large part, a history of being at an important crossroad in the migration patterns that settled the southwestern and western United States. First on horseback in wagons, then by train, millions rolled through the area headed west from "back East" or north from south Texas. Dallas became a major
      retail and distribution center and subsequently a regional headquarters for many businesses. When air travel became commercially viable, Dallas was well positioned to continue its service as a hub. One of the most important development decisions made post-WWII was the commitment of funds to the vision of the Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport. "DFW" has become a monstrous economic engine, and is one of the most important transportation elements in Dallas' current and future growth cycles.
      Heavy rail declined to virtually nothing as a passenger mode, but continues to be a strong factor, along with trucking, in the business hub environment. Amtrak still serves Dallas, but only on a very limited basis with a single line.<BR>
      
      <H2>The DART Solution</H2><IMG height=350 alt="DART train" src="dart10.jpg" width=450 align=left border=1>
<p>The combination of population growth and sprawl utltimately led to the planning of a major light rail system for commuting within the North Texas region. The Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) system was initiated in the late 1980s, and today has nearly 45 miles of track and 34 stations on two major lines. 
      Ridership during the work week is averaging more than 70,000 per day. The network of light rail stations is integrated with a DART bus feeder route, transit center and park-and-ride network. All DART light rail stations have weather-protected ticketing and waiting areas and have been designed to accommodate site-specific art themes. 
      <BR>
      <P>DART offers the potential for removing enough cars from major commuter routes to enable road construction and expansion to keep pace with the increasing traffic loads. The overlay of a light rail system on a street grid that developed in the absence of any passenger rail transit has presented special challenges to DART designers and engineers, but
      the results continue to impress. Continued tax-based funding and an accelerated build-out will probably be required to meet traffic growth rates satisfactorily. A key development plan for a light rail route linking Dallas Love Field into the network is currently being debated by planners and city officials.

      <BR><IMG height=350 alt="High Five" src="high529.jpg" 
      width=450 align=right border=1>
      <P>The "High Five" project is the Texas Department of Transportation's (TXDOT) master plan for unsnarling the tangle that has been created over a period of three decades at the
      interchange between the IH635 east/west loop and US75, the major north/south freeway running through the Dallas metroplex. The project is the largest of its kind in TXDOT history and the largest 
      currently underway in the country. Nearly a half-million cars a day pass through this interchange, and at no time will it be possible to completely re-route all traffic away from the intersection from all directions. 
      <BR>
      <P>The ambitious six-year project has initially been priced at $261 million, and is considered a bargain at that price if successful. In an overlapping three-phase
      project plan, more than 733 support piers for elevated lanes will be built as sub-structure to a 5-tier stack of multi-lane ramps and throughways -- thus the "High Five" name. Construction began in January 2001 and is currently ahead of schedule. Several overpasses have been removed, and traffic patterns undergo weekly changes. Remarkably, traffic disruption has
      thus far been minimal given the scope of the work in progress.
      <BR>
      <P>A Webcam streaming two live image views of the High Five construction project can be accessed at <A HREF=http://highfivecam.com target=_blank>HighFiveCam.com</A>. Depending on your connection bandwidth, you may have to wait 20 to 30 seconds for the streaming image to start. DSL and other higher speed connections will then get smooth streaming images, while dial-up access will provide clear images with movement jumping forward at multi-second intervals. It is still a good view even on dial-up if you have a little patience. But first, check out the still shots below.

      <P>Dallas spearheaded the effort to widen and improve its primary north/south artery beginning in 1995. The project is essentially complete, and has significantly improved the flow of traffic throughout the northern half of Dallas county. The project involved creating below grade-level lanes through some parts of the route between downtown Dallas and Northwest Highway. The image at left depicting these sub-grade lanes is just south of Mockingbird Lane. Multi-lane frontage roads along the entire stretch of North Central Expressway carry much of the local traffic using these routes. The project was also engineered in concert with the development of DART stations, overpasses and track right-of-way. DART actually runs 100-160 feet beneath Central Expressway between Mockingbird Lane and downtown Dallas. About the only thing left to be done to maximize traffic flow on this critical artery is completion of the High Five project described above.
