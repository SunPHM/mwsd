	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The earliest record of a rail mounted crane in use in
		Devonport Dockyard is in 1890, with a vertical boilered 4 wheel self propelled
		crane supplied from Grafton's of Vulcan works, Bedford. Steam was to provide
		the motive power for all the rail cranes up to 1952, when Grafton's also
		supplied the last one. There could have been nearly 80 steam cranes over the
		years, with up to 10 ton lifting capacity. The last working steam crane in the
		Yard was built in 1940, Yard No. 176, and spent its life in South Yard and was
		not scrapped until 1976. These cranes had large timber buffers and conventional
		3 link couplings, and were employed on sundry lifts of equipment and for
		unloading of the wagons, which they could shunt to the necessary location. The
		cranes in the South Yard were used in the timber yards, loading the logs onto
		bogie wagons, for movement through the tunnel to the Joiners' Shop in North
		Yard, or lifting timber out of the timber ponds onto low loader wagons and
		moving them to the timber stacks.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 1952 onwards diesel took over as motive power, with
		T. Smith &amp; Sons (Rodley) Ltd. supplying twenty-nine up to 1968, with
		capacities of three, six and two of ten ton lift capacity. Twenty-two alone
		being delivered between April and October 1956, for the sum of &pound;192,589,
		which was part of an order for thirty-two cranes for the Home Yards and Malta.
		The last diesel crane in the Yard was withdrawn in 1990, from North Yard, but
		it had not been used for some time.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5193 was used in the North Yard around No. 5 basin, and 
		was seen working there at least up to October 1981. She follows the 
		standard Devonport Dockyard construction pattern for cranes, with the 
		large timber buffers almost down to track level and 3 link couplings. 
		The specifications say she is designed to shunt four ten ton wagons. To 
		enable the cranes to lower loads into the bottom of the dry docks, a 
		large amount of lifting cable is carried on the hoist drum, with much of 
		it never being used now 5193 is on the Plym Valley Railway as our 
		embankments are not that high. The jib is of the standard lattice girder 
		construction, the same as supplied on the ten ton cranes we believe, 
		although 5193 is only capable of lifting six. The crane operates without 
		any outriggers, so the short wheel base and of course the four foot 
		eight and a half inch gauge also limits the lifting capability. To 
		ensure a rigid lifting platform, there is no springing on the chassis at 
		all, the four axle boxes are bolted directly to the main frames, which 
		means the crane does not like uneven track, as there is no movement of 
		the axle-boxes to take up any dips in the track. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5193 is now used to lift all sorts of items around the
		railway from sleepers and rail, to wagon wheels and even wooden container
		bodies. The porta-cabin which is now the shop on the platform was lifted onto a
		wagon by 5193, up at the top of the site, and then shunted down into the
		platform by a locomotive and 5193 lifted the cabin into the final position on
		the platform. She has also moved large amounts of track materials in the past
		few years during the construction of the first section of our line and will no
		doubt see a lot more materials moved during the construction of the line back
		to Plym Bridge.</P>

	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A NAME="Devonport">The</A> Railways
		of Devonport Dockyard</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 1690 work started to build a stone dock at
		Point Forward, now in the present South Yard, on the River Tamar to the west of
		Plymouth. The first workers at the docks were accommodated in hulks moored on
		the river, as the nearest houses were in the town of Plymouth some two miles
		away, but by 1700 the first houses in the immediate area began to appear at
		North Corner, and by 1731 the size of the community was approaching that of a
		small town. This turned out to be an unwise location in which to build the
		accommodation, but it did lead indirectly to the need for a railway system
		within the dockyard. To the north the Ordinance Department acquired a 4 acre
		site in 1718 for the purpose of a weapons depot, which became known as the Gun
		Wharf and latterly Morice Yard, with storehouses, workshops, a powder magazine,
		cooperage and in 1723 a row of houses for the officers was built, which still
		exists today. Further expansion work continued on the yard and by 1837 the
		population in the area exceeded that of Plymouth, after Royal approval the Yard
		changed its name from Plymouth Yard to Devonport Yard in 1841.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the rapid expansion of the Navy's steam fleet,
		further expansion of the Dockyard was necessary, but with the Yard now
		surrounded by civilian developments the only place to go was still further
		north up the Hamoze. A new site half a mile up-stream was purchased to form
		what became Keyham Steam Yard (North Yard). In the intervening area was access
		to the Torpoint Ferry, the Gun Wharf (run by the Army), a heavily populated
		part of the town and a hill jutting out towards the River Tamar, so from the
		earliest planning stages it was decided to build a tunnel between the two
		Yards, and also the Gun Wharf. Construction started in April 1855 and by April
		1857 the workers in Keyham Yard could walk through the tunnel to collect their
		wages from the pay office in Devonport Yard.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first tramway in the Yard was laid in 1860, when
		6,750 feet of rail was ordered from Ebbw Vale at &pound;10 per ton. This was
		laid to Brunel's broad gauge and ran from the boiler shop down to a 20 ton
		crane in the corner of South Basin. During the completion of the North Basin,
		between 1865 and 1867, the contractor utilised a standard gauge railway to move
		spoil to Keyham Lake and purchased an Aveling and Porter locomotive, which
		would appear to be the first purpose built railway locomotive in the Yards. In
		1865 an agreement was drawn up for the Cornwall Railway to build a new broad
		gauge line from the end of Weston Mill Viaduct into the Yard, nearly
		three-quarters of a mile long. The Cornwall Railway was contracted to provide a
		shunting engine to work the lines until the Admiralty acquired their first
		locomotive in March 1869, again an Aveling and Porter design but further
		locomotives that followed between 1880 and 1884 were from Hughes and the Falcon
		Engine Company. In February 1899, Dockyard No.'s 1 and 2 were delivered from
		Messers Hawthorn Leslie &amp; Co. </P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the tunnel between the two Yards only being 12
		foot high, it meant that broad gauge trains could not be accommodated, so
		although studies were carried out to enlarge the tunnel, a standard gauge line
		was finally built by the Cornwall Railway around 1877. To allow pedestrians to
		walk through the tunnel, a raised walkway was built on the east side of the
		track, a facility which remained until rail services ended. When L.S.W.R.
		standard gauge trains finally reached Plymouth in 1876, via the G.W.R.'s line
		from Lydford and the Plym Valley into Devonport King's Road station, a third
		rail was laid on the Cornwall Railway's main line to a point roughly half way
		across Weston Mill Viaduct, so that standard gauge trains could enter the
		Dockyard.</P>

	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1895 work started on a big expansion of the Yards, by
		some 118 acres, only 41 acres were above the high water mark, so a massive
		amount of work was required, by 1896 it was reported that 11 locomotives,
		eventually rising to 25 by 1899, were working on 25 miles of temporary track.
		On completion of the contract in 1907, 18 locomotives were auctioned off, some
		selling for around &pound;200, along with over 500 wagons, 2 passenger coaches
		and a large amount of rail. Some 4,700 yards of permanent track had been laid
		in the new Yard extension, of which a 1,000 yards was on curves.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the great upsurge in traffic generated by the First
		World War, eight new locomotives arrived between 1914 and 1919, built by
		Hawthorn Leslie, Avonside Engineering and five from Andrew Barclay. In 1915
		platforms were built to enable long troop trains to work directly into the
		Yard, and 12 trains a day were anticipated. In the first two years of the war
		some 65,000 wagons had been handled in the Yards.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1955 the Admiralty ordered 10 new diesel "Planet"
		locomotives from F.C. Hibberd of London, so marking the demise of the steam
		fleet, many ending their days as stationary boilers. One of the roles of the
		railway within the Yards had been to provide a passenger service between the
		separated Yards, which probably started running between the Barracks platform
		and South Yard in the 1890's. In 1907 with the Yard extension completed,
		services ran every 30 minutes from No. 5 basin, in North Yard, to South Yard
		Camber with 3 intermediate stops, a journey of about 20 minutes. The train
		normally consisted of 6, 4-wheel coaches; 4 for the workman and 2 for higher
		ranks; plus a 4-wheel flat wagon to carry the workers toolboxes and other
		sundry items required by the passengers. Even as late as 1964, a survey shows
		the train was still carrying at least 20 passenger on all the journeys during
		the day through the tunnel, with over a hundred on board at the morning and
		lunch breaks, and the 1605 from South Yard almost full with 153 passengers. In
		the 1960's with the rapid increase of road traffic two bridges were built
		across the Torpoint Ferry approach roads, between North and Morice Yards, and
		Cornwall Beach, between Morice and South Yards, and marked the beginning of the
		end of the Yard's passenger service. No. 2 was specially steamed for the final
		service on Friday 13, 1966, the train being replaced by a bus service. The
		internal freight services continued and around 250 wagons were still being
		received from British Rail a month in 1976. The Falkland's War in 1982 saw the
		last extensive use of the railway for freight, when large numbers of wagons
		brought stores for loading onto ships. The last conventional freight trains ran
		in North Yard at the end of 1984, but reduced to very small loads, but the
		tunnel between the Yards had closed on 10 November 1982, when one of the
		Planet's, 4860, worked the last freight train through the tunnel.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the first locomotive steamed in the Yards in the
		mid 1860's some seventy locomotives have worked on the network, with all the
		Devonport owned locomotives being 4 wheeled, to enable them to operate around
		the tight bends, and standard gauge. Until the 1960's the locomotives were
		painted plum, or dull red, lined out in yellow. By 1976 the diesels were in
		dark green livery with black and yellow striped buffer beams.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1987 the Dockyard was privatised, and is now operated
		by Devonport Management Ltd. This has seen a new type of railway work in
		Devonport, with many Paxman diesel engines, from High Speed Trains, being
		overhauled in the Yard, but arriving on road transporters, along with other
		diesel engines. In October 1991, 47538 was loaned to the Yard as a test bed for
		class 47 engine overhauls, and moved by rail in the Yard by Planets 4858 and
		4860, their last movements before withdrawal. Two air-braked Drewry locomotives
		arrived in 1993 to operate the air braked Nuclear Flask trains into the
		submarine re-fit complex. Other Railway work in the Yard has seen the Mark 2
		Driving Van Trailers, currently used on services out of London Liverpool Street
		station, being refurbished and around 1,800 HST coaches were fitted with
		central door locking in 1994-5. The full 8 coach formation, without the power
		cars, was worked with a barrier vehicle at each end of the train out from Laira
		Depot top and tailed by a Class 47 and Class 08, as the loops at Keyham station
		and the exchange sidings in the Yard were too short to enable a single
		locomotive to run road the train. In 2002 the Yard re-wired and overhauled First Great Western HST power cars, with the units being transferred by
		road from Laira depot into the old Gun shop in the Yard, where two short
		lengths of track were specially built. Work has also been carried out on
		accident damaged Class 170 D.M.U.'s, with the damaged cab sections being
		rebuilt, again the unit was moved in and out of the Yard on road transport. The
		only rail borne traffic, is the nuclear flask train used to transport fuel for
		the Navy's submarines between Sellafield and the re-fitting complex in
		Devonport.</P>
