      <div align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#CC3333" size="2">Animals are 
        put on the Endangered Species list. when it is discovered that they are 
        dwindling. Species on the list receive special protection and a recovery 
        plan is prepared for them. Recovery plans are required by law, this means 
        that a specific action is taken to recover the species. These management 
        programs are needed to protect species and prevent further loss of their 
        habitats. These types of programs mainly focus on protection of the species 
        from disturbance, prescribed burning, adequate grazing, water level control 
        ,control of exotic vegetation, nest protection, and predator control. 
        Thus the forming of the Endangered Species Act. This act is " based on 
        the assumptions that each life form may prove valuable in ways we cannot 
        yet measure and that each is entitled to exist for its own sake as well." 
        Governments set aside specific sums of money to keep the Act enforced. 
        There are always people trying to weaken the act and people of the environmental 
        community who want to strengthen the act. There are three ways that the 
        act can be strengthened. The act can be strengthened with funding (which 
        there isn't enough of), the acceleration of the recovery of species, and 
        by preventing species from having to be threatened or endangered. Critics 
        say that the Endangered Species Act doesn't work. These people are frustrated 
        that in the past twenty years only a handful of endangered species have 
        been recovered and delisted. Randy Snodgrass, an Audubon Wildlife Specialist, 
        says, " How can the act undo damage from over a two hundred year period 
        in twenty years?" Critics say the act puts the needs of wildlife before 
        the needs of humans. Randy Snodgrass replies, "The needs of wildlife are 
        the needs of humans." All species depend on each other to survive. Those 
        who are against the Endangered Species Act also claim that agency actions 
        too often jeopardize federal projects. According to the National Wildlife 
        Federation only two percent of the actions were found to jeopardize federal 
        projects. Critics feel that people who support the endangered species 
        act are anti-job and anti-growth. According to Thane Maynard, and Audubon 
        activist, "The act is a very moderate law that has been in effect for 
        twenty five years. Those years happened to be the twenty-five biggest 
        years of economic growth in the history of the world." For over two decades, 
        the Endangered Species Act has favorably balanced the conservation needs 
        of endangered species with the nation's economic and social demands. </font> 
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#CC3333" size="2">Here are some smaples of 
          successes reported throught out: <br>
          The California <b>Condor</b> was once almost extinct. All of the remaining 
          birds were put into captivity to attempt to rescue this species. That 
          effort achieved its goal and is helping the Condor toward recovery.<br>
          Yellowstone Park, the <b>blackfooted Ferret</b> was thought to be extinct 
          nearly a decade ago. Fortunately, a group of the mammals was found and 
          was bred in captivity. The ferrets have recovered and are home again. 
          <br>
          The Endangered Species Act gave these mammals a good chance to survive.<br>
          The Texas gulf coast <b>Whooping Crane</b> was thought to be extinct 
          in its habitat. Only fifteen birds were estimated to exist in 1941. 
          Under the protection of the Endangered Species Act funds were used toward 
          the preservation and captive breeding of the species. The birds have 
          now increased greatly and are a great tourist attraction. <br>
          The <b>Brown Pelican</b> and <b>Bald Eagle</b> have also made promising 
          comebacks.</font></p>
