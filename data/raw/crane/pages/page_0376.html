          <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><font size="2">The lovely and 
          elegant blue cranes are also known as the paradise crane or Stanley 
          crane. Like the demoiselle cranes, blue cranes spend little time in 
          wetlands, preferring, instead, to feed and nest in dry, grassy uplands. 
          Blues have short bills and, rather than probing like most other cranes, 
          they feed primarily on above-ground resources like seeds and insects. 
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">They generally nest 
          in high elevation grasslands, where there is less disturbance. During 
          the winter, these cranes move down mountains to lower altitudes. Some 
          blues prefer to nest in agricultural areas and do not use natural vegetation.<br>
          <br>
          Most crane species possess red patches of scaly skin on their heads 
          which they use extensively in during threat displays. Blue cranes, along 
          with their close relatives, the demoiselles, do not have these red patches, 
          but possess head feathers which are erected when they are excited and 
          aggressive. The long dark feathers trailing to the ground behind these 
          birds are tertial feathers of the wing, not tail feathers. (Tails are 
          very short on cranes and usually not visible unless the crane raises 
          its wings.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Most crane pairs 
          leap and pirouette when dancing. While blues also leap and bow, most 
          of their dance consists of the two birds running together with the female 
          in the lead. The chase is often interrupted by the excited birds as 
          they stop and call.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Range: Southern 
          Africa, with 99% of its population living in South Africa.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Status: The 
          blue crane is the most geographically restricted of any crane species. 
          Most of the world's 12,000 to 23,000 blue cranes live in southern Africa. 
          A few semi-desert areas boast stable or increasing blue crane populations. 
          </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">The blue crane 
          is the national bird of South Africa and while this provides official 
          protection, laws are difficult to enforce and often sometimes ignored. 
          Blues are sometimes poisoned deliberately (by farmers trying to protect 
          crops) and accidentally (when the cranes eat poisoned bait intended 
          for other species, or after routine dusting of crops). Closely associated 
          with grasslands, blues are sometimes victims of large afforestation 
          projects which convert prime habitat into commercial tree plantations. 
          In some areas of their range, populations have plummeted by 90% in just 
          10 years. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Growing human 
          populations also place greater demands upon the environment as more 
          acreage is converted to agriculture. Some blue cranes are captured and 
          used as pets. Only a few of these cranes nest inside of protected areas, 
          so the future of this crane is largely dependent on private landowners. 
          These factors have given the blue crane the dubious distinction of being 
          perhaps the most endangered of all cranes.</font></font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
