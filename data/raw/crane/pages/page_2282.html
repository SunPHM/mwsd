<I>Illinois may be called the Prairie State, but very little of the state's original prairie remains.
This loss of habitat has caused the disappearance of many native prairie species from Illinois,
including the bison, black bear, and whooping crane. An addtional 127 prairie species are threatened or endangered in Illinois.

Prairies, as the picture suggests, consist mainly of grasses and wildflowers; few trees or shrubs are
found there. In 1820, at least 60% of Illinois' land area, mainly in the northern part of the state,
was grasslands of one type or another<!-- (see <A HREF= "pramap.html">map</A>)-->. Prairie land
makes very good farm land, however, and by the end of the nineteenth century, farmers had
plowed and planted much of Illinois' original prairie. Industrialization and the growth of cities
like Chicago took care of much of what remained, and today 99.99% of the original prairie is
gone.

The high-quality prairie that has survived--only 2352 acres--is generally fragmented into small
packages of a few acres or less, often scattered along highways and railroads. Far-ranging prairie
species, such as the bison or black bear, could never survive in so diminished a habitat, and many
species of birds, plants, and insects also require larger patches of prairie in order to survive. In all, 18 prairie species
have been extirpated since the European settlement of Illinois and 127 more species are
considered threatened or endangered.
