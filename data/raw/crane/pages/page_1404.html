<p>The construction of a new hospital facility in Rochester, MN
required tower cranes that needed to be supported against wind
loads by the partially constructed building. Wenzel Engineering
was charged with getting the lateral loads out of the tower crane
and engaging enough of the building&#146;s current shear walls
and moment frames to provide stability for the crane. The tower
crane on the right was designed to sit completely on the 12<sup>th</sup>
floor. As far as we know this has only been done two other times
in the US.&nbsp; Wenzel Engineering also supported the multi
level skyway during erection, at the left of the picture. This
involved coordinating the erection sequence to maintain balanced
loading to the supports.&nbsp;&nbsp; The process was further
complicated because the shoring towers landed on top of an
existing pedestrian tunnel. </p>
