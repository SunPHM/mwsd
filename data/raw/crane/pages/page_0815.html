<p><strong>Initial Concept</strong></p>

<p>I was given a segment of &quot;land&quot; in the rtlToronto
train4.5 layout between my existing Train Station and a fantastic
embankment built by Jeff Elliott. A road also ran through it,
making a narrow strip of real estate. I decided I wanted to build
an utilitarian building, in the style of older Lego Train sets
like <a href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/165">165</a> or <a
href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/7838">7838</a> or even some of
the <a
href="http://library.brickshelf.com/scans/7000/7777/7777-15.html">suggested
buildings</a> from Idea Book 7777. I was really impressed by the
folks in FGLTC of Germany, who had built <a
href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=63068">amazing
warehouse/cargo platform buildings</a>, too. My idea was to build
a cargo loading station-nothing modern or contemporary, but
something somewhat older in that generic European style that Lego
sets used to have.</p>

<p>As with most projects, I started with a simple ink drawing of
what I wanted to do, outlining the general building layout and
shapes. I deliberately left out certain details, like how I would
cover the roof or any details on the sides of the buildings.
During this part of the design, I did however try to remain
within general dimensions of Lego items like windows, doors,
openings for vehicles and the like. Shortly after I published my
drawing on Lugnet, fellow Torontonian Jeff Elliott created a <a
href="http://news.lugnet.com/org/ca/rtltoronto/?n=7089">virtual
model</a> of the sketch using LDraw. It wasn't hard to translate
the design, as I had intended the sketch to be set to Lego
dimensions. However, Jeff's design is a lot larger, uses hard to
find pieces and doesn't have any of the details in place.</p>

<p align="left">I decided on using yellow and grey pieces as a
primary colour scheme, with white and dark grey accent pieces.
This was primarily because I wanted the Cargo Station to retain
the classic Lego Town look, instead of a more photorealistic
colour scheme many other Lego train builders like. The layout
space was constrained by a length of roughly six track pieces
over three 32x32 dot baseplates. I laid out the foundation with
dark grey basic bricks and spur of train track.</p>

<p align="left">During the layout, I decided on having two
segments of the building with a loading dock up front, the third
with a mesh gate, the fourth with a raised office section and the
fifth as another fenced in area. However, I found myself with two
T-junction and a single straight road plate, which gave me an
ample opportunity to turn the fifth segment into a loading dock
which trucks could park right into.</p>

<p align="left">The roofs were constructed with 33 degree grey
slopes. To roof the entire surface with only slope bricks or
large grey plates would have been prohibitively expensive, so I
spent some time digging through my collection of pieces to see
how I could creatively cover the building. I found several large
grey wings from the <a href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/7144">7144
Slave 1</a> Star Wars spaceship, which I had purchased multiple
copies on at extreme discount which fit into the spaces, and
combined with some older Classic Space grey wings, I bolted them
in place with click hinges.</p>

<p align="left">To create the arched openings on the front of the
building, I decided to use 45 and 33 degree inverted slopes,
which I used before in my previous Train Station project. This
allowed me to stay away from the confines of Lego's existing arch
pieces, which I didn't have any of, not to mention in yellow. The
loading docks are meant for transient mixed goods to be loaded
off of boxcars or flatcars and transferred crossdock to trucks. I
decided to decorate the fronts with small lamps made of tap and
radar dish pieces as well as yellow grill/ladders. The actual
dock is filled with various tanks, parcels, containers and a skid
of Technic cylinder heads.</p>

<p align="left">Just behind the second set of pillars is the
train track, where a flatcar sits ready to be unloaded and loaded.</p>

<p align="left">One of the things I learned after building my
Train Station was that building things with four walls was
expensive in terms of brick usage, yet not fully building walls
made your buildings look incomplete on an all aspect train layout
shared by other buildings. One trick around this is to build some
part of the structure with four walls, and use arch spans and
open wall areas to expand the actual footprint of the building
without investing in the bricks required for full walls.</p>

<p align="left">The office area of the Cargo Station is at the
center of the building and includes a small main floor office for
administration. On the front is a space reserved for putting a
sign later. I put in a large compound window of classic 2x2 white
windows mapped into a similar radius but taller arch. Given the
extra height of this part of the building, I built a small crane
winch over the tracks, directed by a second floor control room.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Small crane winch.</em></p>

<p align="left">Older Lego sets usually have some sort of &quot;play&quot;
feature built into them. I put in this small crane which makes
the building more of a toy-you can move the train car below and
winch up a load of cargo, then move another car in place below it
and lower it back down.</p>

<p align="left">The loading dock on this part of the building is
inset with a small garage/loading bay for trucks, giving a
crossdocking area to load train cars directly. Inside is a small
control panel and storage for tools like a broom and monkey
wrench.</p>
