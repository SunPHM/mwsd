        How little we understood the enormity of the ESA then, the incredible 
        positive effect it was to have on our country far into the future. Only 
        because of it do hundreds of species that share the nation with us still 
        exist at all. Just as significantly, millions of acres of forests, 
        beaches, wetlands and wild places—those species’ essential habitats—also 
        survive.</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana">
        That’s because the Endangered Species Act is more than just a wildlife 
        protection law. It is also a land use statute.&nbsp; Because the ESA exists, 
        millions of acres of the best of wild America also still exist—acres 
        that surely would have been developed otherwise. </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">
        Today there are over 1,250 U.S. species on the list. There ought to be 
        more, and the whole enterprise needs better funding and support. It’s 
        not a perfect law. But we should ask ourselves: “what if the ESA had 
        never existed at all? What then? How many species, forests, open spaces, 
        wild places now protected, would there still be? If it falls, what will 
        happen to what’s left?”</span></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 9pt">
        We may soon find out, because, as this is written, the entire law, not 
        to mention its funding and legal support, is under the fiercest and most 
        sustained assault in its history. How can this be?</span></font></p>

        After the 2002 elections, the far right is sensing victory at last. 
        Already, on public lands across the nation, the law is being implemented 
        by a Secretary of Interior who has asserted that the ESA is 
        unconstitutional, backed up by a President whose close ties to 
        extractive industries don’t even raise eyebrows.&nbsp; With industry-favored 
        appointees in every key post, carefully disguised “administrative

        This is because the Endangered Species Act has been much more than just 
        a magnificent tool to protect wild and natural America. It is a 
        profoundly <i>moral statement</i>, uniquely American in its vision, its

        Based on seismic exploration in the 1980s, the U.S. Geological Survey 
        estimates the mean economically recoverable oil under the wildlife 
        refuge is 3.2 billion barrels.&nbsp; To put this amount in perspective,

        In contrast to the Administration’s claim that drilling would require

        the area’s wilderness values as well as damage wildlife habitat and 
        displace wildlife species.&nbsp; Government biologists predict that caribou,

        roads, pipelines, and drilling pads and the noise from traffic, aircraft 
        and hundreds of oilfield workers.&nbsp; Gravel mining for roads and drilling

    “The road network is, by definition, connected—basically, a large area of 
    connected hard surfaces. Most storm water pipes take the water from the road 
    right to the edge of a lake, stream, or estuary. We have to disconnect the 
    connectivity of the storm water drainage pipe and channel system, so that as 
    much water as possible goes into the soil or wetland. Let the soil and 
    wetland do the filtering before the runoff rejoins surface.” Perforating

    approaches.</span></p>

    “There was a Clean Air Act in the ‘70s and it cleaned up America’s air in a

    areas, you can’t build a highway without considering its implications on the 
    region’s air quality. Now, that’s an interesting constraint! Why couldn’t we

    Smart Growth America—the national coalition of organizations allied on smart 
    growth—is doing its part to move America’s transportation policy toward more 
    environmentally sustainable ends. Their TEA-3 priorities include road repair 
    rather than new roads and more money available for improving water quality. 
    “Roads have limited life spans,” says SGA policy director Beth Osborne. 
    “Each time a road is reconstructed, there is a chance to make it less 
    harmful to water quality and supply and an opportunity to improve any storm 
    water management systems near that road.” </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana">To 
    protect America’s threatened habitat and the clean water, fresh air and 
    flood protection that healthy ecosystems provide for us, our nation needs to 
    take a new look at our penchant for building more and bigger roads. We need 
    to envision a transportation system that protects health and environmental 
    quality, while serving people’s diverse needs for mobility.</span></p>

        Individuals can help by choosing the right kind of car or SUV when it 
        comes time to replace their current vehicles. Since every gallon of 
        gasoline burned in a car yields twenty pounds of CO into the 
        atmosphere, fuel economy can make a big difference. As I noted earlier, 
        hybrid vehicles offer great hope in this area. Businesses can help by 
        offering consumers better cars and SUVs and by educating people about 
        the environmental and national security implications of the products 
        they sell. They can also inventory emissions of heat-trapping gases 
        throughout their manufacturing facilities and figure out how to reduce 
        them, creating less waste, saving energy and money, and, ultimately, 
        producing a better balance sheet and more profit. Government can help by 
        setting clear and enforceable goals for reducing heat-trapping gases, 
        while allowing companies maximum flexibility to comply. And, at the 
        international level, our government can and should lead the way. Since 
        the U.S. has only five percent of the world’s population, but consumes 
        ten percent of its energy and produces twenty-five percent of global 
        heat trapping gases, we have a huge responsibility to be a leader.</span></h4>

        effect on the river, the environment, or even other water users. The 
        earliest water rights take precedence over all other uses—the first user 
        gets as much as his or her right allows, the next person gets part of 
        what is left, and so on until there is nothing left to distribute.&nbsp; In 
        most eastern states <i>surface water</i> use is based on a riparian 
        system, where property owners who are adjacent to a river or lake have 
        the right to reasonable use of the water. However, they have much more

        Given the history 
        and complexity of U.S. water policy, a national water management policy 
        is unlikely, although increasingly the need for a cohesive approach is 
        clear, and resource protection will depend on government action.&nbsp; 
        Recently, the American Water Resources Association (AWRA), a publicly

        Administration and the Congress to develop a National Water Vision that 
        would determine, in cooperation with the states and local governments, 
        how the nation wants to deal with water resources. AWRA emphasized that 
        it is not calling for a federal water policy that directs the actions of

        shared responsibilities at each level of government. </span></p>
