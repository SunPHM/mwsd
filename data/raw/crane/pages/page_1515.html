<p><b><u><font size="+2">Voltan's space dock</font></u></b></p>
<p><b><font size="+2"><font size="+1">I've been playing a lot of full thrust
lately so that influenced my choice of a space dock, I then had the good
idea of haivng the dock built in to a potato..... erm, asteroid.<br>
</font><br>
</font></b></p>
<div align="center"><img src="factory/voltan/base1.JPG"
 alt="bulking out" width="288" height="149">
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>So to start off I</b> <b>cut out a bit of plasticard for
my base and started bulking out the basic shape with lots and lots of green
stuff. </b></font><br>
<img src="factory/voltan/base2.JPG" alt="basic dock" width="288"
 height="148">
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>I followed that by adding the basic dock bit with some
brown stuff this was left very rough as the cunnnign plan was to add another
smoother layer of brown stuff later, or file it smooth, depending on which
method worked.<br>
It was a bit of both in the end.</b></font><br>

 alt="adding surface detaiil to the asteroid" width="288" height="173">
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>So with the basic shape in place, yet more green stuff
was added , but this time I poked it, hmm, with various bits and pieces (dry
lumps of putty, sculpting tools, cocktail sticks) to give the surface a pockmarked
cratery look. </b></font><br>

<br>
<font size="+1"><b>With all that out the way some nice neat geometric structures
were added at various points to give the impression of building on the surface
(it's not very clear on the top photo but there are three pipelines leading
out of the surface up to the dock, these are my electrical component- fuse
wire, I rule or not)</b></font><br>
<img src="factory/voltan/base6.JPG" alt="moulding the masters"
 width="288" height="192">
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>You done yet goes up the cry, not even close, so there
will be a short recess while you go to the toilet or have a cuppa or eat
cake. Using the master I've finished up above I made a mould so I could cast
it in resin. As you can see on the above photo, this involves a wall made
out of lego bricks to hold the rubber in and a screwdriver to hold the lego
wall against the plasticard base to stop any more of the rubber escaping
on to the rug, ho hum.</b></font><br>
<img src="factory/voltan/base7.JPG" alt="the mould" width="288"

<br>
<big><b>24 hours later, after cutting the rubber mould away from the rug,
you remove the lego and the master to show a lovely negative impression of
your master.</b></big><br>
<img src="factory/voltan/base8.JPG" alt="the cast piece" width="288"
 height="188">
<br>
<big><b>You then pour resin into it, following the instructions, and get
a nice new copy of your whatever, in this case space dock. Plus I can now
make lots of space docks and take over the world or something. </b></big><br>
<img src="factory/voltan/base10.JPG" alt="the final thing" width="288"

<br>
<big><b>Painting was fairly easy just lots of drybrushing for the rock bit,
with the constructions painted grey then given a black ink wash and a few
bits of yellow and red added for lights.<br>
The cranes were a last minute thought and I got the idea <a
 href="http://www.brigademodels.co.uk/Frames/Galleries/SFS-2.html" target="_blank">here</a>
and seeing as I have a pack of the starfuries that will never be used, we
have cranes instead.</b></big><br>
