Currently based in Leesburg, Florida, Dave and I have paused in our national driving tour to: first, visit Dave's parents; second, care for their cat while they're in New York helping care for their first grandchild (congratulations Lauran, Pema, and Yumtso); third, to observe a pair of nesting Sandhill Cranes (proud father shown at right) and as much other wildlife as we can find.<p>
Having come from Kansas City, the plantlife in Florida is an interesting change. Most of the neighbors have palm, orange, or grapefruit trees in their yards. Many also have a sago palm, which isn't a palm at all but looks like one that's been buried up to it's fronds. <p>
A Bald Eagle flies through almost every day; the cranes mentioned above often wander into the backyard to pick through the soil for grubs; an egret and an elderly blue heron stake out a nearby pond and squabble throughout the day. And it wouldn't be Florida without the frequent sighting of a pair of close-set eyes floating at the periphery of a community pond.<p>
Tiny, knobby-toed, translucent treefrogs line the exterior window sills at night. One vociferous frog has yet to be sighted but is heard right outside Dave's window early in the morning.<p>
<table width=272 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=left><tr><td><img src="_uimages/lanai.jpg" width=272 height=169 border=2><br><font size=2><center><i>The view from the lanai (screened porched)</i></center></font></td></tr></table>Our preparations to journey beyond Leesburg are almost complete. Short supply of screen tents for sale in Florida may delay us a bit, and a pile of laundry has helped keep us from the road so far. Pulling ourselves away from the screened porch view of water and wildlife will be difficult!<p><br>
