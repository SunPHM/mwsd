</font><font face="Arial" size="3">Aftermarket Ignitions seem to be all the
rage here lately, lots of questions about them in the magazines and on the
web.&nbsp; Just about any Bulletin Board System on the net that has to do with a
vehicle has quite a few posts about them.&nbsp; Everybody wants to know which is
the best and the most affordable?&nbsp; How durable are they?&nbsp; Will it give
me any more power?&nbsp;</font><P><font face="Arial" size="3">The list of
questions goes on and on.&nbsp; Well, I asked alot of these same questions and
finally found the answers to most of my questions and narrowed my search to just
two different ignitions.&nbsp; The CRANE HI-6 and the M.S.D. 6al.&nbsp; I have had
a M.S.D. on a previous 4x4 and it gave me a little more power and better idle,
had 0 problems with it.&nbsp; After talking with several people who have, and run,
the Crane HI-6 (they were all drag racers and run HIGH r.p.m. engines), two of the three&nbsp; had switched from M.S.D. to
Crane. So right off the bat I figured if they were switching, something had to be
better. after all, these are folks that bracket race and do not have lots of extra
$$ to spend on stuff that will not perform.&nbsp; The Crane HI-6 generates up to
twelve sparks at low r.p.m.'s.&nbsp; The number of sparks is adjusted to
maintain a total spark duration of twenty degrees of the crankshaft rotation and
about 3000 r.p.m's is a single high power spark.</font><P><font face="Arial" size="3">Well,
first of all let me tell you
what I got from Crane and then we will go on to the install.&nbsp; I talked
with a Crane Rep. and he asked me if I ever planned on running a turbo or a
super charger, or if I planned on doing any heavy towing with the vehicle.&nbsp;
They offered a Timing Retard control that you can use to retard your timing up
to twenty degrees, or if you set it in the middle, you can retard or advance your
timing ten degrees.&nbsp; This would be a big plus on the trails with low
r.p.m.'s and heavy loads from wheeling.&nbsp; It also gave me the added bonus of
being able to adjust the timing from the cab if I should get some lower grade
gas (now that NEVER happens does it!).&nbsp; I got the HI-6TRC ignition, it has
the timing retard control that comes with it and also is Fully potted with soft
Urethane for added heat, dirt and moisture protection.&nbsp; I also got their
PS-91 in the cap H.E.I. coil to give it some added punch.&nbsp;</font><P><font face="Arial" size="3">The
folks at Crane Cams have a HI-6 ignition to work on any vehicle.&nbsp; The
model I chose works for all G.M. H.E.I. systems, either in the cap coil or the
remote coil.&nbsp; It will also work on quite a few Fords and Mopars.&nbsp; For
the application you need visit the<a href="http://www.cranecams.com/CraneCams.htm"> CRANE CAMS</a> web site and if you have more
questions after that, give one of their helpful Tech Reps. a call at the number
listed on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; O.K. on to the install...</font><P><font face="Arial" size="3">Well,
the hardest part for me was to find a place to mount the ignition
computer box.&nbsp; I wanted to put it in the cab and that is where Crane recommends
you install it.&nbsp; I had a hard time finding room as I have a
manual tranny and can't&nbsp; just slap it on the transmission tunnel.&nbsp; I
looked under the hood and still did not find a location that I really
liked.&nbsp; I finally decided that I would gut my glove box and mount it behind
the glove box door to the inside portion of the heater/air conditioning
box.

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I took a hack saw blade and cut
out the plastic pocket that once served as the glove box ( anything that I had
previously stored in the glove box I put into my center console).&nbsp; There was not
really much room for anything in the old box, so it was worth taking it out to
use for this project.</font><p>

</center>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Once I had the main computer mounted and
ready for wiring, I had to pick a good location for the Timing Retard
Control.&nbsp; It comes in its own housing and has 2 tabs on the top with holes
for mounting.&nbsp; I did not want to mount it in a location that would&nbsp; leave
it vulnerable to being hit by my knees or any of the various stuff that I have
to carry in the old K-5 from time to time.&nbsp; Then there was the
&quot;other&quot; consideration.&nbsp; I have a two year old that is in love
with gadgets and switches.&nbsp; He is bound to be some kind of mechanic, the way he loves to take apart anything he can get his hands on.&nbsp; Makes it
kinda hard to baby proof a house when your baby can take apart all the child proof
gizmos that you thought would keep him safe.&nbsp; I had to mount the Control
somewhere that he could not readily see it and its bright little l.e.d. glowing
away.&nbsp; (Its just like a magnet to him).&nbsp; After toying with the idea of
making a nice cut out in the dash, I got to looking at the ashtray.&nbsp;
Flipped the door open and took out the butt catcher (I do not smoke so it is NEVER
going to be used).&nbsp; After some measuring and checking, it would fit with
some mods to the butt catcher.&nbsp; I broke out the old hack saw and file, cut
out the back side and the little snuffer grill in the front, as well as the
little divot for your cigarette.&nbsp; I cleaned it, painted it black and mounted
it with some self tapping screws.&nbsp; Then I had to file the screws down flush
with the top of the catcher so that it would fit back into the ash tray
housing.&nbsp;I slapped it in and flipped it up.&nbsp; Perfect, and no little
fingers to play with the knob on the control, not to mention the big fingers of
some of my &quot;curious&quot; friends.</font><p>

<p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Now that the mounting was taken care of it was time for some wiring.&nbsp; Since
I had the HI-6TRC version, it came with some nice WeatherPack connectors.&nbsp;
The large main plug was pre-wired into the connectors and the wiring harness
that attached to it was also pre-wired.&nbsp; I had to add the connectors
(included in the parts pack) for the Tachometer, and attach one of the wires
from the Timing Retard Controller.&nbsp; The instruction booklet that comes with
both the Main Ignition and the Timing Retard Control are top notch, well
written and very easy to understand.&nbsp; They are well illustrated and all the
illustrations have numbers on them that correspond to the instructions
given.&nbsp; If that does not make sense, here is an example (take large red wire
and attach to positive battery terminal, see illustration 3a).&nbsp; The illustrations
give you a very clear idea of what has to be done and they show
all the different H.E.I. configurations.&nbsp; On my particular application, the
unit had the added bonus of working in place of the stock H.E.I. module in the
distributor.&nbsp; You remove the stock module and wire the computer straight to the
magnetic pick up and it takes the place of the stock module.&nbsp; I will give
you an outline of my wiring, but please <font color="#FF0000">***NOTE***</font> <font color="#FF0000">Your
Wiring May Be Different From Mine***</font>.&nbsp; That being said, here is what
I had to do.</font><p>

</center>
<p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">The
Heavy Red wire goes to the positive side of the Battery, not to the fuse box or
another &quot;Hot&quot; wire that you have already.&nbsp; I found a large plug
in the firewall which had several wires and one vacuum tube running through it, I
took out my Dremel tool and made another small hole in the grommet and squeezed
the Heavy Red power wire through it for a nice tight fit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a
remote solenoid on my inner passenger fender so I wired it straight to the side
that feeds off the Battery with the supplied ring terminal.&nbsp; Crane recommends&nbsp; crimping
the terminals, as improper soldering can make the
wires brittle.&nbsp; I have been soldering wires and making circuit boards for a
while now and was positive I could do it without making the wire brittle, so I
stripped off the insulation on the terminal and crimped it on, then soldered it
and used heat shrink tubing for a clean, well insulated connection.&nbsp; I
did this on every connection I made with the exception of the 3 WeatherPack
connectors.&nbsp; The Heavy Black wire goes straight to chassis ground.&nbsp;
Make
sure you clean the contact area of all paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran the black
wire to the dash and made a small hole for a screw and nut.&nbsp; I cleaned the paint
down to bare metal and bolted it on.&nbsp; There are six wires that come off the
main WeatherPack plug and all but one need to be routed into the engine
compartment to be hooked up to the distributor.&nbsp; The exception was
the &quot;White&quot; wire, it is used for points type ignition and I don't have
points, so I made sure the end was insulated from contact and wrapped it up and
zip tied it neatly in a bundle close to the connector.&nbsp; There are also four
other wires that come out of the main computer.&nbsp; A &quot;Blue&quot; one, for
cylinder select (since I have a V-8 it was not used, so I insulated and wrapped
it up as well).&nbsp; A &quot;Brown/White&quot; wire that connects to the Timing
Retard Control with a WeatherPack connector.&nbsp; A
&quot;Yellow/White&quot; wire that is used for a Stage Limit Input (like if you
were a drag racer and had a line lock or a transmission brake solenoid, you
connect it to set a certain &quot;rev&quot; limit it can be a single stage
limiter by itself, or a duel stage if you already have one, just wire it to a
positive switched 12 volt source).&nbsp;
Since I do not
use either of these, I insulated it and wrapped it up too.&nbsp; Last, but
not least,&nbsp; the &quot;Green&quot; wire that is used for the Tachometer, I
connected it to my AutoMeter Sport Comp tachometer with a supplied WeatherPack
connector.</font>

<p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Next
up was to check out the Timing Retard Control and connect it to the main
computer's harness.&nbsp; The &quot;Brown/White&quot; wire from the Timing Retard
Control went straight to a corresponding wire on the main computer and was
connected with a WeatherPack connector, as stated above.&nbsp; The
&quot;Black&quot; wire goes to chassis ground and I attached it to the same
screw and nut as the main computer ground.&nbsp; The &quot;Thin Red&quot; wire
goes to a positive when Ignition is on location.&nbsp; It went through the
firewall with the five wires off the main computer plug and was wired in with the
&quot;Thin Red&quot; wire from the main computer to the H.E.I. main power wire(
the one on the outside of the distributor that plugs in beside the Tachometer
wire).&nbsp; Now there is a &quot;Yellow&quot; wire that can be hooked up in 3
different ways, depending on your application.&nbsp; I wanted to use the Timing
Retard Controller as being active all the time, or what Crane calls
&quot;Continuous Retard&quot;,&nbsp; so I wired it straight to ground.&nbsp; The
other two options are to a &quot;Pressure Switch/ Relay&quot; (to activate it at a
certain boost pressure if you ran a turbo or a supercharger), or you can wrap it
up and connect the optional &quot;Map Sensor&quot; to a supplied three prong
WeatherPack connector to use as a boost proportional retard (for every p.s.i. of
boost, the retard control will automatically retard the ignition the same
amount&nbsp; up to 20 degrees depending on how far you have it turned).&nbsp;
Since I do not have any use for the &quot;Map Sensor&quot; either, I insulated
and wrapped up these wires as well.

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">After
these were connected and routed inside the dash, it was time to get the six wires
left over into the engine compartment.&nbsp; I found a plug in the fire wall
that was right below my oil pressure line.&nbsp; I removed the plug and used a
small rat tail file to enlarge the hole a bit.&nbsp; Then I took a rubber
grommet and placed it into the hole to protect the wires from cuts and grounding
out on the chassis.&nbsp; A good tip for fishing wires through the fire wall is
to tape them tightly together in a nice straight group.&nbsp; You can also taper them
if you like, tape each wire about 2 to 3 inches behind the next so that you kind
of get a wedge shape, making it much easier to pull through the grommet.&nbsp; I also lubed up the wires with Windex to make them slide through
easier, it evaporates and does not remain slippery or sticky.

<p>
<font face="Arial" size="3">Once
inside the engine compartment, the &quot;Thin Red&quot; wires from both the main
computer and the Timing Retard Control were put together and connected to the
factory H.E.I. main power wire.&nbsp; The other four&nbsp; wires go to the
distributor.&nbsp; You also have to make a short ground wire that goes from the
H.E.I. coil ground to the inside of the distributor.&nbsp; (More on this in just
a few lines).&nbsp;&nbsp; First thing I had to do was remove the Distributor cap
and all the wires attached to it ( the power and ignition module wires).&nbsp; If your spark plug wires are long enough (mine were, thank god!) you
can leave them attached and just move the cap out of the way.&nbsp; Since I had
the Crane H.E.I. PS-91 in the cap coil, I changed it out at this time as
well.&nbsp; The stock coil was coroded and in need of replacement
anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled the cap off the coil by removing the two screws that
held it down and then removed the old coil by removing the four screw that held
it in place.&nbsp; Installation is in the reverse order, (they include directions if you
can't remember which wire went where after you get it out), nothing to it.</font><p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Next
I removed the stock ignition module and cleaned out the distributor.&nbsp; Once
the stock module is out you can hook up the rest of the wires and your almost
ready to fire it
off.&nbsp; First of all I had to make a short ground wire to go from the outside of
the distributor cap, it and the &quot;Black&quot; and the &quot;Orange&quot;
wire that are inside the black plastic tube are hooked up to where the outside
plug of the stock ignition module went.&nbsp; The &quot;Orange&quot; wire goes
to the positive coil prong, the &quot;Short Black Ground&quot; wire goes to the
middle ground prong then into the distributor and grounds to the stock grounding
screw inside the distributor.&nbsp; The &quot;Black&quot; wire in the tube with the &quot;Orange&quot;
wire goes to the negative coil prong.&nbsp; Now that these are hooked up, you
take the &quot;Short Black Jumper Wire&quot; and the &quot;Violet&quot; and
&quot;Green&quot; wires and run them through a small rubber grommet into the
distributor.&nbsp; The &quot;Short Black Ground&quot; wire goes to the stock ground
screw as already stated, the &quot;Violet&quot; wire goes to the
&quot;White&quot; wire on the magnetic pickup plug.&nbsp; The &quot;Green&quot;
wire goes to the &quot;Green&quot; wire on the magnetic pickup plug.&nbsp; Then
you take some small plastic wire clamps and, using the stock ignition module
screws, attach the wires to the distributor so they will not interfere with
distributor function.&nbsp; Next, double check all your wires to
make sure they are connected properly and that they will not get caught in any
moving parts.&nbsp; Put the distributor cap back on
and fire off the engine.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Once
  everything is running properly,&nbsp; you can shut down the engine and set the
  Rev-Limiter switches.&nbsp; There are two rotary dials that you turn to set the
  rev-limit at your desired level, any where from 600 r.p.m.'s up to 9900 r.p.m.'s
  at 100 r.p.m. increments.&nbsp; The dials are located on the end of the computer
  where the wiring harness comes out.&nbsp; The one closest to the harness does
  the 1000 r.p.m.'s and the next one does 100 r.p.m.'s.&nbsp; For example, if you
  set the first dial at three and the second dial at two you would have a 3200
  r.p.m. rev limit.&nbsp; Since I have an older motor and I do not rev it too
  much, I set my limiter at 4600 r.p.m.'s.&nbsp; The Rev-Limiter is a digital
  sequential rev-limiter.&nbsp; If you over rev the engine and reach the
  rev-limiter, the cylinders are then fired in an equal rotation to prevent plug
  fouling and minimize harmonics and vibration until the r.p.m.'s fall below the
  rev-limit.&nbsp; The computer also has some on-board diagnostic features so that
  you can test for problems if you have any.&nbsp; A l.e.d. blinks a code and there is a
  list to refer to in the instruction manual.&nbsp; It also has a Tach Test
  feature that allows you to test your tachometer before you crank the engine to
  make sure it is compatible with the computer. If it's not,&nbsp; the instruction manual
lists the reasons why it may not work and remedies for them.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I
  was very impressed with the products I received and I can now tell a &quot;seat
  of the pants&quot; difference in the power of the engine.&nbsp; It is by no
  means an astronomical difference in horsepower, but it can be felt.&nbsp; The
  engine also starts much quicker, idles smoother and&nbsp; pulls much lower in the
  r.p.m.'s without the bucking you normally get if you try to make an engine pull
  at that low an r.p.m.&nbsp; It has made for much smoother wheeling with
less rock slippage because of being able to run at a lower r.p.m.&nbsp;</font>
