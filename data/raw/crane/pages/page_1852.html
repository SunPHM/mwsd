<h4>Up and Away! Ultralight-led <BR>whooping cranes start historic migration</h4>
<img border="1" width="163" height="343" align="right"src="/org/caer/ce/news/images/whooper3.jpg" ALT="Whooping crane at Necedah National Wildlife Refuge"><P>MADISON -- A small flock of eight young whooping cranes led by three ultralight aircraft lifted off from Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin shortly after dawn Wednesday, Oct. 17, flying the first leg of a planned 1,200 mile migration flight in an effort to restore migrating whooping cranes to eastern North America. </P>
<P>The young whooping cranes will be shown a route to wintering grounds at Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in Florida and are expected to return on their own in the spring of 2002. The migration team used sandhill cranes in 2000 to successfully prove that cranes could be shown a route and return on their own.</P>
<img border="1" width="469" height="206" align="center"src="/org/caer/ce/news/images/whooper2.jpg" ALT="Whooping crane at Necedah National Wildlife Refuge">
<P>&quot;We’ve waited for this day for two years,&quot; said Darrell Bazzell, Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. &quot;Only a few years ago, who would have believed that something like this could be accomplished? Yet here we are today, on the verge of reintroducing a species absent from Wisconsin for 123 years. I know I’m really looking forward to seeing these birds in the sky in years to come.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We started training ten birds last April.&quot; said Joe Duff, lead pilot, trainer and co-founder of Operation Migration Inc. &quot;The eight remaining in the study were selected for their overall suitability in terms of strength in flying and successfully following the aircraft. We are prepared for the possibility that not every bird will complete the full migration.&quot;</P>
<img border="1" width="97" height="97" align="left"src="/org/caer/ce/news/images/whooper.jpg" ALT="Whooping crane at Necedah National Wildlife Refuge"><P>In 1999, a coalition of State and Federal governments and the private sector formed the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership to coordinate and fund the 2000 sandhill crane and 2001 whooping crane studies. </P>
<P>Over 35 private landowners have volunteered their property as stopover sites for the cranes and migration team. A traveling overnight-pen keeps the cranes safe between daily flights. The migration is expected to take from five to seven weeks. Daily updates on progress can be found on the WCEP Website, <a href="http://www.bringbackthecranes.org">www.bringbackthecranes.org - Exit DNR</a>.</P>
<P>&quot;This project never would have gotten off the ground, literally, without the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership, the private landowners, corporations who’ve donated resources and the support of the public in the twenty-state project area.&quot; said Marshall Jones, Acting Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  &quot;It’s a real tribute to the difference that early collaboration and cooperation makes.&quot;</P>
<P>The Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership consists of: International Crane Foundation; National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin; Operation Migration, Inc; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; U.S.G.S. Patuxent Wildlife Research Center; Whooping Crane Recovery Team; and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources</P>

<h5>One whooping crane drops out of flight</h5>
<P>NECEDAH, Wis. -- A whooping crane that was part of an experiment that seeks to reintroduce a flock of migratory whooping cranes in the eastern US dropped out of flight formation soon after departure from the NNWR this morning.</P>
<P>
Eight whooping cranes trained during the summer to follow an ultra-light airplane lifted off at 7:15 a.m. central daylight time.  At approximately 7:30 a.m. reports came in over the radio that one of the birds had dropped off and landed a few miles south of the refuge.</P>

<P>A position was radioed to a ground crew, but when the crew arrived, they could not locate the bird or pick up signals from a transmitter the bird is wearing on its leg.  Later in the morning, a signal was heard and ground crews began to try and locate the bird.  But the bird continued to change locations through the day and had not been visually sighted as of 4 p.m.</P>
<P>
The remaining cranes successfully completed the 29-mile first leg of the migration route and will continue the migration flight on Thursday, Oct. 18.</P>

<P>For more migration updates call 1-612-713-5311 or visit the project web site.</P>
