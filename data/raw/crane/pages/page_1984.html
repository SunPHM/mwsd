<STRONG>Status:</strong> Federal Endangered, State Endangered
<p>
<STRONG>Description:</strong> The whooping crane is the largest wading bird in North America, standing 4-5 feet (1.5 m) tall. Its
    wingspan is 7.5 feet (2.3 m). The adult has a snow white body with contrasting black legs, black wing tips and
    black markings below the eyes. The top and sides of the adult's head lack feathers and are bright red. Immature
    birds have a white underside, white secondary feathers and black wingtips. Whoopers will occasionally extend their
    huge wings and jump a few feet into the air. It has a vibrant trumpetlike call from which it gets its name. It is easily
    distinguished from the smaller, gray sandhill crane.
<p>
<STRONG>Habitat and Habits:</strong> The whooping crane prefers freshwater marshes, wet prairies, shallow portions of rivers and
    reservoirs, grain and stubble fields, shallow lakes and lagoons for feeding and loafing during migration. Overnight
    roosting sites usually have shallow water in which whoopers stand. It will roost on unvegetated sandbars, wetlands
    and stockdams. The whooping crane is omnivorous, feeding on both animals and plants, such as insects (grasshoppers, crickets), berries, grains, acorns, fishes, crustaceans, reptiles and amphibians. Whooping cranes are
    usually found in small groups of seven or fewer individuals. They are easily disturbed when roosting or feeding.
<p>
<STRONG>Distribution:</strong> The whooping crane formerly nested from central Illinois west to eastern North Dakota and north
    through the Canadian prairie provinces. It presently breeds in Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It overwinters on the Texas Gulf Coast on and in the vicinity of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.
    A second foster population migrates from Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho to the Bosque del Apache
    National Wildlife Refuge on the Rio Grande River in New Mexico. In South Dakota, the whooping crane is a predictable spring and fall migrant in the Missouri River drainage and in westem South Dakota, with only occasional sightings in the eastem part of the state. This species
    does not breed in South Dakota. 
<p>
<STRONG>Conservation Measures:</strong> The whooping crane was
    listed as federally endangered in 1967. Early recovery
    efforts used the cross-fostering method with sandhill
    cranes as the foster parents. No foster birds have paired
    or produced eggs. Cross-fostering of whoopers to the
    Grays Lake sandhill crane flock has been discontinued
    because of very high mortality rates and the lack of
    reproductive success in cross-fostered populations.
 <p>   
    An alternative recovery method is the introduction of
    captive-reared birds specially conditioned for release in the wild. Although this method has been successful with
    non-migratory populations of sandhill cranes, a migratory flock has not yet been established.
<p>    
    Because of the dangers of long-distance migration, such as accidental and intentional shooting of birds and collisions with powerlines, a new whooping crane restoration effort involves the establishment of a non-migratory flock in Florida.
