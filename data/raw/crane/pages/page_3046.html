    river delta, and so is transected by several river branches.<br>

  <p>Minoru Hataguchi, the Director of the Hiroshima Memorial Peace Museum, took 
    me on a tour of the facility. We are photographed in the museum lobby before 
    the tour. A Berkeley coffee mug I presented to him is in&nbsp;his&nbsp;hand.

    <br>
    This tree was exposed to the atomic bombing. After the city was destroyed, 
    it was said that nothing would grow there for decades. When this tree began 
    to show signs of life after the blast, it gave great hope and inspiration 
    to&nbsp;the&nbsp;survivors.</font><br>

  <p>The Peace Arch in Hiroshima Peace Park behind the museum. the stone sarcophagus 
    inside the arch contains the names of all who fell to the atomic bombing. 
    Every August 6, new names are added as <i>hibakusha</i> (a-bomb victims) die 
    or new information is discovered identifying others who were killed at&nbsp;the&nbsp;time. 
    The Hiroshima peace flame and the Hiroshima dome, which can be seen through 
    the arch, were next stops on our visit.<br>

  </p>
  <p>I was honored to be guided through the Hiroshima peace park by Haruko Moritaki 
    (L, dark suit), whose father founded the <a href="http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/abom/99e/rondan/leeper.html">Global 
    Peacemakers Association</a>, a leading organization against nuclear weapons, 
    and friend. They also surprised me at the Shinkansen (high-speed train) station 
    at the end of my visit, bearing gifts&nbsp;of&nbsp;Hiroshima. The generosity 
    of my Japanese hosts was such that I was almost unable to pack everything 
    into my suitcases for the return to the U.S. -- and that's after emptying 
    an entire suitcase of gifts and materials I had brought to Japan.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990066" size="-1">Though 
    not visible in this photo, a peace flame burns at the center of this pond, 
    its base representing outstretched hands. The flame was lit by clerics of 
    many faiths, and will be extinguished when the last nuclear bomb is destroyed. 
    I told my hosts I would wish to be here for that event. Throughout the park 
    are various ponds and fountains, in remembrance of the cries for water from 
    severely irradiated victims in the first hours after the blast. At the time, 
    there was a rumor that giving the victims water would cause them to die, so 
    their cries went unheeded.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990066" size="-1">The bomb 
    exploded approximately 1900 feet directly above this spot, emitting heat greater 
    than 5,000&deg;F. The plaque stands against the wall of a new hospital that 
    replaced the one then standing there (seen as a rubble archway in the photograph). 
    The hospital director was out of town on the day of the blast. When he returned 
    he found no trace of the hospital patients or staff, including his brother, 
    also a doctor. His family still runs the rebuilt hospital at the &quot;hypocenter&quot; 
    of&nbsp;the&nbsp;atomic&nbsp;bombing.<br>

    Memorial to the Koreans who died in the atomic bombing. Many people were brought 
    to Japan as forced laborers before and during World War II. A number of them 
    were in Hiroshima at the time of the blast. The next morning I was to meet 
    one such Korean <i>hibakusha</i> and learn of his organization's outreach 
    to Korean a-bomb victims who have returned to&nbsp;their&nbsp;home&nbsp;country.<br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990066" size="-1">Standing 
    before the Hiroshima Dome, I felt a heightened sense of immediacy and reality 
    regarding the atomic bombing. The recently built hall was nearly directly 
    below the blast. Its chrome dome-roof was instantly vaporized by the heat, 
    allowing the wind to rush down into the building and blow out all the windows, 
    which relieved enough pressure to leave the structure mostly intact. Today, 
    Hiroshima engineers face challenges in keeping the&nbsp;fragile&nbsp;structure&nbsp;standing.</font><br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#990066" size="-1">My tour 
    guides in front of some of the hundreds of thousands of origami peace cranes 
    brought to the park by <a href="http://asterix.ednet.lsu.edu/%7Eedtech/webquest/sadako.htm">schoolchildren</a> 
    from Japan and throughout the world every year. Behind the white wall, construction 
    workers were at work on facilities for displaying the cranes. The cranes remember 
    the <a href="http://www.sadako.com/contents.html">story</a> of Sadako&nbsp;Sasaki, 
    a childhood a-bomb survivor, who died of leukemia in 1955.While hospitalized, 
    her closest friend reminded her of the Japanese legend that if she folded 
    a thousand paper cranes, the gods might grant her wish to be well again. With 
    hope and determination, Sadako began folding, but she did not survive long 
    enough to finish 1,000 cranes. Ever since, schoolchildren have folded groups 
    of 1,000 paper cranes to complete Sadako's quest and to symbolize their desire 
    for world peace. (I was <a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/sfreedkin/me-5.html">arrested</a> 
    with dozens of peace activists in blocking the entrance of a cruise-missile 
    engine-building plant in Michigan in 1985. After the rest of my group was 
    arrested, I held a string of peace cranes across the driveway. Not one missile 
    worker would drive through and break&nbsp;the&nbsp;string.)<br>
