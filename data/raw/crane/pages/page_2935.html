<P>It was Robert Marcellus, principal clarinetist with the
Cleveland Orchestra, and also with the Peninsula Music Festival
orchestra in Door County during the summer, who approached me one
day with an unusual request when I was working at the Ridges
Sanctuary at Baileys Harbor.

<P>&quot;Do you happen to know the whereabouts of some rather
thick robust scouring rushes?&quot;  Naturally my interest was
immediately aroused as I asked him why he was looking for these
unusual plants.  &quot;I use the individual dried sections as
miniature cylindrical sanding devices for shaping my clarinet
reeds.  The natural abrasives in these plants are as fine and
perfect for this job as any manufactured item.&quot;

<P>Fortunately I was aware of a small patch of tall scouring
rushes, also referred to as horsetails, and one two-foot-tall
plant was all he needed.  It was exactly the species he had hoped
we would find.

<P>A few weeks ago, having to go to the University of Wisconsin
at Green Bay, I decided to take my camera and get some
photographs of a large patch of tall scouring rushes growing
within ten feet of the highway in southern Door County that had
been attracting our attention for twenty or more years.  It is a
patch growing in the shade in sandy soil at the base of a wooded
hill where the plants apparently receive a constant seepage of
moisture.

<P>I decided to snip off two of the plants, among tens of
thousands, and take them home for further examination.  They are
around 32 inches long, have between 12 and 14 sections, each
averaging between two to three inches in length.  Having dried,
the sections are now extremely abrasive and will easily remove
surface material from one of my thumbnails.

<P>Here is what makes these scouring rushes so abrasive.  Rain
falls to the ground and, in doing so, absorbs carbon dioxide from
the air which in turn forms a weak solution of carbonic acid in
the raindrops.  Through the years this constant addition of acid
to the wet sandy soil, in which the scouring rushes grow, slowly
dissolves some of the sand which is primarily silicon dioxide or
quartz.

<P>This quartz in solution within the sandy soil is now taken up
by these plants and hardens in the outer cell walls into what can
be referred to as amorphous quartz that lacks definite form or
shape.  If one were to take an individual section of a tall
scouring rush and carefully suspend it by the end in a container
of acid overnight, by morning all that will remain will be the
delicate cylindrical form of the uncrystallized quartz, the very
fragile glass-like skeleton of the section.

<P>Scouring rushes belong to a plant group frequently referred to
as horsetails.  Its genus name, <I>Equisetum </I>(ek-wi-SEE-tum),
is derived from the Latin &quot;equus,&quot; meaning horse, and
&quot;seta,&quot; meaning bristle.  This is in allusion to some
of the species’ thin leaves which, when bunched together, do
resemble a small green horse’s tail.

<P>They are segmented and not related to true rushes, which
reproduce from seeds, and are extremely far removed from horses!
They do not have flowers, instead reproducing from spores as well
as from rhizomes situated on the roots.  Most people show
considerably less interest in plants that do not have flowers.
Unfortunately they are missing out on some fascinating and very
primitive plants.

<P>Modern horsetails date back to somewhat over 200 million years
ago.  Fossils of tree-sized horsetails indicate that they
flourished on Earth more than 400 million years ago.  There are
some excellent specimens of these fossils in the Third World
exhibit at the Milwaukee Public Museum.

<P>Imagine a great southern swampland containing hundreds of
square miles of wetlands, such as the great Okefenokee Swamp in
southern Georgia and northern Florida.  Tree-sized horsetails, as
tall as 40 to 50 feet, growing in such a swamp for hundreds of
years, triggered the development of extensive peat bogs.  These
in turn produced the vast coal-fields of today.

<P>Today’s horsetails, which are allies to the ferns and
clubmosses, also spore-producers, are rarely taller than three to
four feet.  Only about 25 species exist in the entire world,
making it an easy plant group to study.  Eleven species can be
found in Wisconsin.  The kind most people see and recognize is
the tall scouring rush, very likely the species that the Native
Americans, and later the pioneer women who learned from the
Indians, tied together into fist-sized bundles for use in
scouring their pots and pans blackened by the fires—hence the
name of scouring rush.

<P>The fact that the stems contain tiny raised ribs running from
top to bottom increases their effectiveness as scouring material.

<P>It is my guess that no plants indirectly, in the form of coal,
used by people date farther back into history than the
horsetails.
