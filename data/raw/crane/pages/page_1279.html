              a Double Edge East of I-35</h1>
            <h3>By Karen Matthews and Sarah Adams </h3>
            <br />
            <img src="images/webmural_sax.jpg" width="271" height="203" align="right" /> 
            <p>It&#8217;s evident from the orange construction signs and cranes 
              dotting the skyline: Austin is growing eastward. Gentrification 
              is in full swing in East Austin, and some of its biggest critics 
              and supporters live in the areas affected.</p>
            <p> &#8220;Used to be, you'd wake up the next morning and find something 
              built,&#8221; says Dr. Charles Urdy, a former City Council member 
              and college professor who grew up in East Austin. &#8220;Now [the 
              city] has gotten the people involved in the actual planning.</p>
            <p>But Urdy and others feel that even with increased community input, 
              gentrification is a double-edged sword. Two current Austin City 
              Council members who reside in and represent East Austin feel the 
              city faces a dilemma in the process. </p>
            <p>&#8220;Nobody was against revitalization [of East Austin], but 
              now we're just starting to see how detrimental it can become,&#8221; 
              Councilman Danny Thomas says. </p>
            <p>Several longtime residents were forced to sell their homes because 
              they couldn't afford the increased property taxes, he says. </p>
            <p>Property values in Central East Austin rose 137 percent between 
              1995 and 2002, compared with 132 percent for the entire city, according 
              to the Austin Revitalization Authority. </p>
            <p>&#8220;There are homes around East 12th selling for $200,000, and 
              they are surrounded by homes worth only $30,000 or $40,000,&#8221; 
              Thomas says. &#8220;How many new schools have been built in East 
              Austin recently? None. And that's the point.&#8221; </p>
            <p>The most recent U.S. census shows higher-income white and Hispanic 
              families moving into East Austin neighborhoods and displacing lower-income 
              Hispanics and African-Americans. </p>
            <p>Gene Burd, a UT journalism professor who has researched citizen 
              involvement in urban planning, calls gentrification elitist because 
              it brings in the &#8220;gentry&#8221; or upper class to spruce up 
              a neighborhood. In a reverse urban sprawl, middle-income housing 
              and businesses move back into areas populated by low-income housing 
              and mom-and-pop businesses. Advantages of gentrification, stemming 
              from more household spending and commercial businesses, include 
              a healthier economy andway of life. </p>
            <img src="images/eahusingmap.jpg" align="left" />
<p>Councilman Raul 
              Alvarez, also an East Austin resident, says he is part of a citywide 
              taskforce studying other American cities for examples of how to 
              managegentrification. </p>
            <p>&#8220;Smaller, more locally owned businesses are what the area 
              needs in order to survive. But I don't know if that's going to happen,&#8221; 
              Alvarez says. &#8220;There is an awareness of the issue but solutions 
              are hard to come by.&#8221; </p>
            <p>Most gentrification efforts are occurring around Central East Austin, 
              bordered by Cesar Chavez Street to the south, Martin Luther King, 
              Jr. Boulevard to the north, Interstate Highway 35 to the west and 
              Chicon Avenue to the east. The most visible improvements can be 
              seen around East 11th and East 12th streets, which used to be the 
              center of East Austin life, Urdy says. Schools, clubs, churches 
              and restaurants dotted the area around the two streets before it 
              succumbed to drugs and prostitution. </p>
            <p>&#8220;In the '60s, it started to decline,&#8221; Urdy says. &#8220;It 
              was a really big deterrent to anything positive happening there.&#8221; 
              But in its heyday, he says, &#8220;just about everything was around 
              there.&#8221; </p>
            <p>With nearly $5 million in federal loans, the city relocated overhead 
              wires underground, renovated bus stops and constructed new sidewalks. 
              Private funds also have helped restore several area buildings, enticing 
              a handful of new businesses. Maureen Mercado, project manager for 
              the Austin Revitalization Authority, says several local minority-owned 
              businesses such as Gene&#8217;s Po&#8217; Boys and Ben&#8217;s BBQ 
              are expanding, and others, like Shoehorn Graphics and Victory Grill, 
              are being renovated. </p>
            <p>Organizations like the Austin Revitalization Authority, a nonprofit 
              agency created nine years ago by the city, are working to facilitate 
              positive effects of gentrification while minimizing negative effects. 
              The first phase of the renovations around 11th and 12th streets 
              is expected to be completed by mid-2004, with 5,700 square feet 
              of retail and high-end office space, along with two dozen town homes 
              and loft-style apartments. Agency officials hope to eventually develop 
              more than 100,000 square feet of retail and commercial space. </p>
            <p>&#8220;There is clear evidence of homeowners and landlords alike 
              upgrading their residential properties,&#8221; Mercado says. &#8220;We 
              cannot speak for all of East Austin, but East 11th Street is a good 
              example of how getting development started can in turn create a 
              chain reaction of improvements.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Councilman Thomas says the East Austin improvements are overdue 
              but he, like many residents, believes these new plans carry a cost. 
            </p>
            <p> &#8220;As positive as we thought gentrification would be, it definitely 
              has its drawbacks. I'm praying the city didn't plan this just to 
              push people out of East Austin,&#8221; Thomas says. </p>
            <p>The revitalization authority acknowledges that it risks displacing 
              current residents and business owners. Urdy, chairman of the agency, 
              says it is working with citizens and businesses to keep property 
              prices down for the residents after rebuilding and to give temporary 
              or permanent housing to those affected by the construction while 
              their neighborhoods are rebuilt.</p>
            <p>A shift in housing is just one side of East Austin gentrification. 
              Historically, the area east of I-35 was zoned for industrial sites 
              as well as minority and low-income housing. Although the laws have 
              changed, residents east of I-35 still fight to remove factories 
              and other industrial buildings standing near schools and local neighborhoods. 
              Urdy says an earlier attempt by the city to rezone industrial areas 
              in East Austin resulted in a successful lawsuit filed by the companies 
              affected. </p>
            <p>Progress is being made, however. In late October, a council resolution 
              authored by Alvarez proposed to shut down the Holly Street Power 
              Plant two years early, in 2007, after years of pollution and noise 
              complaints by nearby residents.</p>
            <p>The pressure for the nature of East Austin to change comes from 
              current residents, the government and incoming residents, but space 
              issues in a rapidly expanding city also play an important role, 
              says professor Burd. </p>
            <p>&#8220;The whole downtown scene is being gobbled up,&#8221; Burd 
              says. &#8220;The land in that market is becoming more attainable 
              to non-residents.&#8221;</p>
            <p>He adds that Austin's geographical development makes the east the 
              easiest part to build on as the city grows. Downtown, already cluttered 
              with concrete and granite, is growing upward with an outbreak of 
              high-rise offices and lofts. The South and North are established 
              neighborhoods with higher land prices, and the West remains somewhat 
              protected from further development because of environmentally sensitive 
              zoning for the Edwards Aquifer and Barton Creek Watershed. </p>
            <p>&#8220;So we're left with the East,&#8221; Burd says. </p>
            <p>There&#8217;s no question that the city is evolving with time, 
              but Urdy, Thomas and Alvarez hope that benefits of gentrification 
              could outweigh the disadvantages, particularly for lesser-known 
              neighborhoods in East Austin. </p>
            <p>Alvarez says the time to deal with these issues is now.</p>
            <p>&#8220;If we wait three to five years to deal with this issue, 
              we're going to have some serious impact on folks in this area,&#8221; 
              he says.</p>
