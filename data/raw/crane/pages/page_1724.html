We toured Beijing, including Tiananman square and the Great Wall. Then on to Shanghai and Souzhou the silk center; then a Yangtze River cruise which included the Three Gorges Dam and the lesser Gorges. On we went to Xian to see the Terra Cotta Army, then to Guilin, to cruise in a Chinese landscape and, finally, to Hong Kong to shop.</p><br><h5><u>Impressions of the major Cities we visited.</u></h5> <h5>"Beijing"</h5><u>Exchange rate</u>, 8.2Yuan=$1.<br><u>Weather</u> first day, Smoggy, sunny, hot (80's F) not humid. Second day drizzly, cool.<br><u>Accommodations</u> at the four-star Jing Guang New World Hotel (off the Third Ring road)were equivalent to US three-star hotels.<br><u>Shopping</u>, prices for Pearls at the Hongqiao Market were better than in Hong Kong.<br><u>Taxicabs</u> are very reasonable (<i>make sure they put their meter on</i>). The price is 10 Y for the first 10 Km and 1.2 or 1.6 Y per Km thereafter.<p>This city's focus is the central government of China much like Washington DC is for the US. There are three concentric ring roads that surround the ancient and modern central government of China. At the center is the dramatic Forbidden City occupying several hundreds of acres of land. This is the site from which the emperors governed China. Tiananmen Square facing the entrance to the Forbidden City is the focal point for demonstrations by groups regarding issues. </p><p>The most recent dramatic historical series of demonstrations (and subsequent massacre) was the student led prodemocracy movement. (For an excellent insight regarding the prodemocracy movement and modern China read Orville Schell's book, <i><u>Mandate of Heaven</u></i>). Recently, the Falun Gong ongoing demonstrations have been in the news. Apparently there were some kind of demonstrations occurring when we were in Beijing. Our guides changed the scheduled times of our tour of the square to spare us seeing any demonstrations.</p>Tour of Hutong (alley) district gave us our first insight into the relationship between architecture of homes and eras of China's modernization programs.<h5>"Shanghai"</h5><u>Weather</u> Smoggy, sunny, hot (80's F) not humid.<br> <u>Accommodations</u> at the four-star Shanghai Hilton Hotel were equivalent to US four-star hotels.<br><u>Shopping</u>,Friendship department store and shops along Nanjing Road Mall were modern<br><p>This is a bustling commercial city much like New York City. Here the architecture of the housing reflects the history of this City. The buildings along the Bund, the former European commercial "concession", has European style '20s architecture. Modern multistory glass office buildings in downtown Shanghai and across the Huangpu river are replacing the Bund area as the new commercial center of Shanghai. The old Shanghai two story buildings with small shops and narrow streets can be found just off the main streets.</p>Nanjing Road Mall is the showcase area of the new Shanghai. This is a pedestrian mall starting at Renmin Park and continuing almost to the Bund. Renmin Park, once called, I believe, People's Park is a showcase. The centerpiece is the newly built, modern Shanghai Museum (outstanding exhibit of Chinese ceramics development). A very modern Opera House and legislature building face the park. Shops along the mall include such upscale Western shops as Esprit (and MacDonalds). A huge outdoor promotion for Ericsson cellphones drew a large crowd.<p>Evidence that China is in the midst of a recession nowadays is the lack of any activity on the many cranes on the wharf and around buildings in the midst of construction. Areas around newly constructed buildings appear empty of pedestrian or of auto traffic.</p><img src="lifarm.gif" width="256" height="384" alt="" border="2" align="right"><br><h5>INSIGHTS</h5><p>These picturesque sites were all well worth seeing but the real surprise was to see not one but at least two Chinas. The new China is a bustling, car and bus clogged, smoggy country bristling with modern glass buildings, newly built and clean roadways and people stylishly dressed in an eclectic range of tastes. The old China is a bicycle dominated city with narrow alleys, people monotonously dressed in Mao outfits,and drab, soot covered buildings.</p>Modern multi storied glass and steel hotels and offices dominate older, decaying four story structures. In the outskirts of the cities multi storied apartment complexes with central air conditioning were rising amid the four story, six story and multi story older apartment complexes. <p>Each era of China's economic development is reflected in the height and architecture of the apartment buildings. We are seeing China in what Orville Schell, in his book, <i><u>Mandate of Heaven</u></i> refers to as the <i>fourth wave</i>. Deng Xiaoping instituted economic liberalization reforms in 1978 after Mao's Cultural Revolution failed. These reforms have essentially turned Marxism on its head by re instituting private property. According to Orville Schell, the <i>first wave</i> began in the late '70s when six story buildings with elevators were replacing the decaying older four- and five-story buildings and consumers <i>...snapped up electric sewing machines, tape cassette players, and black and white TVs.</i> The <i>second wave</i> came in the mid eighties <i>...as urban families moving into six story (elevator) buildings made a run on color TVs, VCRs, refrigerators and washing machines.</i><p>After the 1989 Tiananmen Square prodemocracy crackdown Deng Xiaoping was anxious to institute economic liberalization to counteract his political crackdown. Deng's model for China is NOT the US democratically controlled market model but, rather, Singapore's politically repressive, economically free market model. By instituting economic liberalization (<i>bread and circuses</i>) the Chinese Communist Party believes it can retain its authoritarian political power.</p> The <i>third wave</i> was initiated by Deng in the early nineties after Tiananmen Square. During the <i>third wave</i> modern multistory apartment complexes were built on the outskirts of cities <i>...with [room] air conditioners, telephones and pianos.</i></p><p>In the current <i>fourth wave</i>, modern multistory apartment complexes are being built with central(?) heating and air conditioning. People with private cars and cell phones are observed. One day, on fashionable Nanjing Road in Shanghai, we saw a huge crowd of people milling around some happening. It was for an Ericsson cell phone promotion. </p><p>The oldest, one story buildings predate the modern era. They are built around a central courtyard which we saw in our tour of the Hutong (alley) district of Beijing. The architectural style dates from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. After WWII and after Mao came to power four and five story apartment buildings were built. These walkup buildings do not have central heating and have communal bathrooms. For heating and cooking coal burning braziers are used which contributes to the smog hanging over many cities. The buildings were drab colored possibly from the soot from coal burning. </p><p>Our tour in the Hutong included a visit to the home of the local district chairperson. The home, consists of a single bedroom and a living/dining room/kitchen frig/sink, neatly maintained. A kitchen stove was in a separate building in the courtyard. A communal bathroom was on another part of the street. the residents were a retired couple who raised two children in this space. Though the older, retired people, who raised their children in the Hutong, prefer to remain there, their children, part of the <i>fourth wave</i>, prefer the larger space and modern amenities (elevators, central heating/air conditioning, private bathrooms) offered in the newer apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city.</p><p>This <i>fourth wave</i> appears to be in the midst of an economic recession. There was an absence of building activity in many of the new commercial and apartment complexes and even completed buildings appeared empty of people. Further evidence was very little freighter or freighter loading activity evident along Shanghai's key river, the Huangpu River.</p><p>We were taken to visit a model elementary school at the beginning of our tour in Beijing and a privately sponsored arts school at the end of our tour in Guilin. </p><p>China's one-child per family policy seems to be very effective. We saw families with few children. The reason this policy is so effective is that when a person has a second child certain dire consequences result. First, the parents lose their government job. second, the child receives no internal passport document. The result is that the child is not eligible for government medical care or for public education.</p><p>The children we saw in these schools were a delight. Many were eager to demonstrate their English speaking skills on us. Some were wearing red bandanas. when we inquired, we discovered this was the symbol they wore to indicate they were proud members of the Communist Youth Party. At first we thought of this as the Chinese equivalent of the American Boy Scouts but on further inquiry we learned this is far more political.</p><p>Less than five percent of Chinese are members of the Communist Party, we learned. At first we concluded, from our American perspective, that this meant the Communist Party was a dismissable minority. After all, in America, with so little popular support such a party would be nothing. What we learned was that becoming a member of the Communist Party was not a matter of simply signing up, as we do in America. On the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party is very careful about confirming the loyalty of a person before acceptance into the party. Only after you are a member of the Communist Party are you eligible for the plum jobs.</p><p>Ruth questioned one of our guides for the Lesser Gorges about her life. She told Ruth that her husband worked for the municipality and she proudly stated that he was a member of the Communist Party. The guide was asked whether she, too, was a member of the CP? She indicated that she was not yet a member but that she hoped she would soon become one. Was not her husband's say sufficient to qualify her to become a member of the CP? No, she said. She needed to be sponsored by two other CP members in addition to her husband. Then she must wait until it is her turn. It is then we realized the CP is a carefully controlled and carefully limited exclusive <i>fraternity</i>. It is the path one needs to follow to enhance one's career and to get access to economic prosperity.</p></body></html>
