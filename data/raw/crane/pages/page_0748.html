  <p align="justify">The Crane are the &quot;Left Hand of the Emperor,&quot; and 
    provide the art, music, and wealth which makes the Emperor's court shine. 
    Every Emperor since the first Hantei has chosen a bride from the Crane Clan, 
    and thus, every Emperor after the first has called a Crane &quot;Mother.&quot; 
    Also, every Emperor has attended the legendary Crane fencing school -- the 
    Kakita School, the most prestigious in the Empire, its students legendary 
    for their prowess and courage. However, the Crane are seen by the other Clans 
    a posers and sycophants hiding behind the protection of the Emperor. The Lion 
    are their especial bitter enemies, a quarrel which dates back to the very 
    founding of the Empire.</p>
  <p align="justify">The two dominant families of the Crane Clan are the Doji 
    and the Kakita, who are both descended from the marriage of the Clan founder, 
    Lady Doji, and her mortal champion Kakita. The Doji, masters of courtly intrigue, 
    rule the clan, but the Kakita are the keepers of the Clan's famous school 
    of swordsmanship, as well as brilliant artists and performers. The last Crane 
    Clan Champion, Doji Satsume, was also the Emerald Champion. Sadly, he perished 
    in the earthquake which smote the Imperial capital, Otosan Uchi, a year ago. 
    His position as Clan Champion has since been filled by his son Doji Hoturi. 
    Hoturi was a notorious womanizer in his younger years, but he seems to have 
    settled down since marrying the splendid artisan Doji Ameiko. </p>
  <p align="justify">The Kakita family daimyo, Imperial Chancellor Kakita Yoshi, 
    also perished in the same earthquake. His place has been taken by his young 
    son, Kakita Kaiten, a promising duelist. The most famous Kakita in the land, 
    however, is Kakita Toshimoko, the &quot;Gray Crane,&quot; the sensei (master) 
    of the famed Kakita Dueling School.</p>
  <p align="justify">The Asahina are the Crane shugenja family. Their magical 
    knowledge was inherited from the Phoenix clan through marriage, making them 
    powerful indeed, but they follow a very peaceful philosophy, even more so 
    than the Phoenix. Their current daimyo is Asahina Tamako, a man of great wisdom 
    but faltering health.</p>
  <p align="justify">The Daidoji family are the soldiers and bodyguards of the 
    clan, and protect the other families when war threatens. They are also skilled 
    in the ways of merchants, and compete fiercely with the Yasuki. The current 
    Daidoji daimyo is the swarthy young Daidoji Uji.</p>
  <p align="justify">Currently, the Crane are at war with the Lion Clan, and suffering 
    heavy losses. Much of their territory has fallen beneath the iron tread of 
    the Lion armies, and their courtiers are working harder than ever to call 
    on the support of the Emperor, as well as seeking alliances with the other 
    Clans. </p>
