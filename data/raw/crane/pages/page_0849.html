      There was a little snow cover as we began the day getting the tower ready
      to stand up. First order of business, checking every bolt to make sure
      they were tight.

      Al fashioned these brackets to secure the pipe to. The four antenna bays
      will attach to this pipe. Notice how it extends several feet higher than
      the actual tower.

      <p>Here Al is hooking the top of the bottom section of the tower to the
      crane. To the left is a very bad picture of Rich Frischkorn. The crane
      operator is in the middle holding the remote control for the crane.

      As the crane holds the tower in place we had to get the legs to align with
      the anchor legs that are embedded into the concrete. It's a very tight fit
      and required the crane operator to make some very minute movements of how
      the tower was hanging.

      Lifting the top section into place was a little trickier because the crane
      was not tall enough to simply hook on at the top of the tower and hold it
      up over the top of the bottom section. We had to hook it as low on the
      tower section as possible and still be above the balance point so the
      bottom of the tower section would hang down naturally. This was the first
      try and as you can see the attach point needed to move up higher.

      &nbsp;Tim, a listener, volunteer, and friend of Al's, is the first to get
      to the top of the bottom section of tower. From there he will help guide
      the top part of the tower into place where they can be bolted together.

      <p>Here's a close up view of the aligning process. The legs from the top

      And for Tim, who climbed up the inside, this is what he was looking at.
      That's him, about 45 feet up.

    <td width="25%" align="center">When the antenna bays arrive they will have
      to attached to the pipe pictured earlier. A feedline, nearly 2 inches in
      diameter, will then be attached to the antenna bays and make the
      connection between the transmitter and the antenna. We'll also have to
      mount 2 receive antennas and the cable that connects them to the receiveer.
      <p>The transmitter is scheduled to arrive the first week of December. Al
      will be very busy hooking up all of the equipment getting the station
      ready for broadcasting. Pray that all goes well and for his safety.</p>
      <p>Pray also that the FCC approval arrives soon. We can't turn it on until
      we have that.</p>
      <p>Pray also for the remaining funds to come in that are needed to pay for
      this project.
