<hr>Mrs.McPherson's grade 4 class held a Japanese tea ceremony in their
classroom after reading the novel <i>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</i>
by Eleanor Coerr. We took the legs off of the tables so that we could sit
down as they would in Japan. Traditional mats called tatami replaced our
chairs. The tables were decorated with origami paper cranes, Japanese tea
cups and chop sticks.
<p>Ms. Tam made sushi, a traditional Japanese food. We also had crackers
that were in weird shapes, rice and sea weed. We enjoyed slurping green
tea and struggling with chop sticks which took a while to learn to use.
<p>The hardest part of our tea ceremony was that everyone had to eat without
talking. When the tea is served the server bows to his guests and pours
them a cup of tea. We enjoyed making loud slurping noises to indicate the
tea was good. We ended our meal eating a candy stick, a straight pretzel
with strawberry or a chocolate coating. As many students said, "It was
a really fun time!"

<p>Kelsi Jones is setting the Japanese table that has no legs. She is putting
the traditional paper cranes on the Japanese table. The Japanese like their
tables to be fancy and delicate. The Japanese people use chop sticks instead
of forks and knives. They eat different foods than Canadians and Americans,
such as sushi and tofu with rice at almost every meal. They also drink
lots of green tea.

<p>Ms. Tam came to show us how to make sushi. She showed us the food we
would need to make it. We were lucky that it doesn't need raw fish

<p>Ms. Tam came to are class to teach us how to make sushi. She put in
rice, sea weed, carrots and celery. It takes concentration to make this
special Japanese food!

<p>Two volunteers (Jodi and Holly) went and made sushi at the front of
the class. They made it with seaweed, rice, carrots, celery and crab. They
rolled it up using a bamboo mat. After they were done rolling up the sushi
they cut it up and ate it.

<p>We got to use chop sticks. It was hard to use them. You had to be able
to move the top stick to pick up the food.

<p>This is Robyn Watt sitting on a tatami mat. A tatami mat is a woven
mat that the Japanese people sat on in their houses. Our class made them
out of construction paper that we learned how to weave..

On the table are paper cranes. The first cranes we made were the biggest.
The second were the smallest and we did them just for fun. We did origami
to make our paper cranes. We put the paper cranes on the tables. Mr. McPherson
and his son Tavis came to show us how to make paper cranes. It was hard
to make the paper cranes the first time , but as we made them it became
easier. It was hard for some of the students and it was easier for others.
We needed to fold the paper carefully.

<p>Here are tables that our classmates sat at during our Japanese Tea Party.
The things that they sat on are called Tatami mats. Our classmates are
sure enjoying the tea party. The decorations on the table are paper cranes
that were made by our class. We all drank green tea from a tea pot and
it was very , very hot. The chopsticks were very confusing to use. Everyone
had a hard time. Ms.Tam was a great help to make sushi. The food tasted
delicious.

<p>This picture is about our Japanese tea party. We made Origami paper
cranes to decorate the table because Japanese people always decorate their
table. We sat on tatami mats. They are kind of like rugs which are used
to sit on. The food was great! We had seaweed, rice, shrimp crackers, rice
crackers and for dessert we had chocolate and strawberry sticks. We drank
green tea. We ate with chop sticks. We had a real fun time.
