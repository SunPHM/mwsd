		<span class="theTitle">Yay!  Comments work!!</span>
					<p><b>COMMENTS WORK!</b>  Much thanks to <a href="http://www.epolady.com/" target="_blank">epolady</a> over at the <a href="http://tidakada.com/board/index.php" target="_blank">b2 boardom forums</a> for all the help.  It is <i>much</i> appreciated.  To fix it, I had to reinstall the b2comments table through phpmyadmin, so all previous comments were lost.  <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />   *sigh*  I saved the table on my computer, so the comments are still there.  If I can ever find a way to reinstall the table without screwing up my comments up, I will.  If not - they all remain forever in my heart.  &lt;3  Corny, I know.  <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>Also - feeling better today.  I don&#8217;t know what was wrong with me last night.  After Jon went home, I suddenly felt very nauseous and hot, and my head began hurting a lot.  It was odd having all those feelings happening at once.  I swear, I slept like a rock last night.  But I felt much better this morning!  <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>I had the chance to talk to <a href="http://www.turtelina.net" target="_blank">Connie</a> on AIM today.  It was fun actually having the chance to chat, since most of our communication has been through comments and emails.  ^__^  I&#8217;ve actually been chatting with lots of cool people lately; its been fun.  <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>My sister &#038; I went to Aurora yesterday to buy lots of Asian food.  Mmmmmm, yummy.  We ate at a Korean restaurant and she got Dduk Bok Ee (<a href="http://kristy.peachsoda.com" target="_blank">Kristy&#8217;s</a> favorite!) and I ate some Kim Bbap.  Also got some more origami paper.  Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to finish off those 1000 cranes now.  Lately I&#8217;ve been working on turtles (which <a href="http://www.turtelina.net" target="_blank">Connie</a> would absolutely love, I&#8217;m sure!).</p>
	<p><img src="http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/images/jarkaruus.jpg" border="0" align="left"/>LOOKIE AT WHAT MY PARENTS BOUGHT ME TODAY!!!  Mmmmm, the new <a href="http://www.terrybrooks.net" target="_blank">Terry Brooks</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345435737/qid=1062379094/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/103-5931270-0475043" target="_blank">Jarka Ruus</a>.  Yay!  Is anybody else a Terry Brooks fan?  The only person I know of is <a href="http://www.dreamwinds.net" target="_blank">Amy</a>.  Anyways, can&#8217;t wait until I start to read it.  </p>
	<p>Almost convinced parents to buy me a laptop today (God, I&#8217;m spoiled) but it looks like it&#8217;s going to be more towards Christmas.  I still love my desktop compie very, very much, but&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to love when it&#8217;s 60 miles away from you.  Besides, I&#8217;ll need one if I study abroad in London next year, right?  Which reminds me&#8230; study abroad meeting Sept 18th!!  Must remember!!!</p>
	<p>Mmmm, just noticed how many plugs I&#8217;ve put into this post.  Might as well keep going, so here&#8217;s some more that I haven&#8217;t already plugged:  <a href="http://daverockstheuniverse.peachsoda.com" target="_blank">Dave</a> because he&#8217;s all the way in New York now, and probably having lots of fun.  <a href="http://www.drollery.com" target="_blank">Lele</a> because while she&#8217;s also in New York, she&#8217;s got a <i>great</i> &#8220;feminine&#8221; layout which I love.  <a href="http://www.turtelina.net/yummy/" target="_blank">Lan-Anh</a>, because she commented on my layout (^__^) and because she resides in London - where I want to be.  I&#8217;d plug more but I&#8217;ve gotta get some downloading done before I go back to the dorms tomorrow and won&#8217;t be &#8220;allowed&#8221; to download.  Crappie.</p>
	<p>[EDIT]Just realized that this is post #200.  Yay!

	<p>You could say I&#8217;m not feeling well right now.

					<p>*Ahem* Had a nice little scare last night with my MySQL database and b2 files.  Eek.  Thankfully, <a href="http://www.cyberpixels.com" target="_blank">CyberPixels</a> was able to restore it to an earlier date.  *phew*  So I only lost the one entry I wrote yesterday.  All it said was&#8230; <b>NEW LAYOUT</b>!!!!!  It still isn&#8217;t completed, as I still need to configure all the personal pages, which I won&#8217;t be able to do until I get back to the dorms and to my computer.  I came home from the weekend and will be working off my parent&#8217;s computer.  A big thanks to <a href="http://girl.daynah.net" target="_blank">Daynah</a> for letting me know what was wrong and for letting me know what to do, and to <a href="http://www.drollery.com" target="_blank">Lele</a> for letting me know things were messed up in the first place.  <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   Smilies/hacks will be reinstalled when I return, and I also *vow* to learn php/mysql so I don&#8217;t have to bug <a href="http://girl.daynah.net" target="_blank">more intelligent people</a> on the matter.  <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
	<p>Anyways, I don&#8217;t know how often I&#8217;ll be posting while I&#8217;m at home.  *Silently wishes I would have gotten a laptop instead*  I&#8217;m watching LOTR: The Two Towers tonight with my parents on DVD.  MUHAHAHA, oh how I have waited for this day!  >=)

		<span class="theTitle">Peachsoda&#8217;s first ever contest</span>
					<p>I had a brilliant idea earlier while folding an origami turtle.  I&#8217;ve been talking about getting another domain name for a long time, but due to my oh-so-uncreative mind, have been unable to think of the name.  <b>BUT!</b>  I have decided to open a sort of mini contest.  I will be taking submissions for ideas for domains names, and will pick the one I like best.  The winner, whose domain name I pick, will receive:</p>
	<p>- 20-25 MB webspace (more <i>if</i> needed)<br />
- Subdomain of your choice (http://you.winningidea.net)<br />
- POP3 email account(s)<br />
- FTP Account<br />
- PHP 4.3/php myadmin<br />
- MySQL 4.0 + unlimited databases<br />
- CGI bin</p>
	<p>Anyone interested may submit as many ideas as they wish.  The more ideas you have, the better chances of you winning are!  <b>Not interested in webspace?</b>  I&#8217;d also be willing to burn several CDs from anything on my <a href="playlist.php">playlist</a> and ship it free of charge to the winner.  Or if there is something else you want (reasonably priced) I&#8217;m sure we can discuss it.    <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif' alt=':mrgreen:' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
	<p>Seeing as I got 3 hours of sleep last night and I <i>really</i> need to go to bed, I won&#8217;t be putting up a submission form.  All submissions can be <a href="mailto:jiffiner@peachsoda.com">emailed</a> to me.  I will close this contest next Wednesday, September 3rd.  So submit people!  Jen wants a new domain name. :hyper: </p>
	<p>Also, to my hostees <a href="http://kristy.peachsoda.com" target="_blank">Kristy</a> &#038; <a href="http://daverockstheuniverse.peachsoda.com" target="_blank">Dave</a>&#8230; I&#8217;ve begun backing up the MySQL databases every week, just incase my site crashes again.  All your <a href="http://www.cafelog.com" target="_blank">b2</a> files run off the MySQL database, so your entries won&#8217;t be lost if the site crashes, as long as I have a backup.  If for any reason you guys need your files, just let me know.    <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif' alt=':mrgreen:' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
	<p>Have also been comtemplating on purchasing <a href="http://pure-essence.net/" target="_blank">Dodo&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://pure-essence.net/domain/themes2.php" target="_blank">theme script</a>.  I am just wondering how easy it is to install and configure.  I mean, if I already have <a href="http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/index.php?p=174&#038;more=1&#038;c=1">too many problems</a> with installing other scripts and hacks, will it be worth the money to purchase?  I&#8217;d really love to put some of my old layouts back online using this script, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m knowledgable enough to do it alone.   :scared: </p>
	<p>[EDIT]My <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/peachsoda03/" target="_blank">Live Journal</a> is up and running with much thanks to <a href="http://www.turtelina.net" target="_blank">Connie</a> for the code!  I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m going to make it a journal/photojournal about university life.  I&#8217;m sure my mom will enjoy that&#8230;    <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':smile:' class='wp-smiley' />

		<span class="theTitle">First day of school</span>
					<p>Well, today was my first day of class, and it wasn&#8217;t too bad considering I only had 1 class.  I was supposed to have Chemistry, but due to conflicts in my schedule, I didn&#8217;t have it this morning, but will go tomorrow.  Which reminds me of my reading/studying that I need to be doing.  <b>WHY DOES SUMMER HAVE TO BE OVER???</b></p>
	<p><img src="http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/images/csbuilding.jpg" border="0" align="left">Anyways, my Computer Science Freshman Seminar Recitation was today and was in a building off campus, so I had to trek my way there.  Found it okay though, which I was thankful for.  It&#8217;s actually closer to my dorm than it would have been had it been on the academic side of campus.  The class was interesting&#8230; around 25 students, 2 of which are girls, including me.  The other girl and I really hit it off though - we&#8217;re both really into photography and computers (obviously), and she&#8217;s really nice too.  My professor was totally awesome as well - he seems really into the student/teacher relationship, and doesn&#8217;t seem to mind undergrad students.  I&#8217;ve heard some horror stories about teachers absolutely hating undergrads but still having to teach them.  Hopefully I won&#8217;t get any of those.    <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif' alt=':neutral:' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
	<p>Things I also accomplished today: Got back into Chemistry, spoke to bitch lady about English, registered my bike, opened a bank account, took out loads of trash, ate lunch (yummy!  first real meal in awhile), and took a refreshing nap.  Now all I have to do is study for the Chem quiz tomorrow.   :confused:</p>
	<p>Also, have been surfing the net a lot lately, and there are several wonderful new layouts up!  Yet another one by the wonderfully talented <a href="http://gyrl.net" target="_blank">Gaile</a>, and an <i>amazing</i> one by <a href="http://h-y-p-h-e-n-s.net/fantasy/" target="_blank">Ling</a>.  Go check them out and tell them how much they rule the web.    <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=':wink:' class='wp-smiley' />

					<p>Oh God, I just had to post again before the nap.  Just checked my site stats, and apparently my site came up on AltaVista with the keyword search <a href="http://www.altavista.com/web/results?tlb=1&#038;kgs=0&#038;ienc=utf8&#038;q=ate%20a%20hot%20pepper%20stop%20the%20burn%20in%20my%20mouth" target="_blank">ate a hot pepper stop the burn in my mouth</a>.  WTF????</p>
	<p>But gosh, that kept me laughing for about 2 minutes straight.  Must.. stop laughing.   :laugh4:

					<p>Tiring first day of classes.  Big schedule mess.  Will write more about it tonight after I take a nap and get some dinner.  I need to revive my energy and brain.  And as my friend Sarah says, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to expand me brain.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Oh geeez, I just realized that my counter hits are nearing 2,000.  Should I do anything special?  I was planning on writing a poem to my 1,000th visitor.  But the 1,000th visitor ended up being&#8230; me.  Oops.  I was logging on to see if I had made it to 1,000 yet.  Damn.    <img src='http://thegirl.peachsoda.com/wp-images/smilies/icon_redface.gif' alt=':oops:' class='wp-smiley' />
