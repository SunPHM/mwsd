      <font size="-1">The RCBC Meeting of February 9, 2003 featured Josef San 
      Miguel, Curator of Birds for the <a href="http://www.sazoo-aq.org" target="_blank">San Antonio 
      Zoo</a>. Mr. San Miguel described some of the ambitious projects presently 
      being advanced by his department. The avian staff consists of 19 bird keepers, 
      2 supervisors, and the curator.</font> 
      <p><font size="-1">The bird collection at the San Antonio Zoo contains of 290-300 
        species including a number of Endangered Species such as the whooping 
        crane, Bali mynah, pink pigeon, Attwater&#8217;s prairie chicken, and 
        Guam rail. Mr. San Miguel used effective projected images of many birds 
        and the programs serving them to illustrate his verbal presentation of 
        work done with and for birds by zoo staff.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1"> For example, the zoo utilizes an extensive quarantine 
        program to insure that new additions are healthy and will not present 
        a health danger to the existing collection. There are two veterinarians 
        on staff at the zoo. Birds receive treatment for medical problems and 
        are preventively tested on a regular basis. Due to the favorable climate 
        in San Antonio, many of the birds are housed outside. This permits them 
        to enjoy spacious accomodations and a more natural environment but also 
        requires vigilance to prevent the spread of avian diseases.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1"> Mr. San Miguel described the vital role of zoos in preserving 
        a breeding population of many birds and other animals whose habitat is 
        being destroyed. Detailed records of bloodlines are maintained to insure 
        the greatest genetic diversity possible under captive conditions. An example 
        of the efforts to save a species is the cooperative program to salvage 
        the <a href="http://southwest.fws.gov/refuges/texas/apc.html" target="_blank">Attwater&#8217;s 
        prairie chicken</a> (link to Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife 
        Refuge). <br>
        A number of Texas zoos, The Texas Fish and Wildlife Department and other 
        public and private groups are coordinating their efforts on behalf of 
        this beautiful bird. Attwater&#8217;s prairie chickens are being bred, 
        raised, and released with the goal of re-creating a self-sustaining wild 
        population.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1"> <a href="http://www.sazoo-aq.org/02meet/02index.html" target="_blank"><img src="../images/whooper.jpg" alt="whooping crane" width="100" height="139" hspace="15" border="0" align="left"></a>The 
        program to breed and release <a href="http://www.sazoo-aq.org/02meet/02index.html" target="_blank">Whooping 
        Cranes</a> (link to San Antonio Zoo animal collection page) involves artificial 
        insemination in order to produce fertile eggs, incubation of these eggs, 
        and careful rearing of the chicks to prevent their becoming imprinted 
        on human caregivers. In the heat of the San Antonio summer, zookeepers 
        don &#8220;crane suits&#8221; and spend their days feeding the chicks 
        with puppets and teaching them how to behave like whooping cranes. The 
        babies never see people except when veterinary care is required, and that 
        interaction is always perceived as negative by the birds. The goal is 
        to prepare them for life in the wild with their own kind.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1"> <a href="http://www.sazoo-aq.org/01plan/01index.html" target="_blank"><img src="../images/LoryAdWeb.jpg" alt="Ad for San Antonio Zoo's Lory Landing" width="180" height="108" hspace="15" border="0" align="right"></a>In 
        addition to conservation efforts, the staff is dedicated to making birds 
        visible and accessible to its many visitors. Mr. San Miguel described 
        the popular and successful <a href="http://www.sazoo-aq.org/01plan/01index.html" target="_blank">Lory 
        Landing at the San Antonio Zoo</a> (link to San Antonio Zoo Attractions 
        Page). He is especially proud of having 10-12 species of lories with approximately 
        100 individual birds in this exhibit for visitors to interact with and 
        enjoy. The exhibit cost $178,000 and is a state-of-the-art facility&#8212;a 
        true showcase for San Antonio!</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">We are pleased that Mr. San Miguel shared his enthusiasm 
        and expertise with all of us. It was both enjoyable and extremely informative. 
        Thank you so much, Josef!</font></p>
