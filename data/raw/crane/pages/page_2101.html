<FONT SIZE =3> A whooping crane in Hall County boasts the earliest arrival ever in Central Nebraska and the second-earliest entrance in Nebraska history, crane experts said Tuesday.<P>

 Craig Davis of the Platte River Whooping Crane Habitat Maintenance Trust first spotted the endangered bird Sunday near Platte River Road south of Alda's Interstate 80 interchange.<P>

 The 5-foot-tall bird was visible to the naked eye Tuesday afternoon in a cornfield with sandhill cranes and snow geese just north of Platte River Road between Doniphan and Alda.<P>

 "It's awe-inspiring at times to think there are only 182 of them left," Davis said. "Every time you see one, it's an amazing sight."<P>

 He was referring to the number of whooping cranes that travel a 2,500-mile journey from their wintering site in Texas to their breeding territory in Canada. Other whooping cranes are in captivity, bringing the total to approximately 250 birds.<P>

 The white bird with black wingtips and red on its head is the tallest in North America and has a wingspan of approximately 7 feet. A whooping crane may weigh up to 16 pounds.<P>

 Davis saw his first whooping crane in 1989. This year's whooping crane may be the same bird that spent at least a month in Central Nebraska last spring, starting in early March. Bird experts can't be sure, because the crane is not banded.<P>

 "We don't have an idea where this bird winters. This bird's an adult," he said. "More than likely, it's not wintering with the other whooping cranes. It's staying with the sandhill cranes."<P>

 The whooping crane is spending time in the same area where last year's whooping crane was, making enthusiasts believe it's the same bird.<P>

 Whooping cranes usually migrate through Nebraska in April.<P>

 "The mild winter has caused the bird to migrate earlier than normal," Davis said.<P>

 Eric Volden, a naturalist with Crane Meadows Nature Center south of Alda, saw the whooping crane Tuesday. The bird's name (pronounced "hooping") comes from its call.<P>

 "It seems identical to the one we had last year," he said. "Just like people have differences in habit, this crane has decided to be different."<P>

 Presence of a whooping crane last year in Central Nebraska "did an awful lot for the whoopers. People travel thousands of miles to see this bird. This is one of the rarest birds in North America."<P>

 Volden suggested that people who want to view whooping cranes, sandhill cranes or other migrating birds stay in their vehicles. The birds are very visible from the road, and viewers should find a safe place to pull off.<P>

 "Don't try to walk out in a field," he said. "It's important to give them space."<P>

 The earliest Nebraska sighting of a whooping crane occurred near North Platte in January in the early 1990s, said Gary Lingle of Gibbon, an extension educator for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He is author of "Birding Crane River: Nebraska's Platte," a guidebook for viewing birds in Central Nebraska.<P>

 "This is really, really unusual," Lingle said Tuesday. "We do have a large number of sandhill cranes in the region for this time of the year. The geese and waterfowl are building up. The migration is certainly under way."<P>

 Other birds, including pelicans, American egrets and snow geese, are commonly mistaken for whooping cranes, Lingle said. Whooping cranes are the only large white birds with black wingtips that fly with their necks straight out and their legs trailing.<P>

 The Hall County whooping crane is "very likely the same one that was here last year. We can't prove it's the same bird, because it's not banded. In all probability, it could be around in March during the peak of crane migration."<P>
