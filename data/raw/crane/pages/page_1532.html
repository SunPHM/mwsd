<p align="center"><i>Stage III, the final work phase of Lock and Dam 26, involves 
  the construction of one and a half gatebays and an auxiliary lock. When the 
  entire project is finished next year, it will be the largest facility of kind 
  on the Mississippi River.</i></p>
<p align="left">Some time this June, the final yard of concrete will be poured 
  for one of the largest and most complex projects ever built for the U.S. Army 
  Corps of Engineers - Melvin Price Locks and Dam 26. The $950 million megastructure 
  is located on the Mississippi River just north of St. Louis. Mo. at Alton 111. 
  It replaces a 50-year-old Lock and Dam 26 facility a few miles upstream and 
  is designed to remove barge traffic bottlenecks along that stretch of the nation's 
  largest inland waterway system.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">Originally built to handle about 46 million tons of river traffic 
  a year, L&amp;D 26 must now deal with some 70 million tons of commercial traffic 
  annually. </p>
<p>The old L&amp;D 26, which is now being demolished, was unable to handle this 
  increased shipping demand satisfactorily. It had two locks both 110 ft. wide. 
  The main lock was 600 ft. long, and the auxiliary lock was 360 ft. long. Because 
  of their small size, barge tows had to be doublelocked; that is, be separated 
  and locked into sections and then reassembled. This caused an average delay 
  time of 17 hours.</p>
<p>The new and much larger L&amp;D 26 corrects that problem. It consists of two 
  locks, one 110 ft. by 1,200 ft. and the other 110 ft. by 600 ft. The locks are 
  separated by two of the low-level dam's nine spillway gates to allow simultaneous 
  two-way navigation. Moreover, the larger lock, which already is in operation, 
  permits 15 jumbo barges and a towboat to lock through, with a maximum lift of 
  24 ft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="placement%20of%20cooled%20concrete.jpg" width="333" height="230" alt="Chillers and conveyors"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Various systems have been used to deliver concrete to pour 
  sites. Here, an agitor truck feeds material to a series of conveyors leading 
  to the placement area.</i></p>
<h3>Herculean Project</h3>
<p>Construction of L&amp;D 26 has not been easy. Work began back in 1979 and has 
  been divided into three stages. The project's final completion date is set for 
  early next year.</p>
<p>The entire structure is built of concrete and lots of it. For example, the 
  base slab of the locks is up to 20 ft. thick. The lock walls are up to 60 ft. 
  high and 40 ft. thick.</p>
<p>In all, the project has required 800,000 yds. of concrete and 21 million pounds 
  of reinforcing steel. Delivering and placing this huge amount of yardage, often 
  under difficult conditions, presented tough challenges that had to be met in 
  a number of innovative ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="pumping%20of%20cooled%20concrete.jpg" width="269" height="302" alt="Concrete cooling required for pumping"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Pumping has been used extensively for the construction of 
  L&amp;D 26. Here a placing boom positioned atop a temporary coffer dam is supplied 
  concrete from a Schwing pump.</i></p>
<h3>Long Distance Belt</h3>
<p>One such solution took place during the Stage 11 work phase when a specially 
  engineered system of conveyors supplied by Morgan Manufacturing Co. moved more 
  than 300,000 yds. of concrete from a batch plant on shore to the middle of the 
  Mississippi River - a distance of over one half mile.</p>
<p>Concrete was carried from the plant to the riverbank on a 230-ft. long feeder 
  conveyor. The next leg of the journey was along an 885-ft. long conveyor across 
  half the river to the main lock location then under construction.</p>
<p>From there a 1,350-ft. long main line side discharge conveyor extending along 
  a temporary cofferdam carried the 3 in. aggregate mix to a link conveyor that 
  spanned more than 200 ft.</p>
<p>Next, a 236-ft. long side discharge placing conveyor suspended from rail-mounted 
  traveling towers placed the concrete in the average 12-ft. deep lock floor and 
  60 ft. high wall.</p>
<p>On a typical lock floor placement of 2,600 yd., the long distance, 20-in. wide 
  belt conveyor system delivered 230 to 240 yds. of concrete per hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  concrete for underwater seal pours of the guidewalls constructed during the 
  Stage II work phase.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>A total of 15 Manitowoc cranes have been used during Stage 
  III construction by Alberici-Eby, the joint venture contractor. One is the tower 
  placer rig equipped with a telescoping concrete conveyor.</i></p>
<h3>Underwater Pump Pours</h3>
<p>In another difficult concrete pour situation, also occurring during Stage 11 
  construction work, three Schwing pumps were stationed on the temporary cofferdam 
  to deliver shore-batched concrete.</p>
<p>Two of the pumps fed a pair of barge-mounted placing booms that were used to 
  help construct the upstream guidewall for the main lock. The third pump delivered 
  mix to a separate placing boom located within the lock chamber.</p>
<p>About half the concrete pumped to the floating placement booms consisted of 
  underwater seal pours for the guidewall foundation. That foundation is made 
  up of thrust locks, a series of 104 &quot;cans,&quot; actually 6 ft. diameter 
  steel casings that are driven into the riverbed and filled with 84 yds. of concrete.</p>
<p>As the tremie-placed concrete drifted to the edges of the cans to form a seal, 
  pumping continued by forcing &quot;concrete under concrete&quot; to build up 
  the subsurface section of the thrust locks.</p>
<p>The three Schwing pumps owned by Concrete Placement Service of Kansas City, 
  Mo. placed a total of 172,000 yd. of concrete during the project's Stage II 
  work period.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="cooled%20concrete%20for%20Ross%20plant.jpg" width="361" height="252" alt="Chillers and concrete cooling for Ross plant"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Concrete for Stage III work comes from the on-site Ross plant 
  equipped with two 10 yd. mixers. Agitor trucks haul the material to the pour 
  sites. </i></p>
<h3>Stage III Winding Down</h3>
<p>Stage 111, the final phase of work on L&amp;D 26, has involved the construction 
  of one and one-half gatebays of the dam and an auxiliary lock. Over a 3n-year 
  period, now nearing its end, this job will have absorbed more than 330,000 yds. 
  of concrete. </p>
<p>To make certain this enormous quantity would be produced and delivered when 
  needed, Alberici-Eby, the joint venture contractor, put up an on-site central 
  mix plant on the Illinois side of the river.<br>
  The Ross plant is equipped with two 10-yd. mixers and controlled by a computerized 
  Seltec batching system. The facility, since going into production back in October, 
  1989, has turned out an average of 1,600 yd. of concrete a week, according to 
  Troy Fabrizio, plant superintendent.</p>
<p> The entire plant operation is geared to meet and surpass the rigid job spec 
  requirements called for by the Corps of<br>
  Engineers. This strong emphasis on quality control is evidenced by a full-size 
  laboratory that is run by the Corps just a few steps from the concrete plant 
  and used to run four to six sample tests on every batch leaving the yard. Similarly 
  Alberici-Eby has installed elaborate systems to comply with Corps specs regarding 
  hot and cold weather concrete placement temperatures.</p>
<p> To chill the aggregates before they are mixed, the raw materials are taken 
  from vibrating feeder bins to a three-deck washing screen where they receive 
  a 2,000 gpm high-impact water spray. From there, the aggregates are moved to 
  the batching hoppers via a 48 in. wide and 150 ft. long enclosed conveyor and, 
  while enroute, receive a 2,000 gpm cold shower. A separate conveyor is used 
  to bring sand to the overhead storage bin.</p>
<p> To further control concrete placement temperatures, chilled water is used 
  to pre-cool the plant's open aggregate<br>
  stockpiles; chilled air is blown into the aggregate storage bins; and there 
  is a backup system for injecting liquid nitrogen into the two mixers.</p>
<p> The chilled water is produced on-site using a packaged cooling/heating unit 
  built by Coldcrete Inc. The skid-mounted unit is the size of a 40-ft. van trailer 
  and contains a 6.4 million btu centrifugal chiller, a 1.5 million btu Natco 
  marine boiler, two heat exchangers--one for aggregate and the other for water--five 
  pumps and all electrical controls.</p>
<p> The chiller is capable of cooling 2,800 gal. of water 6 deg. per minute and 
  150 gal. of batch water 16 deg. per minute. </p>
<p>Water supply is drawn from two insulated storage pits. One holds 350,000 gal. 
  for aggregate cooling, the other 100,000 gal. for batch mixing.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Operations room in the Alberici-Eby concrete plant is equipped

<h3>Novel Pour Method</h3>
<p>Concrete produced by the Ross plant is carried to the various pour locations 
  by a fleet of eight 10-yd. agitor trucks.</p>
<p>A total of 15 Manitowoc cranes have been used at the Stage III construction 
  site, a number of them for concrete placement purposes. One such is a model 
  4100 crane that has been redesigned into a &quot;tower placer.&quot;</p>
<p>Rated at 250 yph, the placer is equipped with a 153 ft. tower and 130 ft. boom. 
  Concrete deliveries are discharged into a feed hopper at ground level and elevated 
  by conveyor to the placer's boom. A telescoping conveyor of 120 ft. to 200 ft. 
  length extends from the boom to the pour location. All conveyors on the tower 
  placer are 24 in. wide.</p>
<p>Another Manitowoc crane, a model 4600 Ringer, has been mounted on a barge and 
  used to set 202 heavy precast beams which form the guidwall of L&amp;D 26's 
  auxiliary lock. The beams weigh 225 ton apiece and, coupled with 20 tons of 
  rigging, require the crane to lift a total load of 245 tons, said John B. Berra, 
  vice president of J.S. Alberici Construction Co. and Stage III project manager 
  for the joint venture.</p>
<p>Each beam is 53 ft. long, 7 ft. wide and 8 ft. deep. Embedded into each unit 
  is an 8 in. piece of steel armour plate to protect the guide wall from the impact 
  of errant barges as they move through the lock.</p>
<p>The beams were manufactured by Egypec, a joint venture of Egyptian Concrete 
  Co. of Salem, 111 and Prestressed Engineering Corp. of Algonquin, Ill. They 
  were cast at a temporary plant in Mt. Vernon, Ind. on property along the Ohio 
  River belonging to Babcock Wilcox. This site was selected to take advantage 
  of existing cranes with the capacity needed to handle the heavy units.</p>
<p>The beams were match cast in Hamilton Forms at a rate of three units a week. 
  Each section required 106 yd. of concrete produced by a Ross batch plant and 
  is reinforced with a 10-ton steel cage.</p>
<p>Delivered to the L&amp;D 26 project site in loads of six beams per barge, the 
  units are stacked four high by the Ringer on the upstream side of the guidewall 
  and six high on the downstream side.</p>

<h3>Stairway of Water</h3>
<p>L&amp;D 26 is one of a series of 29 locks and dams that have been built on 
  the upper Mississippi River. This stairway of water makes navigation possible 
  between Minneapolis, Minn. and St. Louis, Mo. The operation of L&amp;D 26 is 
  under the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers St. Louis District.</p>
