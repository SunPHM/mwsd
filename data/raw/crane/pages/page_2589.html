<p>The Sand Hill Crane is also known as the Grus Canadensis.
<br>The Sand Hill Cranes are usually found in open grass lands, meadows,
and
<br>marshy portions of lakes, ponds, and rivers.
<br>It eats roots, tubers, seeds, grain, berries, small vertebrates, and
small invertebrates.
<br>When they breed they fly from Northern Canada down to Cuba.
<br>Eggs hatch after 29-32 days. The babies are able to fly after 2 months.
<br>Although 2 eggs are laid it is uncommon for more than one chick to
survive adult hood.
<br>If the nest is lost the parents will re-nest.</center>
