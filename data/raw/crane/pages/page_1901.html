      <FONT SIZE="4"><B> </B></FONT>Last week, the group of 15 whoopers started 
      winging north at record speed. Sara Zimorski, who wintered with them at 
      Chassahowitzka NWR, reports: &quot;The group of 15 cranes has been stuck 
      in IN for the past several days--waiting for good migration weather, which 
      should be coming within the next few days. Here in Baraboo (WI), it's warming 
      up and the snow we got earlier this week is melting and will probably be 
      gone by the time our cranes make it back to WI. If the weather's good, it 
      might only take them another two days of flying to get here. After all, 
      they went from Florida to Indiana in just three days. It could take an extra 
      day or two for #14 to get back since she's a little farther behind (in Illinois).&quot; 
      What problems did the birds encounter? Which states have the 3 separate 
      &quot;paths&quot; traveled though? Which birds are now closest to home (Wisconsin), 
      where subadult yearlings #1, #2, and #6 are? Sara gives the latest daily 
      details here:<BR> <BR> <B>April 4, Day 4</B> <FONT COLOR="#AA0000"> <BR>

      The group of 15 whoopers (14 2002 chicks and subadult Crane #5-01) took 
      off from the flooded field in Jackson County, IN at 1025, but landed back 
      in the field at 1043. A cold front was moving into the area and the weather 
      was becoming unsettled, not good for migrating. The birds remained in the 
      field for the rest of the day and roosted there that night. Chick #9-02 
      was on her own migration path. Her exact roost location was not determined 
      on April 3, but by 8:30am on April 4 she was already flying and was detected 
      between Henry and Newton Counties, GA. She was found circling over lakes 
      in Dawson County, GA later in the day and then continued north. Unfortunately 
      the plane had to land due to bad weather so tracking was discontinued. Also 
      migrating alone, Crane #14-02 left her roost site in Carroll County, GA 
      at 1030, but encountered rain and landed in Jackson County, Alabama by 1:30.<BR> 
      <BR> <B>April 5, Day 5</B><BR>
      The group of 15 remained in Jackson County, IN. They spent the day in the 
      flooded field and also fed in nearby harvested cornfields. Crane #9-02 was 
      found on her roost site in Fannin County, GA at 1050. She circled over this 
      area for a while and moved a short distance north before landing and roosting 
      in Union County, GA. Crane #14-02 was found in flight east of her roost 
      site in Jackson County, Alabama a little after 11:00. She flew north and 
      crossed the TN state line around 2:00. At 6:53 she landed in a pond and 
      roosted in Bedford County, TN.<BR> <BR> <B>April 6, Day 6</B><BR>
      The group of 15 remained in Jackson County, IN where the sky was overcast 
      and the winds were out of the north. #9-02 was observed at her roost site 
      in Union County, GA (in the north GA mountains) at 8:40. She took flight 
      at 8:52 and headed northeast. Her signal was last heard at 12:50. #14-02 
      left her roost in Bedford County, TN, but the plane was not able to track 
      her due to rain and thunderstorms.<BR> <BR>

      The group of 15 remained in Jackson County, IN. At dusk a pair of sandhill 
      cranes showed up and the whoopers threatened and chased them, but the sandhills 
      stuck around and remained there to roost with the whooping cranes. #9-02 
      was not found. Lara searched for her from the plane in parts of Georgia, 
      North Carolina, and Tennessee, but never heard her signal. #14-02 was detected 
      in flight by the plane at 1:00 and landed to roost in Hopkins County, KY 
      at 6:28<BR> <BR> <B>April 8, Day 8</B><BR>
      The group of 15 remained in Jackson County, IN. The pair of sandhills showed 
      up again at dusk and were again chased by the whooping cranes. As the whoopers 
      settled down for the night the sandhills walked in and roosted with them 
      without getting chased off. #9-02 was not found. #14-02 left her roost site 
      at 9:45 and landed in Hardin County, Illinois at 2:30.<BR> <BR> <B>April 
      9, Day 9</B><BR>
      The group of 15 cranes remained in Jackson County, IN. The sky was overcast 
      and winds were 10-20 mph out of the north, unsuitable for migrating. Only 
      one of the sandhill cranes was in the area today and the whooping cranes 
      continued to harass the bird with threatening and chasing. Crane #9-02 was 
      not found, and weather conditions have prevented aerial searching for the 
      past few days. Crane #14-02 did not continue migration today. This is the 
      first day since she began migration on 1 April that she did not make a significant 
      flight. She remained in the pond/cornfield where she spent the previous 
      night in Hardin County, Illinois, for most of the day but moved to roost 
      at a site 1.5 miles north of the previous night's roost. A visual observation 
      of this location could not be made.<BR> <BR> <B>April 10, Day 10</B><BR>
      I just talked to Richard a short while ago, and the group of 15 cranes has 
      taken flight several times, but the flights have been short and local and 
      the birds have returned to the field. Once again the conditions are not 
      good for migrating; the sky is overcast, and the winds are out of the north. 
      However, the conditions are better elsewhere. Apparently #14-02 is flying 
      again today and being tracked by Colleen in the truck. The better weather 
      also means Lara and the pilot can fly again to try and locate #9-02.<BR> 
      <BR>
      Why doesn’t the map show a location for Crane #14 on April 6? Which bird(s) 
      do you think will reach Wisconsin first? Make a prediction!<BR> <BR> <HR>

        </table>
        <p>&quot;As of right now, we don't know where #9 is and we'll probably 
          have to wait till someone sees her or she shows up back here; or we 
          might get lucky and hear her while the other birds are being tracked. 
          Unfortunately, once a signal is lost it's hard to find again, because 
          there's lots of places a crane could be and it's hard to search all 
          of them, even from an airplane. The other problem with tracking #9 is 
          that she was last seen/heard in the Georgia mountains, which is a hard 
          area to track through. In areas like this the radio signal bounces off 
          the mountains and down in the valleys, additionally, the mountains and 
          trees can block the signal so it can't be heard. This makes it very 
          difficult to find and determine the direction of the signal, and it 
          can be quite confusing and frustrating for the trackers. So for now 
          we know where 16 of the 17 birds are, and we're glad the group of 15 
          is staying together. It would be much harder to keep track of them if 
          they had split up any further. Richard, Colleen, and Lara will keep 
          following the 16 birds, and of course will continue listening and looking 
          for #9.&quot; <BR>

      Jeff Bahls, whose photos you see here, gives this fun report on April 9: 
      &quot;I went back last evening to watch the cranes return to the roost. 
      I got there around 7PM, when only a hand full of cranes were there. I was 
      up to 88 when the landowner pulled up and we chatted for a while. She hadn't 
      seen the bird yet. As if on cue, #6 drops in at 7:45 PM. When he landed 
      he took a couple of drinks from the wetland. Then he proceeded to clear 
      &quot;his&quot; area. Anything within a step and a poke got it.&quot;<BR> 
      <BR> <HR> <A NAME="Shhhh"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Shhhh! Crane Caution, Please!</B></FONT><BR>
      The cranes have been stuck at their Indiana location for several days. Word 
      got out and sometimes 5-6 vehicles showed up on the county road by the cranes’ 
      wetland. That's not a great concern in itself, but it becomes a huge concern 
      when people get out of their cars to look, or take pictures or video. They're 
      excited about what they're seeing. They chat excitedly with the other onlookers. 
      THAT’s the problem: voices carry. As we wish for a glimpse of these magnificent 
      birds, Heather Ray reminds us: &quot;Remember these cranes have been costume-raised 
      and have never seen an un-costumed human, nor have they heard human voices. 
      They have a tentative hold on wildness and it is in their best interests 
      to fear and avoid anything &quot;human.&quot; People can best help this 
      reintroduction succeed by keeping the cranes wary and wild.

      <p>Dear Journey North:<BR>
        &quot;Oops! I actually found more whooping cranes at Aransas this week 
        (a total of 121) than I had last week (116). How could that be? Had the 
        cranes gotten tired of cold feet after encountering snow and ice in Nebraska 
        and retreated back to the warmth of Texas? Although ducks will sometimes 
        make a short reverse migration when encountering frozen conditions, I’ve 
        never heard of this happening with whooping cranes. They can tolerate 
        the cold very well.&quot; </p>
      <p>Why does Tom think he found more cranes this week? Tom says that normally 
        most pairs are gone by April 15, and all pairs by April 20. How are the 
        cranes still at Aransas going to catch up with those already in North 
        Dakota and get to the nesting grounds in time to lay eggs and raise young? 
        Why did so few cranes migrate in the past few days? Why does Tom expect 
        so many to leave this weekend? </p>

      The primary migration route through Nebraska is a narrow swath about 140 
      miles wide. Migration may take two to six weeks. Whooping cranes migrate 
      in the daytime and make regular stops for the night to feed and rest. Some 
      stopovers last only one night, others up to four weeks. Whooping cranes 
      migrate as individuals, pairs, family groups or small flocks of up to 11 
      birds. Parents and the young of the previous year separate upon departure 
      from Aransas NWR, while en route to the breeding grounds, or soon after 
      arrival on the breeding grounds. How many families have been seen migrating 
      in the sightings above?

      Whooping cranes migrate north to nest and raise young to take advantage 
      of the tremendous food resources in the northern marshes. Dragonfly larvae 
      are everywhere to feed to the young chicks, and the ponds are full of minnows 
      for Mom and Pop to eat. But there is a cost to pay for this summer visit 
      to the grocery store--namely migration. It's not just a five- minute trip 
      to the local store, but (for the Aransas/Wood Buffalo flock) a 2,400-mile 
      migration on a trip that can take as long as a month. The cranes work up 
      quite an appetite during this migration since they often fly 6-8 hours a 
      day. This doesn't leave much time for finding food. And the migration period 
      is when the cranes encounter the most danger. We think that between 60 and 
      80 % of all deaths of fledged whooping cranes occur during migration.<BR>

      Last time we asked you to look at satellite migration data for the first 
      24 hours and answer: &quot;How many miles did the group of 15 cranes cover 
      on their first day of migration?&quot;<BR> <FONT COLOR="#AA0000">&nbsp;</FONT><BR>
      Daphne is the GIS Specialist who makes all the Journey North migration maps. 
      She shares how she found the answer: &quot;I measured the distance between 
      Chassahowitzka and Lee County, GA using my GIS and WWW-based &quot;Distance 
      Calculator.&quot; (With the question, we provided a link for a lesson that 
      takes you to the WWW-based &quot;Distance Calculator.&quot; That URL was 
      http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/DistanceLatLong.html).<BR> <BR>
      Daphne continues: &quot;Using my GIS, I came up with 231 miles (371.75km). 
      Using the WWW-based &quot;Distance Calculator,&quot; I came up with 230 
      miles (370.15km). This calculator switches the latitude value a BIT, so 
      it's a little different, but the answers are quite close. I looked into 
      the actual location data in Lee County and still come up with 231 miles.&quot; 
      Thanks, Daphne! And WAY TO GO, cranes!<BR> <BR>
      NOTE: If you calculate the distance manually and use the distances you come 
      up with while looking at a map (process described in the Latitude, Longitude 
      and Distance Traveled lesson), you should be close to 230/235 miles, but 
      not exact. (Eyeballing on a map is never exact.)<BR> <BR> <HR> <A NAME="Birds"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Birds 
      on the Brain: Discussion of Challenge Question #9</B></FONT><BR>
      Last time we asked: &quot;Why do you think the whooping cranes in the new 
      Eastern flock are given numbers rather than names, like the manatees that 
      are tracked by Journey North?&quot; <BR> <BR>
      You know that these birds are part of a migration experiment, when losses 
      are not unexpected. Would giving them names make any losses even more poignant? 
      Maybe that’s part of the answer, but here’s more from our friend Rachel 
      at the International Crane Foundation. See how you feel about her explanation:
