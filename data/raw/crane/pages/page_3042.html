        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">These 
          photographs are being uploaded particularly so that the members of Plymouth 
          Church of Shaker Heights might see that I accomplished my agreed upon 
          mission, depositing a set of one thousand folded paper cranes at the 
          Children's Peace Memorial monument in Hiroshima on Saturday, October 
          19, 2002.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Behind 

          this act, of course. there lies a story worth the telling, actually 

          several related stories that, taken together, give reason for hope in 

          troubled times.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 

          skein of related stories begins with the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki 

          on August 9, 1945. Among those caught in the attack was a two-year-old 

          girl named Sadako. <img src="Sadako03.jpg" width="186" height="201" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6" alt="Sadako Sasaki (2002)">In 

          the years after the war Sadako initially seemed to have survived without 

          negative effects; then, despite being an active, athletic young woman, 

          she developed leukemia. While under treatment for her illness, one assumed 

          directly related to the perceived effects of atomic radiation, she began 

          folding <i>origami</i> (folded paper) cranes. Amassing a total of one 

          thousand such cranes was assumed to insure the granting of a wish -- 

          and Sadako desperately wanted to live. Unfortunately, despite reaching 

          her goal, she died at the age of sixteen.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><img src="CPMcranes01.jpg" alt="Childrens Peace Memorial, Hiroshima (2002)" width="195" height="341" hspace="6" vspace="12" align="right">Her 
          classmates and friends continued folding cranes in her honor, then dedicated 
          them as a prayer for peace. Eventually a Children's Peace Memorial using 
          a model of the folded paper crane as one of its central motifs was dedicated 
          in Hiroshima's Peace Park to the hundreds of child victims of the atomic 
          bomb as an eternal prayer for a peacful future world. <img src="CPMcranes04.jpg" alt="origami cranes, Hiroshima (2002)" width="200" height="133" hspace="6" vspace="6" align="left"></font></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Thereafter individuals 
          and groups from around the world began bringing their collections of 
          a thousand paper cranes to the monument as a concrete expression of 
          their own personal or collective prayers for peace.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Following 

          the events of September 11, 2001, in preparation for the upcoming holiday 

          season, this inspiring story was repeated to the children attending 

          services at Plymouth Church of Shaker Heights. They and some of the 

          adult members of the congregation then began folding cranes to be utilized 

          as sanctuary decorations for Christmas. A feature story appeared in 

          the local newspaper, and I stepped forward to indicate a willingness 

          -- if a full complement of a thousand cranes could be assembled before 

          October 2002 -- to bring the completed set with me to Japan and deposit 

          them at the Childrens Peace Memorial in Hiroshima. Which -- as the opening 

          paragraph indicates -- I did on October 19, 2002.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><img src="HelmaLew01.jpg" width="213" height="282" align="right" hspace="6" vspace="24" alt="Helma Lanyi and Lew Johnson, Hiroshima, (2002)">But 
          there's yet a third chapter to this saga. I was accompanied on my Hiroshima 
          sojourn by two participants in the Smithsonian Japan Journey tour for 
          which I was acting as Study Leader. Helma Lanyi was born in Berlin during 
          World War II and now lives in Washington, D.C. where she is (among other 
          things) actively involved in various Peace, Justice and Reconciliation 
          projects; Lew Johnson, a retired lawyer from the Seattle area, served 
          in the United States Army during that same conflict and was serving 
          in Europe when the use of the atomic bomb ended the Pacific conflict. 
          Having these two with me made the historical context of Sadako's original 
          story palpable and real, enlarging it as well to incorporate more than 
          just the conflict in the Pacific theater.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Lew 

          told me that one of the reasons he wanted to come along was that, at 

          the time, he was estatic that the use of the bomb had brought the war 

          to a final conclusion -- and that he would not have to run the risk 

          of being killed during what everyone assumed would be a bloody land 

          invasion of the Japanese home islands. Later that morning, after we 

          had deposted the cranes and worked our way through the exhibits at the 

          nearby Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum graphically detailing the impact 

          of that single weapon on the life of the entire city, Lew took me aside 

          and told me that, for the very first time, he had begun to ask hemself 

          if maybe, just maybe, had he lost his own life in exchange for the Bomb 

          NOT being used, the sacrifice might have been a worthy one.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">And 

          therein lies the conclusion of this tale of multiple threads. Just as 

          many contributed to the folding of the cranes now hanging near the Childrens 

          Peace Memorial in Hiroshima and just as that gesture emerged in turn 

          from the initial decision by Sadako's friends to honor her and later 

          all children killed by the atom bomb with a prayer for peace symbolized 

          by one thousand folded paper birds, so, too, passing strangers (once 

          enemies on oppostie sides of a worldwide conflict) were brought together 

          for a moment of dedication and inquiry that brought new understanding 

          to one for whom the Bomb's use had never been questioned. What a remarkable 

          confluence of possibilities and coincidences.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">How 

          fortunate I feel to have been a part of that chain of circumstance. 

          And, ultimately, how confident I am that in the end peace, indeed, will 

          prevail.</font></p>
