I come from Wuhan, which has been Pittsburgh's Chinese sister city for over two decades, based on the fact that they look exactly alike. Not only is Wuhan located on a triangular confluence of the Yangtze river and the Hanshui, but it also has a steely industrial past -- one that it hasn't yet cleaned up as successfully as Pittsburgh. More interest in Wuhan? Please see
