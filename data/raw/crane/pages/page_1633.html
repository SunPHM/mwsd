<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A
few of you that were in contact with us over the holidays realize we are in
Mobile, Alabama and at the end of our inland river voyage. This letter details
our final days on the rivers and tells of the transition from a surveyed,
constructed waterway [the Tenn-Tom] to a natural, winding river – the
TomBigbee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>We
last told of our harrowing departure from the Cochrane Rec Area amidst a flood
situation and storms surrounding us. We anchored once in the Fenache Creek and
then stopped in the Demopolis Yacht Basin, our first paid inhabitation in an
actual marina. I negotiated a dirt-cheap price for dockage [20<span
style='layout-grid-mode:line'>¢ a foot/day], that allowed us to enjoy
restrooms, showers and laundry facilities at the end of our dock. There was
also a TV room there – we haven’t watched that much TV since 1998, before the
Windigo refit!</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>We
didn’t experience any rain for our trip to, and stay in Demopolis. In fact, the
weather was exceptional yet again. Wet weather to the north kept the river
current running 4 or 5 knots, though, and water levels were very high.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
first evening in Demopolis we were treated to “Christmas on the River”, a
parade of <a href="floats%20that%20float.jpg">‘floating floats’</a> – many of
them animated! <a href="fireworks.MPG">Fireworks </a>accompanied the passing of
each lit display. Another treat was the discovery that there were pecan trees
EVERYWHERE, dropping their fruit around our feet. We gathered a <a
href="a%20bag%20of%20pecans.jpg">nice bag of these snacks</a> and scoffed at
the price of the store-bought variety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>A sad thing occurred in Demopolis; a crack was discovered
in my bike frame and required it to be sent off to England for repair. I have
been getting a lot of walking exercise since then, and at least the Moulton
makers stand behind their work and are fixing it under warranty. I was really
getting used to a lot of cycling from our anchorages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Demopolis
was a cool place, but we were anxious to move on, so we locked through the <a
href="Demopolis%20Lock%20and%20Dam.jpg">Demopolis Lock</a>, spent the night
anchored next to a bridge and locked through the <a
href="Coffeeville%20Lock%20and%20Dam.jpg">Coffeeville Lock</a> the next day.
This would be Windigo’s last lock on the inland river system. Now we are
directly connected to ocean tides and unchecked currents. We raced along with
currents we haven’t experienced since the Mississippi River. It seems that when
we went searching for bald eagles in the Land Between The Lakes in their mapped
&amp; posted habitat, we saw none. But the like the Illinois Waterway, Alabama
is <a href="alabama%20eagle.jpg">populated with eagles</a>, and we were close
enough to get a <a href="soaring%20alabama%20eagle.jpg">couple pictures</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>We
found an unusual mooring a mile up a channel, off the main river, that was used
many years ago for an old lock. Sure enough, we ventured far enough to discover
the <a href="spending%20the%20night%20in%20the%20old%20Lock%20#1.jpg">old lock
walls still intact</a>. With the flooded state of the river, we were able to
tie up right in the old lock structure. On of the local hunters there told us
the lock was dry in the summer, and that it might drain out while we were in
it! But with current measurements, and weather reports tracked, I figured we
could occupy it for the night. I was so curious, that in the morning we
ventured 3 more miles back into the channel. What I was curious about was to
see the alligators that live there! But alas, it is the cooler season for them,
and they hibernate most of the winter months here. What a photo for the website
that would have been!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>So
we moved down a few miles and anchored near Jackson, AL. <a
href="anchored%20@%20Jackson.jpg">This is NOT a normal cruisers stop</a>. Our
anchorage was adjacent to the public boat launch ramp &amp; next to a RR
trestle. A curve in the river allowed us to be out of the main navigation
channel near the shore. But with the big currents and rising water [it went up
twenty-some feet in less than three days] some of the barge tows would swing
right next to our boat! It was easy to pick out the ‘good’ tug captains from
the ‘rookie’ pilots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>While
we were locking up the dinghy on the second day, we met Tommy Hart &amp; Dr.
Gene Smith launching their fishing boat at the ramp. It turns out these fellows
don’t use rods &amp; hooks and they weren’t ‘fishing’ for supper. Their hobby
is hunting for historical remnants along the rivershore. Lots of civil war
refuse – bits of artillery and clothing &amp; such. But their main treasure is
ancient evidence of habitation from THOUSANDS of years ago. Tools, pottery,
religious symbols, etc. left by Indians from many eras. Very impressive
fossilized remains of plants and animals are sometimes found, including<a
href="a%20SHARK's%20tooth.jpg"> fossilized teeth (bigger than your hand!) from
prehistoric sharks</a> that occupied the seas flooding the area prior to the
ice ages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Tommy
&amp; Gene [and Tommy’s son-in-law John Gunn] are such successful
archeologists, that Tommy has erected a <a href="tommy%20hart's%20museum.jpg">small
museum</a> to house his collection. His favorite use of the museum is to invite
school groups to visit and explore the <a href="knives%20&amp;%20cutting%20tools.jpg">contents
of the museum</a>. The variety of the collection is staggering, raging from<a
href="arrowheads%20&amp;%20spear%20points.jpg"> hundreds of spearpoints and
arrowheads</a> to dozens of <a href="grinding%20&amp;%20hammering%20tools.jpg">grinding
and hammering tools</a>. All types of animal fossils and fossilized wood span
tens of thousands of years in age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Their
research has included archeological study at the university, and their
discoveries have enabled them to reconstruct ancient tools and weapons,
including the <a href="http://www.worldatlatl.org/index.htm">atlatl</a>, a
modified spear launched with a long lever to increase it’s range &amp;
velocity. John Gunn has in his collection <a href="john's%2012inch%20celts.jpg">three
greenstone “celts” </a>unprecedented in size and quality. These finely honed
religious stones measure nearly 12” in length, much larger than the usual
charms and icons carried and used by ancient tribes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Some
museum curators would deem these celts and a few of the perfect finely crafted
spearpoints in these private collections gathered by ‘amateur’ archeologists as
extremely valuable. What a treat to discover this treasure off the beaten path
of most sailors on the waterways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Not
only was this uncommon treat presented to us, but we were also invited to some
common but sorely missed holiday events in Jackson – we <a
href="christmas%20caroling2.jpg">participated in the Christmas</a> caroling <a
href="christmas%20caroling3.jpg">adventure of the Rockville Baptist Church</a>.
Then we were dragged kicking &amp; screaming to a potluck dinner at <a
href="tommy%20hart's%20place.jpg">Tommy &amp; Brenda’s house</a> where we were
forced to consume all manner of delicious foods. He constructed his home with
the assistance of a few friends from lumber cut from trees at the site. He also
worked the land around his house to provide <a href="tommy%20hart's%20pond.jpg">beautiful
landscaping</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Could
we stand anymore Southern Hospitality? Yes, later we were driven to a cemetery
where the patriarchal leader Ike Nettles created the gravestones early in this
century. This man made bust castings of family members and<a
href="ike%20nettles%20family%20gravestone2.jpg"> formed concrete gravestones</a>
for each of them from these castings. Very unique.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A
tour of<a href="gene%20&amp;%20emily's%20place2.jpg"> Gene &amp; Emily’s
homestead</a> was most intriguing. Having been in her family for 150 years,
this beautiful setting entrances visitors with its simplicity and tranquillity.
The location is so remote, when they moved there in 1988, they occupied the
house for several years with no electricity or indoor plumbing. A <a
href="waterboy.jpg">“Waterboy”</a> was used to bring 2 gallons of spring water
up to the house from a well 900’ down the ridge. A length of pipe tapped a <a
href="spring%20well%20box.jpg">wood box constructed around the artesian well</a>.
The bucket of the Waterboy was lowered down a tightly stretched wire to the
pipe where it filled with water. Reeling in the string attached to the bucket
pulled it up again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>We
didn’t want to leave Jackson, and neither did Windigo. We had laid out another
anchor to assure we didn’t repeat our Ashland City experience, and with the
rising river levels, swift currents and backwash from passing barge tows the
two anchors set so well, it took an hour to get ‘em up. Of course, during this
harrowing procedure we were passed by a large tow; and just downstream from us
at the ramp, a working barge decides THIS was the exact time to put ashore to
offload a crane. We managed to get outta there without losing any ground
tackle, smashing into another boat or wrecking Windigo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

href="tombigbee%20debris.jpg">littered with debri</a>s, some of it being entire
trees! These storms must be common as the erosion and subsequent damage was
evidenced by the <a href="riverfront%20home!.jpg">“riverfront homes”</a> we
observed. Is it a <a href="well%20placed%20tree.jpg">boathouse</a>, or a <a
href="new%20construction.jpg">houseboat</a>?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>The next day we anchored 10 miles above Mobile, readying
for our <a href="new%20mobile%20bridge.jpg">passage under</a> a <a
href="suspension%20bridge%20detail.jpg">brand new suspension bridge</a> and
through the <a href="one%20of%20several%20shipyards.jpg">shipyards</a>. That
was a huge change from our quiet months on the rivers! <a

and<a href="USGC%20ship.jpg"> types</a> <a href="navy%20ship.jpg">litter </a>the
shore; some <a href="cape%20florida%20&amp;%20cape%20flattery.jpg">new ones </a>are
<a href="cape%20florida%20&amp;%20cape%20flattery2.jpg">under construction.</a>
Several shipyards line the shores of the river with <a
href="shipyard%20cranes.jpg">cranes</a>, slips and drydock ships. These drydock
ships are larger than the seagoing vessels they hold. The <a
href="a%20friend%20indeed.jpg">large cargo ships</a> are steamed into the
drydock with it flooded, then the doors are closed and the <a
href="drydock%20ship.jpg">drydock ship is pumped out</a>, leaving the entire
bottom of the seagoing vessel exposed for maintenance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
shipyard area is at the <a href="mobile%20municipal%20building.jpg">city of
Mobile</a> and the <a href="downtown%20mobile.jpg">mouth of the Mobile River</a>,
which opens out into the 35-mile long, 10-mile wide <a href="mobile%20bay.jpg">Mobile
Bay</a>. Ten miles south of Mobile is the Dog River, which is the location of
most of the marinas in the Mobile Bay area. We were referred to the Grand
Mariner Marina in the Dog River, but to get into the river, we had to traverse
a narrow, shallow channel. Of course, it was low tide to boot. We touched
bottom twice, but one of those times we stayed ‘touched’ for almost an hour,
moving only 500 feet in that time. Eventually the rising tide, waves and
Windigo’s tiny diesel engine moved us into the river and up to the Grand
Mariner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
