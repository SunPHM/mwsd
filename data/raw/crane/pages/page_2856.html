Just north of our campsite, the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge promised unique sightings of carnivorous plants and  unlikely views of endangered Mississippi Sandhill Cranes. A gregarious guide at the visitor center pointed us in the best direction for Pitcher Plants and we started along the nature path, scouring the trailside vegetation and bactracking several times to make sure we hadn't missed one. We realized such scrutiny was ridiculous when hundreds of easily visible Pitcher Plants and their blooms cropped up at our feet several minutes into the walk. The Pitcher Plant, and other carnivorous plants, trap and digest insects in order to get nutrients that are unavailable from the soil.<p>
Enjoying the continued cool and cloudy weather, we returned to the coast for scenic driving through the gulf towns of Pass Christian and Gulfport. Pausing in Bay St. Louis for lunch, we toured historic downtown and its eclectic shops and restaurants.<p>

Entering our third state in as many days, we made our way to the lastest birders' mecca of Pearl River Wildlife Management Area in Louisiana. Thought to be extinct, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker made an alleged appearance on April 1, 2000. Dismissing the April Fool's Day coincidence, we followed directions to the best woodpecker habitat and prepared to launch our photography and birding careers with the first photo of the bird. Mosquitoes, thunder, and our own impatience allowed us only a fraction of the time we'd intended to stay. The closest we got to the legendary woodpecker was finding a tree with tell-tale signs of pecking.<p>

We settled into Fontainebleau State Park on the north side of Lake Pontchartrain, noticing with curiosity a small bridge that had been built on our campsite. Failing to take heed of the warnings given us by the bridge and the darkening skies, we set up our tent in the center of the site and went to sleep.<p><br>
