<title>Construction and Deployment of Reef Balls at Maiden Island</title>

<h2 align="center">Construction and Deployment of Reef Balls at Maiden Island</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="StephenMichael1.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="250">Stephen Michael is
Construction Manager for Stanford Development Company and was in charge of the Construction
and Deployment of the Reef Balls around Maiden Island.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen studied construction engineering at Tampa Bay Technological High
School and Hillsborough (County) Junior College in Florida. He then worked for
several years with Tampa-based Enterprise Building Construction and Becker
Concrete Company before returning home to Antigua in 1989.</p>
<p>Stephen joined Stanford Development Company Limited as a superintendent in
1995 and was promoted to construction manager in January 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Incredible Performance</h3>
<p>Stephen's prior experience in concrete turned out to be a great help for the
Reef Ball project.&nbsp; One of Stephen's goals was to prove that West Indian
labor could build Reef Balls faster and with higher quality than anyone had ever
done before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normally in construction, Reef Ball molds are used once, and occasionally
    twice per day.&nbsp; Stephen was able to achieve<b> four </b>times per
    day!&nbsp; With only 24 hours in a day, and 4-5 hours of concrete curing
    time, one can imagine the management skill required to pull that off when
    dealing with 30+ molds.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Normally, a Reef Ball has to sit for seven to thirty days before it is
    strong enough and has the proper pH for coral growth....Stephen was able to cast,
    de-mold, load on a barge and deploy
    within 18 hours!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>By Reef Ball authorized contractor standards, contractors are allowed a 5%
    breakage allowance.&nbsp; Stephen's crews had an amazing breakage rate of
    just .2% (two out of a thousand).</li>
  <li>Prior to Stanford, the largest private Reef Ball project used 14
    molds...Stephen had over 30 in service.</li>
  <li>The largest 'layer cake' style Reef Ball previously made was 5,000 pounds
    and only one was made.&nbsp; The Stanford project made over 50 'layer cakes' Reef Balls
    8,000 pounds each!</li>
  <li>And for the REALLY BIG accomplishment...from the time Stephen called the
    Reef Ball Foundation to place an order for the molds until Windward Reef was
    completely constructed and deployed was less than 2 months!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Over 2,000 Reef Balls were constructed in a 3-week period during the peak
    of construction, a record that will like never be broken again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's just say, Stephen proved his goal...and then some.</p>
<h3>Not Without Challenges</h3>
<p>These accomplishments are even more amazing when one considers the working
environment.&nbsp; The concrete plant was over 45 minutes by truck from the
casting site and due to a 24 hour construction schedule, temperatures varied
greatly from night to day so concrete mix designs had to be constantly
adjusted.&nbsp; Frequent rain, often heavy downpours, during the construction
was managed with minimal downtime.&nbsp; No Reef Ball project has ever had to
deal with so many sizes, styles and anchoring types...each combination creating
a specific type of Reef Ball that had to be placed in a specific spot on the
seabed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracking all this required managers to carry Palm top
computers which had to be synchronized every day to make sure the manufacturing
of the Reef Balls matched the deployment schedule for the following
day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Todd Barber, Chairman of the Reef Ball Foundation, and Debbie O'Hare of the
Coral Transplant Team show the construction team an advanced method of using the
Reef Ball molds to create unique styles.&nbsp; The construction team accused Mr.
Barber of watching too much 'Star Trek' when he was a boy.</p>

<p><i>A special construction team was set up just to do the 'layer cake' Reef
Balls.&nbsp; The construction team even came up with new ideas on their
own...instead of just using rocks for the 'layer cakes', they used empty conch
shells which added beauty and complexity to the Reef Balls.</i></p>

<p>Above and Below: Molds were designed and used to create anchoring piles for
the Reef Balls that were deployed on pure sand bottoms.&nbsp; The pilings make
sure the Reef Balls don't sink down into the sand.</p>

<p><i>All molds where set up with two bases so that production could be speeded
up by demolding the Reef Ball before the concrete was hard enough to lift
them.&nbsp; That way, the mold could be used while the first Reef Ball continued
to harden.</i></p>

<p>The barges were loaded by cranes, 'cherry pickers' and front end
loaders.&nbsp; It all depended upon the size of the Reef Ball being loaded and
which barge it was being loaded on.&nbsp; The logistics of the loading operation
was one of the most critical tasks because they had to be loaded all night long
to stage deployments which had to run from sun up to sun down to maximize barge
efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

in the mold makes it hard to tell how tall the modules really are.</p>

Reef Ball which is monolithically cast into the Reef Balls.</p>
