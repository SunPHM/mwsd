<P><FONT face=Verdana>On Dec. 6, the ultralight-led cranes flew 97 miles into Terrell Co., Georgia where they remained until Dec. 10 when some of the cranes flew 60 miles into Cook Co.,&nbsp;Georgia and&nbsp;others had an aborted flight and returned to the stopever in Terrell Co. This group of stragglers was later transported to Cook Co. the following day.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>Week of Nov. 28- Dec. 2</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The direct autumn release cranes began migration on Nov. 24 and as of Nov. 25 were spotted in Meigs Co. Tennessee. The ultralight cranes&nbsp;left Meigs Co.&nbsp;on&nbsp;Nov. 30,&nbsp;and flew 67.3 miles into Gordon Co., Georgia.&nbsp;&nbsp;On&nbsp;Dec. 1, they left Gordon Co. and flew 101 miles into Pike Co.

<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=3>The last whooping cranes remaining in Wisconsin began migration on 24 November.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=3>By the end of the week, all 11 yearlings were in Florida, 3&nbsp;direct autumn release&nbsp;juveniles were in Tennessee and 1&nbsp;direct autumn release&nbsp;juvenile was in Kentucky. Adults were at widespread locations along the migration route.</FONT></P></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The<STRONG> </STRONG>ultralight-led cranes arrived&nbsp;on Nov. 24&nbsp;in Tennessee after flying 115 miles from their last stop in Washington Co. Kentucky. The cranes had left Shelby Co. Kentucky on Nov. 20.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>Week of Nov. 14-18</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The first&nbsp;seven wild whooping cranes reached Florida this week, with five males from the 2004 flock arriving at the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge on Nov.17,and two females reaching Florida earlier in the week. As of Nov. 18, none of the direct autumn release birds had left Wisconsin, but many of the wild whoopers had begun migration.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>On Nov. 11, the 2005 ultralight-led cranes departed Morgan Co. Indiana after a ten-day layover, and flew 46 miles into&nbsp;Jennings Co., Indiana. On Nov. 17, they flew 47 miles into Shelby Co., Kentucky, where they remained as of Nov. 18. Total distance to date = 486.1.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>Week of Nov.7-11</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The young cranes have been stuck in Morgan Co. Indiana for eight days, and tomorrow will set the record for the longest time spent in one location on migration. In sad news, one whooper was found dead in&nbsp;its holding pen, and the cause of death is being investigated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The wild whooping cranes have begun migration and were in Indiana by mid-week. The four cranes that were released with the&nbsp;adult population are expected to begin their migration soon as well.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>Week of Oct. 31-Nov.4</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>On Nov.1, the cranes flew 49.1 miles into Boone Co., Indiana. On Nov.2, they flew 55.4 miles into Morgan Co., Indiana. This was the first time that all 20 cranes made the entire flight without having to be crated and brought to the destination point. Total accumulated distance = 393.3 miles. They are now at their tenth stopover and have completed 25% of the migration.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>Week of October 24-28</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>By Oct. 28, the cranes had flown a total distance of 288.8 miles and were located in Benton Co. Indiana. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Sadly this week, the death of a whooper from the 2003 flock was reported. The bird's carcass was found in the Necedah Refuge, and the cause of death was unknown at the time of discovery.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>On Oct.23, the cranes took off from Green Co. and flew 35.5 miles into Winnebago Co. Illinois. They remainded grounded there on Oct.24 due to gusty winds. Total distance traveled to date = 129.5 miles.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Meanwhile, back at the Necedah Refuge, the four cranes being directly released with the adult cranes are slated to take off on migration this week. This is the first year that direct release is being used along with the ultralights so cross your fingers for a smooth migration!</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>October 17</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Liftoff! On October 14, the 2005 cohort took off from the Necedah Refuge.&nbsp;Fourteen cranes made it to the first stopover 8 miles south of the Refuge in Juneau Co.&nbsp;Two birds dropped out and 4 returned to the Refuge. Eventlually, all 20 cranes were led to the first stopover point, either by ultralight or crate. By Oct.17, the cranes had migrated a total of 47.9 miles to Sauk Co. and were standing down due to rainy and windy conditions.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>October 2005</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Summer training has gone well for the whoopers! The cranes are preparing to embark on their fall migration, and are expected to commence their journey south in mid to late October.</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>August-September 2005</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The 2005 Class of whooping cranes is currently training in the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in Necedah, WI. There are 20 cranes training with the ultra-light aircraft and 4 training for direct autumn release. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The NRF Crane Club visited the refuge on Aug.31, Sep.1 and Sep. 2 to view the cranes in training, tour the refuge and meet project staff. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>July 2005</FONT></STRONG></P><FONT size=2>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=3>On July 14, four whooping crane chicks, 29-39 days of age, were transferred from the International Crane Foundation to the&nbsp;Necedah NWR. These chicks are being costume/isolation-reared for direct autumn release this October.</FONT></P><FONT size=2>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=3>In sad news, the remains of&nbsp;18-04 were found&nbsp;on July 16&nbsp;under a transmission line in Green Lake County.18-04 represents a significant boost to the successful reintroduction program. This bird was a "pioneer" in the experiment of "direct release" whereby it was released into the wild in proximity to older whooping cranes. The young bird joined several groups of whoopers in a southward migration last fall, spent the winter in Florida, and found its way back to Wisconsin this spring. The bird's death was&nbsp;due to the unfortunate situation of presumably hitting a transmission line near where it was spending the summer. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=3>The death of no. 18-04 is the eleventh mortality from among 53 birds released during the first 4 years of the reintroduction. His loss reduces size of the eastern migratory population to 42 individuals.</FONT></P></FONT></FONT>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>May 2005</FONT></STRONG></P><FONT size=2><FONT size=3><FONT size=2>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=3>On May 16, Whooping crane 18-04 left his last stop at&nbsp;in Dodge County, WI and&nbsp; completed migration to the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=3>Due to developmental problems, 18-04 was released in October 2004 to complete his first fall migration by following older whooping and sandhill cranes, instead of the ultralights. He wintered&nbsp;in Florida, and is&nbsp;the last of the </FONT><FONT size=3>2004 whooping cranes to complete spring migration back to Central Wisconsin and the Necedah NWR area.</FONT></FONT></P></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT size=3>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>In sad news, the&nbsp;remains of yearling 14-04 were found on May 10&nbsp;in&nbsp;Juneau County. <FONT size=2><FONT size=3>He is believed to have been killed by a large predator.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Verdana size=3>
<P>The death of no. 14-04 is the tenth mortality from among 53 birds released during the first 4 years of the reintroduction. Seven of these mortalities have occurred within the past year, and 6 have occurred within the past 6 months.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Verdana size=3>As of May 9, there were&nbsp;36 cranes in and around Wisconsin's core reintroduction area.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;2 cranes in&nbsp;Indiana and 2 in Lower Michigan. There were also 3 cranes traveling between the&nbsp;upper peninsula of Michigan and Southeastern Ontario and 1 spotted in Quebec.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>April 2005</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Two adult whoopers at the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge&nbsp;produced an egg recently (an important milestone for the reintroduction project)&nbsp;which was unfotunately predated upon. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Other exciting news includes the&nbsp;return&nbsp;migration of 18-04, the juvenile crane who migrated south with other sandhills versus&nbsp;the ultralight last fall. He was tracked in northern Georgia during the week of April 18-22. His arrival back at the Necedah refuge will signal an important feat for the "direct release" method which the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership members plan on using this fall in conjunction with the ultralight led method.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>During the soft release method, juvenile cranes are released in the fall with the adult whoopers from previous years' flocks with the idea that the adult cranes will teach the juveniles the migration route to Florida. As in previous years, there will also be a group of crane chicks training with the ultralight aircraft. Let's hope both groups have a safe summer in the refuge!</FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT face=Verdana>March 2005</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The whooping cranes have begun their spring migration north, with several whoopers having already arrived back at the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge and other areas throughout Wisconsin during the week of March 20th.&nbsp;The&nbsp;juvenile cranes of the Class of 2004 have also begun their migration and many have arrived back in Wisconsin as well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The Class of 2005 chicks will arrive at the Necedah Wildlife Refuge this spring to begin yet another year of training with the ultralight aircrafts. Project biologists hope to start seeing some pair bonding between the older cranes this season, and&nbsp;hope to witness the&nbsp;arrival of the&nbsp;first wild produced chicks in the coming year or two.</FONT></P>
