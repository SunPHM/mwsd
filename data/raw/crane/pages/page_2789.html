<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cowlitz Wildlife Area: Habitat 

  Plantings- </b>Recent activities on the Cowlitz Wildlife Area have included 

  monitoring past plantings at two separate units, Mossyrock and Swofford. The 

  Mossyrock Unit was surveyed by Wildlife Area Manager Kantar to monitor past 

  plantings in 9 exclosures dating back to 1998. These exclosures were originally 

  developed to provide visual screens and additional wildlife habitat attributes. 

  Of the 9 exclosures 6 retain over 75% desired tree/shrub cover. A mixture of 

  fruiting trees and shrubs including elderberry, salmonberry, hawthorn, rose, 

  cascara and Pacific crab in addition to Douglas spirea, western red cedar, vine 

  and bigleaf maple are doing quite well on the site. Manager Kantar and Laborer 

  Morris mended additional fence and weeded all exclosures of evergreen and Himalayan 

  blackberry and tilled the areas for new stock. An additional 500 trees and shrubs 

  including red osier dogwood, black hawthorn, Pacific crab, red elderberry, cascara 

  sagrada, western red cedar and serviceberry were planted in areas of the exclosures 

  where open space was available. This will serve as additional cover, nesting 

  and foraging areas for a variety of migratory birds, (Laborer Morris watched 

  a rufous hummingbird tending its nest), small game, and in a few years when 

  the fencing is removed, additional foraging areas for deer and elk. Laborer 

  Morris also tilled and then planted 250 Douglas fir trees along one of the field 

  access rows for additional visual screening.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Swofford Pond Unit, specifically 

  at Sulphur Creek was planted with various riparian shrubs in order to help restore 

  native vegetative cover to areas adjacent to the creek bank. With elk use in 

  the area and competition with dense reed canarygrass, reestablishing tree and 

  shrub cover has been a challenge. Wildlife Area Manager Kantar surveyed the 

  area and reported a tree/shrub survival rate of 65%. Laborer Morris mowed and 

  tilled the area and planted an additional 70 trees and shrubs as follows: 10 

  Pacific Willow, 10 Black Cottonwood and 40 Oregon Ash consisting of taller, 

  2 year seedlings. This area will be monitored overtime to insure tree/shrub 

  establishment and weeded and mowed routinely to reduce plant competition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cowlitz Wildlife Area: Riparian 

  Restoration- </b>Wildlife Area Manager Kantar and Tacoma Power Staff made a 

  site visit to Kiona Creek and Spears Unit with wetland scientists in an effort 

  to evaluate potential areas for wetland restoration efforts. These units have 

  been identified for restoration treatment and requests for proposals will be 

  developed this summer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cowlitz Wildlife Area: Peterman 

  Hill Forest Management- </b>Simpson Timber Company has started up operations 

  on the Peterman Hill Unit and will be logging throughout the area. Tacoma Power 

  has recently replanted over 150 acres on the unit as part of the land management 

  agreement for the unit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cowlitz Wildlife Area: Riffe Lake- 

  </b>Water levels at Riffe are up and have required the movement of signs from 

  lower water levels. Laborer Morris has been monitoring these levels and adjusting 

  signs as needed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cowlitz Wildlife Area: Watchable 

  Wildlife- </b>East Riffe/Kosmos Flats. Wildlife Area Manager Kantar and Laborer 

  Morris have witnessed many interesting bird observations over the last few weeks, 

  including Western grebe, western bluebirds and nesting Canada geese. Ospreys 

  have been observed fishing on numerous occasions and 2 adult bald eagles have 

  been using nearby perch trees and have been seen soaring along Dog Mountain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Klickitat Wildlife Area: Maintenance 

  Activities- </b>Wildlife Area Manager Morrison reports that he continues with 

  maintenance activities. Nine miles of roads were graded and all other roads 

  were cleared of blowdowns, etc. All food plots but one was readied for summer 

  fallow. The last was too wet to complete at this time. He is having many problems 

  with his tractor. Some can be attributed to its old age, others (such as three 

  flat tires) to normal wear and tear. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">St. Helens Tree Farm Road Access 

  Meeting- Regional staff met with representatives from Weyerhaeuser St. Helens 

  Tree Farm operations to discuss recreational access. The Weyerhaeuser staff 

  stated that in general they were pleased with the results of the changes implemented 

  last year. They explained to us why there are differences in operation between 

  the north and south halves of the tree farm and were resistant to any modifications 

  that might make access more available to hunters. They were however, very interested 

  in helping us provide our constituents with better information and seemed anxious 

  to show cooperation within the framework established last year. We will be providing 

  a Company information flyer via PDF posting on our website which will describe 

  in detail the access plan. It includes a map showing points of access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Peregrine Falcon Nesting: Lewis 

  and Clark Bridge-</b> Darrel Whipple, the volunteer on this project, and District 

  Wildlife Biologist Miller visited the site this week. Both birds were in attendance 

  and vocalizations of young have been heard recently. Miller notified WA DOT 

  Biologist of our findings, DOT is also monitoring the site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bald Eagle Management-</b> Biologist 

  Miller visited the proponent for a development near the Neuakum bald eagle territory. 

  Last year the proponent conducted grading operation up to the nest. Lewis Co. 

  advised the landowner that a bald eagle management plan will be required before 

  and filling can take place. The landowner will be providing a map of the proposed 

  development for plan development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Klickitat Wildlife Area: Maintenance 

  Activities- </b>Wildlife Area Manager Morrison reports that normal springtime 

  maintenance activities are consuming the major portion of his effort. Most of 

  the boundary fences that have adjacent livestock grazing have been maintained 

  and ready for cattle turn out. All the watering cisterns (guzzlers) have been 

  checked and cleaned. Some additional repairs will be required to some. The sharecroppers 

  have completed most of their spring work. He and his temporary help have begun 

  work on the food plots set up for deer and turkey. They will remain in summer 

  fallow until being planted to winter wheat in September. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Klickitat Wildlife Area: Boundary 

  Fence-</b> WDFW's fence crew completed the boundary fence near the new land 

  purchase (Boise-Cascade). Most of the adjacent landowners welcome a new fence 

  along their boundaries, but there were a few that felt there may be a way to 

  get something for nothing from the government, such as a sliver of acreage. 

  After studying the survey, even they decided to accept the fence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Klickitat Wildlife Area: CAG-</b> 

  After setting up a date for the Citizens Advisory Group (CAG) meeting and mailing 

  an info packet to each participant, some had conflicts and wouldn't be able 

  to attend. Since it was so hard to set a date convenient to all, Wildlife Area 

  Manager Morrison held the meeting anyway, asking those who could not attend 

  to submit any comments by mail. Well, the date must have been inconvenient to 

  all, because NONE attended. He is now waiting for comments, but to this date 

  has not received any comments either! We can interpret this a couple of ways, 

  either those contacted are not interested, or they believe the direction we 

  are taking on management of the W/A is compatible with their user groups. Until 

  we hear differently, we will assume the latter. Morrison is still trying to 

  contact members to see if they have comments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Mt. St. Helens/Shillapoo Wildlife 

  Area Maintenance Activities: </b>Wildlife Area Manager Calkins spent the week 

  securing supplies for June projects and worked on several maintenance projects 

  including hand-seeding about &frac12; mile of erosion prone bank along the mudflow 

  at Mt. St. Helens, spraying Himalayan blackberry along about 1/4 mile of interior 

  road at Shillapoo as well as continuing to search for a and spray poison hemlock. 

  A contractor also mowed about 20 acres of pasture area at Shillapoo which is 

  managed as winter waterfowl pasture.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Volunteers scheduled to help control 

  erosion at Mt. St. Helens to protect elk habitat: </b>A volunteer event is planned 

  for Saturday and Sunday at the Mt. St. Helens State Wildlife Area on the North 

  Fork of the Toutle River in Cowlitz County. This is a great opportunity for 

  folks who do not have other Memorial Day weekend plans to get outside and help 

  protect and improve elk habitat in the Mt. St. Helens area. The planned work 

  will include collecting and planting willow cuttings in erosion prone areas 

  to protect elk winter forage areas on the site. Any one interested in helping 

  should contact the Wildlife Area Manager at (360) 906-6725.<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Black-tailed Deer Hairloss-</b> 

  Biologist Miller, Wildlife Manager Dobler and intern Tiah Angel conducted the 

  second spring hair loss flight in units 530 and 550. the survey is done by helicopter, 

  and fog hampered the starting time of the survey and may have affected the total 

  number of deer observed. For both units combined, a total of 154 deer were observed. 

  In unit 530, 108 deer were counted and of the 108, 6 adults and 13 fawns showed 

  evidence of hair slip. The percentage of fawns afflicted was 39 %, the highest 

  since the counts began. The adult to fawn ratio was 100:44. In unit 550, 46 

  deer were observed and 8.6 % of the deer were afflicted with hairloss. The percentage 

  of fawns afflicted was 25%. The adult to fawn ratio was 100:37. A pilot study 

  on fawn survival was begun last year and more effort is scheduled this summer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Duck Stamp Project Canceled-</b> 

  District Wildlife Biologist Miller received word this week that the Duck Stamp 

  project at Deep River will be canceled. The land is being appraised and sale 

  is considered imminent. The money for this project will be returned to the fund 

  and may be reallocated to another project in the region.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Clark county Deer Study- </b>Biologist 

  Holman responded to calls regarding two of the study animals remaining from 

  the Clark County Urban/Suburban black-tailed deer study. During a span of four 

  days, two of the deer were killed in collisions with automobiles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On May 13, deer #16 was killed on 

  the I-205 freeway. A necropsy was performed by biologist Holman and Colorado 

  State University Veterinary Medicine Student Ruth Parkin to determine the reproductive 

  status of the doe as well as general health. The doe was not pregnant, nor was 

  she lactating. The doe's bone marrow showed plenty of fat and the liver and 

  lungs appeared healthy as well. Additionally, some concern has been raised by 

  the public regarding the &quot;tightness&quot; of the collars used to study 

  the deer and associated loss of neck hair. Doe #16 showed no signs of such a 

  condition. We appreciate the help of vet student Parkin in the necropsy work</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Western Pond Turtle Management- 

  </b>Our capture program is going very well this spring with approximately 20 

  adult females captured. These turtles will be transmitter -equipped and followed 

  through next month to locate nest sites for the head start program. Captures 

  have increased dramatically during the past two weeks at the Bergen Road site. 

  As many as 14 turtles have been captured in one day. A total of three adult 

  females have been outfitted with fresh radiotelemetry equipment as of May 17. 

  Trapping efforts will continue until at least May 24th. At least eleven adult 

  female turtles are thought to inhabit the Bergen Road location. At the Sondino 

  Ranch site, 20 out of 34 known adult female turtles had been captured and outfitted 

  with updated telemetry gear as of May 16th.</font></p>

  Andersen assisted Conboy National Wildlife Refuge staff with ground surveys 

  of sandhill crane nest sites. Approximately 8 known crane pairs are currently 

  nesting with hatching already underway from some of the earliest nest sites. 

  There are still several pairs unaccounted for, but water levels look good this 

  year and adequate habitat exists for more nesting pairs than last year. A helicopter 

  survey will take place this week to get a complete overview of this years nesting 

  activity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Peregrine Falcons -</b> District 

  9 staff are currently surveying for peregrine falcon nesting in the Columbia 

  River Gorge. All three known pairs active in 2001, are currently incubating 

  eggs. Volunteers are assisting WDFW staff with these surveys and we appreciate 

  their help. We still have two historic sites to check for occupancy. Peregrine 

  young should soon hatch and more activity will be seen at nest sites. Productivity 

  surveys will be conducted in the coming weeks to determine productivity rates.</font></p>
