Historically, natural fire occurred on a three to five-year interval. Fires were of low intensity,  fueled by grasses and pine litter. Prescribed fire simulates natural fire. Fire management officers write a prescription for fire to be ignited only when certain weather, fuel and moisture conditions occur that will make the fire manageable.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT></P><IMG SRC="../images/img0087a.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=RIGHT><P>The prescribed fire program at the refuge strives to return the wet pine savannas to a natural condition, providing suitable habitat for native plant communities such as wiregrass and pitcher plants. Fire is mainly applied in the fall and spring. Fall fire is used to improve savannas overstocked with planted slash pine and enhance crane nesting areas. Spring fire is used to clear unwanted woody vegetation from savannas that have grown up in thickets. This brush shades out desirable herbaceous plants and makes the savanna unsuitable for crane nesting. Spring fire improves the growth response of herbaceous plants while reducing the viability of the woody plants.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT></P><IMG SRC="../images/img0096a.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="../images/img0093a.gif" ALT="" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10><P>Fire is primarily applied by aerial ignition. Aerial ignition spheres that look like 'ping-pong balls" are dropped from a helicopter. The spheres ignite spot fires that burn together within the target area. In this way large acreages can be burned  safely and efficiently. Smoke is less of a problem with these fires. Since smoke blows from burn areas with the prevailing winds, burns are planned when a favorable wind is forecasted which will carry the smoke away from developed areas and main highways. Wildlife such as deer, small mammals and reptiles escape it by running ahead of the fire or seeking cover in dens or holes in the ground. Very few animals perish in prescribed fires because the spot fires burn with less intensity than wildfire that is driven by the wind.</P><P>Wildfire is any undesirable fire burning on or adjacent to the refuge. This fire endangers refuge values such as nesting sites or improvements such as the <A HREF="mscvisit.htm">visitor center</A>. Whether caused by humans or lightning, wildfire will be suppressed by the refuge fire crew.</P><P>The refuge fire crew also assists the local Mississippi Forestry Commission in suppressing wildfire in Jackson County. Homes and businesses have been constructed within forest and brush lands that are susceptible to recurring wildfire. With recent and rapid commercial development within the county, a wildland/urban interface now exists that heightens the importance of wildfire supression.</P><P>When fires of national complexity occur, the refuge fire management crews are ready and available to assist whenever and wherever needed.  Most recently several refuge firefighters traveled to Florida to participate in suppressing the worst wildfires that have occurred there in 50 years.</P><CENTER><HR WIDTH=85%><HR WIDTH=85%><A HREF="../index.html">Home</A>  - - <A HREF="mscvisit.htm">Visitor Center</A>  - - <A HREF="mscrane.htm">The Cranes</A>  - - <A HREF="mscplant.htm">Carnivorous Plants</A>  - - <A HREF="mscnews.htm">What's New?</A><BR><HR WIDTH=85%><A HREF="mschabit.htm">Refuge Habitats</A>  - - <A HREF="mscdoing.htm">Management</A>  - - <A HREF="mscstaff.htm">Staff & Volunteers</A>  - - <A HREF="mscfaves.htm">Related Sites</A><BR><HR WIDTH=85%></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
