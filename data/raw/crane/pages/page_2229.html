<H4>How do you travel by air with all your gear?</H4>

<p>
Generally, I carry on two bags as follows:
<p>  
The Canon 600mm f/4, an EOS 3 body, and the 28-135 IS zoom lens 
(the latter items stuffed into woolen winter hats), 
go into carry-on #1, a Domke large lens bag.  

<p>
Carry-on #2 is  a TravelPro 24" rolling case like the one the 
pilots and stewards and stewardesses use.  
(I don't know yet whether this bag will fit through the new 
United Airlines carry-on templates that are popping up at many 
security  gates (If your carry-on does not fit through the template, 
you will be forced to  return to the ticket counter and check 
your bag; they will not even x-ray it and let you check it at the jetway 
as you could in the past.)   

<p>
The following items are placed in the rolling case:
<ol>
<li>All film for the trip. 
(With the new x-ray machines for CHECKED BAGGAGE it is 
mandatory to carry on all your film. 
On long trips, therefore, a good deal of your carry on 
capacity will be allotted to your film. 
When traveling in the US, it might be best to mail or 
Fed-X film to yourself at your destination. 
Both Fed-X and the US Postal Service state 
that their air shipments are NEVER x-rayed. 
On a recent trip to the Pribilofs, 
I mailed 300 rolls to the King Eider Hotel 
and then mailed 234 exposed rolls to Chelsea Color Labs 
in New York and am happy to report that the film arrived 
safely at all destinations (as did I).

<li>The Canon 400 f/5.6L and  300mm f/4L IS lenses.

<li>One or more backup camera bodies.  
<li>Two 25mm and one 12mm extension tubes.
<li>The 1.4X and 2X teleconverters.
<li>One flash unit.  
<p>
(Note: all lenses, camera bodies, and accessories are placed in the 
aforementioned woolen caps which are cheap, keep out dust and moisture, 
and most importantly, offer sufficient padding to protect against damage 
provided that you get to carry on your carry on!)
When traveling overseas, or when carrying extra gear,  
I'll sometimes  wear my vest a laJoe McDonald and pack as much stuff 
into it as I dare.  Most airlines do not as yet have firm policies 
on such practices, but do not be surprised if you are hassled if 
you try this approach. 	Usually, however, I'll pack extra 
camera equipment (including additional bodies, and often, 
the Canon 500mm f/4.5L lens!), tripods, tripod heads, 
other accessories, batteries, vest, tool kit, lens cleaning supplies, 
and often, several loaded 140 carousel slide trays and a 
Kodak Ektagraphic projector in my checked baggage.  
The 500mm lens  is placed in a large Domke lens bag.  
(With increasingly stricter regulations in sight, there is a 
strong possibility that we might soon be forced to place 
our well-padded long lenses in our checked baggage.)  
All items are  padded with clothing.  All but the tripod or 
tripods are placed in large (roughly 29 or 30 inch), incredibly 
rugged Delsey hard sided cases.  The tripod or tripods, , individually 
wrapped in large, bulky items of clothing, go in a rolling duffle bag.
You can guess by now that traveling  by air is not my favorite activity, 
but with good planning, lots of padding, and a bit of creativity, 
your next trip by jetliner to a bird photography hotspot need not be 
a harrowing experience.
