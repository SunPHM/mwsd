      <h2 class=MsoBodyText>Photography Tour</h2>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>January 2003</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><img src="../images/tours/gbbt04_snowgeeseatdawn_t.jpg" width="150" height="97" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">Bosque 
        del Apache is an American National Wildlife Refuge straddling the Rio 
        Grande approximately 130 miles south of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  At its 
        heart lie 13,000 acres of moist bottomlands where the waters of the Rio 
        Grande have been diverted to create extensive shallow wetlands.  Bordering 
        the refuge are the Chupadero Mountains on the west and the San Pascual 
        Mountains on the east.  </p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>Bosque (pronounced &quot;bosskay&quot;) has been described 
        as one of the most spectacular and significant wildlife refuges in North 
        America.  Significant because of the role it continues to play in the 
        lives of the once endangered Greater Sandhill Cranes and due to the efforts 
        made to preserve a major wetland ecosystem in the arid desert lands of 
        New Mexico.  Spectacular, as thousands of winter visitors can attest, 
        because of the sheer concentration of wildlife that builds up during the 
        six-month winter period. </p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>SANDHILL CRANES</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><img src="../images/tours/gbbt02_sandhillcranesatsunrise_t.jpg" width="102" height="150" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="Sandhill Cranes at sunrise">The 
        main reason for the creation of Bosque del Apache, back in the late 30's, 
        was to provide safe wintering grounds for the then endangered Greater 
        Sandhill Crane.  Today it is no longer under threat with winter counts 
        of around 17,000 birds on the refuge but they still remain a priority.  
      </p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>When it comes to food specially grown corn is &quot;bumped&quot; 
        into broken storks instead of being flattened.  Geese will not feed so 
        readily on bumped corn because coyotes lurk amongst the stalks but the 
        much taller cranes have a clear view and consequently do not feel threatened.  
        There are actually three kinds of Sandhills to be found at the Bosque: 
        the Greater 48&quot; high, the Lesser 39&quot;, and the Canadian 42&quot;, 
        plumages are virtually identical.</p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>SNOW GEESE</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><img src="../images/tours/gbbt03_snowgeese_t.jpg" width="103" height="150" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">Tremendous 
        flocks of Snow and Ross' geese fly down from their breeding grounds in 
        Southern Canada and begin arriving at the Bosque in small numbers around 
        mid-October.  The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service co-operates with local 
        farmers to grow food crops such as corn for the wintering birds.  Additional 
        food such as chufa, millet, smartweed and bulrush are also grown on the 
        refuge itself.  By December the daily counts of Snow geese will have risen 
        to over 50,000 along with 20,000 assorted wildfowl including Canada geese.</p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>OTHER BIRDS</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>The flocks of cranes and geese are especially spectacular 
        when flying out at dawn and again when returning to roost at dusk.  However 
        there is plenty more to see and photograph around the 15 miles of loop 
        roads within the refuge.  </p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>Birds include, various hawks mainly Red-tailed and 
        Cooper's, Kestrels, Bald Eagles, Great Horned Owls, Great Blue Herons, 
        Night Herons, Snowy and Great Egrets, American Bitterns, Wild Turkeys, 
        several Road Runners, Gambel's Quail, White-crowned Sparrows, Red-winged 
        Blackbirds, Western Meadowlarks and shorebirds such as Snipe, Dowitcher, 
        Killdeer, American Avocet and Greater Yellowlegs.</p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>COYOTES</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>The refuge provides a superb feeding ground for coyotes 
        as you can imagine and they play an integral role in Bosque's ecosystem.  
        They tend to prey on old or illness weakened birds as well as helping 
        to spread out heavy concentrations of geese.  As a consequence Bosque 
        is seen as one of the best places in North America to photograph these 
        exciting animals.</p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>MULE DEER</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>Named for their large ears mule deer can be encountered 
        virtually anywhere around the refuge browsing on the new growth of shrubs 
        and trees.  On my previous visits I saw them daily and, on more than one 
        occasion, have actually photographed them swimming, which they do readily 
        in this wetland environment.  Mule deer were an important source of food 
        to the native Indian people who lived along the Rio Grande and for the 
        early Spanish and American settlers in days gone by.</p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText> </p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>THE RECCE</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText><img src="../images/tours/gbbt01_baldeaglesinbosque_t.jpg" width="105" height="150" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">In 
        February 2000 I travelled to New Mexico for a ten-day recce on behalf 
        of Nature Photography Pro-Tours Ltd to check out the potential of Bosque 
        del Apache as a new tour location.  Sufficient to say that at the end 
        of my visit I did not want to leave and in 2001 I could not wait to get 
        back!   In my opinion it is unquestionably a &quot;must visit&quot; location 
        for any bird or wildlife photographer</p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE REFUGE</h3>
      <p class=MsoBodyText>Photographing the geese and cranes is straightforward 
        and best achieved from outside the vehicle especially the flight shots.  
        However virtually everything else is done from inside the vehicle using 
        beanbags or window mounts.  This excludes using a mini-bus, as anyone 
        who has been to America knows that the only windows that open in these 
        vans are those in the front.  Therefore we use individual vehicles with 
        one person in the front and one working from the back, exactly the same 
        method that is deployed in Lesvos.</p>
      <h3>THE TOUR</h3>
      <p>Calculated on the current rate of exchange (£1.00/$1.40) the package 
        price is based on two people sharing both car and room at good quality 
        motel/hotel accommodation with breakfast plus all entry fees to the refuge.   
        A major fluctuation in exchange rates will affect costs.</p>
      <h3>TOUR OPTIONS</h3>
      <p>We have decided at NPPT that the best way to offer this new tour is in 
        two options. The first as a straightforward 10-day tour.  Secondly, to 
        combine it with the Florida tour, which will make a fantastic overall 
        trip, as well as being a very viable option. </p>

      <h3>PRE-TOUR MEETING</h3>
      <p><img src="../images/tours/gbbt05_roadrunner_t.jpg" width="150" height="99" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">Clients 
        will be invited to attend a pre-tour meeting in November to discuss the 
        final arrangements, equipment, clothing etc. and to view slides from previous 
        Bosque and Florida trips.  This is an opportunity to ask those last minute 
        questions and to meet other members in the groups.  Full details of the 
        meeting will be forwarded to anyone unable to attend.</p>
      <h3>BOOKING</h3>
      <p>To reserve places send an e-mail first followed by a deposit cheque for 
        £175.00 per person for the single tour and £250.00 for the joint tour 
        made payable to Nature Photography Pro-Tours Ltd.  On receipt a confirmation 
        of your booking together with an invoice will be sent by return.</p>
      <h3 class=MsoBodyText>DEPOSITS</h3>
      <p>Deposits are non-refundable and so, as a financial safeguard, we advise 
        you to take out travel insurance as soon as your booking confirmation 
        is received.  In the unlikely event that the tour does not attract sufficient 
        numbers all monies will be refunded in full.</p>
