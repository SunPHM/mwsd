<P class="MsoNormal">A 29-year-old worker for a water tank company
was killed when the partially assembled water tower he was working
on was struck by a falling portable tower crane. The man was part
of a three-man crew that reconditions and relocates used water
towers, this one intended for a small rural Iowa community. An
independent crane company was hired to erect supports for the
water tower and lift the tank into its final position. This company
erected its portable tower crane adjacent to the new foundations
for the water tower, as close as possible. (see Photo 1). After
hoisting the tank and while swinging it into position, with just
a few feet to go, the rear crane outrigger facing the water tower
slipped between cribbing timbers and sank into the ground. The
entire tower crane fell towards the water tower, smashing everything
in its path. The victim was sitting on a horizontal strut of the
water tower base (see Photo 1), approximately 80 feet in the air,
preparing to adjust and tighten bracing rods once the tank was
in position. Two other workers were injured, another member of
the tank crew, who was positioned inside the ladder cage for the
water tower, and the operator of the crane, who was sitting inside
the control box of the crane 120 feet above the ground. Photo
1 was taken by a newspaper reporter a few minutes before the crane
fell.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">In July 2000, a mobile tower crane fell into
an adjacent water tower, causing the death of a 29-year-old man
working for a tank company that specializes in the relocation
of used water towers. The Iowa FACE program became aware of the
incident the next day from local news media and began an immediate
investigation. A site visit was planned that same afternoon, and
photographs were taken of the construction site, the crane that
fell, and the smashed water tower. One investigator conducted
this site visit and also returned a week later to make detailed
measurements after the crane had been removed from the site. Other
information was gathered from newspapers, interviews with the
company erecting the water tower, a national internet forum on
crane accidents, and other crane companies using this same type
of mobile crane. An operator's manual was also obtained. Additional
photographs were obtained from reporters who were at the scene
immediately prior to and during the incident.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The employer was a small company specializing
in the reconditioning and relocation of used water tanks and water
towers. The company had been in business part-time for six years,
and full-time for the past 15 months. The company had three employees,
all three having multiple combined years of experience working
with and moving water tanks. Two workers were positioned on the
water tower itself, while the owner gave verbal instruction from
the ground.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-2.JPG" WIDTH="504" HEIGHT="238" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The
company had a written safety program, and all three men had gone
through safety training for this type of work. Due to the complexity
of the work and the unique circumstances of every job, specific
written safety instructions were not possible. However, safety
was routinely discussed each day on the job. Workers were aware
of the risks and wore proper fall-protective equipment, including
safety harnesses and shock-absorbing lanyards. The victim had
seven year's experience working with water tanks and two year's
experience with this tank company. This was the first fatal accident
for this tank company.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The crane company, however, had a fatal accident
three years ago while erecting a windmill generator on top of
a 140-foot column. In that case the same type of mobile tower
crane was used. Timbers under the outriggers were placed on recently
backfilled soil adjacent to the new windmill foundation, and the
timbers sank into the loose soil, causing the tower crane to fall
with its hoisted load. (See FACE report on our website:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/face/Reports/REPORT-028.htm">http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/face/Reports/REPORT-028.htm</A></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>INVESTIGATION</B></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The tank company was contracted to dismantle,
relocate, and reassemble a water tower which had been used at
a public facility. The reconditioned water tower was to be the
water supply for a small rural community, population 250. The
total height of the water tower was 127 feet. The water tank had
a capacity of 50,000 gallons, was 22 feet in diameter, 23 feet
tall, and had an empty weight of 28,000 lbs. Tank company employees
considered this a small job, having worked on much larger municipal
water tanks in the past.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-3.JPG" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="321" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Two months prior to this accident, a local
contractor excavated the area to a depth of 18 feet and structurally
filled this area to a depth of 7 feet, all according to engineering
specifications received from an engineering firm that specializes
in water tower construction. Structural fill dirt, which was trucked
in for this, was described as gray brown lean clay trace silt.
This fill was compacted to 98% of maximum, and later tested and
certified (at 7 feet below grade), by an independent engineering
firm as suitable for a load bearing capacity of 2000 psf. (pounds
per square foot). This was the level where the foundations for
the water tower were poured. The next 6 feet of soil was backfilled
and compacted to 95% of maximum, which was never tested, but would
likely still retain the 2000 psf. rating. The final 6-12 inches
of topsoil was composed of black dirt, which had been scraped
off the area prior to excavation. This top soil had no certified
bearing load, for it was not compacted, but was simply to allow
grass to grow in the area. The mobile crane trailer had difficulty
maneuvering in this black dirt and required assistance from the
excavation contractor on site.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The exposed sections of the four concrete
foundations for the tower were 24 feet, 10 inches apart (see Diagram).
The four legs of the water tower were bolted to these concrete
pads, and horizontal struts and tightening rods were in place
to keep the supports square.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The last major construction procedure was
to lift the reconditioned water tank onto the legs of the water
tower. The in-state crane company was using a portable telescopic-type
tower crane with a capacity of 30 tons. It had a platform height
of 140 feet with a 50-foot boom, giving the entire crane a height
of approximately 188 feet. The last crane from this manufacturer
was made in 1980; therefore, this crane was at least 20 years
old. It is described as more complicated than other cranes; however,
it is well suited to set up and use quickly in urban settings.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The water tank was initially unloaded about
100 feet from the water tower. The crane therefore, was first
erected at a suitable location to move the water tank into the
proper position for the final lift, adjacent to the water tower
legs (See Photo 4). During this move, the capacity and reach of
the crane was tested by &quot;booming down&quot; or &quot;walking
the load&quot;, i.e., extending the swing radius to 30 feet, 6
feet farther than would be required for the final lift, which
required a swing radius of approximately 24 feet. The tank was
kept just off the ground for the test lift in case of overloading.
At this time the crane had no difficulty moving the empty tank;
therefore, the water tank was placed adjacent to the water tower
and the portable crane was moved into position for the final lift
the next day. The crane was not tested by &quot;booming down&quot;
at this final location prior to the lift.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">As mentioned, it was difficult for the semi-tractor
to move the crane trailer into position because of the soft topsoil.
Photographs show deep wheel tracks from the four sets of dual
tires under the heavy trailer (See Photo 7). A local farmer with
30 years of farming experience described the soil as <I>&quot;hard
as pavement on top, yet pure gumbo underneath&quot;</I>. He said
the soil was very difficult to work; it drained poorly, and retained
moisture more than other soils. This jobsite was flat; the ground
surface was dry; the temperature was in the 90s, and there was
essentially no wind that day.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-4.JPG" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="283" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The tower crane was positioned at an angle
to the water tower foundations (See Diagram), as close to the
water tower as possible. This type of tower crane has four outriggers,
two at the front, adjacent to the edges of the trailer, and two
outriggers at its rear. The front outriggers are secured to the
right and left sides of the transport trailer and have no lateral
movement but are hydraulically driven downward to level the crane.
The two rear hydraulic outriggers are on 9-foot extended beams,
which give a center-to-center distance between these outriggers
of 27 feet. These outriggers swing into position manually and
then are pinned in place with a steel strut. Each beam is extended
hydraulically forcing the outrigger pads downward to level the
crane.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Each front outrigger was set on two timbers
which were set directly on the ground. The timber dimensions were
85 inches long, 12 to13 inches wide, and 7 inches tall. Each rear
outrigger was set on three of these timbers, which also were set
on the bare ground. There was no evidence of an attempt to move
the 6-12 inches of topsoil in the area; all outriggers were set
directly on this black dirt. The right rear outrigger was set
inside the perimeter of the new water tower, approximately 11
feet from the well opening. No plywood or steel plates were used
under the timbers to distribute the load, nor were any bolts or
other rigging used to secure the timbers together.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-5.JPG" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="163" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Shortly
before the final lift, the water tank was raised a few feet off
the ground to clean up the bottoms of the support legs (Photo
4). This photograph shows a glimpse of the outrigger and cribbing
timbers that completely failed 20 minutes later. On a closer look
at the photo (Photo 5), some details are noteworthy: (1) the ground
is not level under the timbers, (2) the cribbing timber to the
right has already begun to roll out from under the pad, and (3)
there is a space between the right and middle timbers. The appearance
of the timbers in this photo is consistent with the final position
of them after the accident, as seen in Photo 6.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">This telescopic mobile tower crane can be
controlled from two locations, from an elevated cab within the
tower itself at a height of 130 feet, or remotely from the ground.
Both positions are equal in their ability to maneuver the crane,
and the remote controls are normally used for reasons of safety.
For this operation, the crane operator chose to work from the
elevated cab position, apparently to more clearly see the signals
from other workers located on the water tower.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Two men from the tank company were positioned
on the water tower itself to help &quot;catch the iron&quot;.
One was inside the ladder cage at the top of the ladder, to help
with final positioning of the tank onto the water tower legs.
The other man, the victim, was on a horizontal strut, preparing
to position and tighten the X-bracing immediately after the tank
was lowered onto the water tower (See Photo 1). The owner of the
tank company was standing on the ground giving directions to the
other two men.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-6.JPG" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="190" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The water
tank was raised to about 130 feet then swung over the water tower
structure to align it with the base, the procedure lasting approximately
11 minutes. The tank was vertically within 3 to 4 feet of the
water tower legs when the right rear outrigger on the tower crane
suddenly shifted and sank down between the timbers, causing the
tower to fall towards the water tower structure (See Photo 6).
The soft soil was pushed upwards, the stabilizer arm on the right
outrigger snapped, and the outrigger arm swung to the rear of
the trailer as the crane began falling. Witnesses report it took
several seconds for the crane and tower to fall to the ground,
taking nearby powerlines with it.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-7.JPG" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="377" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Several
people rushed to aid the three men caught in the wreckage. The
crane operator was still inside the cab area, conscious, with
facial wounds and other injuries. The man inside the ladder cage
clung to the ladder when it fell and remained conscious, suffering
only a broken ankle. The victim was unconscious and bleeding from
head injuries, without a pulse or respirations. CPR was begun
by a newspaper reporter and other bystanders and continued until
emergency crews arrived. The victim was air-lifted to a hospital,
and was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The investigation concluded that the tower
crane fell directly in line with, and on top of, the right rear
outrigger, complete failure of the ground under the right rear
outrigger occurring soon after the full load was upon it. Although
the top of the ground in the area was dry, deeper soil under the
three timbers was wet and soft. The weight of the load squeezed
this soil upward between the timbers (See Photo 6). There was
a depression approximately 18 inches deep in the ground made from
the right rear dual tires of the trailer (See Photo 7). This depression
was evidently made when the outrigger failed and the complete
weight of the hoisted load and the crane was momentarily transferred
to the trailer before the tower fell flat to the ground.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>CAUSE OF DEATH</B></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The official cause of death from the Medical
Examiner's report was, &quot;<I>massive head, chest, and abdominal
trauma.&quot;</I></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>RECOMMENDATIONS / DISCUSSION</B></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>Recommendation #1: <I>Crane owners and
operators should ensure that cranes are properly set up with the
outrigger pads supported by firm stable footing.</I></B></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-Diagram.jpg" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="290" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Discussion:
</B>Construction projects frequently require the use of a mobile
crane which must be set up on soil that has recently been worked
or backfilled for foundations, grading, etc. In addition, it is
not unusual for crane operators to encounter frozen / partially
frozen soil, wet soil, layered soil, changing weather conditions,
etc. Because a crane&#146;s lifting capacity increases as the
swing radius (distance from center of crane to lifted load) decreases,
crane operators desire to set up as close to the worksite as possible.
However, soil is frequently unstable in these locations and extra
precautions are necessary to provide firm stable footing.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">An evaluation of the outrigger loading based
on information obtained from the crane manufacturer&#146;s operating
manual indicated that the ground under the rear outriggers was
subjected to a pressure of about 3600 psf.., which is 1600 psf..
greater than the soil's certified 2000 psf.. capacity. See appendix
for a more detailed description of the evaluation. Evidence at
the incident site noted in Photos 4, 5, and 6, confirms that the
ground was failing under the outriggers just prior to the incident.
When the crane had been set up adjacent to the water tower, the
rear outriggers had been set on three; 12-inch by 7-inch by 85-inch
cribbing timbers, providing a bearing area of just over 21 square
feet. To reduce the loading to a level of 2000 psf.., it would
have been necessary to increase the bearing area to about 39 square
feet. This could have been accomplished by using appropriately
sized steel or timber mats under the outrigger pads. In either
case, the services of a certified professional engineer should
be consulted to assure that the mats are of sufficient size and
strength to support the crane and its load.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><IMG SRC="../Images/Tower-Figure.JPG" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="160" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Contributing
to the occurrence of the incident was the manner in which the
timbers were placed under the outriggers. As can be seen in Photos
4, 5, and 6, just prior to the incident, the cribbing timbers
were rolling out from under the outrigger pads and spreading away
from each other. Some crane companies we consulted always use
plywood or steel plates under outrigger timbers to minimize shifting
of the soil and/or cribbing rollout, even if they are setting
up on highway concrete. In addition, some operators use long bolts
through timbers to create a solid base, to prevent cribbing rollout
(See Figure)</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">In this case, it is apparent that the rear
outriggers were setup improperly. The ground was not leveled under
the outrigger, and cribbing timbers were not placed close together,
nor were other means taken to prevent cribbing rollout. It appears
that much of the hoisted load was transferred to the middle timber,
which was certainly not adequate to support the load. More significantly,
adequate bearing area to reduce the outrigger loading below 2000
psf.. may have prevented this incident.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>Recommendation # 2: </B><I>Crane set-ups
should be closely observed during lifting operations to detect
instability caused by changing load and ground conditions.</I></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>Discussion: </B>Evaluation of the incident
circumstances indicates that the ground under the right rear outrigger
had begun to fail early in the lift. As evidenced by Photo 4,
the ground under the outrigger was already failing, yet the hoisted
load was less than waist high above the ground. Had the ground
condition under the outrigger been detected and correctly assessed
at this point, there would have been time to lower the load and
change the outrigger set up to one that was more stable. During
the lift there were several workers on the ground, including the
owner of the tank company and the foreman of the crane crew. Once
the lift was begun, it lasted about 11 minutes, during which the
ground under the outrigger continued to fail to the point that
the lean of the crane caused it to become unstable and it fell
over. It seems likely that the attention of ground observers would
be focused on the lifted load and the workers on the water tower.
However, as a crane lifts and then swings its load into position,
the outrigger loading changes, increasing as the load is swung
over them. To detect potentially unstable conditions, the entire
crane setup should be observed during a lift.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>Recommendation # 3: </B><I>Prior to crane
operations, construction companies utilizing crane services as
well as the crane owners and operators should evaluate the soil
bearing capacity at the lift site to ensure that crane equipment
and procedures are compatible with site conditions.</I></P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>Discussion: </B>Prior to the incident,
there was information available that if it had been evaluated
could have indicated the need for additional measures or the use
of alternate lifting methods. The sub-soil characteristics, including
a 2000 psf.. bearing capacity, had been identified two months
prior to the lift. The crane operating manual contained information
from which outrigger loading could be estimated. The crane company
had experienced a similar incident in 1997, in which the soil
bearing capacity had not been properly considered when establishing
the practical working load of the crane. In both instances the
failing outrigger was setup on backfilled topsoil, which has no
approved load-bearing rating. Evaluation of this information may
have indicated that the crane and/or the lift procedures were
incompatible with the site conditions. It is not known if each
of the companies involved in this incident were aware of all the
information available. However, if the information had been shared
and correctly evaluated, the need for additional measures to ensure
crane stability or the use of an alternative type of crane may
have been recognized.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Much can be learned from the experience of
other crane operators around the country. WWW.craneaccidents.com
was created for this purpose, and is a lively forum to keep abreast
of developments, stories, accidents, opinions, etc. The tower
crane involved in this fatality was over 20 years old, and identical
units are successfully being used by other crane operators in
the USA. As more and more dialog takes place, operators will become
aware of crane hazards and adopt better habits of safety.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal"><B>Evaluation of Rear Outrigger Load</B>s</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The outrigger loading, or the pressure exerted
by the outrigger against the supporting ground, depends on the
load imposed on the outrigger by the weight of the crane and the
lifted load and the bearing area, the surface area between the
outrigger set up and the ground. The resulting pressure can be
calculated using the formula:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">P = F/A</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">Where: P is the pressure in pounds per square
foot (psf.), F is the load on the outrigger in pounds (lbs), and
A is the bearing area in square feet (sq.ft.).</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The manufacturer's operating manual for the
crane in this incident includes charts that contain values of
outrigger loads for various weights of lifted loads. These tables
list total load on each rear outrigger according to the load being
lifted.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The tables do not list values for loads generated
by a lifted load of 28,000 lbs, the empty weight of the tank.
However, the table lists a total load of 74,000 lbs for a 20,000
lbs lifted load and a total outrigger load of 78,000 lbs for a
30,000 lb lifted load. By interpolating between these two values,
the total load on each rear outrigger resulting from a 28,000
lb lifted load can be estimated to be about 77,200 pounds.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The rear outriggers of the crane in the incident
had been set up on 3; 12-inch wide by 7-inch high by 85-inch long
timbers providing a bearing area of 21.25 sq. ft.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The resulting outrigger loading can be estimated
using the previously mentioned formula:</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">P = 77,200 lbs/ 21.25 sq. ft.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">P = 3632.9 psf. ~ 3600 psf.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">The resulting outrigger loading of 3600 psf.,
is 1600 psf. above the certified 2000 psf. soil capacity at the
indicent site.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">By using the formula P=F/A, and solving for
A, the increased bearing area necessary to reduce the outrigger
loading to a level below 2000 psf. can be determined.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A = F/P</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A= 77,200 lbs / 2000 psf.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">A = 38.6 psf. ~39 sq. ft.</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</P>

<P class="MsoNormal">This should be considered the minimum bearing
area needed.</P>
