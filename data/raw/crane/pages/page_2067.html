CONTENT="The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has held a        leading international position in wildlife research and management since its                                         founding in 1936 as America's first wildlife experiment station and research refuge.
In 1940 there were less than 20 whooping cranes alive in the world. Changes in habitat, egg collecting, and hunting almost led to its extinction. There are now 188 whoopers in that wild flock, another 100 in captivity, and over 60 in an experimental flock in Florida. This recovery was directly due to conservation efforts, scientific research, and changes in land management.
	Unique to North America, the whooping crane stands 5 feet tall with a long neck and long legs. Its pure white body feathers are accented by jet black wing-tips and a red-and-black head with a long, pointed beak. The wings measure about 8 feet across.
	Breeding whooping cranes in captivity at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center began in 1967 with 12 eggs collected from the wild flock.  The Patuxent flock currently has 44 adults, with 9 experienced breeding pairs who generally lay around 50 eggs a year in total. From these eggs last year, we raised 26 chicks most of which were released in Florida.  ">

For whoopers, the                                                          rarest of all cranes, the annual count has been an                                                          environmental
      cliff-hanger for decades. In 1938, they were                                                          down to only 18 birds in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo flock,
      with                                                          only 11 remaining in the non-migratory
      Louisiana flock. Ten                                                          years later there were 31 birds in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo                                                          flock, but the
      Louisiana flock was down to a single bird. By                                                          1950, the Louisiana flock was gone. The
      Aransas-Wood                                                          Buffalo flock's numbers hovered on the edge of
      disaster for                                                          another decade. By 1964, there were still only 42 whooping                                                          cranes in the wild.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                                                          So, when a biologist doing aerial surveys
      in 1964 at Wood Buffalo Provincial Park (in Saskatchewan and Northwest
      Territories, Canada) discovered a young-of-the-year chick with a broken wing, he                                                          quickly took action. The chick's parents were aggressive,                                                          rushing the helicopter when it came too close. The biologist                                                          knew that the parents could keep the chick safe from                                                          predators, but soon they would have to migrate, and their chick                                                          wouldn't be able to follow them. He wouldn't survive long once                                                          they were gone.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                                                          The biologist contacted officials in Canada and the US, and                                                          was advised to capture the bird. They did so the next day,                                                          chasing the chick through the marshland until it tripped on its                                                          dangling primaries and fell.  The young crane, once captured,                                                          offered surprisingly little resistance. An x-ray showed a 2
      inch                                                          sliver of charred wood had pierced the bird's breast muscle                                                          and his wing was partially dislocated.  They speculated that he                                                          had struck a burnt tree during early flight practice. To                                                          everyone's surprise, the young crane showed no fear of his                                                          captors and readily accepted food including smelt, mealworms,                                                          hamburger and minced eggs.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                                                          The injured chick was later transferred to Monte Vista
      National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado where                                                          he did well until he suddenly became ill. Four veterinarians                                                          were brought in and treated the bird, who seemed near death.                                                          Amazingly, within a day the crane seemed to recover. But his                                                          bout of bad luck wasn't over. While exercising in his pen one                                                          morning, he caught a toe in the bandage on his injured wing                                                          and fell, breaking the wing in two places. Again, the vets                                                          repaired the wing and he again recovered.  It was shortly                                                          afterward that this young crane would be given the name
      &quot;Canus&quot; -- CAN for Canada and US for the United States.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                                                          In 1966, Canus was transferred to what was then the                                                          beginnings of the Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered                                                          species captive propagation program at the Patuxent Wildlife                                                          Research Center. Canus was the first whooper in the program,                                                          and would become, over his long life, the foundation sire of the                                                          captive flock. His adjustment to life in captivity was a major                                                          factor in his ability to thrive in this new environment. Unlike                                                          many wild-caught animals, he never showed fear of his                                                          caretakers, and once he matured, would be quite aggressive to                                                          them, especially during breeding season.<br>
      <br>
                                                          His injured wing would eventually be amputated. Without two                                                          fully functional wings, Canus could not breed naturally. And so                                                          the biologists at Patuxent developed an Artificial Insemination                                                          (AI) program so that Canus, and other whooper males who                                                          were not fully-flighted, could reproduce. With such small                                                          numbers, every individual whooper was genetically valuable.&nbsp;
      As Patuxent's endangered species program developed, eggs                                                          from Wood Buffalo were brought here to hatch, to develop a                                                          captive breeding flock that would genetically represent the                                                          wild flock in Aransas. This captive flock would be a safeguard                                                          -- a genetic back-up -- in case disaster wiped out the remaining                                                          wild birds.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                                                          Those early years were devoted to building the breeding flock                                                          and learning how to propagate whooping cranes. All the while,                                                          the numbers in the wild crept up slowly but surely. In 1966,                                                          when Canus came here, there were 43 birds in the wild. In                                                          1976, there were 69. Meanwhile, the scientists at Patuxent                                                          were discovering just how much there was to learn about the                                                          care, feeding, and propagation of whooping cranes.&nbsp;<br>

                                                          All through the growth of Patuxent's breeding flock, the                                                          development of proper incubation techniques, the perfecting of                                                          AI, the development of health care protocols, nutritional                                                          formulas, medical techniques, and chick rearing techniques,                                                          Canus was there.
      <font FACE="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Because he was such a
      long-term subject for Patuxent's experiments, he literally taught us much

      here on many other female                                                          whoopers.&nbsp;
      It was even shipped, cryogenically                                                          preserved, to other facilities with whooping crane females.                                                          Over the years, he and his mate raised many chicks
      together,                                                          and were fiercely protective parents. Canus was surprisingly                                                          healthy, after his initial rocky start, but he did have a bout of                                                          illness during the
      1980s that he recovered from, and in the last                                                          five years he had some minor problems due to arthritis in his                                                          spine. We moved a panel heater into his pen in the hopes that                                                          would
      help and it may have, but we never actually saw him use it.&nbsp; He always knew when he was being observed. At the first site                                                          of humans approaching his pen, Canus and Mrs. C would start                                                          going through their threat displays, letting everyone know that                                                          if they were thinking of coming in his pen, there would be                                                          trouble!<br>

                                                          We first talked about Canus in these reports in

      At that                                                          time, we were following the progress of a young chick destined                                                          to be released in Florida, and Canus was that chick's                                                          grandparent.

                                                          Over the course of his long life, Canus was responsible for 186
      whoopers, as sire, grand-sire, great-grandsire and beyond.&nbsp; That's four times the number of whoopers who were alive the                                                          year he was captured. His descendents today are flying free<br>
                                                          from Wisconsin to Florida and reproducing naturally in the wild                                                          in Central Florida. Today, there are nearly 420 whooping                                                          cranes in the world -- ten times as many as the year he was                                                          captured. Canus was no small part of that.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                                                          Early in the morning of Saturday, January 18, Canus was                                                          found down in his feedshed near his heater. The technicians,                                                          Barb and Brian, experienced in emergency crane care, rushed                                                          him to the veterinary hospital on Center, and after placing him                                                          in a heated pen, contacted both the veterinarian on duty, Dr.                                                          Patty Bright, and our regular veterinarian, Dr.
      Olsen, who was                                                          attending crane meetings in California. In a short time, Canus                                                          began to rally, lifting his head, looking around, and even<br>
                                                          attempting to stand. Canus was only a few weeks shy of 39                                                          years, and had had other sudden bouts of illness, but had                                                          always recovered, so we had hopes that this would follow that                                                          pattern. Dr. Bright treated Canus with injectable fluids and                                                          steroids, and consulted with Dr. Olsen about an appropriate                                                          treatment regimen for the next few days. They decided to also                                                          administer antibiotics, and continue fluids and steroids until the                                                          bird was well enough for diagnostic blood work, which might                                                          tell them more about the nature of the problem.<br>
      <br>
                                                          Unfortunately, despite Canus' attempt to rally, he died during                                                          treatment a few hours later. It was a terrible shock to all of us.&nbsp;
      In spite of his age, Canus had always fought back against the                                                          odds and had always been so
      strong-- it was hard to imagine                                                          anything defeating him.&nbsp;<br>

                                                          To the people who care about the fate of endangered species,                                                          the numbers of animals is a natural focus. How few, how many.&nbsp;
      For those of us who work with these rare animals, each                                                          individual under our care is special, unique to themselves, and                                                          valuable. In the course of our daily work, we discover their                                                          personalities, their individual quirks, and become totally                                                          involved in their welfare and that of their offspring. In many                                                          ways, Canus embodied our mission -- he survived against                                                          incredible obstacles, thrived, and showed a wonderful spirit
      and will to live. Even while we grieve his loss, we have to                                                          celebrate the success that was his life. And in the offspring he                                                          has left us, he'll live on, both here at Patuxent, and free in the                                                          wild.<br>
