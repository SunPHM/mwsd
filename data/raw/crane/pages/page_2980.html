<P>A favorite and the largest group of true butterflies is now
being seen regularly on the wing, the brush-footed butterflies.
All are medium-sized and noted for their strong flight.  People
throughout the world enjoy these butterflies, and a few, such as
the mourning cloak, are seen on several continents.  People in
England call this large hardy butterfly the Camberwell beauty.

<P>Even though there is plenty of diversity within this amazing
group, there is one feature that can be seen on all of the
species.  Their front legs are very stunted in size, are of
little to no help to the butterflies in walking, and are usually
held tightly up against their bodies.

<P>We have observed at least 16 species of the brushfoots on or
near our property.   They include the banded purple or white
admiral, viceroy, red admiral, painted lady, American lady,
buckeye, Compton’s tortoise-shell, Milbert’s tortoise-shell,
mourning cloak, question-mark, comma, pearl crescent-spot, and
four of the fritillaries, the silver-bordered, meadow, great
spangled and aphrodite.  The 17<SUP>th</SUP>, the Baltimore, was
seen in the southern part of the county.

<P>There are two good-sized flowerbeds on our property that are
reaching their peak of bloom.  One, the common milkweed, is
naturally quite wild and is known by many students of nature as
one of the host plants of the larvae of the monarch butterflies
(not one of the brushfoots).  Fortunately the large extremely
fragrant clusters of flowers on the tall milkweed plants, loaded
with nectar, also attract many insects including butterflies.


<P>The other flowerbed reaching the peak of bloom in our
butterfly garden contains a few dozen purple coneflowers.  What
an excellent hardy perennial this is for attracting and feeding
many butterflies.  It’s one of our favorites.  Right now the
butterfly that is becoming a regular customer at the coneflowers’
outpouring of nectar is the great spangled fritillary,
Wisconsin’s most widespread fritillary.

<P>Provide these large strong fliers several rather simple but
basic requirements and you may have them on the wing, without
fail, every year starting as early as late May and extending
throughout the month of August.  Number one: their larvae eat the
leaves of violets, so these common plants are required.  Number
two: sunny woodland openings will provide the butterflies
protection from strong winds.  Finally, the adult great spangled
fritillaries are very fond of the nectar of a number of flowers.


<P>Any of the annuals, such as zinnias, that offer both good
landing platforms and copious supplies of nectar will appeal to
the great spangled.  And as I previously mentioned, the purple
coneflowers are pure magic in attracting these dazzling
butterflies.

<P>What an unusual life history this butterfly, known for its
erratic, zigzagging flight, has.  Males, which sometimes emerge
as early as late May, and females which usually emerge around
three weeks later, are both on the wing now and will soon be in
the process of mating.

<P>Eggs will be laid in August or even into early September
either on the leaves of the violets, garden pansies (also in the
violet genus), or at least on grasses or other plants in the
vicinity of the violet.  As soon as the eggs hatch, the tiny
caterpillars eat the egg cases and promptly fall to the ground
and down into the forest duff.

<P>Subsisting on only the infinitesimal meal of the egg case, the
caterpillars will crawl beneath some protective cover where they
will miraculously spend the entire winter neither drying out nor
freezing.  Next spring they will crawl out of their woodland
floor quarters and onto the young, tender, emerging violet
leaves.  What adds more mystery to their strange habits is the
fact that they feed only during the night.  Don’t look for them
during daylight hours because they don’t even remain on their
host plants, the violets.  They have crawled elsewhere to
hide.

<P>These black larvae are easily identified by their sort
branched spines that are orange-red at their bases.  Their growth
is fast and usually by June they have reached maximum size, will
form into their chrysalids and will emerge several weeks later as
adults.

<P>How fortunate we all should be for the rich biodiversity of
our wonderful state, the incredible great spangled fritillary
included!
