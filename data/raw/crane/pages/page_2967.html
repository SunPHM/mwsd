April – the earth
is “opening up” and you can smell the invigorating bouquet!

<p>Almost
unbelievably there have been years when the earliest of the area’s wildflowers,
the trailing arbutus and hepaticas, were in bloom before the end of March.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, March and April weather, being
extremely fickle at best, will determine their opening this year.

<p>The reason
trailing arbutus can produce such extremely early blossoms is that the buds
were already well formed by last fall. To satisfy your own curiosity once the snow has finally melted, hike a
trail where you know these fragrant beauties grow, kneel down and gently lift
the leaves and woody stems for a look. Believe me, you’ll find the ready-to-open flower buds.

<p>There is one rare
wildflower that I am determined to find blooming in Door County one of these
Aprils, the snow trillium, <i>Trillium
nivale</i> (ni-VAY-le). I know of
several sites in Manitowoc and Brown counties, and if they grow well there, I
strongly suspect that they should be found here too. We’ve seen them in full
bloom in Brown County between April
15-20.

<p>I am convinced
that snow trilliums are seldom found and enjoyed by people simply because most
woods “go begging” in April for people visitors. During your explorations, remember to always obtain permission
from the property owners to hike on their land.  Another point to bear in mind is that the criminal law of
trespass in our state protects ALL wildflowers and other plants from diggers
and pickers, even though the plants may be growing in ditches or along
roadsides.

<p>Even though many
of our native wildflowers are automatically labeled “Mayflowers,” our
phenological records of the first opening of wildflowers in our woods in recent
years hopefully will get some of you thinking wildflowers this month. Here are a few of the first blossoming
dates: hepaticas – April 5-10, bloodroots – April 12, Trout lilies and spring
beauties – April 21, and wood anemone, giant trilliums, Dutchman’s breeches,
and bellworts – April 27. About
one-third of our giant trilliums were in bloom last year by April 30.

<font size=-2 color=000000>Skunk cabbage surrounded by snow.</font>

<p>Just to set the
record straight, our woods, roughly in the middle of the county from east to
west, is around 150 feet higher in elevation and warmer than land close to Lake
Michigan where cold winds off the lake naturally retard the flowering of most
plants. There is one exception,
however, the skunk cabbage. This is the
very first wildflower of the year to bloom in the low, cold cedar swamps
usually during the first week of April in this area, long before the fat little
buds of the marsh marigolds (cowslips) even begin to emerge.

<p>Skunk cabbages
don’t “jump up at you” like many wildflowers do in a sense.
They retire from sight.
In fact some people would take one look at
them and see nothing whatsoever resembling a flower. It is one of the several related plants that display no leaves
(at least very small at best) at flowering time, such as the Jack-in-the-pulpit
and the green dragon.

<p>The fanfare I hear
them play to the common man is that loathsome titles may veil much loveliness
and worth. Any plant that muscles its
way through layers of snow and ice is worthy of one’s admiration. Remember that all skunk odors do not emanate
from four-legged black and white “perfume dispensers!” However, one has to practically crush the
plant to receive even the slightest skunky odor from it.

<font size=-2 color=000000>The fox sparrow, Door County's transient visitor
with the golden voice.</font>

<p>Last year on April
2 Charlotte stepped out onto the south-facing deck at our home at 6:15 A.M. and
heard the singing of the eastern phoebe, American robin, herring gulls, eastern
meadowlark, American crow, mourning dove, sandhill cranes, and the drumming of
the ruffed grouse. There were still
many dark-eyed juncos along with several fox sparrows feasting at the cracked
corn on the ground in the front yard.

<p>April is sparrow
month in Door County. Expect to see and
hopefully hear the song, white-throated, white-crowned, fox, field, swamp,
chipping, grasshopper, vesper, clay-colored, Savannah and tree. The white-crowned, fox and tree sparrows are
either transient or winter visitors and will be here only temporarily.
It is on pleasantly warm early April days
that one can luck onto hearing the exquisite singing of especially the fox and
tree sparrows.

<p>We refer to the
pugnacious fox sparrows as those transient visitors with the golden voices.
Surely they possess one of the most
delicately sweet voices of all those species that are with us for only a brief
spell during their spring migration. Several years ago 13 inches of snow fell in early April and temporarily
stalled their migration, and it was then that we obtained such good photos and
sound recordings of these large, hardy, brightly marked birds.

<p>Loren Eisely, one
of my favorite authors, wrote: “We cannot in one lifetime see all that we’d
like to see, or learn all that we hunger to know.” (But it’s fun trying!)

<p>
More and more we
want to send our roots deeper and deeper in one place, to learn the land and
its native inhabitants well, to get to “feel at home. What an incredibly wonderful, nature-rich
place Door County is in April! Let’s
keep it that way!
