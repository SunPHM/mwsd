<P>Following the death of my friend Drew Lynch to AIDS, I composed this film using 
  footage of him and myself. This poetic journey leaps from New York City to the 
  desert in a shot my Bolex recorded while spiraling out the window of a 5th floor 
  apartment. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Everything is far <BR>
and long gone by. <BR>
I think that the star <BR>
glittering above me <BR>
has been dead for a million years. <BR>
I think there were tears <BR>
in the car I heard pass <BR>
and something terrible was said. <BR>
A clock has stopped striking in the house <BR>
across the road ... <BR>
When did it start? ... <BR>
I would like to step out of my heart <BR>
and go walking beneath the enormous sky. <BR>
I would like to pray. <BR>
And surely of all the stars that perished <BR>
long ago, <BR>
one still exists. <BR>
I think that I know <BR>
which one it is - <BR>
which one, at the end of its beam in the sky, <BR>
stands like a white city ....

<P><B>Not for Nothin'</B> 
<P>Awarded Best Black-and-White Cinematography in a Short Film at the 1996 Cork 
  International Film Festival, NOT FOR NOTHIN' is dreamy yet streetsmart, lushly 
  photographed and spiked with wit. Rodney O'Neal Austin's distinctly modern, 
  tongue-in-cheek vamping eschews campiness in favor of an air of gothic mystery, 
  playing full tribute to the screen goddess Louise Brooks." - Michael Fox, COVERArts, 
  New York 
<P>An homage to early sound film, a sensualist's dream that follows an androgynous 
  cabaret performer on his search for the Beloved. A poetic narrative whose excessive, 
  expressive visual style insists on the insertion of the androgyne/queer protagonist 
  into an historic epoch of cinema from which he/she was absent or merely inferred: 
  the late silent era. A document of San Francisco performer and visual artist 
  Rodney O'Neal Austin (the film's co-conceptualist) and his band Minnie Pearl 
  Necklace. Visual art by Meg Mack and Diane Hopkins, music by Beth Custer and 
  a cameo by Jose Sarria, the legendary chanteuse of the historic Black Cat Club.

<P> <B>Sketches After Halle</B> 
<P>French writer Marguerite Yourcenar, reflecting on her novel Memoirs of Hadrian 
  said, "the distance I bridge between myself and Hadrian is above all, the distance 
  which separated me from my true self." This project began as a document of the 
  East German town of Halle where I'd traveled with my German lover in 1991. It 
  was post-reunification, and I was struck by this desolate ghost town. While 
  working with the footage five years later, my memory of Halle opened onto the 
  life of Bauhaus painter Lyonel Feininger (recalling a retrospective of his Halle 
  paintings when I was there). Research into his letters led me to his wife Julia, 
  who in translating his letters but not her own had written the autobiography 
  of her own absence. Combining my own text images with those of Feininger, this 
  autobiographical portrait of my own absence longs for a time and a relationship 
  that slipped away.
