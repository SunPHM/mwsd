        Coan Construction Company Inc. </font></b></i></p>
      <p align="center"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+3" color="#FF0000">Coan 
        Construction Company, Inc.- <br>
        <font size="+2">Not Afraid To Try New Things</font></font></b></p>
      <p>In 1974 Tom Coan started a small concrete construction company in the 
        hopes of providing for his family's needs in the future. He wanted a place 
        for his two sons to grow up and belong when they were old enough to work 
        and most of all he wanted to provide exceptional quality of workmanship 
        to the Southern California construction community. </p>
      <p>Coan Construction was incorporated in 1977 after the company's operations 
        had been well underway for three years. Tom Coan worked for a major general 
        contractor for many years and went as far as he could with the company 
        he had ties to. His son Jeff had started a construction equipment rental 
        company, while his younger son, Perry finished up high school. Tom Coan 
        had succeeded in venturing out on his own and created a thriving endeavor 
        to hand over to his sons. When he started the company, both Jeff and Perry 
        contributed to the well being of the operations.</p>
      <p align="center"><i><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><img src="../images/Concrete2002OCT/APU-2.jpg" width="300" height="119"><img src="../images/Concrete2002OCT/APU.jpg" width="200" height="119"><br>

        </font></b></i></p>
      <p> Jeff started renting equipment to the fledgling concrete construction 
        firm before the two companies were eventually folded together in the late 
        70's. Perry worked on the grounds and projects as a laborer and graduated 
        in '81, while his older brother was operating much of the equipment for 
        the major projects. Soon thereafter, Perry became a laborer for 4 years 
        and stepped into the shoes of an operating engineer at about the same 
        time Jeff found a permanent place in the office. Today, both Perry and 
        Jeff can be found in the main offices estimating and managing various 
        ongoing projects. </p>
      <p>In those maneuvers, Coan Construction, Inc. uses a number of makes and 
        models of equipment to complete their daily tasks. One of the more unique 
        aspects of the company is that they are one of the few concrete contracting 
        companies to own all of their concrete machinery as opposed to renting. 
        Currently, the operating engineers lend their expertise to either a John 
        Deere 310 or 410 backhoe, a 210 skip with a laser guided attachment, a 
        Case 1845 Skid Steer, an FMC 18-ton crane, Broderson 5-ton cranes, or 
        a collection of Schwing concrete pumps including their latest 28 meter 
        boom pump. </p>

        Coan Construction's new office pictured under construction in Pomona, 
        CA. </font></b></i></p>
      <p>Coan Construction, Inc. averages around 100 employees, who include carpenters, 
        laborers, and masons, operating engineers, administrative staff and so 
        on. Founder, Tom Coan, fully retired about three years ago, leaving Jeff, 
        Perry, two other estimators, and a total of four administrative staffers 
        downstairs. Jeff Coan serves as the President of the company while Perry 
        functions as the Vice President. Perry's wife, Sharon, works as the Controller, 
        while Gene Gottowski lends his talents as the Field Supervisor. Vince 
        LaSala, the Concrete Superintendent was the company's second hire and 
        has been there longer than anyone in the field. According to Perry the 
        employees who have been with them for as long, or longer than himself, 
        make up the strength of the company. Without that strength, the company 
        would not have made it through many of the challenging years. </p>

      <p>Those challenges have reared their heads in many ways according to Perry. 
        In his experience, the industry as a whole has created a greater need 
        for project management and administration. "There is more of an air of 
        professionalism on the business end. There are no more deals made with 
        a handshake," he said. Most recently, Coan Construction's daily operations 
        were disrupted in good and bad ways. Over the course of a year, the main 
        yard and offices in Pomona were a flurry of constructing activity. The 
        end result yielded a new 5,000 sq. ft. office facility as well as a 10.000 
        sq. ft. shop on an acre and a half. They did all of the concrete and framing 
        work themselves, including a 14 x 5-foot concrete conference table, a 
        logo inset entry wall and a pre-cast logo inset monument. </p>

      <p>Having their central location in the city of Pomona, Coan Construction, 
        Inc. has had a middle jumping off spot to perform much of the services 
        they provide. They work form Palm Springs to Oceanside and the Pacific 
        Ocean and have gone as far north as San Luis Obispo. Perry Coan stated 
        that they do site/architectural concrete work as a service to larger structural 
        jobs, but they do not actively search it out. Much of their contracted 
        work includes structural foundations, elevated decks, slab on grade, cast-in-place 
        walls for hospitals, schools, retail office buildings, parking structures, 
        etc. Parking structures include both cast-in-place and pre-cast buildings. 
        They have provided services for much of the entertainment industry, such 
        as the concrete work at the soon to be completed, Tower of Terror at Disneyland 
        and various parts of Downtown Disney. The footing work ranges from 2x2 
        continuous footing and 1000 cubic yard matt footings depending on the 
        job. </p>

      <p>Apart from the everyday stresses of the concrete contracting and construction 
        industry, many of the members of the staff, including Jeff and Perry like 
        to ride dirt bikes in the Mojave Desert, Death Valley, Big Bear Mountains, 
        Sierra Nevada mountains, etc. According to Perry, they put together "events" 
        for company participation and usually have about 4-5 employees and a number 
        of other friends in the construction industry come to play. "We study 
        maps and plot routes through the desert and use GPS to go anywhere from 
        100-300 miles a day," said Perry.</p>
      <p> In the competitive markets of construction bidding and estimating, companies 
        with specializations in concrete such as Coan Construction, Inc. have 
        their work cut out for them in more than one way. Coan Construction Co., 
        Inc. has been able to adapt to the needs of a changing industry, which 
        has allowed them to rise above others in their related field. "These are 
        very difficult jobs to perform," said Perry. "There is a running question 
        with many of the guys that jokingly asks, Œwhy can't we get a straight-lined 
        box of a building to work on?' We get the crazy plans, but our guys love 
        it and we have never been afraid to try something new or challenging."
