				<li type="disc"><b>Rodeo</b> - In summer and early fall there are rodeos almost every weekend.

				<p>The <b>fishing</b> is incredible, in rivers and lakes and, if you dare, take a dip on one of the many hot summer days. With your own <b>canoe or kayak</b>, you can explore one of the lake-chains. For <b>rafting,</b> the Chilko, Chilcotin and Fraser rivers range from smooth flat water to wild white water, in amazing scenery. Rafting outfitters (e.g. <a title="Rafting with Chilko River Expeditions" href="http://www.chilkoriver.com/" target="_blank">Chilko River Expeditions</a>) offer various trips.</p>
