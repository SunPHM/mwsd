      <font SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Logistics is a key factor of any military operation,
      whether it is during a crisis or for humanitarian operations - providing
      equipment, supplies and enabling personnel to maneuver is the first step.
      An important part in this year’s Cobra Gold is the dispatch of equipment
      which will enable US military forces to participate in the exercise.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_1_458.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="140"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">The
      Gopher State, one of 10 crane ships, measures in at 668.6 feet (approx 215
      meters) long, with a displacement of 31,500 tons and can be used as a
      floating port/terminal in situations where there are no facilities or
      where the port facilities have been destroyed in a military operation. The
      ship was involved with operations in the Gulf War.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well before the troops assemble for the exercise, four
      U.S. Naval ships have been busily unloading their cargo at Chuck Samet,
      Sattahip. They are the MV 1st Lt. Jack Lummus, at 675 ft 2 inches (approx.
      220 meters) long, the MV PFC Dewayne T. Williams at 673 ft 2 inches (218
      meters) long, the big daddy of the contingent, the USNS Seay at 950 feet
      (approx. 318 meters) long and the SS Gopher State crane ship, acting as a
      portable terminal.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_2_458.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="152"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">U.S.
      Navy Squadron Three Commander, Commodore William D. Daniels, in charge of
      the prepositioning exercises said, “It’s great to be a part of these
      exercises and we are happy to be here in Thailand.”</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These floating warehouses are part of the Military
      Sealift Command (MSC) and with the exception of the SS Gopher state, one
      squadron can carry enough equipment to support over 14,000 combat
      personnel for up to 30 days of a military operation, providing vital
      equipment such as armored personnel carriers, amphibious vehicles, tanks,
      construction vehicles, ammunition, medical and foods supplies.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_3_458.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="100" height="195"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">Captain
      Landon Hutchens, Public Affairs Officer attached to Cobra Gold with the
      U.S. Marine Corps addresses the media.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of these ships are packed full of equipment, with
      the positioning and placement of each item an exact science, balancing the
      cargo accordingly when loading and unloading. The vessels are capable of
      doing this in port, or out of port as is the case in Chuck Samet where
      equipment has been loaded on to floating barges and transported to shore
      where the SS Gopher State then lifts the heavy equipment onto land.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U.S. Navy Squadron Three Commander, Commodore William
      D. Daniels, in charge of the prepositioning exercises said, “It’s
      great to be a part of these exercises and we are happy to be here in
      Thailand.” This is Commodore Daniels’ first visit to Thailand. He also
      spoke warmly about the Thai people and the good cooperation between the US
      and Thai forces during the setup stages for Cobra Gold 2002.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The Ships</p>
      </font></b>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ships are privately owned and leased to the US
      government on 25-year contracts. Civilian merchant mariners crew them,
      with only minimal military personnel onboard. When asked why this was so,
      the response was, “If we were to use Navy personnel the amount of crew
      would effectively be tripled by the true nature of procedure. This way,
      vessels can operate with a sufficient amount of crew at considerably less
      expense.” All of the civilian crewmembers are experienced mariners. They
      are provided with military training and are kept informed of the relevant
      safety measures required by the navy. The training is updated annually.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_4_458.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="152"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">Captain
      Tim McCann (center) of the SS Gopher State and his chief officers take a
      breather from their hard work getting ready for Cobra Gold 2002.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One doesn’t realize the size and capacity of these
      vessels until one is on board. The first stop of our tour was the MV 1st
      Lt. Jack Lummus. The ‘Lummus’ as it is called, is part of the MSC’s
      sixteen large medium container roll-on/roll-off ships. It is a “mere”
      675 ft 2 inches long (approx. 220 meters) with a total displacement of
      46,111 tons and top speed of 17.7 knots.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It can store up to 480 vehicles of varying sizes. The
      cranes on the ship can lift 39 tons each or work in unison for heavier
      equipment such the M1 Tank for army personnel or graders used by the
      Construction Battalion.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_5_458.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="115"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">(L
      to R) Senior Chief Scott Williams, Public Affairs Officer from Amphibious
      Group 3 of the U.S. Navy, Dub Allen, Public Affairs Officer for MSC Far
      East, and Major Joe Piek, Public Affairs Officer.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The MV PFC Dewayne T. Williams, at a “tiny” 673 ft
      2inches (218 meters) holds similar capacity and speed to the ‘Lummus’
      and has a crew of 32.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third and largest in this contingent is the USNS
      SEAY, part of the MSCs nineteen large medium roll-on/roll-off ships. It
      measures in at 950 feet (approx. 318 meters) with a displacement of 62,069
      tons and reaches speeds up to 24 knots. This vessel stands out like an
      icon in the ocean, dwarfing all other vessels close by.</p>

      of 32.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its 4 starboard cranes are able to lift a combined
      weight of 120 tons, working individually or in unison, providing a quick
      turn around of loading or unloading of heavy equipment. The ship was built
      in 1972 and then converted to a crane ship in 1986. It has permanent
      ballast (which provides balance) enabling it to lift heavy loads without
      any significant shift in the center of gravity, even with extra long booms
      on its 4 cranes.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_8_458.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="287"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">Equipment
      is packed in tight about the MV 1st Lt. Jack Lummus, where the positioning
      and placement, loading and unloading of each item is an exact science.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Captain Tim McCann, who has served on the ‘Gopher
      State’ said that the ship was involved with operations in the Gulf War.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each of the ships is loaded and deployed for 3 year
      stints, after which they return to their main base in the US for
      refurbishment. The Maritime Prepositioning Force’s (MPF) concept of
      operations calls for U.S. Marine Corps and Navy support personnel to fly
      to a contingency site concurrently with the Maritime Prepositioning
      Squadron sailings. Once personnel have arrived in the theater of
      operations, the ships are off-loaded and Marines can quickly move into
      combat. It is an essential element of the US Navy’s capability providing
      efficient sea transportation of vital equipment and supplies to specific
      operations areas in any amount of time.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">Cobra Gold 2002</p>
      </font></b>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cobra Gold 2002 is a regularly-scheduled joint/combined
      exercise and is the latest in the continuing series of U. S. - Thai
      military exercises designed to ensure regional peace and strengthen the
      ability of the Royal Thai Armed Forces to defend Thailand or respond to
      regional contingencies. The official exercises commence this coming
      Tuesday, May 14.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_9_458.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="299"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">Flying
      Humvies? No, the Gopher State’s crane make sure they don’t have to.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the newest additions to this year’s Cobra Gold
      is the High Speed Vessel (HSV) for the Marine Corps. This new type of
      vessel, part of the Marine Expeditionary force is a new chapter in
      logistics. The HSV, as it is referred to, is a high speed catamaran
      capable of maintaining a speed of 33 knots fully loaded with 970
      passengers. Its= 32,000 square feet (approx. 10,000 sq.m) is used to carry
      an entire battalion of marines and equipment.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Cobra Gold is not about equipment alone, the
      most important aspect is people. People are required to operate equipment,
      people are required to interact and promote relations. Cobra Gold 2002 is
      more important than ever. Planning commenced in September 2001 and is
      realized today as one of the largest exercises involving U. S. Forces in
      the Pacific Command this year.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><img border="1" src="f1_10_458.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="200" height="139"><b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" color="#800000">US
      Marines check out the equipment in a state-of-the-art transport vehicle.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year’s exercise will focus the participants on
      peace enforcement operations and will include the planning and execution
      of noncombatant evacuation operations, as these types of military
      operations are increasingly called for in today’s world.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent example is the U. S., Thailand and Singapore
      armed forces involvement in the peacekeeping mission in East Timor.</p>

      tactical experiences between all participants.”</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As in all previous Cobra Gold exercises, this exercise
      will include joint-combined land, sea and air operations.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approximately 14,000 U. S. forces will participate,
      including elements of U. S. Army, U. S. Marine Corps Forces, U. S. Pacific
      Air Forces; as well as Special Operations Command Pacific, Air Combat
      Command, Air Mobility Command (AMC), Military Sealift Command (MSC) and
      reserve elements from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Participating Thai Forces will number approximately
      7,000 and will include elements of the Royal Thai Army, Navy, Marine Corps
      and Air Force.</p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Major Tom Russell said, “The benefits of these
      exercises are far reaching for the region. It provides an opportunity to
      share technical and tactical experiences between all participants.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Other benefits include the ability to refine and
      streamline arrival and assembly procedures. We are doing this strictly by
      the book. The practice of force generation is a critical part of any
      operation, whether it is responding to a crisis or providing humanitarian
      aid, we can purify huge amounts of water and provide facilities up to 500
      hospital beds,” added the major.</p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also said, “The rapid deployment and assembly of
      the MPF is vital and we can be in any coastal waters within 7 steaming
      days. We can cope with any operations small or large as it (MPF) is
      scalable and flexible.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year’s Cobra Gold will also feature a more
      realistic approach with both aggressive and reactive forces, including
      live ammunition training.</p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“It will be a win-win situation,” said the major.
      The lessons learned from the Cobra Gold exercises will enable all
      participating forces to evolve professionally and personally, learning
      from each other, benefiting their country and culture.-</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whilst in Thailand, visiting U.S. Forces will also
      conduct Community Relations Service Projects (Comrels) in which military
      personnel will interact with the local society building, painting,
      sharing, teaching and learning in helping to create a better relationship
      with people of Thailand.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">The Big Picture</p>
      </font></b>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cobra Gold is just a small part in the overall scheme
      of things. As mentioned it provides training for all participants,
      developing and refining skills that can be used in real life situations.

      <p ALIGN="justify">The Camillian Social Center in Rayong currently gives
      assistance to 76 people infected with HIV/Aids (49 adults, 27 children).
      Much is involved in prevention programs in Rayong Province and its
      HIV/Aids network in the South-East Region.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Starting on January 29th 1996 with the opening of the
      Palliative Care Unit and Mothers and Children Unit of the Center, three
      years later, on November 27th 1999, a house for orphaned children infected
      with AIDS was opened.</p>

      <p ALIGN="justify">This supervised environment gives victims of AIDS a
      chance to grow up in an atmosphere of love and acceptance. Since the
      children are all being treated with retroviral medicine, they are able to
      perform normal activities. Some of them are even attending public schools
      and are not only good students but participate in all general educational
      activities.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Since its inception, the Camillian Social Center Rayong
      has provided assistance to 633 AIDS infected people. Three hundred and
      forty two have died, but an amazing number of two hundred and fifteen have
      returned to society and are leading normal lives.</p>

      Giovianni proudly looks on while Bishop Lorenz Thienchai and Dr. Somsak
      declare the facilities open.</font></i></b></p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The Center made another big step forward on April 20th
      with the opening of a new building where a group of eight sick people and
      four children, together with a “house-mother” are now accommodated.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The Bishop of Chantaburi, Monsignor Lawrence Thienchai
      Samanchit blessed the new building during a well-attended gathering in the
      presence of the benefactors who financed this project, including Carolyn
      Tarrant, MBE of the British Community in Thailand and president of the
      Foundation for the Needy and Fr. Anthony Lafeber, the president of Sanoek
      Foundation in Holland.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The Camillian Social Center wishes to express its
      gratitude to the sponsors for their support:</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">British Community of Thailand Foundation for the Needy:
      600,000 baht</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Sanoek Foundation Holland: 600,000 baht</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Local and foreign benefactors: 155,000 baht</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The second important event was held on the same day,
      April 20, when the project “Sharing for Life” finally became a
      reality. This project will be a milestone in the life of a group of
      fifteen families who are affected and infected by the HIV virus.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The idea started when Ciap, a widow of an AIDS infected
      man, decided to share her experiences and her small business with other
      victims.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Her business was making dolls and toys out of pieces of
      material to simply survive after her husband’s death. Ciap worked under
      a small roof in difficult conditions for years. She eventually realized
      that she wanted to share her experiences with others in need of a job or a
      reasonable income.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Fr. Giovianni Contarin helped her to coordinate fund
      raising and give some input into the HIV association in order to come up
      with new ideas for this project. Soon, under the guidance of the HIV/AIDS
      network of South-East Thailand, with its president Moo and the financial
      support of Dr. Somsak and Patima Leesriwatakul, a small factory was
      commissioned to be built. Dr. Somsak and Patama offered 200,000 baht as
      financial assistance and Ciap offered her own small piece of land of 1,000
      square meters in the Ban Chan District.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Now fifteen women are producing dolls and toys and
      generating an income sufficient to provide a life with dignity for
      themselves and their families, who all are seriously affected by the
      spread of HIV.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">A small amount of the weekly income is set aside to
      finance activities amongst the members of this group, to train newcomers,
      to help other needy people and to provide some relaxation and enjoyment
      after working hours. This project and its concept are quite new in
      Thailand. It takes a lot of effort, dedication and tireless support by the
      HIV sufferers and the HIV/AIDS network to bring this project to a fruitful
      success.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Dr. Somsak attended the opening ceremony and, cutting
      the ribbon, declared the “Sharing for Life” facilities open. Bishop
      Lorenz Thienchai conducted the official blessing and prayer service. The
      Camillian Social Center thanks its supporters and friends who have worked
      so tirelessly through the past seven years.</p>

      <p ALIGN="justify">During the launch, the artists themselves played for
      the boisterous crowd such tunes as “Stairway to Heaven” and “Smoke
      on the Water” from Pop and the guys. Declan performed his easy listening
      numbers like “Short People” and “Easy Like Sunday Morning”, while
      the Rick, Harpic, Jill trio rounded the evening up numbers such as
      “Nutbush” and “Hit Me with your Best Shot”.</p>

      assist in the year’s Jesters Care for Kids campaign, which includes the

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 12 months anniversary of the Royal Cliff Wine Club
      was celebrated with an Australian Winemaker’s Dinner in the ballroom of
      the Royal Cliff Grand. These events just seem to get better and better and
      the full-house turnout of 120 eager diners was testament to the popularity
      of these gustatory evenings.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The winemaker being featured was Wolf Blass wines and
      Ranjith Chandrasiri, the captain of the wine club, had managed to procure
      the services of John Glaetzer, the chief wine maker for the Wolf Blass
      label. This man has won the premier award in wines, the Jimmy Watson
      Trophy, four times and has amassed more than 3,000 other awards with his
      wines.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">John turned out to be a very relaxed and laconic
      Australian, who commenced his address by saying, “When I started with
      Wolfie in 1966 we had one secretary and 50 barrels. I married the
      secretary so the staff went down to two, Wolfie and me. Now we’ve got
      4000 staff and I said to Wolfie the other day that my wages hadn’t gone
      up correspondingly. He replied that in the old days I didn’t work hard
      enough.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">John Glaetzer’s main thrust these days is in the
      production of red wines and he reassured the diners that if they ran out
      he would get some more made for them straight away. Interestingly, he
      recommends that red wine should be served between 16-18 degrees Celsius.
      He does still have an interest in the white wines, even the sparkling
      ones, and claimed his job is to count the bubbles.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">With executive chef Walter Thenisch importing
      Australian delicacies as Tasmanian salmon and Gippsland lamb to finish
      with Australian cheese including the championship winning King Island
      Brie, it was an evening to remember just for the food alone; however, with
      the two white wines and the two red wines to complement the dishes it was
      a superb evening.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Votes for the two whites, a Chardonnay and a Riesling,
      were evenly matched on my table, while the reds, a Cabernet Sauvignon and
      a Merlot, saw the third wine, the Cabernet easily the most popular. While
      the winner was number 3, the real winners were the Wine Club members who
      experienced another magnificent evening at the Royal Cliff Beach Resort.</p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dynamic Bartercard Thailand organization is running
      another of their very successful Tuk Tuk Rallies on June 8th. The previous
      Bartercard rally resulted in more than 1 million baht being presented to
      charity and this year’s event has already attracted so much interest
      that the Bartercard people are confident of being able to raise even more
      this year for Senator Meechai’s Population and Community Development
      Association (PDA).</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The charity rally will feature around 100 of
      Bangkok’s famous Tuk Tuk’s in a colourful cavalcade to Pattaya. The
      spectacle is a real traffic stopper, but traffic police assistance is on
      hand to ensure the unique three wheelers have priority en route to their
      destination. It is expected that the trip from Bangkok to Pattaya will be
      around 4-5 hours, and the teams will then have a boat cruise to unwind
      after the journey.</p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Corporations and businesses get behind the rally by
      sponsoring a Tuk Tuk, with Gold, Green or White sponsorship packages,
      which allows for advertising, banners and other promotions, including TV
      and VCD presentations which can be used by the rally entrants.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">Graham Brain, managing director of Bartercard Thailand
      said, “We have been heartened by the response to the Bartercard Tuk Tuk
      2002 Rally, with all the Gold sponsorship packages already taken up by
      such prestigious companies as Castrol, eThailand, Metro, Nationwide
      Insurance, Nike, Singha, SKF Bearings and UniThai. Most of the companies
      that ran in the first rally have already indicated they will come again
      this year, with their personnel enjoying the event and considering it to
      be great team building opportunity.”</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">With the Green and White sponsorships also filling up
      rapidly, it is recommended that interested groups apply as soon as
      possible, to be able to be part of this wonderful fun experience.</p>
      <p ALIGN="justify">The selected charity, the PDA, is a non-profit NGO
      involved in assisting the rural poor of Thailand, with family planning and
      AIDS prevention programmes. In fact, the bulk of the proceeds from the Tuk
      Tuk Rally 2002 will be used to purchase condoms for the PDA to distribute
      as a positive step in the fight against overpopulation and sexually
      transmitted diseases.</p>
