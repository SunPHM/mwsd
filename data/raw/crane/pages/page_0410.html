<P align="left">Watched a Hoodie Crow trying to open an empty Irn Bru can as if 
it were a shellfish.&nbsp; It repeatedly flew up in the air with it and then 
dropped it on the grass.&nbsp; I don't know if it was just playing, or showing 
off to a potential mate, as they normally drop shells on rocks when they're 
serious about opening them.&nbsp; It also stabbed repeatedly at the can with its 
bill, and rolled it around a lot.</P>

Iris flower of the year seen.&nbsp; Seems only yesterday the shoots were just 
inches off the ground.&nbsp; On the right, a gall on Rowan caused by the mite 
Eriophyes Sorbi</p>

<P>A boat trip to the Isle of Rona, organised by the local branch of the 
Scottish Wildlife Trust.&nbsp; It was a dull day and rain was forecast but we 
were extremely lucky to have no rain at all while we were there, and only 
intermittent rain on the trip out and back.</P>

<P>Two views from the boat, the first back towards the Cuillins, and the second 
the wooded slopes of Scorrybreac, where many of the pictures on this site are 
taken.&nbsp; It looks splendid from the water, as does the whole north coast of 
Skye which we were able to see at close quarters as far as the Storr.&nbsp; We 
saw some porpoises, or rather their dorsal fins, in the water close to the Skye 
shore, and there were a great many Razorbills and Guillemots about, in small 
parties, all diving and surfacing in unison.</P>

<P>Rona is a small island off the northern tip of Raasay, which lies between 
Skye and the mainland.&nbsp; Rona is often seen but seldom visited.&nbsp; From a 
distance it looks barren, all you can see is rock.&nbsp; But in reality it is 
amazingly lush.&nbsp; There is plenty of woodland in sheltered areas, and the 
heather grows almost head-high in places.&nbsp; There are few grazing animals 
there these days and the natural vegetation is being allowed to regenerate, 
making it a very exciting place for the naturalist.</P>

<P dir="ltr">This picture shows typical Rona terrain, together with one of the

around 280 species of wild flowering plants and ferns grow on the island, and 
there are probably more waiting to be discovered.</P>

Buckler Fern, growing in mossy woodland together with Hard Fern and Wood Sorrel.&nbsp; 
This fern is recognised by the crimped appearance of the fronds.&nbsp; It is not 
at all common in North Skye but very plentiful in the woods of Rona.&nbsp; On 
the right, the Sea Spleenwort, growing farther from the sea than I have ever 
seen it before, on an inland cliff in fact, though one that doubtless gets a 
taste of sea spray during winter gales.</P>

Another of the party saw a Painted Lady butterfly and a Magpie Moth, but I have 
not yet seen either of these species this year.</P>

<P dir="ltr">The Early Marsh Orchid and the graceful Flote-grass.&nbsp; In 
general the vegetation of Rona seemed behind that of Skye in seasonal 
development.&nbsp; There were many specimens of the Lesser Twayblade among the 
Heather, but none of them had put up any flowering stems yet.&nbsp; It would be 
wonderful to go back later in the year when the ungrazed grasses and other herbs 
would be at their best.&nbsp; It would also be wonderful to go back in thirty 
years time and see how the native woodland has regenerated.</P>

<P dir="ltr">The island has Red Deer, Otters, Wood Mice, and possibly Mountain 
Hares (as does Raasay), and has seabird colonies on the cliffs.&nbsp; Both 
Common and Grey seals haul out on the island's shores and skerries.</P>
