        <p>We've all experienced these fantastic adventures at Disneyland. If
        you've ever left one of these attractions wondering, <b>&quot;Wow, how
        did they do that?&quot;</b>, you shouldn't feel alone. Over the years, I
        have heard both kids and adults ask these kinds of question over and
        over again. Sometimes, you might know the right answer, but a lot of
        times you don't...</p>
        <p>Whether you are young or old, if you're curious about the science
        behind the Disney magic, <b>Ask Doc Krock!</b> is for you.</p>
        <p>Since childhood, Disneyland and its magical attractions and
        environment have fascinated me, and I have always wanted to know how
        Disney made the magic happen. As I grew up into a scientist, it became
        part of my nature to try to understand how the world around me works. My
        love of Disney and science now allows me to answer your questions about
        the science behind the magic!</p>
        <p>Maybe you're thinking, &quot;Hey, it sounds like you're going to
        spoil everything!&quot; Well, I don't think so. In fact, I believe that
        understanding how things work and having a bit of historical background
        actually increases your appreciation for the magic that the Imagineers
        create. However, to prevent spoiling any key attraction illusions, I
        will post a little &quot;spoiler warning&quot; so you don't accidentally
        learn information that might ruin your enjoyment of an attraction.</p>
        <p>The magic of Disneyland is everywhere! Here are just a few of the
        topics I'm currently working on:</p>
        <ul>
          <i>Specific attraction illusions, like those in the Haunted Mansion,
          the Temple of the Forbidden Eye, and Star Tours</i>
          <p><i>General attraction technologies, like audio-animatronics, ride
          mechanisms, and theatrical illusions (lighting and fog)</i>
          <p><i>Historical attractions, like the Flying Saucers, Mission to Mars
          (or the Moon, depending on how old you are), and the Submarines</i>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#336699" size="4"><b>I encourage you to submit your
        questions so I can share them.</b></font> Straightforward or complex,
        let me know what's on your mind. You'll get simple and fun scientific
        explanations of how Disney artists and Imagineers create the wonderful
        Disney attractions. When I can, I'll try to include references in case
        you want to explore the topic in more depth.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><font color="#336699" size="4"><b>Today's Topic: The Disneyland
        Monorail</b></font></p>
        <p>For my first column, I've chosen a topic that most of you are
        familiar with: <b>the Disneyland Monorail</b>. This classic attraction
        has been pleasing and transporting Disneyland guests since 1959 when it
        opened as the Disneyland- Alweg Monorail System. Did you know that its
        basic technology hasn't really changed over the last <b>40 years</b>? As
        you'll see in a bit, the reasons for this are the rather simple concepts
        on which the whole Monorail system is built.</p>
        <center><img src="figure1-1.jpg" alt="The Disneyland Monorail" border="0" width="240" height="320"><br>
        <font size="2" color="#808080"><i><b>Figure 1.</b> The Disneyland
        Monorail</i></font></center>
        <p>Let's take a look at the beamway (See Figure 2). The entire Monorail
        route is made up of many steel reinforced, &quot;I&quot;-shaped,
        concrete sections. Each section is bolted into place on top of precast
        concrete support pillars (see Figure 3). These beams may be fairly
        narrow, but they are extremely strong and can support several thousand
        pounds. Did you know that this modular beam design allows easy removal
        of a section for repair or to allow very tall vehicles, like cranes, to
        enter areas within the route perimeter? During the early construction of
        Disney's California Adventure, I saw sections of beamway missing while
        the large cranes and earth movers were brought in and out of the
        construction area.</p>
        <center><img src="figure1-2.jpg" alt="Beamway and supports" border="0" width="320" height="240"><br>
        <i><font color="#808080"><font size="2"><b>Figure 2.</b> The Monorail
        beamway and support structure</font> </font></i></center>
        <p><center><img src="figure1-3.jpg" alt="Beamway joint" border="0" width="320" height="240"><br>
        <font size="2" color="#808080"><i><b>Figure 3.</b> A beamway joint</i></font></center></p>
        <p>Along one side of the beam is a set of metal strips. You can see an
        example of this in figure 4. If you guessed, by the &quot;High
        Voltage&quot; warnings, that the quiet and smooth ride is due to
        electrically powered motors, you're right! These metal strips or
        &quot;electrical contacts&quot; carry 600 volts of electricity. That's a
        LOT of electricity! And, a single power supply sits outside of the park
        and supplies the electricity to the entire beamway.</p>

        <p>On your next visit to the park, stand underneath the beamway and look
        up as the Monorail glides. You'll see the undercarriage of the Monorail.
        If you look at Figure 5, you see a series of small &quot;guide&quot;
        tires that ride along the side of the rail. These tires provide the
        horizontal support for the Monorail, but what you don't see are the
        other important tires that run on top of the beam.</p>

        undercarriage of the Monorail</font></font></i></p>
        <p>Figures 6a and 6b show diagrams of how the wheels sit along the beam.
        There are two types of wheels that run on top of the beam:
        &quot;load&quot; and &quot;drive&quot;. While the load wheels support
        most of the weight of the Monorail cars and provide some braking
        capabilities, the slightly larger drive wheels provide all the
        locomotive power as well as the high-speed braking. The four drive
        wheels get their power from four large 100-horsepower electric motors
        under the Monorail, alongside the track. This gives the Monorail a lower
        center of gravity and better stability.</p>

        </center>
        <p>So, how many wheels are there? Figure 7 shows the six wheel sets that
        are in each Monorail. There are 54 wheels per Monorail in all. The two
        wheel sets at each end are under the pilot's cab and the &quot;tail
        cone&quot; (the back of the Monorail), while the other four sets sit
        between the passenger cabins, behind the gray stretchy material.</p>

        <p><b><font color="#336699" size="4">Monorail Performance</font></b></p>
        <p>How fast do you think the Disneyland Monorail can go? The latest
        Monorail models can travel up to 70 miles per hour (mph)! However,
        because this is Disneyland, and because there really isn't enough room
        to go that fast, the Monorail is limited to 35 mph. There are four speed
        settings the pilot can select in the cabin, ranging from about 5 mph for
        level P1, to 35 mph for level P4. Disneyland recently installed a
        Collision Avoidance System (CAS) that warns the pilot if another
        Monorail gets too close.</p>
        <p>The monorail pilots used to be responsible for staying under the
        speed limit, but not anymore! Disneyland recently installed a speed
        enforcement system. Now, an alarm sounds if the pilot goes over a speed
        limit by 1.5 mph. At 3 mph over a speed limit, the system begins to slow
        the Monorail to an appropriate speed.</p>
        <p>That's about it for the Monorail, a fairly simple design that has
        proven to be a popular and fairly rugged transportation system for the
        park. Next time you're in the park and see the Monorail pass overhead,
        think about all the neat secrets you learned here. Then, be sure to
        catch a ride in the pilot's cab by asking one of the Monorail Cast
        Members - it's a special treat.</p>
