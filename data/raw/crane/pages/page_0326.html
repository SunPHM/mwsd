            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you're a whiz at recognizing someone's voice when they call on the phone, it's
			because humans each have a voice all their own. You might be surprised to learn that
			many of the world's endangered whooping cranes can also be identified by their voices!
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Dr. Wessling is a scientist who lives near Hamburg, Germany. He is a chemist who
			became interested in cranes when his sons were young. Over the years, he observed
			Eurasian (Common) cranes. He found mysterious behaviors that he assumed were characteristic
			for a certain crane individual or pair. But how could he be sure it was really the
			crane he thought it was when cranes look so much alike? Dr. Wessling got the idea
			to record the cranes' <a href="/jnorth/sounds/crane_unison_Wessling.wav">vocal calls</a> and then to analyze their voices with a computer.
			He hoped their voices could help him be sure of a crane's identity--and his hunch
			was right! <BR>
			<BR>
			<B>One-of-a-Kind</B><BR>
			The computer helped turn each vocal recording into a <strong>sonogram</strong> --a
			picture of the	call showing its &quot;melody&quot; over time. The &quot;melody&quot; consists of
			all the tones (e.g. frequencies) expressed by the birds at a certain time, over the
			whole frequency spectrum looked at. Just as the patterns of each person's fingerprints
			are uniquely their own, the sonograms provide a way to determine a so-called &quot;voiceprint&quot;
			or &quot;acoustic fingerprint&quot; that identifies individual cranes and crane pairs.
			Dr. Wessling calculates the sum of all the intensities over the whole recording time
			shown for specific frequencies. In other words, at which frequency a certain bird
			makes more or less intense calls. And he found out: &quot;Every bird shows a certain
			individually characteristic frequency spectrum. This is that bird's unique 'acoustic
			fingerprint,' taken from its recorded vocal calls. Every pair and every bird has
			a characteristic voice, just as we humans each have our own characteristic voice
			by which people recognize us without seeing us.&quot; This is big news!<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Hurdles</B><BR>
			This amazing discovery did not come easily. Dr. Wessling's first challenge was convincing
			people who cared for these endangered birds to let him in the refuge. After all,
			others had previously tried and failed at recording crane calls. But Dr. Wessling
			was sure he could do it! He convinced officials--including Tom Stehn--to let him
			work in the refuge for nine days with these endangered birds. Then another tough
			job began. Dr. Wessling told Journey North:<BR>

            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As a researcher who is officially entitled to record Whooping crane calls for
			conservation reasons, I am allowed to enter into closed areas. I access the cranes
			by walking through grasslands, wetlands or wet marshes, trying to avoid being seen
			by them. When I am close enough to a pair, I play a CD recording from an original
			Whooping crane call using a loud megaphone. The pair in front of me hears it and
			thinks: &quot;Oh, another Whooping crane is intruding in our territory! Let's tell
			them that this is our territory.&quot; Then they call, and I record. <BR>
			<BR>
			It is often not as easy as it sounds here! Some calls I can record
			in the morning. To do this, I am in the Refuge 1.5 hours before sunrise, in
			total darkness, to approach
			the roosting place. Then I wait. If I am lucky, the crane pairs express
			a morning call--a unison call. Sometimes two, three, or four crane pairs call,
			one after the
			other. (One crane pair might be a quarter or half mile away from
			me, and the next	pair a mile away.)&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Then came the painstaking work of analyzing. &quot;I had to erase all the
			bad noises and side noises in order to analyze them. Some recordings were
			hard to analyze as
			it was windy, or waves were making noise, or other birds were calling,
			or the ships in the Intracoastal Waterway roaring. All of these bad noises
			had to be erased.&quot;

            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After his first session at Aransas, Dr. Wessling sent his special recording equipment
			to Brian Johns at Wood Buffalo National Park where the wild whooping cranes nest.
			Brian entered the grounds by helicopter and called to the birds with Dr. Wessling's
			recordings on a CD played over a megaphone. Brian recorded the Wood Buffalo cranes'
			answers for Dr. Wessling to analyze. And Dr. Wessling returned to Aransas in January
			2001 to record the cranes again on their wintering grounds. His goal was to get more
			recordings of already-recorded cranes and also the pairs he missed in 2000.<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Success! We Hear You, and We Know Who You Are</B><BR>
			What did all this work accomplish? From his 1999 study, Dr. Wessling
			reports: &quot;From
			the 27 pairs, 22 gave a unison call, 17 a guard call, and 12 gave both. In order
			to get these analyzable calls, I made more than 200 recordings. I only failed to
			characterize two pairs, one of which was not present. &quot; Dr. Wessling didn't
			visit the location of 23 or 24 pairs, so they remained to be recorded on another
			visit in 2001. After his 2001 visit to Aransas, Dr. Wessling reported: &quot;This
			time, I was able to get at least 25, maybe 27 pairs to call at me. Four pairs are
			new for me. Together with some pairs recorded by Brian Johns in summer 2000 at Wood
			Buffalo National Park, we now &quot;personally&quot; know 35 whooping crane pairs--or
			more than 70% of all breeding pairs.&quot; Great news! <BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Just in Time</B><BR>
			Voiceprints are a valuable discovery. Scientists stopped banding cranes in the late
			1980s. Banding was expensive, time consuming, exhausting--and dangerous to the cranes.
			In around ten years, no more cranes with bands will be alive. (Some cranes can live
			over 20 years, although the average lifespan is eleven.) At this writing, only about
			20 cranes with bands survive out of a total crane population of 177 (Feb. 2001 numbers).
			With so few left, monitoring the world's only remaining wild whooping cranes is ever
			more important to saving the species. But how can cranes be safely monitored? Thanks
			to Dr. Wessling's work, they can now be kept track of with acoustics, or sound, and
			the discovery that cranes' individual voices can tell us which crane is which. <BR>
