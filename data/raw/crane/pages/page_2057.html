      <div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sixteen endangered 
        whooping crane chicks following three ultralights flew 200 miles, traversing 
        nearly the entire state of Georgia today. 
        <p>&quot;This is the longest flight we've ever made -- with any species,&quot; 
          said Operation Migration's Heather Ray from just outside of Albany Georgia. 
          &quot;All 16 birds made the flight. We just needed to get over those 
          mountains and the birds flew perfectly.&quot;</p>
        <p>They are on their 1,228-mile ultralight-guided migration from Necedah 
          National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin to Chassahowitzka National Wildlife 
          Refuge along Florida's central Gulf Coast.</p>
        <p>These endangered whooping cranes, the largest birds in North America, 
          left Necedah on October 8, 2003 following three ultralight aircraft 
          piloted by Operation Migration pilots.</p>
        <p>The whooping crane chicks have now traveled 950 miles during their 
          migration. They are in Terrill County, just north of Albany, Georgia. 
          They had flown into Georgia on Sunday morning, Nov. 30, 2003, after 
          leaving Hiawassee Wildlife Refuge, managed by the Tennessee Wildlife 
          Resources Agency.</p>
        <p>The Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP), an international coalition 
          of public and private groups, is conducting this project in an effort 
          to reintroduce this highly imperiled species in eastern North America.</p>
        <p>&quot;These magnificent creatures are almost home for the winter,&quot; 
          said Sam D. Hamilton, Southeast Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and 
          Wildlife Service. &quot;It is a great day for the whooping crane and 
          the entire partnership that is helping bring it back from the edge of 
          extinction.&quot;</p>
        <p>The ultralight migration project is in its third successful year with 
          Federal and State experts teaming with Non-Profit groups with a single-minded 
          purpose of resurrecting the cranes' historic migrating route.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;We are proud to be a partner in this exciting effort to restore 
          this magnificent bird to Georgia's skies,&quot; said Mike Harris, Georgia 
          Department of Natural Resource's Wildlife Resources Division's Non-game 
          Wildlife and Natural Heritage Section Chief. &quot;The reintroduction 
          of the eastern migratory flock of whooping cranes in Georgia is a prime 
          example of what can be accomplished with strong state, federal and private 
          partnerships.&quot;</p>
        <p>The migration follows the natural migration of the whooping crane's 
          cousin, the sandhill crane that passes through Tennessee each fall.

        <p>The whooping crane chicks involved in the WCEP reintroduction project 
          were hatched at the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research 
          Center in Laurel, Maryland, where they were introduced to ultralights 
          and raised in isolation from humans. The Operation Migration pilots, 
          along with biologists from Patuxent and the International Crane Foundation, 
          spent the summer conditioning the cranes to fly gradually longer flights 
          behind the ultralights--the cranes' &quot;surrogate parents.&quot;</p>
        <p>These sixteen cranes are the third flock to make this historic, assisted 
          migration from Wisconsin to Florida. In 2001, seven of eight whooping 
          cranes that began the first fall migration made it to Florida safely; 
          five of these seven birds survived the winter and made an unassisted, 
          successful spring migration back to Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>In 2002, the WCEP migration team conditioned a second group and guided 
          17 juvenile cranes to Chassahowitzka NWR. One was lost during the migration 
          when it collided with an ultralight. Sixteen returned to Wisconsin this 
          past spring.</p>
        <p>The WCEP monitoring team is presently tracking the location of all 
          of the 20 cranes from the &quot;Class of 2001&quot; and &quot;Class 
          of 2002&quot;. To date, all but two of the cranes from these previous 
          migrations have successfully migrated to Florida and the hassahowitzka 
          National Wildlife Refuge. The last two are headed south as well: One 
          in Tennessee -- the other in Kentucky (photo available).</p>
        <p>To follow the progress of the wild cranes, please visit: <a href="http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/back/2003fall/01-02fl-nov17-up.htm"><font color="#990000">http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/back/2003fall/01-02fl-nov17-up.htm</font></a>.</p>
        <p>The reintroduction is part of an ongoing recovery effort for the highly 
          imperiled whooping crane, which was on the verge of extinction in the 
          1940s. Except for the Wisconsin-Florida birds, the continent's only 
          other migratory population of whooping cranes winters at Aransas National 
          Wildlife Refuge on the Texas Gulf Coast.</p>
        <p>A non-migrating flock of about 100 cranes remain year-round in central 
          Florida as part of an ongoing reintroduction study led by the Florida 
          Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. This reintroduction would 
          not only restore the whooping crane to part of its historic range but 
          also provide another geographically distinct migratory population that 
          could lead to downlisting the species from endangered to threatened 
          status by the U.S.
          Fish and Wildlife Service and eventual recovery.</p>
        <p>In 1998, an international coalition of state and federal governments 
          and private organizations formed the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership 
          to spearhead the migratory reintroduction project for the whooping crane, 
          a federally listed endangered species. More than 35 private landowners 
          have volunteered their property as stopover sites for the cranes and 
          migration team. A temporary pen keeps the cranes safe from predators 
          between each morning's flight, and all of the team that interacts with 
          the cranes wear costumes to mask their human form and use adult crane 
          puppet heads to mimic adult bird behaviors. The goal of WCEP is to establish 
          a migrating flock of at least 125 birds including 25 adult breeding 
          pairs, restoring the species to eastern North America.</p>
        <p>Founding members of WCEP include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
          the International Crane Foundation, the International Whooping Crane 
          Recovery Team, Operation Migration, Inc., National Fish and Wildlife 
          Foundation, U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center 
          and National Wildlife Health Center, and Wisconsin Department of Natural 
          Resources.</p>
        <p>Many other flyway states, provinces, private individuals and conservation 
          groups have joined forces with and support WCEP by donating resources, 
          funding and personnel.</p>
