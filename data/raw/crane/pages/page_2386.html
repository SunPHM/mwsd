<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">As you read this article the Whooping
Cranes that arrived early are incubating on nests in and around Canada’s Wood
Buffalo National Park (WBNP), while the late birds, mostly subadults, may still
be in migration. In total there should be up to 120 potential breeders along
with 65 subadults migrating north this spring. The high count during the past
winter was 185 birds. According to Tom Stehn, Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)
habitat conditions, bay salinities and blue crab abundance was good for the
Whoopers during the past winter. If the birds are in good condition throughout
the winter, the breeders have a head start towards a successful nesting season.
After a 20-30 day migration covering 4000 km (2,400 miles) the cranes begin
arriving on their breeding territories in late April and early May.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Whooping Crane breeding territories are in
the extreme north-eastern corner of WBNP. The park itself covers 44,000 sqkm (11
million acres) while the breeding area is contained within an 80x 80 km area
(1.5 million acres). The nesting area lies among the large marshes adjacent to
the Sass, Klewi, Nyarling and Little Buffalo rivers. Each nesting territory is a
mosaic of small to large shallow wetlands with bulrush, sedge and cattail as the
dominant emergent vegetation. In amongst the wetlands are low ridges and upland
areas dominated by black spruce, willow and dwarf birch.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><i>Click Here for a larger photo of the <a href="klewimarsh.htm" target="_blank">Klewi
marsh</a>.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Water conditions in WBNP were excellent in
the fall of 2002 and despite lower than average snowfall throughout the winter,
the wetlands should be in average condition this spring. Once the cranes settle
in and re-establish their territories they begin nest construction, which
usually takes a couple of days. Generally 2 eggs are laid about 2 days apart.
Incubation begins with the laying of the first egg and it usually takes about 30
days before hatching.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">May is when Lea Craig-Moore and I conduct
our first Whooping Crane surveys of the year. A typical survey begins by
chartering a Cessna 172 from Big River Air in Fort Smith and systematically
flying low over the nesting area looking for white dots. These white dots are
either snow banks, sun-bleached stumps, shed moose antlers or Whooping Cranes.
The cranes seen are usually singles or pairs but can include small groups up to
about 4 or 5 subadults. Some of the singles will be incubating birds. Over the
course of the month of May we will discover most of the birds and nests. The
location of each bird and nest is recorded on aerial photos and a global
position system (GPS).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">Whooping Cranes making unison call at nest
site, WBNP, Canada.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Plotting crane locations on aerial photos consists of
circling over the cranes until I find the correct location or get airsick. Once
all the nests are located, I won't do another survey until just after eggs are
hatched. Hatching usually takes place during the first 2 weeks of June. At this
time I conduct hatching success surveys in a U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)
Partenavia PN68 aircraft flown by Jim Bredy. The aircraft is excellent for this
type of survey work because of the excellent forward visibility through its
glass nose. Tom Stehn will join me for these surveys and our job is to spot
Whooping Cranes, check for young, check for colored leg bands, and check nests
for signs of hatched or predated eggs. All this is done from the aircraft at 150
kph. If we are lucky we will spot the tiny young or the leg bands on the first
pass.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">If the Whoopers are in dense emergent vegetation or trees
and tall shrubs we will return another day in hopes that the birds are in a more
open situation. Once all the pairs have been checked we will search for birds
pioneering new habitats in the area. The last surveys of the year are timed to
be near when fledging takes place. I will only look for pairs that had young in
June. Once we locate a pair we will determine if there are any young present.
All birds observed during these surveys are also plotted on aerial photos and
GPS coordinates obtained.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The last bit of field work on the breeding grounds will be
to record unison calls of some of the breeding pairs. This is done by flying
into the territory of a breeding pair with a helicopter and landing several
hundred metres from the cranes. We will play a recorded unison call in hopes of
soliciting and recording a call from the resident pair. Dr. Bernhard Wessling
will help us compare our recorded calls made at WBNP to those recorded at ANWR
to try and match up pairs between their summer and winter territories.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In addition to the aerial surveys we will also monitor
water levels in ponds and creeks in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whooping
Crane nesting area and meet with a variety of stakeholders to discuss issues.
All this work is done in cooperation with Mark Bradley of WBNP. During the
summer of 2002 we located 56 breeding pairs, however only 50 nested. It is
anticipated that as many as 60 pairs could nest during 2003. Some of the older
banded birds are reaching the end of their life span and starting to die out of
the population.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">One of the first pairs of Whoopers that had been observed
each year is no longer around. The Lobstick pair (male 24 years old, female
unknown age) was not seen during the 2002 fall migration and they failed to
arrive on the ANWR wintering grounds. It will be interesting to see if their old
territory is occupied by new birds this year. The Lobstick male began his
occupancy in the Lobstick marshes in 1981 and nested every year. Over that time
period these birds brought 8 young to ANWR.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Florida’s non-migratory Whooping
      Crane project has continued to make good progress during the past several
      years. The project was initiated in 1990 at the request of the Whooping
      Crane Recovery Team is and is designed to restore Whooping Cranes to their
      former range in the southeastern United States. Florida’s Fish and
      Wildlife Conservation Commission is the lead agency, but this project is a
      cooperative effort involving the USFWS, U.S. Geological Survey, the
      Canadian Wildlife Service, and the International Crane Foundation (ICF).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In early April 2003 the Florida
      non-migratory flock of Whooping Cranes consisted of a maximum of 99 birds,
      with 74 accounted for on a regular basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This included 11 birds released this past winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      from the San Antonio Zoo) into Lake County of central Florida.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      with a power line and one sustained a broken leg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The latter was still able to fly, remain alert to predators, use
      suitable habitat, and find food, so we opted to give it the chance to heal

      nests were initiated (2 eggs in each) and all 3 hatched at least 1 chick

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Like any situation, reintroducing
      Whooping Cranes into Eastern North America can be viewed from several
      different vantage points. Certainly dressing up in a costume to keep birds
      from imprinting on humans has it humorous side. Some consider using ultra light
      aircraft to lead a flock of cranes across the county to be adventurous
      while others think it’s romantic. Yet, organizing 9 federal, state, and
      non-profit agencies into one partnership with a common goal is ambitious
      by any measure. From any perspective, an eastern population of migratory
      Whooping Cranes; returned to the area following an absence of more than a
      century, is a monumental achievement. After only 2 years there are now 21
      birds in this flyway and their high survival rate and wild behavior is due
      to the efforts of many people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Experience, as in all things, is key.
      Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the International Crane Foundation
      have perfected the delicate art of raising rare birds in captivity to
      ensure the survival of their wild counterparts. Operation Migration has
      played surrogate parents to 10 flocks and 4 species and taught a migration
      route to 186 individual birds over 10 years.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">We led more birds in flight than
      ever before<i> </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">during t</span>his
      past year. Although we worried that 16 Whoopers would not be able to fly
      on the vortices created by the wing of one ultra light aircraft, our fears
      were unfounded. To accommodate the larger number of birds we added 2 crew

      backup pilot for many years but this past season he flew as lead/chase

      his work with Trumpeter swans to fly with a different species and his help
      allowed us to have 4 aircraft in the air at all times.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Survival rate was the highest yet<i> </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">for
      the Wisconsin/Florida migratory </span>Whooping Crane project. 17 Whooping
      Cranes were transported from the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, in 2
      shipments, to the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge (Wisconsin) in mid
      June, and 17 began the migration on October 13th. Unfortunately, on day
      one a calm morning turned blustery, and one bird came into contact with
      the lead aircraft; he was injured, and eventually had to be euthanized.
      The 16 remaining birds successfully completed the migration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i>We flew our ultralight aircraft
      slower than ever before</i>. We began the migration on October 13, 2002
      and it was not until November 11<sup>th</sup> that we finally arrived at
      the halfway point in Tennessee. Frost, fog, wind, and rain held us firmly
      on the ground on 23 of those 37 days and with so far still to go, the
      pressure weighed heavily on the crew. The Whooping Cranes that graduated
      from our migration school in 2001 spent the summer in Wisconsin and began
      the fall migration, well after we departed with the class of ‘02. Yet,
      the ’01 class members made much better progress than us and by
      coincidence, arrived at the Hiwassee State Refuge in Tennessee while we
      were there - waiting for the weather to improve. On the day we departed 2
      from the class of ’01 even joined the class of ’02 flight for a few
      moments.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i>We flew our ultralights faster
      than ever before</i>. The weather improved during the second half of the
      migration and we were able to fly on 8 consecutive days covering 584
      miles. We completed the 2002 migration on the morning of November 30
      delivering 16 Whooping Crane chicks to the isolated release pen in the
      salt marsh of the Chassahowitzka NWR in Florida.</p>

      greet the chicks having arrived two days earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Following a brief health exam and placement of satellite
      transmitters on 5 of the Whooper chicks they were officially released and
      #5-‘01 immediately joined them, becoming the dominant bird in the flock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Due to the larger number of Whooping
      Cranes and the roosting problems experienced by last year’s birds, the
      pen at Chassahowitzka was increased from 1 to 4 acres and an artificial
      oyster bar was created for them to roost on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These changes allowed the birds to roost within the safety of the
      pen almost every night and all 17 birds survived the winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>While the birds spent their nights inside the pen they spent time
      each day foraging outside the pen, and taking short flights around the
      area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">For a time after the young Whoopers
      arrived at Chassahowitzka it was easy to pick Whooper #5-‘01 out of the
      group, but as the winter months went by the chicks acquired their adult
      voices, their pure white adult plumage, and even the beginning of the red
      patch on their heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
      changes made it much more difficult to distinguish #5-‘01, the yearling
      bird, from the chicks, requiring us to be more attentive during our daily
      observations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">At the time of this writing the 16
      chicks and #5-‘01 are making their way north unassisted, having left
      Chassahowitzka on April 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership and all its supporters should take
      pride in their achievements. These magnificent birds are one step farther
      from extinction and that is success from any perspective.</p>

      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Whooping Cranes
      typically lay two eggs but infrequently raise two chicks to flight age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>As a consequence, biologists believed one egg could be removed from
      each two-egg nest and hatched in captivity without harming growth of the
      wild population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In most
      years between 1968 and 1996, Whooping Crane eggs were collected from nests
      in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The original goal of this egg conservation program was to
      ensure survival of the species by creating a captive population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A second objective was to start new wild populations using eggs
      collected in the wild and eggs produced by captive cranes. By 1996 these
      goals had been achieved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three
      captive flocks existed and production from these was sufficient to support
      experimental introductions to start new wild populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>All wildlife scientists agree that the egg collection was
      beneficial and essential to achieve these goals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>But a few believed that the wild population would grow more rapidly
      without egg removal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those
      individuals believed that some parents would successfully raise both
      chicks and, as a result, the population in Wood Buffalo National Park
      would grow faster than it did with removal of second eggs. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The slow but
      steady growth of the wild population in Canada, during the years of egg
      pickup, and projected growth of the captive population, provided a sense
      of security that Whooping Cranes were on their way to recovery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Whooping Crane Recovery Team then voted in 1996 to stop the egg
      conservation program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Part of
      the pressure for this action came from Parks Canada and their philosophy
      that within the national parks nature should be allowed to run its course
      without interference or management by man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The collection
      of eggs in the wild was last practiced in 1996.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Since then, the wild Whooping Crane population has declined and
      only one set of twins has survived to reach the wintering area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Studies in Wood Buffalo National Park (1998 and 1999) by Doug
      Bergeson, a biologist for Parks Canada, confirmed that 90 percent of the
      second eggs (or chicks) can be considered “surplus” because they do
      not survive (Bergeson et al. 2001).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two
      recent analyses indicated increased survival of Whooping Crane chicks in
      Wood Buffalo National Park during the years of egg removal (Ellis and Gee
      2001, Lewis 2001).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Then, late in
      2002, Professor Mark Boyce of the University of Alberta, completed his
      preliminary analyses of data collected by Canadian Wildlife Service during
      the egg collection years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
      predator populations were increasing in the Park, Dr. Boyce found only a
      slight increase in chick survival due to collection of second eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the survival of crane chicks from eggs left in the Park
      almost doubled when predator populations were declining.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Both parents can concentrate on feeding and protecting the single
      chick when the second egg is removed, thus increasing the chick’s
      likelihood of surviving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
      survival advantage to the chick is partially eliminated when numbers of
      predators are increasing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But,
      the survival advantage of having a single chick is fully realized, and
      survival of crane chicks almost doubles, when predator numbers are
      declining due to a shortage of their primary foods such as snowshoe hare
      and lemmings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Other
      information indicates the need to accelerate the growth of the Whooping
      Crane population in Wood Buffalo National Park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>There is increasing evidence of genetic problems in the captive
      population that likely also exists in the wild population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Some crane families do not produce fertile eggs, some produce
      chicks that do not survive well, and some chicks have heart defects,
      scoliosis, and leg deformities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
      genetic problems are believed to result from the 1940’s population low
      when only 14 or 15 Whooping Cranes survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Negative environmental effects faced by the wild Whooping Cranes
      include upstream water diversions that diminish nutrient inflow, and
      thereby crane foods, found in Texas wintering habitats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>There also are expanding human activities within migration and
      wintering habitat that negatively impact crane survival.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The only
      self-maintaining wild population is still small (about 184 individuals).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Small populations are vulnerable to extinction through catastrophic
      events (like a hurricane at the wintering site) and random changes in
      productivity or survival.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Population and genetic specialists state that security
      against genetic problems, population fluctuations, and environmental
      changes, lies in maximizing population size. The appropriate <u>minimum</u>
      population goal to overcome the above problems is 1,000 individuals in the
      Whooping Cranes that nest in Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Whooping Crane Recovery Team set this same population goal in
      the 1990s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Claire Mirande and
      associates analyzed population growth that occurred in the years 1938-1990
      (Mirande et al. 1993).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      predicted that in 42 years (about 2032) the population would reach a safe
      level of 1,000 individuals if habitat was not limiting and inbreeding
      (genetic problems) did not reduce survival.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Unfortunately, genetic and habitat problems are evident.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Therefore,
      accelerating growth of the Whooping Crane population in Wood Buffalo
      National Park is an appropriate conservation action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In January, Whooping Crane Conservation Association (WCCA)
      President Chester McConnell, attended the annual meeting of the Whooping
      Crane Recovery Team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
      behalf of the WCCA he recommended collection of second eggs resume.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">In the report
      from their annual meeting the Whooping Crane Recovery Team agreed that egg
      collection could increase chick survival in Wood Buffalo National Park in
      some years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, they wish to
      measure chick survival through a full 10-year cycle (1997-2006) without
      egg removal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Team also
      agreed that collections would make more chicks available for the
      experimental reintroductions to establish other wild populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>However, they said that production from the captive flocks is
      sufficient to support the reintroductions. They said current captive
      facilities are presently at peak manpower and pen capacity for raising
      existing chicks and would be strained to handle additional eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Team envisions no further egg collection until after 2006.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">WCCA believes
      it is wise to be conservative in the approach to recovery of Whooping
      Cranes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several zoos have
      indicated a desire to have Whooping Cranes that are surplus to current
      genetic and reintroduction needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
      of the experimental reintroduced populations in Florida have only partial
      genetic representation of the wild population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Chicks reared from eggs collected in Canada would correct that
      genetic problem and accelerate the establishment of experimental
      populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It seems wise
      to pursue expansion of chick-rearing facilities if present rearing
      facilities are not sufficient to rear the additional chicks that would be
      available from egg conservation practices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Audubon Center for Research on Endangered Species, located in
      New Orleans, and Lowery Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida, reportedly would be
      interested in expanding their facilities and becoming more involved in the
      reintroduction programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      appear to provide locations that could provide increased rearing
      facilities if egg conservation is again practiced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>International Crane Foundation, Calgary Zoo, and Patuxent Wildlife
      Research Center also could provide the staff and facilities if sufficient
      funds are made available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For

      recovery of Whooping Cranes and resumption of egg conservation as soon as

      in 1860. The actions by people during the days of settlement and intensive
      exploitation of natural resources almost caused our beloved Whoopers to
      become extinct. They shot them for food and destroyed millions of acres of
      their habitats. The last wild migrating flock dwindled to an all-time low

      self-sustaining population of a minimum of 1,000 Whooping Cranes in North
      America by the year 2035. (2) Short-term recovery objectives are a minimum
      of 25 breeding pairs in the Aransas/Wood Buffalo population plus a minimum
      of 25 breeding pairs occurring in self-sustaining populations at each of 2
      other discrete locations. A breeding pair is defined as a pair that has
      produced eggs. (3) All 3 populations need to be self sustaining for 10
      years at the objective level before officials will consider removing the
      Whoopers from the endangered list. (4) 100 Whooping Cranes must be
      maintained in captivity as a safeguard to ensure long-term survival of the

      Nick Novakowski took over the program and in 1966 Ernie Kuyt became the
      biologist working with the cranes until 1991. My first encounter with a
      Whooping Crane was in the fall of 1974 but I would have to wait another 7

      When Graham retired the responsibilities were moved from CWS Headquarters

      assumed the duties for a few months before Dr. Roger Edwards took over. In

      into my job description. I instantly became the Whooping Crane
      Coordinator, the field biologist and the technician who did all the work.
      It was great and as Coordinator I would direct the program from my ivory
