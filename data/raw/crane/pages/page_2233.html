			<P>Two days after the chicks arrived, the crew brought each group out of the pens
			and introduced them to their respective training strips. Dan was on the training
			strip with them, assuring them that the costumes had not changed, the aircraft trike
			was the same, and only the location was different. Since the young whoopers already
			were familiar with the trike and the costumes, they adapted quite well. <BR>
			<BR>
			Each day the crew will rise with the sun and quietly travel to the first site to
			conduct the training session--if weather permits. Calm days are best. In their first
			days at the refuge, the cranes will work with the wingless aircraft, following the
			taxiing trike for the length of the grassy training strip.</P>

			<P>The young cranes have developed their primary feathers so at times, one or two
			will even catch a bit of air and glide for a few feet. <BR>
			<BR>
			When the cranes at one site finish their training session, the crew travels to the
			other site to begin the process again with the other cohort.<BR>
			<BR>
			Later, as the cranes begin to follow the ultralight in flight, the trainers will
			merge them into larger groups based on the dominance structure until there's one
			cohesive flock just before migration.</P>

			As their flight feathers and wing muscles develop, the colts (young cranes) will
			eventually take flight and follow the airborne ultralight over central Wisconsin.
			Their flight training will continue until the flock departs on fall migration to
			Florida. The crew is hoping for a mid-October departure.</P>
