Monday, June 4&nbsp; Kingfish Restaurant in Louisville Mile 600
<p>I slept a little late, getting up about 7.&nbsp; It had rained hard
during the night.&nbsp; The weather forecast called for a warm front (WARM!&nbsp;
YEA!) to move through the area with thunderstorms in the morning lessening
as the day went on.&nbsp; I decided to stay at the dock until the worst
of the weather passed over.
<p>After studying the charts, I realized that I might have trouble finding
gas on the river downstream from Louisville, and I was running low.&nbsp;
I bundled up in my foul weather gear and walked in the rain down the road
in front of the Kingfish Restaurant looking for a gas station.&nbsp; Luckily,
I found one about a half mile from the boat.&nbsp; So I returned to the
boat to get the gas can and a luggage dolly I had brought alone for just
such a time as this.
<p>I returned to the gas station, filled the six gallon can with gas, and
got a hot egg biscuit and cup of coffee.&nbsp; (Two hot meals in a row!)
Then I hiked back to the boat pulling the heavy gas can, thankful that
I had the luggage dolly.
<p>It rained a little shortly after I left about 9:45, but the winds were
calm and the morning was pleasant.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear some thunder
in the distance that worried me just a bit.&nbsp; The forecast called for
a "confused weather system for the next several days."&nbsp; I think that
means it will rain on me for the rest of my trip.
<p>I ran aground briefly at Beargrass Creek.&nbsp; I had been eager to
see that creek because it was one of the potential hurricane holes I had
picked out for the night before, and because it bears the name of Beargrass
Christian Church nearby.&nbsp; Obviously the creek was too shallow for
me to have spent the night.&nbsp; But only the tiller had caught in the
mud and not badly.&nbsp; I managed to push off with an oar without much
trouble.
<p>Then I went behind Towhead Island, which was my second possible place
to anchor last night.&nbsp; It was a very interesting place, but it had
an expensive marina there.&nbsp; All the houseboats had satellite TV antennas.&nbsp;
I thought to myself, "Satellite TV on a boat!&nbsp; Isn't that just the
way most folks are?&nbsp; They say, 'Let's get away from it all and take
it all with us!'"
<p>I entered the channel leading up to the McAlpine Locks at 10:35.&nbsp;
The ride through downtown Louisville was exciting even though the day was
heavily overcast.&nbsp; When you have been in the rural areas for so long,
the cities provide lots of interesting things to look at.

<p>I spotted a Bank of Louisville billboard with the words, "Ain't no river
wide enough" which seemed an appropriate song for Louisville and for me:
<p>Listen, baby
<br>Ain't no mountain high
<br>Ain't no valley low enough
<br>Ain't no river wide enough, baby
<p>If you need me, call me
<br>No matter where you are
<br>No matter how far
<br>Just call my name
<br>I'll be there in a hurry
<br>You don't have to worry
<p>'Cause baby,
<br>There ain't no mountain high enough
<br>Ain't no valley low enough
<br>Ain't no river wide enough
<br>To keep me from getting to you
<p>William Least Heat-Moon says, "Louisville is where it is because the
Falls of the Ohio, once the only significant natural impediment within
a thousand miles, are where they are.&nbsp; The broad ledge, while not
high, was just enough to stop steamboats and necessitate that cargo be
hauled overland to a vessel on the other side; around the simple portage
of goods, the city grew.&nbsp; During high water, paddle wheelers could
execute a thrilling ride through the falls to avoid the haulage, and one
nineteenth-century writer reported the flooding river sweeping houses over,
occupants crying out from the windows and rooftops.&nbsp; McAlpine Dam
sits upon much of the ledge now, but near the north side, the base of the
Falls of the Ohio is still visible at low water, and from the limestone
paleontologists have found a large fossil bed, an album of ancient sea
creatures long gone before the Ohio made its first run over the rocks"
(p. 151)
<p>The McAlpine Lock had a lot of construction going on with cranes and
barges and men working all over it. Only one channel was open, so it took
quite a while for me to lock through.
<br><img SRC="FamilyPics/Jun08060.jpg">
<p>When I called the lockmaster this time, I decided to use a different
name for my boat.&nbsp; Hey, how are they to know?&nbsp; This time I said,
"This is the sailboat Folly calling the McAlpine lockmaster."&nbsp; "Folly"
is not a bad abbreviation for "Fifty Dollar Folly."
<p>The lockmaster radioed back that it would be a little while, but he
would get to me as quickly as possible.&nbsp; I moved over into a little
side pool to wait.&nbsp; The light winds kept blowing me across the pool,
then I would start the motor and go back to the windward side and float
back.&nbsp; I had to wait about 45 minutes before entering the lock.
<p>I still have a fear of the locks even after all of them I have traversed.&nbsp;
There are always worries about the wind, the current, the towboats, trash
in the locks, and tying up.&nbsp; But this trip is about overcoming fear!
<p>As I entered the lock, I reduced throttle on the motor until it was
barely chugging along.&nbsp; I tried to run right down beside the wall
of the lock toward the floating bitts where I was to tie up.&nbsp; It's
always difficult to make this maneuver alone.&nbsp; I have to swing the
back of the boat toward the bitt at just the right time, then reach out
and tie up with a rope.&nbsp; It would be so much easier with two people!
<p>This time, I decided to leave the motor running slowly and I would throw
the rope over the bitt as I passed by, tie it off to the winch and it would
stop me.&nbsp; But as the bitt appeared, I realized it was higher than
the previous ones.&nbsp; I had to stand up at the back corner of the boat
and throw the rope over the bitt which was about 6 or 7 feet off the water.
When I threw the rope, the other end which was looped over a boat cleat
came undone.&nbsp; When I pulled to take up slack and stop the boat, the
loose end threw me off balance.&nbsp; I ALMOST FELL OFF THE BOAT!
<p>When I stumbled back into the boat, I accidentally kicked the keel winch
handle, loosening it.&nbsp; Suddenly the 360 pound keel was free to reel
out the cable making the winch handle spin furiously.&nbsp; It stopped
with a BANG when my shin got in the way.&nbsp; I was surprised that the
blow didn't break my leg, but it did cause an immediate knot to swell up
on my shin (and the knot took three weeks to heal!).
<p>My heart raced as I realized how close I came to disaster.&nbsp; In
my mind I could see me lying in the boat with a broken leg.&nbsp; Or I
could see me swimming in the water while my boat slowly motored forward
until it crashed into the closed gate ahead.&nbsp; And my boat is high
enough that it is impossible to climb into the boat from the water.&nbsp;
I cringed as I pictured that embarrassing and uncomfortable scene.
<p><img SRC="FamilyPics/Jun08063.jpg">
<br>The floating bitts
<p>But as it was I simply waited for the next bitt, shut the motor off
and very slowly coasted up to it for a successful tie off.&nbsp; After
tying up, I had to wait a while again because the lockmaster decided have
the tugboat "The McKinna Marie" = #44 (without barges) to lock through
with me.&nbsp; As I sat, I noticed the big signs posted every fifty feet
along the top of the lock showing the length.&nbsp; The lock was 1100 feet
long!&nbsp; And I noticed that the boat was leaking faster.&nbsp; That
leak was really beginning to aggravate me.
<p><img SRC="FamilyPics/Jun08062.jpg">
<p>I finally exited the McAlpine Lock at 12:12.&nbsp; It took an hour and
a half!&nbsp; Shortly after the lock, I spotted the I-64 bridge into Indiana.&nbsp;
I didn't know until then that that bridge was an over/under kind.&nbsp;
The only other bridge I ever saw like that was in San Francisco many years
ago.
<p>The forecast called for winds at 5-10 mph.&nbsp; Just last night at
the Kingfish, Ralph had observed that the weather service says 5-10 mph
when they really mean "no wind."&nbsp; He was right. This would be the
only day on the trip when I never raised the mainsail.
<p>12:35 Towboat # 45- Mid-South Towing Company
<p>I have never gotten bored on the river because there is always something
fascinating to see on shore.&nbsp; About 1 p.m., the river was eerily quiet
with the feel of early morning or an impending storm.&nbsp; Of course,
it wasn't early morning so that left the latter.&nbsp; The skies were heavily
overcast but not yet raining.&nbsp; The river was deserted, and the water
was flat calm.
<p>Suddenly a group of 6 or 8 purple martins began to swoop and play around
the boat.&nbsp; They reminded me of the dolphins that play around ships
at sea.&nbsp; The martins were doing the same kinds of things.&nbsp; They
swept low in front of the bow of my boat only missing it by two feet or
less.&nbsp; Then they would fly around the mast above.&nbsp; One flew straight
at me as I stood by the boom, getting within 2 feet of me before wheeling
off into the sky.&nbsp; In the quietness of the moment, it was an incredible
display!
<p>I often stood on the boat, but I was always extra careful because of
a fear of falling overboard.&nbsp; When a person is single-handling a boat,
falling overboard is one of the worst disasters possible.&nbsp; There is
no one on board to turn the boat around and come back to pick you up.&nbsp;
But sitting for 10-14 hours a day is almost impossible.&nbsp; So when the
waves were calm, I would stand with one hand on the boom or sometimes on
the backstay.&nbsp; Occasionally, I would stand on the seat peering high
over the boat, but I never stayed there long because the perch was too
precarious.&nbsp; And I have to admit that I never wore my lifevest.&nbsp;
I always had it in the cockpit with me, but it wouldn't have done me any
good if I had fallen overboard.
<p>1:35&nbsp; Towboat #46 - Crescent City
<p>1:40 Towboat #47 - Olmstead
<p>Both of the previous towboats were going upstream carrying a load of
coal.&nbsp; Upstream meant that the coal didn't come from Eastern Kentucky!
<p>About 1:50, I spotted a gaudy casino on the Indiana side.&nbsp; It's
interesting that Kentucky has horse racing and a lottery, but no casinos!&nbsp;
We keep our gambling in check in this state!
<br><img SRC="FamilyPics/Jun08067.jpg">
<br>Indiania Casino
<p>2:02 Daymark 619.4&nbsp; = 11 miles in 1.5 hours = 7 mph!&nbsp; Wow,
my best time yet.
<p>At 2:35, just passing the daymark at mile 623, I could see rain on the
river ahead.&nbsp; I stopped to top off the gas tank and prepare myself
for the coming storm.&nbsp; But the rain never came.&nbsp; I spent all
day expecting it to rain at any moment with the dark skies, and dreading
it, but it actually rained very little on me.&nbsp; I think about the weather
A LOT!&nbsp; The forecasts for most of this trip have been pretty dismal.&nbsp;
So I have spent each day anticipating the worst - thunderstorms with high
winds and hard rain almost all day long.&nbsp; But for the most part, the
weather was better than forecast.&nbsp; Today, it was foggy and hazy all
day.
<p>2:55&nbsp; Towboat # 48 - River Princess
<p>The river has been noticeably different since Louisville.&nbsp; There
have been very few residences near the water and no signs of towns.&nbsp;
Perhaps this part of the riverbank is low and tends to flood.&nbsp; It
is striking the change from the other side of the McAlpine Lock to this
side.
<p>At 3:15, I could hear the guns from Ft. Knox, or I thought, "maybe it
is thunder."
<br>&nbsp;
<p>About 4, I checked the weather channel on my marine radio.&nbsp; The
front that had been over me all day had picked up steam as it moved off
the river.&nbsp; It caused severe storms in Elizabethtown with some trees
down and wind reported at 80 mph!&nbsp; I sure am glad I missed that weather!
<p>At 4:25, a large 30 foot cabin cruiser that threw huge waves passed
going upstream.&nbsp; It appeared to have a husband and wife on board,
with the wife steering and the husband tending to some lines near the water.&nbsp;
Their passing led me to contemplate the various ways other people do this
same trip.&nbsp; I had to admit that you can do this trip a lot easier
and in style in a $30,000 power yacht and stopping at marinas every night
with electric hookups to run air conditioning and satellite TV!&nbsp; But
then I was proving that it CAN be done in a $50 sailboat.

<p>4:30&nbsp; Towboat #49 - Robert McBride
<p>About 5:30, just after I had passed under a dark cloud again without
rain, I spotted a BIG BOAT coming around the bend.&nbsp; It was so strange
to see another boat. I had seen so few boats on the river since Louisville,
other than the towboats.&nbsp; And this was a big passenger boat!&nbsp;
As it got near I realized it was a steamboat with paddle wheels.&nbsp;
It was the Mississippi Queen!&nbsp; I was really excited to see that famous
boat pass me by.&nbsp; The passengers who were braving the weather on the
decks all waved at me, and I waved back.
<p><img SRC="FamilyPics/Jun08071.jpg">
<p>5:45 Towboat #50 - Pat McBride
<p>About 6:30, I pulled into Buck Creek. The creek was barely big enough
to do.&nbsp; The main problem was overhanging trees which barely gave room
for my mast to slip between them.&nbsp; But this was the only half-way
decent creek for many miles.&nbsp; The creek was not much wider than my
boat was long.&nbsp; I knew I would have difficulty turning around so I
eased into the creek backward using the oars.
<p><img SRC="FamilyPics/Jun08073.jpg">
<br>Buck Creek
<p>I oared back about 50 yards to a nice clearing, intending to put out
one anchor from the front and one from the back to hold me straight in
the middle of the stream.&nbsp; When I arrived at a suitable spot, I threw
out the river anchor from the back of the boat and prepared to hustle to
the front to put out the Danforth.
<p>That's when I first noticed that a slight breeze was making it's way
straight up the creek from the river.&nbsp; It was just enough wind to
blow the front of my boat toward the shore and the overhanging limbs eager
to entangle my mast!
<p>I grabbed the oars and pulled hard breaking one of the bull rings I
was using for oar locks.&nbsp; I wished I had invested in the right kind
of brass oar locks instead of making do with the plastic bull rings.&nbsp;
But I did manage to get the boat back in the middle of the creek.&nbsp;
Then I threw out the Danforth anchor and chain from the front of the boat.
<p>I sat for a long time picturing in my mind how I was going to get the
boat out of this narrow slot.&nbsp; I knew that if I pulled up either of
the anchors quickly, the other end of the boat could swing toward shore
and into the trees.&nbsp; I realized I would have to let out a few feet
of the front anchor and take up the slack on the back anchor until I was
directly over the back anchor.&nbsp; Then I would have to slowly pull toward
the front anchor until I was directly over it and the boat was not moving.&nbsp;
Then I could lift it aboard and hurry back to the motor and start it and
make my way out - IF the wind didn't blow me ashore before I got the motor
started.&nbsp; It all worked in my mind, so I didn’t worry too much about
it during the night.&nbsp; But I realized that this creek was really too
small for me.
<p>After I settled in and had something to eat, I decided it was time to
narrow down the search for that pesky leak.
<p>First, I moved things around so I could crawl up in the each of the
claustrophobic quarter berths to see if I had a leak around the bottom
of the cockpit.&nbsp; I suspected that to be my culprit, but everything
seemed very dry there.
<p>I re-examined the pivot hole bolt, and it looked like I had completely
solved that little drip.
<p>By drying an area and waiting, I could tell that the leak was coming
from farther forward.&nbsp; I suspected the front of the keel slot.&nbsp;
I had noticed that the previous owners had put a lot of fiberglass at the
front end of the slot. Perhaps they were trying to solve this same pesky
leak.
<p>So I had to move everything from the V-berth out into the cockpit so
that I could look in the lockers beneath.&nbsp; It took quite some time
to get all that junk out into the cockpit.
<p>As soon as I opened the locker cover, I saw that the forwardmost V lockers
were FILLED WITH WATER.&nbsp; I was alarmed at how much water!&nbsp; This
was obviously the source of my problem.&nbsp; I removed 2 buckets full
of water from the V berth lockers.
<p>I sponged everything dry and looked for the leak. It came from a very
mysterious place right beneath the cross-bracing.&nbsp; I couldn't understand
why it would leak there.
<p>I had a tube of marine epoxy so I decided to try to stop the leak from
the inside, a task which I consider usually impossible.&nbsp; I epoxied
the sources and slowed it down a little, but was still disturbed at how
fast it was still flowing.
<p>I must admit to panic.&nbsp; I was far from anywhere and that was a
bad time to have a sinking boat.&nbsp; But kept telling myself to be calm.&nbsp;
I seriously considered calling Sarah and telling her to come get me as
soon as possible because… I AM SINKING!!!!&nbsp; But I didn't want to panic
her.
<p>I kept trying to calm myself down by telling myself this was not a serious
problem.&nbsp; It would take an awful lot of water to sink this boat.&nbsp;
I decided to see just how much it leaked in an hour.&nbsp; I collected
several cups full, but it was clear it was not going to sink me.&nbsp;
I might have to bail more often, but I should be Okay - if the leak was
not increasing in flow.&nbsp; I didn't expect to sleep very well that night.
<p>It was well after dark and after I had been battened down in the cabin
for some time, when I decided to check everything in the cockpit.&nbsp;
Just after I raised the hatch to make my way into the cockpit, I heard
a loud KERPLUNK in the water about 40 yards behind the boat!&nbsp; It was
an unusual sound that perplexed me.&nbsp; I have been around the water
a lot in my time.&nbsp; I have heard the SPLASH that a fish makes.&nbsp;
And I have heard the SPLAT that a beaver makes with its tail when it dives
beneath the water.&nbsp; This sound was neither of those.&nbsp; It sounded
exactly like someone had thrown a 3 inch rock into the water with a KERPLUNK!
<p>I crept into the cockpit with my flashlight and shined it around trying
to discover what it was that made this sound.&nbsp; While I sat there,
I heard another KERPLUNK!&nbsp; And then about 30 seconds later, another
KERPLUNK!
<p>My mind raced trying to figure out what in the world this could be.&nbsp;
There I was all alone in a remote creek far from anywhere and there were
very strange noises in the creek.&nbsp; My mind went to those terrifying
scenes from the movie Deliverance.&nbsp; But the banks of the river were
so thick, I didn't see how anyone could sneak along the shore without making
lots of noise.&nbsp; Were they throwing rocks into the creek to scare me?&nbsp;
Well, it was working!
<p>But I really didn't believe it was a person.&nbsp; I just couldn't imagine
what kind of animal or fish it was.&nbsp; I sat for a long time, but didn't
hear the sound again.&nbsp; So finally, I tuned my fate over to God, crawled
back into the cabin and went to sleep.&nbsp; As I drifted off to sleep,
I decided I would have to lay this episode to the mysterious "Buck Creek
Monster!"
