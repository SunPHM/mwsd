      <div style="clear:both;"></div>My first birthday in Basel was last Wednesday and the day was warm, sunny and beautiful!  I remember so many rainy birthdays back home and my mom reminding me "April showers bring May fllowers!"  Well mom rained a little sunshine on this birthday with a beautiful card and topaz necklace, which arrived in my mailbox!  How exciting to get a little package with such great things inside!  I spoke to my sister that evening, but then I speak to her almost every evening anyway!  Dad mailed a CD of photos of me and my family through the years .... a real tearjerker and really something special!  Then I heard from Dad again via video mail, which he has really taken to' says he likes it because he doesn't have to use a spellchecker!  The whole webcam thing is going to be great!  The chance to see and talk to someone so far away really helps you stay connected.  If any of you get a webcam, let us know so we can see you too sometime!<br /><br />The birthday itself was a regular old day filled with some cleaning, unpacking the final boxes, preparing for our first dinner party and the first night of this session's pottery class.  I actually spent hours of my birthday glazing some or the masterpieces that I created before the Easter break.  If they turn out any good I'll post them!  Since my actual birthday was a Wednesday, J waited until the next Friday night to take me out to a surprise dinner.  I didn't have any idea where we were going but he had us dressed up fancier then we had ever been for dinner here in Basel!  We approached a familiar tram stop by the Rhine and out we went, to cue up for entry onto a candlelit dinner cruise down the Rhine!  I would have loved to have taken photos to show on the Blog, but since I had know way of knowing where we were going, I didn't even bring the camera.  It was really quite nice, there was a half hour <em>degustation</em> (tasting) to sample some local Basel wines that were available with our meal.  The dinner that evening was a <em>Spargel</em> (asparagus) Menu. For those of you who are NOT fans of asparagus, I warn you tnot to visit the EU during springtime.... it is all the rage here now and you can't get away from it!  There is not a restaurant in town that doesn't offer a Spargel something or other!  MMMM, smell the asparagine!<br /><br />So all in all, my 33rd year is off to a great start.  I want to thank all of my family and friends who found a way by post, phone or email to remember me on my birthday - you truly made it special.  This morning we actually had someone ring our door bell with a beautiful birthday delivery for me....<br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1586.JPG"><br />We have the BEST friends!  Thanks Matt and Krysta!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Given all the nice sunshine this week, my thoughts turned to those we left at home, and I thought you might be interested in seeing more of what my daily life is like.<br /><br />Work starts for me usually around 8, and at about 9:30 most people on my floor gather in the cafe (there's one on every floor of our office building with espresso, cappuccino, sandwiches and light lunch fare) for the morning fix.  Outside the cafe is a little balcony where you can catch the morning breeze off the Rhine:<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1573.JPG"> <br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1574.JPG"><br />The river is just on the other side of the first row of buildings.<br /><br />Then, it's back to the desk for more cerebral pursuits.  Around 12-1 everyone goes to the Cantine (in another building) for lunch, where a big plate of traditional Swiss food is only about $7 (the cheapest eats in town); followed by an espresso in the cafe under the Cantine.  Back to the desk to work for a few hours.<br /><br />Just around 3 - 3:30, when *phew* this workload is killing me, the department heads off to the cafe on our floor for another top-up of espresso.  Here's the view at that time of day:<br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1576.JPG"><br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1577.JPG"><br />OK, the view isn't so great, but it's fresh air and an opportunity to get outside for a few minutes.<br /><br />Re-energized, we return to our desks for the home stretch, and what I usually find to be the most productive part of the day.  Hmm, wonder if it has anything to do with all that caffeine?!?  Sorry no pictures of the office itself, strictly verboten, company secrets and all.  Hint:  it's an open plan with very spacious cubes and lots of plants - shhh!!<br /><br />Then around 6 - 6:30, it's off to home.  Speaking of which, we had our first dinner party last week, and our dining room is starting to shape up:<br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1581.JPG"> <br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1588.JPG"><br />T has taken to regularly getting fresh-cut flowers to bring a little Basel springtime inside.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>After yet another month of almost constant gray, the clouds broke today revealing Basel in all its spring splendor.  The trees have been busily blooming (as T's allergies will attest), and our neighborhood is now simply gorgeous:<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1569.JPG"><br />Tres bourgeois, no?<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1571.JPG"><br />Do I see a "Ja?"<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1572.JPG"><br />Ja!  To making sure we mortgage the future of today's youth to pay for retirees!!<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Spent most of last week in Berlin on a trip for business.  T tagged along for the shopping.<br /><br />Berlin.  <br /><br />Just the word strikes a harmonic chord in me.  I've been there four times now: before and after the fall of the wall, and twice in the intervening orgy of development that is reuinification.  In many ways, Berlin is symbolic of my own transformation from a self-centered adolescent to a more introspective and appreciative adult.  But only if you try really hard to find symbolism in all things.  In the end, I just fell in love there, and a part of me is always there in some way.<br /><br />There is such an energy to Berlin; it's like being in Manhattan but with the European layout:  broad, cafe-lined promanades, people from all different backgrounds, cutting-edge counterculture, and they speak real German, so I have a chance at understanding people the first time they say something.  Coming back to the site of my first border crossing into East Germany, I can vividly recall the tour bus I was on: full of quietly excited teenagers, all sure this was supposed to be a great experience but without the context to really appreciate it.  I have that context now that many of the buildings have been renovated and new glass-and-steel structures put in place of the crumbling communist facades.  I remember the solemn power of the museums and other stone buildings with their imposing 20's-era architecture, covered with the grimy offal of inefficient engines, the grim-faced populace making their way through their lives, unhurried (why hurry?  Everybody gets paid, regardless); the store windows displaying all three products for sale; all color seemingly muted.  <br /><br />We stopped for a while in a park, probably part of the Tiergarten, near a fountain celebrating the triumph of socialism.  One of the girls on our tour traded her jeans (the ones she was wearing) for one of the Russian soldiers' hats.   I vividly remember her climbing back onto the bus, pantsless, and digging out another pair from her backpack.  Like crabgrass through cracks in a poorly-tended sidewalk, capitalism flourished even there and then.<br /><br />Now Berlin is vibrant and vibrating with energy, and the Brandenburg gate ushers in a new era for the city that always seems in the process of remaking itself.  If I had my choice to live anywhere in the world, it would be here.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1545.JPG"><br />Sunset from our hotel.  The ubiquitous construction cranes are unavoidable!  Allegedly Berlin has more canals than Amsterdam.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1546.JPG"><br />The bear is the mascot of Berlin (pronounced "bear-LEEN" in German").   You can find these bears, appropriately customized, all over the city.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1547.JPG"><br />As the MoMA is being renovated, some of the best pieces are on display in Berlin until the Fall.  This exhibition is extremely popular:<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1553.JPG"><br />... the line to get in wraps completely around the building ...<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1554.JPG"><br />... and the line just to buy tickets!!<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1541 - T at KaDeWe.JPG"><br />Our heroine taking a well-deserved cappucino break outside a popular department store.  Shopping can be so draining!<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the ranch, we received more keys from our landlord than we knew what to do with, so we thought this would serve as a prime example of the Swiss experience.  I called yesterday, and a representative said she would be here at 8am this morning.  At 7:58 our bell rang, she checked out the keys and took the extras.  At 12:00 noon, the locksmith arrived with freshly-cut keys for our garage, with instructions.  All in a day's work!<br /><br />We also have nesting updates:  <br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1555.JPG"><br />It seems that Celene has abandoned her nest, although we could swear we still see her flying around looking a little forlorn.<br /><br />We suspect the reason for her departure is this:<br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1557.JPG"><br />Poorly constructed at best, obviously not a Swiss bird.  Auslaender!  A new bird has taken up residence in the same tree, and perhaps there wasn't room enough for both of them? There also seems to be some evidence of a struggle; will keep you posted.<br /><br /><br />At this stage of our lives, people often ask when our little twosome might become a "threesome."  To all of you, we have good news; please welcome the newest member of our family:<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1565 - Newest family member.JPG"><br />Praise Java.<br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>J has been doing most of the blogging, so I thought I would jump in so you knew I was still here.  I have been writing the blogs with J below but you can't really tell.  We have finally unpacked most of the boxes and I came across the beautiful leather-bound journal given to us by a dear friend ( Thanks C!) before we left, to chronicle our experience abroad.  Since finding that, I have been trying to journal while J tends to the blog.   The journal just allows for a few more personal thoughts than the blog does.  <br /><br />First off, my good friend "D" is the only one willing to submit names for our new little birdie friend.  She kindly reminded me that Clarice is the woman in Silence of the Lambs, so there goes that idea - it conjures up creepy images!  I mean that man would eat people; no telling what he would do to baby birds!  Anyway, D has made a wonderful suggestion for a name that we have adopted, she is now "Celene".<br /><br />So Easter is upon us an as you see from below, the Swiss celebrate in much the same way that we do, but I would guess that even their hollow bunnies are made of fine Swiss chocolate!  This is the first holiday away and it brings a bit of sadness. Being away during the holidays makes you realize how much holidays are grounded in tradition and family.  I mean really, Sunday could come and go here and J and I would never really feel as if a holiday had passed!  We will try to call home to connect with family as the celebrations go on without us and we will be making our very own Ham dinner, in between putting together the final Ikea furniture!  Also, to keep tradition alive, we have purchased some pre-colored hard boiled eggs to continue my family's Lebanese egg-cracking tradition.  See photo below:<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1520 - Easter Eggs.JPG"><br />Not really the same without the influence of PAAS!  In the past I have purchased kits to make eggs: dotted, swirled, and even plaid!  I think someone just drew on these eggs with a marker!  They call them "picnic eggs".  Who colors their eggs for a picnic?  Who takes eggs on a picnic?  Who really GOES on picnics?<br /><br />I have been keeping very busy as I am still consulting for my old job back home (Hi everyone...especially Joan who checks in regularly!).  I have also just accepted a part-time position with the same company J works for - they have a genetics deptartment there that was in need of someone to do some educational work for them!  How fortunate! <br /><br />I have also just completed my first session of pottery class, where I did mostly hand molding, but I think I will advance to the wheel next session. I have also joined the Professional Woman's Group of Basel, which I think will serve as a great connection for me to meet other women here who are both in my age range and share my interests.   Here is a photo of my very first pottery masterpiece...I know, you are stunned by its beauty!  I think it is ALMOST as good as my nieces' pinch pots they made...but they really were much more creative than I.     <br /><br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1523 - T Pottery 1.JPG"><br />Just perfect for Olive Tapenade!  <div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Some new friends were nice enough to drive us out to wine country, so we got some great pictures of the countryside and some great tastes of Alsacian wines.  For those of you unfamiliar with this region, we learned that their most common varietals are riesling, gewurtztraminer, tokay pinot-gris, and sylvaner.  The rieslings from this region are much dryer and more complex than rieslings from Germany, only a few miles away, and J learned for the first time what "slate" tastes like in wine!  T appreciated the difference in 'terroir' (a breed of small dog - just kidding!) pronounced 'ter-WAHR' (follow the bouncing ball and pronounce through your nose).  Terroir is the unique effect of the soil on the flavor of local wines, different even from hill to hill!<br /><br />Other wine tips we learned:<br />- in general, the poorer the soil, the sweeter the wine, because poorer soil produces fewer grapes<br />- sylvaner is considered so dry as to only be appreciable in combination with food<br />- in the absence of other French vocabulary, a good word to know is 'degustation' (= free tastings!  Whee!)<br />- Tokay-pinot gris is the more full-flavored of the Alsatian wines<br />- when tasting, sample the gewurztraminer last, as it may overpower the next wines<br />- it is generally considered in poor taste to snarf wine out through your nose from laughing too much (this may be a local French thing)<br /><br />Our our begins in Colmar, heading in the direction of Strasbourg...<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1470.JPG"><br />The chef in the window is washing the dishes.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1472.JPG"><br />This house has obviously been indulging in the escargots and Tokay-Pinot Gris!<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1481.JPG"><br />The Alsatian vines, still sleeping off the winter chill, on the way to Kayserberg.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1483.JPG"><br />In Alsace, the storks bring wine, not babies!  They seem to be the local bird...<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1486 - Loading the Grape.JPG"><br />T's theory is that they squish the grapes one at a time, under this mallet.  Now who's been drinking too much?<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1490.JPG"><br />French countryside, on the way to Riquewihr.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1496.JPG"><br />Barrels of fun!<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1498.JPG"><br />This is oddly, typically, Europe: the juxtaposition of ancient and modern.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1499.JPG"><br />Here's a sign you won't see in the US - marking the town gate, built in 1291.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1511.JPG"><br />This castle (Haut Koenigsbourg), perched way up on a hill, has its own windmill!<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1515.JPG"><br />...its own windmill - completely self-sufficient, in the event of attack.  <br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1503.JPG"><br />The view over the countryside, in sun...<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1506.JPG"><br />And curtains of spring rain.<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1508.JPG"><br />And these two towns likely regard each other as "outsiders!"<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1518.JPG"><br />CRAZY BUNNY!!!  Coming to get you!!!  Son of the killer Easter Bunny!!<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1519.JPG"><br />We had dinner here in Ribeauville overlooked by yet another castle.  <br /><br /><br />It's only a model.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Sunday morning, and some new friends invited us to drive with them to Alsace to taste some wines.<br /><br />Went out last night for sushi, and it was actually pretty good!  For here, anyway - good fish, decent rolls, only slightly more expensive than what we would expect to pay in the US for mid-range sushi.  The only real complaint was the lack of selection - only tuna, salmon, yellowtail and whitefish.<br /><br />We're debating names for our new birdie friend and her family.  T thinks she looks like a Clarice.  Any other suggestions?  Send them to us and we'll post them! <br /><br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Spring has arrived, this time for real!  Here's what we found today just beneath our balcony:<br /><br /><img src="http://creeden.us/PICT1457 - Birds nest.JPG"><br /><br />Still shopping in our free time on the weekends for more furniture and lights for the apartment (people here take the lights with them when they move out, so there are bare wires dangling from the ceilings).  It's been loads of fun, and we're experimenting with lots of European styles.  Photos when they finally get hung!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
