<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>The flights from London to Helsinki and on to Oulu went 
    smoothly.  As we walked from the International to Domestic Terminals at Helsinki 
    we saw a Whitethroat and while we were waiting for the Oulu flight, Fieldfares 
    were much in evidence.<br>
    <br>
    At Oulu we were met by Ulla Peltomaki who took us to our hotel and then out 
    for some local(ish) birding.  Near Temmes we visited a small wood where Tengmalm's 
    Owls were making use of a nest box.  The female owl peered out at the assembled 
    birders before resuming her duties.<br>
    <br>
    Near the Finnature office we were entertained by a calling Corncrake, and 
    one or two of the group managed tantalisingly brief views of it.<br>
  </div>
  <div class=bodytext>Later we met up with two other groups (to minimise disturbance) 
    to try for views of Ural Owls.  As we gathered a Woodcock flew past on its 
    roding flight and a Great Spotted Woodpecker was calling nearby.  A male Hen 
    Harrier drifted past carrying prey presumably for young, or a nesting female 
    not far away.  The Ural Owl young had left the nest but one was soon found 
    and eventually both adult birds were also seen nearby. <br>

    <br>
    After a traditional meal near Liminka we were driven back to the hotel.  Before 
    finally dropping us off, our Finnature guide drove us the short distance to 
    the shore where we saw just one Whooper Swan but plenty of ducks, including 
    Red-breasted Merganser, Goldeneyes and a pair of Garganey. </div>

<div class=bodytext> 
  <p><span class="bodytextbold"><b>Day 2:</b></span><b> <span class="tourdate">6th 
    June</span></b></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>We left the hotel at about 8.15 a.m. and set off for our 
    first full day’s birding in the Oulu area.  Our first stop was to search a 
    piece of shoreline on an Oulu island for Terek Sandpiper, which sadly eluded 
    us.  However many other good things were seen here including Whooper Swans, 
    Greylag Geese, all three sawbill species, Marsh Harrier, Curlew, Oystercatcher, 
    Ringed Plover and Redshank.  Best of all at this site were three species of 
    terns: Arctic, Little and at least three Caspians.<br>
    <br>
    Still within Oulu, we visited another site which at first glimpse seemed like 
    a piece of rough, wet grassland - in fact that's all it really was.  However, 
    the birds here were a stark reminder of  ‘times past' in Britain.  Snipe, 
    Redshanks and Lapwings seemed to be everywhere; Sedge Warblers sang from the 
    bushes and Reed Buntings from the reeds.  Whinchats were also present and 
    Corn Buntings sang from posts and bushes.<br>
    <br>
    An even rougher looking piece of stony land next to an industrial building 
    site also proved well worth a visit.  Arctic Terns were settling in the area 
    - some, perhaps, already nesting.  Temminck's Stint gave their lovely trilling 
    song flight while a lone Turnstone wandered around somewhat aimlessly.  There 
    were also a few Ringed Plovers and Little Ringed Plovers present giving good 
    opportunities to compare the differences between the two species.<br>
    <br>
    From here we went to the Liminginlahti area and began birding at the northern 
    end.  A boardwalk led to a tower, which overlooked the bay and some wet coastal 
    grassland.  Ducks were present in small numbers and included Teal, Wigeon, 
    Shoveler and a couple of male Pintails.  A Bittern boomed from a nearby reedbed 
    over which a male Marsh Harrier hunted on stiffly held wings.<br>
    <br>
    After a hearty lunch at the Liminginlahti Nature Centre, another boardwalk 
    led to tower hide overlooking the bay.  Better views of Garganey were enjoyed 
    as were Black-tailed Godwits in their fine brick-red summer plumage.  Ruffs 
    were seen lekking briefly and far out on the marshes, the top halves of two 
    Bean Geese were just visible above the longer grasses.  Most frustrating of 
    all, another Corncrake was calling occasionally from short, wet grassland 
    near the tower hide.  Despite the sparseness of the vegetation and our elevated 
    viewpoint, it remained as elusive as the same species yesterday.  As we took 
    the boardwalk back towards the Centre, a Scarlet Rosefinch was singing from 
    one of the bushes and gave everyone excellent views.<br>

    <br>
    A further drive to woodland near Siikajoki led to a pleasant walk along dry 
    woodland tracks (despite recent rain).  A gaze between appropriate pine trees 
    revealed a huge nest, formerly built and occupied by Goshawks.  Sitting proudly 
    on this nest was a superb Great Grey Owl.  A pair of glaring yellow eyes peered 
    back at us and soon a chick peered out from beneath its mother and entertained 
    us for a while.  Eventually, mosquitoes become quite bothersome and we left.  
    Despite a couple of stops on the return journey, no further species of real 
    interest were located that day.</div>

  <p><span class="bodytextbold"><b>Day 3:</b></span><b> <span class="tourdate">7th 
    June</span></b></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>Today was our first day with Tony Eskelin who was to be 
    our guide for the remainder of the tour.  Our first destination was a piece 
    of coniferous woodland near Kiiminki.  Spotted Flycatchers and a fine male 
    Brambling entertained us whilst we waited for the 'main event' at this site. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Telescopes and binoculars were trained on a hole in a birch tree and soon, 
    a male Three-toed Woodpecker arrived and gave a soft call.  Immediately, the 
    female appeared from inside the hole and dashed off before we could get a 
    look at her.  The male was no more obliging as it promptly disappeared into 
    the hole!  A short while later, he emerged from the nest and rather than flying 
    off to left or right, he flew directly towards us.  One of the taller members 
    of the group nearly ended up with a new parting in his hair - which is how 
    close he came to us!  We stayed here for a good while longer enjoying not 
    only the woodpeckers but also the sounds of a Greenshank in song flight nearby.  
    As we drove away from this site, a pair of Red-breasted Mergansers was seen 
    on a small lake.<br>
    <br>
    At another location near Kiiminki, we walked to a nesting box occupied by 
    a pair of Pygmy Owls but due to the time of day, neither adult put in an appearance.<br>
    <br>
    To the north of Oulu we visited a site where Terek Sandpipers are known to 
    nest.  Again the target bird eluded us, but Arctic Terns, Ringed and Little 
    Ringed Plovers, Oystercatchers and Temminck's Stints were all well seen.  
    After lunch we spent time in the Liminka area including a visit to another 
    part of the Liminginlahti reserve.  What looked to be little more than a flooded 
    field turned out to be a superb wetland area for waders.  Wood Sandpipers 
    hid among the shortest of vegetation, while Lapwings and Black-tailed Godwits 
    flew overhead giving alarm calls suggesting they were breeding nearby.  Marsh 
    Harriers drifted effortlessly over reed beds bringing a temporary silence 
    to the singing Sedge Warblers and Reed Buntings.  We lingered at this super 
    place but time was pressing and we had other stops to make.<br>
    <br>
    Alongside a dirt road we stopped at a place which looked no different to the 
    rest of the road we had travelled.  However just a few yards away, an Ortolan 
    Bunting was singing in a tree and everyone had excellent views.  A little 
    further along the same road another stop was made and the target bird duly 
    obliged – a Corncrake was well seen by everyone and this more than made up 
    for the species elusiveness on the previous two days.  Returning towards the 
    tarred road we stopped at a small woodland.  Here a Long-eared Owl was the 
    star attraction - the attentions of the mosquitoes were less welcome!<br>
    <br>
    After the evening meal, some of the group went out for more birding.  Some 
    miles from Oulu we were taken to another woodland.  It was rather wet underfoot 
    (!!) but we made it through to a place where a pair of Pygmy Owls was known 
    to be using a nest box.  Calling nearby indicated the presence of an adult 
    owl, but it was some considerable time before we got to see it.  The wait 
    was interspersed with mosquito catching (plenty present!) and occasional roding 
    song flights by a Woodcock.  After we all had good views of the female owl, 
    we peered into the nest box to see nine well-feathered young (a few days from 
    fledging).  The sound they made at each successive viewer resembled loud, 
    popping popcorn – an interesting sound to say the least.<br>
    <br>
    One more location was to be visited before we returned to the hotel.  To the 
    north of Oulu we were driven into an old sand/gravel quarry.  This had recently 
    been landscaped yet it still looked very bare.  Young trees planted in the 
    area made very little difference to the barren look, but in time a forest 
    will make the area useless for what we were about to see.  Eleven lekking 
    male Black Grouse were assembled in an area about 200 yards from our viewpoint. 
    Their 'bubbling' and 'sneezing' calls were clearly audible and as they fanned 
    their tails in full display, it became apparent that a twelfth bird in their 
    midst was a displaying Capercaillie.  It was rather strange to learn that 
    this bird was so 'lonely' that he sought the 'company' of Black Grouse.  The 
    surrounding pine forests had been improved (as far as timber production was 
    concerned) and this was very much to the detriment of the breeding Capercaillie 
    population.  Suddenly the Capercaillie seemed to become more aggressive and 
    drove the Black Grouse away thus leaving him in sole possession of the display 
    ground.  We decided to leave him to it, reaching our hotel about midnight.</div>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>Today we were to transfer to Kuusamo.  Rain greeted us as 
    we set out and it increased in intensity as we drove through the outskirts 
    of Oulu.  Toni took us to a lake close to the town where we were able to birdwatch 
    from inside the minibus.  Great Crested Grebes swam and dived not too far 
    out, Tufted Ducks and Goldeneyes busied themselves in search of food and overhead, 
    Arctic Terns continued to fly around despite the rain.  As the rain eased 
    to a mere downpour (!) we could see a Whooper Swan which added a little grace 
    to the area.  A pair of Smew took off and disappeared over the trees and some 
    Red-breasted Mergansers drifted past before we set off on the journey.<br>
    <br>
    Near Jolaskyia, we took some time to visit another lake.  A tower hide overlooked 
    the area and from here, a number of birds were visible.  Arctic Terns flew 
    around searching for insects, their grace and beauty rivalled by Little Gulls 
    whose dark underwings were clearly visible.  Swallows and Sand Martins were 
    also trying their best to deplete insect numbers but was it our imagination 
    or were they really leaving the mosquitoes alone?! <br>
    <br>
    Common Snipe were displaying while Curlews added to the magic of the location 
    as their haunting calls drifted across on the breeze.  A nearby Cuckoo added 
    its voice to the atmosphere and across the road, the repetitive yet tuneful 
    song of a Scarlet Rosefinch could be heard.<br>
    <br>
    Our search for new birds continued until eventually, far out across the marsh 
    a pair of Slavonian Grebes was sighted.  Unfortunately they were busy nest 
    building just beyond a reedy island.  Most of their activity was hidden from 
    view, but every now and then, one bird would swim out, collect a beakful of 
    nesting material and return to the reedy edge.  The top half of the other 
    bird could then be seen working this new vegetation into the actual nest.<br>
    <br>
    Whilst we watched this lake, the rain eased to a mere drizzle, but as we set 
    off on our journey, the heavens opened again and birding was impossible.<br>
    <br>
    We had lunch in Pudasjarvi and then completed our journey to Kuusamo with 
    little further of note (except more rain), but a few kilometres before the 
    town, we turned off to view a great location for birds - the Kuusamo rubbish 
    tip!  A host of Ravens and a number of Hooded Crows vied for attention with 
    Wood Sandpipers and Ringed Plovers on a small pond and also various gulls 
    on the tip itself.<br>
    <br>
    By the end of the evening meal, the weather had improved considerably and 
    an evening walk along the shore of the adjacent lake seemed worthwhile.  Whooper 
    Swans were seen and a couple of plovers along the shore were worthy of note.  
    There was a Little Ringed Plover which was ringed and a Ringed Plover which 
    was not.</div>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>What a difference the sun makes!  Today we awoke to glorious 
    sunshine and after breakfast, we drove to a nearby lake, south of Kuusamo.  
    A Black-throated Diver was the first bird to draw our attention and this was 
    quickly followed by the main reason for visiting this location - a Red-necked 
    Grebe.  The pleasant song of a Rustic Bunting cascaded from a superb male 
    at the top of a lakeside pine, but all too soon it flew to some scrub and 
    was not seen again.  A short drive later and we were soon watching Little 
    Bunting and while here, we saw a couple of Willow Tits and a group of a dozen 
    or so Crossbills flew over calling.<br>
    <br>
    We drove to the north of Kuusamo and paused for a while to see a pair of Siberian 
    Tits taking food to young in a nest box.  Pied Flycatcher and Redstart sang 
    nearby and Siskins were often about.  A small lake attracted a number of birds 
    including Little Gulls, Greenshank and our first Whimbrel of the trip.<br>
    <br>
    On our way towards Rukantunturi, we stopped off at another lake where Whooper 
    Swans and Goldeneyes were seen; the grace of the swans contrasted with the 
    'hustle and bustle' of the diving ducks.  As we walked up a track, a Common 
    Sandpiper flew from her nest of four eggs and gave a convincing broken wing 
    display. Another Siberian Tit was feeding amongst the pines. Further up the 
    hill, we reached a point that overlooked a gorge.  Here the telescopes were 
    trained on a spot where a female Eagle Owl rested close to her two chicks.  
    At the high point of the road near Rukantunturi a Siberian Jay made a brief 
    appearance but was obviously well fed by other birders who were also picnicking 
    in the area; it did not return while we were there.<br>
    <br>
    As we travelled on to our next destination, a brief pause to look over a lake 
    produced four Bean Geese.  Further on we paused to search for dippers.  White 
    Wagtails and Sand Martins were taking insects along the river and then we 
    found a true Finnish rarity for the area - a Grey Wagtail.  Whilst we admired 
    two Dippers (of the Continental Black-bellied form) our Finnature guide was 
    keen to watch the Grey Wagtail which he immediately broadcast on the local 
    'Birdline'.<br>
    <br>
    At a lake further on, a couple of Velvet Scoters and a male Smew were amongst 
    the birds seen. A continuous, loud whine from a huge swarm of insects sounded 
    very threatening but we were assured that the insects (in this case!) were 
    of the non-biting variety.<br>
    <br>
    After more searching for birds we returned to the hotel for a rest before 
    the evening meal. Later, we enjoyed a superb and all too brief slide show 
    of local landscapes and wildlife by a local photographer - an excellent end 
    to the day.</div>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>We set out at 5.00 a.m. for an early morning 'grouse drive' 
    through forests to the east of Kuusamo.  Not long after entering the woodlands, 
    a male Black Grouse was well seen before it flew off into the trees and was 
    lost to view.  Further on, a couple of Crossbills flew up from the track as 
    we rounded a bend, but they quickly disappeared and were not seen again.  
    Occasional Reindeer and Arctic/Mountain Hares were seen but pride of place 
    in the mammal line went to the two male Elk which paused for some while before 
    lumbering off into the trees.  There were other occasional glimpses of female 
    Black Grouse and Capercaillie but not everyone saw these.  We returned to 
    the hotel for a 7.00 a.m. breakfast after which we set out for another days 
    birding.<br>
    <br>
    Our journey to Rukantunturi was via some quiet mountain tracks where we saw 
    a few interesting species but on arrival at the parking area, three Siberian 
    Jays were being fed by other birders.  We paused here for some time to enjoy 
    close views of these delightful and confiding birds.<br>
    <br>
    This set us in good stead for our walk up the nearby mountain.  Siskins and 
    Pied Flycatchers sang to accompany our journey and the higher we went the 
    grander the view that unfolded around us.  Eventually we reached an appropriate 
    place to take a rest amongst the superb ancient pine forest while our guide 
    sought our target bird.  On his return we were taken to a spot from where 
    we had distant but satisfying views of a Red-flanked Bluetail.  Further glimpses 
    proved how elusive this species can be.  We then set off for the walk back 
    to the mini-bus.<br>
    <br>
    Soon we were having lunch at the Oulanka National Park Centre after which 
    we were taken to a lake where a dozen or so Velvet Scoters were watched sailing 
    majestically past five male and two female Smews.  A Wood Sandpiper was exceptionally 
    confiding as we stood on a small jetty from which a Common Sandpiper had flown 
    on our arrival.  A couple of distant Waxwings, complete with prominent crests, 
    encouraged us to visit the far end of the lake in search of woodland species.  
    A Great Spotted Woodpecker flew past calling and then, in the broad valley 
    in front of us, a Wryneck began its distinctive song.  After some considerable 
    search, it was found in the top of a twiggy, dead tree and then it flew towards 
    us landing near the top of a small pine - we now enjoyed excellent views!<br>
    <br>
    Despite our early start, it seemed we had to leave this idyllic setting all 
    to soon and head back to the hotel for a rest before the evening meal.</div>

  <div class=bodytext>Today, we left Kuusamo at 8.00 a.m. to head off for Ivalo 
    well to the north.  As we crossed the Arctic Circle, we paused to indulge 
    in the Finnish custom of a celebration drink (and who were we to refuse?!) 
    before heading on for a stop at a broad marshy area a short distance off our 
    main route.  Here we saw a distant Black-throated Diver sat on its nest while 
    a Common Crane flew over calling.  Bramblings sang their monotonous songs 
    from nearby trees and a Rough-legged Buzzard circled over some pines to the 
    south.<br>

    A side road out across the marsh gave us views of a Whooper Swan sat on a 
    huge nest but just as we were leaving, a Black Woodpecker flew into some pines 
    and after some searching we were treated to good views of this elusive bird.  
    We continued our journey and paused at a couple of places along the Kitinen 
    River where it broadens into a series of lakes.  Raptors seen here included 
    Goshawk and Osprey.<br>
    <br>
    After a late lunch at Peurasuvanto we completed the journey to Ivalo, occasionally

    Once we had checked in to the Hotel Ivalo, we were taken out to three sites 
    by a local birder.  The first stop to the east of Ivalo was to visit a location 
    for Hawk Owl.  The female sat calling from a pine while we enjoyed to the 
    full a short encounter with this super bird. Just behind us, a Bluethroat 
    sang its varied song, which confusingly included Waxwing calls! A nearby marsh 
    was explored and four Bean Geese were on the edge of a distant pool. <br>
    <br>
    Just along the bank from them, Ruffs lekked as a female strolled nonchalantly 
    past.  Soon we were enjoying views of the two main species we were seeking 
    here - Jack Snipe and Broad-billed Sandpiper.<br>
    On the return journey to Ivalo, we paused at some pools where Ruffs, Temminck's 
    Stints and Wood Sandpipers were numerous - probably in excess of 50 of the 
    latter species alone.<br>
    <br>
    As we headed off to the road for Ivalo, a male Hen Harrier completed an exciting 
    day's birding.</div>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>This was another travelling day, with the journey from Ivalo 
    to Vadso on Norway's Varangar Peninsula.  Before we set off northwards, we 
    took a brief trip to the pinewoods close to yesterday's marsh.  As we walked 
    through the area the behaviour of a pair of Rough-legged Buzzards suggested 
    they had a nest nearby.<br>
    <br>
    Soon we were on the road heading for a new area - a new country even!  A brief 
    stop at the viewpoint overlooking part of Lake Inari proved worthwhile, but 
    apart from singing Bramblings and Willow Warblers, no birds were seen. <br>
  </div>
  <div class=bodytext>Further on we took a short detour towards Toivoniemi where 
    birds were in short supply compared to previous visits.  A Wood Sandpiper 
    flew up from the edge of the roadside while a little further on, 3 male Ruffs 
    were lekking right on the edge of the road.  An Elk was feeding beside the 
    river.<br>
    A couple of hours after leaving the hotel, we paused briefly at a 'roadside 
    stop' where we were able to obtain excellent views of Greenfinches and Mealy 
    Redpolls on some feeders. <br>
    <br>
    Further stops along the way produced views of Black-throated Divers and Common 
    Scoters on roadside lakes. <br>
    <br>
    After lunch we crossed the border into Norway and drove to the north of Tana 
    Bru to a site for Gyr Falcons.  Here the aerial skills and abilities of these 
    birds were seen to good effect when first the male and later the female (a 
    considerably larger bird) showed how they could ride the air currents along 
    their nesting cliff.  After they had been perched high on rock ledges for 
    some while, the female suddenly took off calling in alarm; the male immediately 
    followed and as they powered their way along high above us, we became aware 
    of the cause for their concern.  A White-tailed Eagle had drifted into their 
    air space and provided a potential threat. Unfortunately all three birds disappeared 
    over the cliff top before we could view an encounter.<br>
    <br>
    The final birding of the day was at Hoyholmen.  Arctic Terns were numerous 
    and their usual aggressive selves; Arctic Skuas were nesting too; Temminck's 
    and Little Stints were mingling with Ringed Plovers and a Sanderling whilst 
    a group of Oystercatchers, Bar-tailed Godwits and a few Knots formed a 'high 
    tide roost'.  Eiders were a little way off shore and about 100 Goosanders 
    were resting on a sandy island.<br>
    <br>
    We then completed our journey to Vadso along the shores of the Varangar Fijord 
    on which numerous Eiders, Goosanders and Gulls could be seen.</div>

<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>After donning winter clothes for the pre-breakfast walk 
    (due to it being rather cool yesterday), we began to realise our mistake as 
    we set foot outside the hotel.  To say it was warm and sunny would be an understatement.  
    We walked around Store Vodsoya where Arctic Terns and Common Gulls were breeding 
    in abundance.  Temminck's Stints gave their trilling song flights and there 
    were a couple of Arctic Hares nearby.  Red-throated Pipit and Arctic Redpolls 
    were found amongst the dwarf willows and on the usual pond there were at least 
    40 Red-necked Phalaropes.  Ruffs lekked on some flatter ground while along 
    the shoreline there were plenty of gulls including a constant procession of 
    Kittiwakes.<br>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    After breakfast we began to drive and bird watch eastwards from Vadso.  At 
    the far end of the harbour, a group of Common Eiders was checked and found 
    to contain five male and two female Steller's Eiders.  Goosanders either loafed 
    about on the weed-covered rocks or dived for food a short distance out on 
    the sea.<br>
    <br>
    Close to Hoyvik, our Finnature guide Toni spotted the huge dorsal fins of 
    some Orcas (Killer Wales) far out on Varangar Fjord.  Despite the distance, 
    everyone managed to see them and we estimated that there were perhaps eight 
    of these magnificent creatures present. <br>
    <br>
    For a short while, our concentration on the Orcas was broken when about a 
    dozen Harbour Porpoises drifted past in the opposite direction (going east) 
    fairly close to shore.<br>
    <br>
    Thousands of Kittiwakes were feeding and whirling around in huge flocks and 
    these were occasionally harried by Arctic Skuas.  After checking the beach 
    on the way out to Store Ekkeroy and seeing a variety of waders, we visited 
    the island's huge Kittiwake colony. The sight and sounds were almost overwhelming 
    - not to mention the smell!  Here, Razorbill and Black Guillemot were added 
    to the list.<br>
    <br>
    During lunch we saw that a huge bank of mist was heading our way.  Soon we 
    were enveloped in a cooling blanket of sea fog, which restricted our view 
    considerably. Kittiwakes, which had been taking a short cut across land to 
    their nesting colony, were now hugging all the contours of the coastline. 
     They appeared out of the mist, passed us and then faded into the distance.<br>
    <br>
    In an effort to climb above the mist, we decided to head further along the 
    coast and then off inland where higher ground might produce clearer views 
    and new species.  Close to the road, smart Lapland Buntings could be seen. 
     Beside a gravel road near Krampness, Shore Larks were seen and a female was 
    sitting on a roadside nest.  Further on, we went for a walk to try to find 
    Willow Grouse, which could occasionally be heard some way off. <br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately the sea mist was not the shallow 'bank' that we had hoped for 
    and it was some time before we had even 'slight' views of a grouse as the 
    mist cleared a fraction before thickening again.<br>
    <br>
    The persisting and thickening mist brought us to the conclusion that further 
    birding would be fairly useless so we headed back to the hotel in Vadso where 
    we arrived at about 6.00&nbsp;p.m. Despite the mist, we had added a fair quantity 
    of new birds - and two superb<br>
    new mammal species to our lists.</div>

</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>We left the hotel in Vadso at 8.00 a.m. and drove towards 
    Vardo.  A short way along, other birders were gull watching.  A pale gull 
    amongst them caused some discussion but our Finnature guide, Toni Eskelin, 
    is a keen 'gull watcher' and confirmed the identification as a Herring Gull/Glaucous 
    Gull hybrid.<br>
    <br>
    As we were a little short of time, we quickly headed for Vardo but an adult 
    White-tailed Eagle stopped us in our tracks.  It flew from one shoreline perch 
    to another and showed off its white tail and its huge wingspan to good advantage.<br>
    <br>
    During the boat journey to Hornoya, plenty of auks and Eiders were seen.  On 
    the island itself, we were greeted by a Brünnich's Guillemot that rested on 
    weed covered rocks throughout our stay. <br>
    The sounds of Kittiwakes were everywhere as thousands nested on the cliffs. 
     Black Guillemots rested on wave-washed rocks and their common cousins were 
    higher up the cliffs with Puffins and Razorbills.  There was a constant stream 
    of all of these species flying to and from their nesting sites and the sea.<br>
    <br>
    Puffins often flushed as one of the larger (Herring or Great Black-backed) 
    gulls flew past. However some of these comical looking auks allowed a close 
    enough approach for photography with a 20mm wide angle lens; it's a shame 
    the weather was so misty. <br>
    <br>
    There were also some recently fledged juvenile Ravens on the island.  One 
    of them looked rather incongruous as it perched on a Kittiwake's nest and 
    seemed to be wondering what to do next.  We left it to ponder its next move.<br>
    <br>
    As we waited at the landing point, Brünnich's and Common Guillemots approached 
    so closely that either camera or binoculars could hardly focus on them.<br>
    <br>
    Once back in Vardo, we checked-in to the hotel, had lunch (with Common and 
    Steller's Eiders just outside the hotel in the harbour) and then set off for 
    some more birding.<br>
    <br>
    On tundra near Indre Kiberg, we searched without success for Dotterels.  However, 
    other waders present included Dunlins, Turnstones, Ringed and Golden Plovers. 
     Red-necked Phalaropes fed busily on one of the pools while a constant stream 
    of gulls flew to a larger lake - still mostly frozen over - to bathe and preen.  
    Long-tailed Ducks dived in the same lake but kept their distance from the 
    gulls.  Arctic and Long-tailed Skuas either rested on the tundra or patrolled 
    the skies on the lookout for an easy meal.  Whenever they wandered into the 
    Turnstones’ territory, these breeding waders were robust in the defence of 
    their air space.<br>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    As the coastal mist cleared, we drove to Komagven Bay to watch the various 
    species gathering on the rising tide.  Common Eiders and Steller's Eiders 
    flew past in opposite directions before settling on the sea. Long-tailed ducks 
    were numerous and Goosanders drifted by in convoy.  A Red-throated Diver was 
    well seen, a few Common Scoters were diving for food but a lone, female Scaup 
    was elusive.<br>
    <br>
    On the way back to Vardo, we drove up a hill to search for Snow Buntings. 
     A male flew past but too quickly for most of the group to see it.  Our final 
    stop of the day was at Vardo to overlook the channel between the island and 
    the mainland.  A flock of about 140 King Eiders contained just one adult male; 
    the rest were juvenile males, in various stages of moult, and a few females.</div>

<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>Four male and two female Common Eiders plus two male Steller's 
    Eiders were visible from the hotel windows before breakfast today.<br>
    <br>
    Poor weather had settled in during our sleeping hours (or can we still call 
    it 'night'?) and continued for most of the morning; sometimes light rain, 
    sometimes it poured down.<br>
    <br>
    A slow drive to Hamningberg was the plan today and we began just beyond the 
    Vardo tunnel and on to the minor road northwards. <br>
    <br>
    Golden Plovers piped alarm calls whilst we watched a mixed flock of Common 
    and King Eiders on the sea. Goosanders were there in abundance and a Red-throated 
    Pipit perched on top of a nearby shrub.  A few Wigeon and nine or ten Pintails 
    flew up from a roadside ditch.  They circled round overhead giving good views 
    to those of us brave enough to stand out and endure the rain.  Further on, 
    small tundra pools and larger lakes held a good number of Red-throated Divers 
    - nine on just one pond for instance.  A male Scaup swam and dived on another 
    pond, which held two more divers. <br>
    <br>
    Later, nine Bean Geese were grazing alongside another freshwater pool and 
    again, there was a Red-throated Diver loafing about on the water.  Occasional 
    Red-necked Phalaropes, Ruffs, Wood Sandpipers and other waders were seen and 
    every bay held plenty of Common Eiders, Goosanders and Long-tailed Ducks - 
    but sadly no White-billed Diver.<br>
    <br>
    A small pod of Porpoises were seen swimming around towards Vardo and there 
    was a constant passage of thousands of Kittiwakes.  Wherever food was surfacing, 
    Herring and Great Black-backed Gulls and a few Gannets joined huge swirling 
    flocks of these delightful gulls.  This was most evident at Hamningberg where 
    we had lunch and watched the passage of gulls and a few auks, including some 
    Black Guillemots, not far off shore.<br>
    <br>
    Close to Hamningberg we saw a good number of Reindeer all growing new antlers 
    in a covering of velvet. We drove a track out past some huts and across the 
    tundra.  A male Bluethroat hopped on to the track and we all had good views 
    of him.  We soon became aware that there was another bird present and this 
    was his mate; she was busy nest building in a little hollow very close to 
    some trackside bushes.<br>
    <br>
    As we drove back towards Vardo, we constantly searched the sea for one of 
    the special birds of the area but White-billed Diver eluded us.  We also took 
    the road towards Vadso searching for the same species. There were plenty of 
    the usual sea ducks and we also saw Arctic Redpoll and Shore Lark at one of 
    these stops - but still no diver.<br>
    <br>
    Heading back towards Vardo, we stopped to search for Snow Buntings.  Soon 
    we were watching a pair feeding around the edges of a patch of snow.  A couple 
    more males completed our bird watching for the day except for the Steller's 
    and Common Eiders and an adult Glaucous Gull from the hotel window.</div>

  <div class=bodytext>A dull start to the day both weather-wise and by a lack 
    of Steller's Eider in the harbour by the hotel!<br>
    We left to begin our journey to Ivalo in Finland. Constant stops to search 
    the sea paid off when Toni eventually found a White-billed Diver.  His thoroughness 
    and persistence throughout his time with us yielded many extra species that 
    would have otherwise been missed.  After everyone had obtained fair views 
    of this special bird, a group of American birders arrived and whilst we were 
    showing them the diver, a White-tailed Eagle flew up from the beach area. 
     It was mobbed by a large group of gulls including a Glaucous.  A pair of 
    Bean Geese flew over before we set off on the next part of our journey.<br>
    <br>
    We arrived at Nesseby and spent some time watching the Red-necked Phalaropes 
    on the pool near the church.  Goosanders, Common Scoters, Common and about 
    20 Steller's Eiders were on the sea and nearby rocks while waders on the mud 
    included Curlew, Bar-tailed Godwit, Turnstone, Redshank and Dunlin.  We also 
    saw a Shelduck feeding in a tidal pool.<br>
    <br>
    After lunch at Utsjoki, we were driven up a nearby hill to search for mountain 
    top species. By now the weather had improved considerably and some of us were 
    regretting donning the necessary thick clothing at the start of the day.  Some 
    time later, a female Dotterel flew past calling and then landed not far away. 
    This gave everyone ample opportunity to get good views of this relatively 
    confiding species.<br>
    <br>
    At one other brief stop on the journey, Pied Flycatcher, Redpoll and Brambling 
    were all heard singing.</div>

<blockquote> 
  <div class=bodytext>Journey home day today so after a late-ish breakfast (to 
    allow for some packing time) we set out to visit a woodland 40 kilometres 
    to the south of Ivalo.  Unfortunately, the instructions on how to find a specific 
    Capercaillie's nest were not quite as accurate as we had hoped.  Despite attempts 
    by our local Finnish guide to phone the photographer who had located the nest, 
    he could not be reached and the nest was never found.  Our Finnature guide 
    was as disappointed as the group members that the local guide had failed us 
    on this occasion.  However Bramblings sang from the depths of the pine forest 
    and the journeys each way were punctuated by stops to watch the large herds 
    of Reindeer close to the roadside.<br>
    <br>
    After a leisurely 'final pack' we headed for Ivalo airport for an uneventful 
    flight to Helsinki and then onwards to Heathrow.<br>
  </div>
  <div class=bodytext>
    <hr>
    <p><br>
      This was a highly successful tour with a grand total of 181 species of birds 
      and 11 species of mammal recorded.<br>
      <br>
      There was considerable good humour amongst the group (as is typical with 
      so many tours) and our Finnature guide worked hard to ensure that we saw 
      so many of the special birds of the locations visited. Seven species of 
      owl, 28 species of wader and elusive birds like Red-flanked Bluetail and 
      Corncrake were just some of the highlights; but no doubt each person in 
      the group will have had their own favourite species, places and moments.<br>
       <br>
      To sum it all up, it was a great trip with excellent birding in fabulous 
      places and all attained in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. </p>
