</FONT>Tom is flying today--April 17th--to see how many stragglers remain at Aransas, and you'll hear the results
			next week.<BR>
			Last time Tom predicted he'd find fewer than 50 birds on today's flight. Next time we'll see how close Tom's prediction
			came! Meanwhile, Tom sent us this letter, written a few days ago. Read carefully to find out the two most important
			conditions to help cranes in their journey north. At what time of day do they usually take off from Aransas? How
			far could they fly in a day? (What place is that distance from where you live?) How long does it typically take
			whoopers to reach their summer breeding grounds in Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park? What slows them down?<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Dear Journey North,<BR>
			We've had great migration conditions every day the first 10 days in April. Let me try to describe the conditions
			that help the cranes migrate and also answer some of the questions I asked last week.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="black">Two things are most important for the migrating cranes.</FONT> The first is favorable winds.
			The cranes want a wind either behind them or at an angle to their route so the stream of air can push them along.
			Leaving the coast of Texas, all the cranes so far in April that have migrated have had very strong southeast winds.
			&quot;Southeast&quot; winds mean they are coming from the southeast and thus will push the cranes to the northwest.
			Since the cranes' direct migration route is a compass bearing of 332 degrees (north-northwest), the southeast &quot;tailwinds&quot;
			provide them a strong push at their tail. Several times during their trip north, the cranes will encounter winds
			from the north or northwest, what one would call headwinds if you were trying to fly to Canada. With strong headwinds,
			the cranes will stop the migration and wait several days for the winds to turn around and blow from a more favorable
			direction. Thus, although the cranes may make it all the way to Canada in 12-14 days of flying, the total journey
			may take 20-25 days depending on how many days they stay on the ground waiting for favorable winds.<BR>
			<A NAME="14"></A>The second key factor is thermal currents. When watching the cranes just before they start a migration
			flight, we always notice &quot;heat waves,&quot; or a shimmering of air, visible through our spotting scopes about
			15 minutes before the cranes depart. In the morning, as the sun heats up the land, the warmed air rises and provides
			lift for the cranes. This warming usually becomes strong about 9:30 AM, a typical time when cranes will start their
			migration flights. The cranes are lifted by these thermal currents and will rise as high as 6,000 feet in the air--more
			than one mile high. They then glide to the north down to about 1,000 feet before catching another thermal. When
			rising in a thermal, the cranes make very little forward progress. When they are gliding down, we have clocked
			them travelling at 62 miles per hour. When strong tailwinds are combined with thermals, the cranes can travel about
			420 miles in a day. Usually about 5 PM, the thermals are dying out as the sun gets lower, and the cranes may start
			flapping their wings more and flying in a straight line, but soon they will get tired of that type of effort and
			look for a place to spend the night. That leads us to:

Wally Jobman, USFWS Endangered Species biologist in Grand Island, Nebraska, reports from the migration path. He
			says the two newest confirmed whooping crane sightings were on April 7 and 8, near Upland, NE, in Franklin County.
			On April 11, three birds were reported one mile south and 2 miles east of the Gibbon I-80 interchange, but the
			sightings haven't yet been confirmed. Why so few cranes? Wally told us about last week's weather: &quot;Up to 8
			inches of wet snow fell in parts of western and northern Nebraska on Wednesday April 11. Winds were 20-40mph, creating
			blizzard conditions at times.&quot; The weekend of April 14-15 was expected to bring good migration weather. Based
			on what Tom Stehn told you about the best conditions for cranes to migrate, check the weather maps this week and
			make your OWN predictions for what Wally and Tom will report in next week's whooping crane update!

Wouldn't it be fun to know exactly which whoopers were spotted over Nebraska? After all, each individual has its
			own incredible life story. Thanks to the pioneering work of crane vocalization expert <A HREF="http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/crane/VoiceprintWessling.html">Dr.
			Bernhard Wessling</A>, identifying individual cranes is easier on the cranes than capturing and banding was. But
			before Dr. Wessling's work, scientists could only keep track of individual cranes by banding them. But no whooping
			cranes have been banded since 1988, so most of the banded birds that still survive are difficult to identify because
			their bands are faded, broken, or missing. <BR>
			Thanks to Wally Jobman, you CAN &quot;meet&quot; a migrating whooper that was banded. Wally sent us all the sighting
			records for one of his favorite banded cranes, Crane RwR-B. Such raw data sightings are a careful collection of
			observations and records from which scientists can piece together the stories of a crane's life. It takes a bit
			of detective work and a lot of curiosity to figure it out. Studying banding data often raises more questions than
			answers. But that's what scientists must do each time they get a &quot;helping&quot; of raw data, and we're eager
			to give you the same challenge and adventure! What kind of story will you piece together from banded Crane RwR-B's
			raw data? How old is this whooper? How many times was it seen? During what summer (year) did RwR-B product its
			first chick? When was the first time RwR-B's nest was observed? Do you think it was RwR-B's first nest? For how
			many seasons does RwR-B seem to stay with a chick? Which period of time shows no record of chicks produced? See
			what else Wally told us about the banding program and RwR-B:

			Migration, territory, courtship, nest building, egg laying, incubation, and care of the young--all are parts of
			the breeding cycle. These activities happen so cranes can pass their genes on to new generations. In an earlier
			report, Tom Stehn reminded us, &quot;The peak population during the 2000-2001 winter was 180. An estimated six
			whooping cranes died at Aransas this winter, leaving 174. This is quite a drop from the 187 whoopers in the flock
			in the spring of 2000. We can only hope for a reversal of this trend in 2001.&quot; <BR>
			Brian Johns is a wildlife biologist on the cranes' breeding grounds in Canada. &quot;Predicting crane production
			can be a tricky business, says Brian. &quot;There are so many factors that affect the production of young.&quot;
			What do you suppose some of those factors are? We want to hear from you!<B></B>

<A NAME="A"></A><B><FONT SIZE="4">Above the Clouds? Discussion of Challenge Question #11</FONT></B><BR>
			Last week Tom asked: &quot;Do whooping cranes ever migrate above the clouds? If so, what would be the advantages
			and disadvantages of flying above the clouds?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Tom says cranes will not fly above a thick cloud layer the way ducks and geese do. He explains: &quot;They will
			not since there are no thermal currents above thick clouds. Whereas ducks and geese continually flap their wings
			during migration, and thus benefit from the &quot;thinner&quot; air high above the clouds that offers less resistance,
			cranes rely on thermal currents and soaring flight patterns. Other large birds such as pelicans, hawks, eagles,
			and vultures also rely on thermal currents and soar in spiral patterns to migrate.<BR>

<A NAME="Stay"></A><B><FONT SIZE="4">Stay or go? Discussion of Challenge Question #12 </FONT></B><BR>
			Tom asked you to think about this: &quot;Why would some of the whooping cranes be less eager than others to leave
			the wintering grounds?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;The answer,&quot; Tom says, &quot;comes down to physical differences between adult birds that need to get
			up to Canada and nest, and non-breeding birds (subadults) that will not be breeding this summer. Subadults are
			cranes usually between ages 1 to 4, too young to mate. Different hormone levels can be measured in the blood in
			adults and subadults. Adults have much higher hormone levels, making them anxious to get north and breed. The younger
			subadult birds don't have those high hormone levels and thus will take their time leaving Texas.<BR>
			&quot;But it's not always that simple. Sometimes subadult whooping cranes will migrate with sandhill cranes and
			thus be heading north in March in front of many adult whooping cranes. Adults can start the migration at vastly
			different times. For example, one year we had one breeding whooping crane pair start the migration in early March,
			and the last breeding pair left Aransas on April 20. That's quite a span of time. You don't have to worry about
			the cranes that leave late. Those late migrants usually make a more rapid trip to Canada so that all the adult
			pairs will get up to Canada in time to nest.&quot;<BR>

<A NAME="High"></A><B><FONT SIZE="4">High Wire Hazards: Discussion of Challenge Question #13</FONT></B><BR>
			Our last update described why high wires were extremely dangerous to migrating cranes, and we told you about new
			little coils called Bird Flight Diverters that should help solve the problem. We asked, &quot;Why do you think
			cranes have difficulties seeing wires? How do you think little coils help solve the problem?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Cranes have trouble seeing wires because nothing like wires exists in nature. Cranes have no idea of a wire's width.
			Since the ends of a wire are so far apart and far away from them, cranes have no idea how far they are from a wire
			until they get dangerously close. Coils called Bird Flight Diverters (BFDs) placed on wires can help because the
			coils are three-dimensional, giving cranes a better concept of their distance from it. This helps cranes avoid
			smacking into the wire.<BR>
