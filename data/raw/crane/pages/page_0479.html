Since I got my first LEGO&#174 Technic crane (Technic set 855) I like to build cranes
in LEGO&#174 Technic. This is my actual model and also the first one after my dark age,
which endured from about 1987 til the autumn of 1995. There are four pictures with
explanations below.

My 8 feet tall crane. It is fully motorized and operational.
I began construction about one year ago, the first version was
much smaller. It was about 3 feet all and wide. By the time I
added some height and width, until I reached the ceiling.
The mast now is 8x8 bricks, it was 6x6 before. When it fell over
by some wind through the open window (it smashed nearly completely,
some parts fell out of my window on the 6th floor (Got them all back,
sigh)), I made it 8x8 for more stability.<br clear=all>

The full side view of the top section. The hook is moved back- and
forwards by a micromotor. Up and down is powered by a standard Technic
9V motor. The complete top section is rotated at the top of the mast
also by a micromotor using the great 8-knob diameter turntable.
In my pre-dark age, there was no part to cover this function that good.
My first after-dark-age Technic set was 8868, which included this turntable
and mainly inspired me to construct a new crane.</p>

Closeup of the "operational" section. The grey crown gear at the mast is part
of the gear-reduction to rotate the top section. The other to motors are
located directly at the back, the red part you can see are holding the second
mircomotor to move the hook-fixing backwards and forwards along the derrick.
Between this motor and the driver's cabin is the standard 9V-motor located,
which moves the hook up and down. The grey box at the end is filled with
metal parts such as bolts and coins as a counterweight.</p>

When the missing parts as the turntable and the micromotor are available for
LDraw, and when I have time enough, I will create instructions to rebuild this
model with LDraw.</p><br clear=all>
