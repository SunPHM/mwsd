<H1>Creeping Crane</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>It is probably common for fans of LEGO Technic to make a large crane.
My crane is inspired from <A
HREF="http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leo/lego/crane.html">Leo Dorst's crane
with a remotely operated bucket</A>.  I've also take inspiration from <A
HREF="http://www.brickshelf.com/scans/8000/8888/8888-004.jpg">an old Technic
idea book</A>.

 <P>My crane has four remotely operated motors.  Two 1997 style motors
govern the wires.  One motor controls the up/down movement and the other
the open/close of the gripper.  These motors reside in the upper part of
the crane, next to the large wheels used as counter weights.  A <A
HREF="http://carol.wins.uva.nl/~leo/lego/diff.html">Leo Dorst style
adder/subtractor was used</A>.</P>

<P>The remotely operated grabber works really well.  I can use it to
pick up a small orange, by using the control panel only!  This is way
fun!</P>

<P>One old style motor controls the car which runs back and forth on the
crane boom.  The motor is geared down 3:1 and then 24:1 before the power
is passed to the 16t cog which drives one long run of Technic chain
links.</P>

<P>The other old style motor powers the rotation of the crane.  The
motor is located on the crane base, and one single shaft runs all the
way up to the rotation point: Just below the boom.</P>

<P><A HREF="modular-crane-tower.html">I have made a diagram for the
crane base and tower.</A> It would have been easy to make the crane
taller, but I didn't consider that an interesting challenge.
