        <p>The trumpeting &quot;garoo-a-a-a&quot; of the Sandhill Crane (Grus 
          canadensis) can be heard a mile or more across the oak forests and wetlands 
          of northern Anoka County. The cranes dance, bowing and jumping, extending 
          wings to reach a majestic six-to-seven foot span. In a nest woven of 
          cattails, a mating pair incubate two eggs, establishing their new summer 
          home at the Sandhill Crane Natural Area.</p>
        <p>Sandhill Crane Natural Area, consisting of 530 acres, took shape under 
          the direction of a steering group consisting of the Minnesota Department 
          of Natural Resources (DNR), City of East Bethel, Anoka County, the MPCA 
          and neighbors thrilled with the occasional crane spearing waste grain 
          in their back yards. The cranes may be the &quot;poster species&quot; 
          for the sanctuary, but it also will protect plants (such as the lance-leaf 
          violet), fen and tamarack swamp ecosystems, and other birds, mammals 
          and amphibians that will be identified in a wildlife assessment.</p>
        <p>&quot;There are not many areas like this left,&quot; says Jeff Perry, 
          natural resource specialist for Anoka County Parks and Recreation. &quot;People 
          should understand the importance of managing these natural areas and 
          maintaining the ecological quality into the future. Today, this resource 
          is in excellent condition.&quot;</p>
        <p>A 1993 hunting trip, pairing then-DNR Commissioner Rod Sando and former 
          Mayor of East Bethel Jeff Hintz, jump-started the concept of the Sandhill 
          Crane Natural Area. The two talked about connecting DNR land, Anoka 
          County parcels, a property acquired by the MPCA under the Closed Landfill 
          Act, city land and the former East Bethel Landfill into one protected 
          area. Connecting these disparate pieces took a lot of commitment and 
          hard work by the steering group.</p>
        <p>This collective vision for greenspace and habitat preservation grew 
          just when the MPCA was contemplating land-use plans for the closed landfills 
          for which the state is responsible. The East Bethel Landfill property 
          included wetlands as well as old waste, so its inclusion in the Natural 
          Area made good sense. Wetlands adjoining landfills operate as natural 
          clean-up systems for ground and surface water. They also serve as a 
          buffer system, assuring that no development takes place within the range 
          of the migrating landfill gas common at many old landfills. </p>
        <p>&quot;The landfill is the proposed starting point for visitors,&quot; 
          says MPCA project leader Jean Hanson. &quot;There will be a parking 
          area, kiosk and trails leading from the landfill to a public observation 
          and picnic area.&quot;</p>
        <p>When a master plan for the Natural Area is completed this spring, the 
          steering group can apply for funding to implement it from natural resource 
          damage money. The money is received through settlements by the MPCA 
          from companies that insured businesses that used the former landfill. 
          Hanson hopes the Sandhill Crane Natural Area's success story will inspire 
          similar efforts in communities working with the MPCA on closed landfill 
          land-use plans in the future. <br>
