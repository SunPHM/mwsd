I had never before seen terra cotta bricks used in home constructionand had not before seen cranes used so much in residential construction.I took quite a few film pictures of different construction projects in Switzerlandand Germany.</P><P><CENTER><A HREF="714a.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714ax.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="714b.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714bx.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><AHREF="714c.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714cx.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></P><P>I am not sure why there is a fireplace in what seems to be an outdoorarea of this house. </P><P>Today's ride was never very tough. There were 12% grades, but that seemedlike nothing now. I did discover that my granny chainring needed replacingtoo.</P><P><CENTER><A HREF="714d.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714dx.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="714e.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714ex.jpeg" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="108" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></P><P>We stopped at another one of King Ludwig's castles. This one was moreclassical and ornate than Neuschwanstein. I did not go inside.</P><P><CENTER><A HREF="714f.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714fx.jpeg" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="108" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="714g.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714gx.jpeg" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="108" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><AHREF="714h.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714hx.jpeg" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="108" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></P><P>I stopped at a huge bike store in Garmisch to get a replacement smallchainring. At test ride seemed satisfactory, but when I got on my way andhit some 12% grade, the chain dropped between the middle and small ring.It appears that the store in F&uuml;ssen used the wrong middle ring, sowhen the small ring was replaced, the spacing between the rings was toogreat. I'll have to have the entire drive train replaced when I get backhome--at this point in the trip it is too late to do anything else. </P><P>I managed to ride over two 12% climbs today in my middle ring. I am clearlygetting stronger as I go.</P><P>Our campground was pleasant and as always, was surrounded by mountainpeaks. </P><P><CENTER><A HREF="714q.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714qx.jpeg" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="108" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></P><P>We seemed to have quite a lot of space to ourselves, until a bustledof young people from Finland showed up. They set up their tents and filledout all the available space at the campground, but they were quiet and well-behaved.</P><P><CENTER><A HREF="714r.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714rx.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="81" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><A HREF="714s.jpeg"><IMG SRC="714sx.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="53" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A></CENTER></P><P>After dinner, most of us went to the campground restaurant for dessert.In Germany, the restaurants refuse to serve Kuchen (cake) after 5 :00 or6:00. Apparently, cake is thought of as part of the tea ritual and it isnot considered to be dessert. I can understand a restaurant not servingbreakfast after a specific time, because the cooking surfaces are different,but why a restaurant would refuse to serve food that it has on display isbeyond me. Oh well, ice cream and strudel are not subject to the Kuchencurfew, so we were able to eat dessert albeit Kuchen-free.</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT>86 km</P><P><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="450" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="33%"><P><CENTER><A HREF="../713/713.html"><IMG SRC="../../LkHuron/lt.gif" WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="61" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH="33%"><P><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="169" BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"HEIGHT="159"><TR><TD WIDTH="164%"><P><CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="../../../index.html"><IMG SRC="../../../gifs/hp2.gif"WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A>&nbsp;<B><AHREF="../../../index.html"><BR>Tailwinds Home Page</A></B></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD><P><CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="../ata.html"><IMG SRC="../misc/castle2.jpeg" WIDTH="108" HEIGHT="92" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A><BR><B><A HREF="../ata.html">Across the Alps</A></B></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH="34%"><P><CENTER><A HREF="../715/715.html"><IMG SRC="../../LkHuron/rt.gif" WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="61" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
