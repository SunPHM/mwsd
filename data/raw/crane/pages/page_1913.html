&quot;Still on their wintering grounds, the young cranes are doing a really good
			job learning how to fish,&quot; reports <A HREF="http://www.savingcranes.org/">ICF</A>'s
			Anne Lacey of the two-person monitoring team. Climb into the blind and see for yourself
			(click on video under this photo) what the cranes look like as they forage! <BR>
			<BR>
			What are the birds doing these days? &quot;They haven't been going very far away
			from their pen,&quot; Anne reports. &quot;The cranes recognize their pen as their
			home territory, and if the water level is appropriate (not too high, not too low)
			they DO roost in water. We've had very erratic water levels lately: tides that are
			very high or very low. If they aren't roosting in their pen, we try to keep track
			of where they go to make sure they're roosting in water deep enough and far enough
			from shore to be safe.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Last night I watched them going through their preening routine before they
			go to sleep. They get everything in order before settling down to roost for the night.&quot;
			A reminder: Anne watches from the video monitoring equipment. Anne and Richard check
			on the birds every evening, taking the 5-10 minute airboat ride to check the pen
			and the food levels at the feeding stations. They wear the white crane costume whenever
			there's a chance the birds will see them. Anne usually stays in the blind and runs
			the video equipment. She says: &quot;We're trying to minimize contact even with the
			costume so they don't rely on it or think the costume (&quot;parent&quot;) will lead
			them back.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Anne adds, &quot;Spring has finally sprung here. We might have broken out of the
			warm/cold/warm/cold weather pattern. Other birds are moving -- many swallows and
			warblers. March 8 I saw a termite mound hatch and also saw bats for the first time.
			If the springtime conditions seem right for other animals, maybe it'll seem right
			for the whoopers as well.&quot; Stay tuned!</P>

			Richard Urbanek of the US Fish and Wildlife Service is head of the monitoring team

			Last time we asked you to read about the personalities of the new Eastern flock and

			transmitters? Why?&quot; We were very pleased to hear some good thinking!<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Michael, a first grader in Ferrisburgh (Vermont) Central School, thinks that
			you should pick strong cranes that could carry the backpack without them being bothered
			by any extra weight. So that means #6 and #7 would be out for Michael's choice. He
			thinks that Crane #2 might be pecking at the transmitter and could further damage
			her beak. So that leaves #5 and #1 for his choice of who would wear the satellite
			transmitters.&quot; (lthurber@anwsu.k12.vt.us) <BR>
			<BR>
			We also liked the thinking of Jennifer, sixth grader at Ferrisburgh, who looked for
			the most dominant ones &quot;so everyone will follow them,&quot; and also considered
			which cranes have recognizable patterns &quot;so they can be spotted easily.&quot;

Now let's hear from Operation Migration lead pilot Joe Duff: &quot;The two birds
			that have PTT's (#2 and #5) are still dominant. During training and the migration
			we keep track of which birds are leaders and more dominant. We do this by watching
			their behaviour. The most aggressive birds (often the largest but not always) will
			lead the flock in flight or be the first at the feeding station. They will peck the
			other birds in order to establish their dominance and if the other bird want to challenge
			they will peck back and a small fight will ensue. These battles do not amount to
			much and usually one or the other will give up and walk away. Sometime the loser
			will peck another bird just to show that they are not complete losers. This is sometimes
			caled displaced aggression. The birds see us as members of the flock and will often
			try to challenge the handlers just to find out where they stand in the flock order.
			We use the puppet to challenge back and keep order. According to the monitoring team,
			#2 and #5 are still dominant and we hope they will be lead birds on the way back
			north or at least they will stay with the main flock and give us an idea where the
			group is.&quot;<BR>

			Question #2</B></FONT><BR>
			You still have time to answer: &quot;What date do YOU predict the Eastern flock's
			migration will start?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;We think sometime around March 15 the whooping crane's migration will start.
			It's about the same time the Western flock leaves,&quot; predict Louis, Andrew, and
			Vihar from Iselin (New Jersey) Middle School.<BR>
			<BR>
			Ryan and Will's prediction is: &quot;In the year 2000 the Whooping Cranes started
			to migrate on April 11, but in the year 2001 they started to migrate on April 8.
			Since the temperatures have been warmer this year and the cranes like cool weather,
			we predict they will begin to migrate on April 5 this year.&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Heather Ray of Operation Migration offers some clues. &quot;It was February 25th
			last year when the ultralight-led Sandhill cranes departed Florida and began their
			unaided return flight to central Wisconsin and the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge.
			Whooping cranes mature a bit slower than Sandhill cranes and the whoopers currently
			at the Chassahowitzka refuge are a full month younger than the Y2K Sandhills were
			at this time. It remains anyone's guess as to when they will initiate their northern
			journey but the Argos NASA Satellite has been providing data every other day since
			Feb. 20th in anticipation of their departure. The monitoring team has two vehicles
			both equipped with radio receivers and as soon as the young birds head north the
			team of two will be on the road, tracking the cranes as they return north -- without
			the aid of their mechanical surrogate parents.&quot;<BR>

&quot;I recently took part in a unique way to help whooping cranes. I wish all of
			you could have been here to help,&quot; writes Tom Stehn from Aransas, where he oversees
			the western flock. &quot;Throughout the waters along the Texas coast, commercial
			fishermen put out traps and catch blue crabs and stone crabs, which they sell to
			restaurants and food processing companies. Each fisherman is allowed to have 200
			crab traps. When the traps get old, some fishermen have failed to pick up the traps,
			and others have been washed to shore. These traps become litter. Unfortunately, the
			traps continue to catch crabs, fish, and even a rare turtle called the diamondback
			terrapin. When a critter gets caught in the trap, it can't escape and dies. Then
			other organisms come to feed on it and also get trapped, so the cycle continues.
			We call these GHOST traps since no fisherman is actually using these traps.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			On February 23, Texas Parks and Wildlife organized a huge volunteer effort to pick
			up abandoned traps. How many ghost traps were picked up by volunteers of all ages?
			How many traps still remain in whooping crane habitat? What's the next step in this
			important project? Read Tom's full report here:

We thought you'd like to hear about the annual Whoop It Up Festival held in February
			in Port Aransas, Texas. Here's what Heather Ray of Operation Migration wrote: &quot;Aransas
			National Wildlife Refuge is the winter home to the only remaining wild migratory
			flock of 174 Whooping Cranes. Each fall, this flock migrates from the Wood Buffalo
			National Park in northern Canada to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the Gulf
			Coast of Texas with their young of the year. The young cranes learn this traditional
			migration route by following their parents -- just as the chicks we raised last year
			followed their mechanical parents, learning a new route and in doing so became the
			pioneers which will pass on their knowledge to future generations. The 3-day festival
			was hosted by the Port Aransas Chamber of Commerce and they did a wonderful job of
			coordinating the many events, speakers and field trips. We were treated to a boat
			tour onboard the Wharf Cat with Captain Ray Little, which carried us out through
			the Intracoastal waterway and into the territories occupied by the Whooping cranes.
			On one hand, it was an encounter I wish anyone that has an interest in cranes can
			experience, yet on the other hand, I hope that few will actually go so that these
			precious few remaining birds will have some semblance of privacy. To see these huge,
			long barges trundle along transporting chemicals through the narrow coastal passage
			-- at times less than 200 ft. from the foraging Whoopers -- is alarming, and reinforces
			the need for a second, discrete migratory flock. Fortunately the people of this area
			realize the treasure they are responsible for and continue to work toward solutions
			to minimize potential threats to the cranes and to educate others about the critical
			balance of nature needed to ensure the survival of this last wild flock.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			We'll learn more about these efforts in the next report. For now, look at Heather's
			photos and send us your answer to:

The question above gets you thinking about dangers on the wintering grounds, but
			last time Tom Stehn said, &quot;We believe most mortality (death) of whooping crane
			adults occurs during migration.&quot; Indeed, experts think that between 60% and
			80% of all deaths of fledged whooping cranes occur during migration. The question
			for you was: &quot;Why are cranes most vulnerable to death during migration?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Kameron and Patrick from Ferrisburgh (VT) Central School wrote: &quot;They have to
			get to Canada which is a very long trip. If they run into bad weather or predators
			they wouldn't make it. Ponds might be frozen so they couldn't find food.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Louis, Andrew, and Vihar from Iselin (NJ) Middle School said, &quot;The Cranes are
			most vulnerable during migration because if they stop they can be attacked by animals
			such as foxes. They can fly into telephone and electrical wires which they can't
			see. If the place they go to is too cold when they arrive they cannot find food and
			will die. Any loss is a big loss for such a population.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Their answers show that these students thought carefully about the dangers of the
			journey! So WHY do cranes make such a dangerous trip? And what do you think is the
			Number One danger to migrating cranes? Write your thoughts in your journal, then
			compare. Tom Stehn reveals those answers here, with another question for you:

The International Crane Foundation's Rachel Jepson Wolf helps us with this one. Rachel
			says: &quot; I was concerne when I first heard the classification of the whooping
			cranes in this flock. I felt that these cranes needed to be given all the protection
			possible under the Endangered Species Act. But I changed my mind as I learned more
			about what this classification meant. I now support this classification completely,
			and see it as vital to the success of the project. Why is &quot;experimental, nonessential&quot;
			classification important? There are two main reasons: flexibility and support.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;<B>Flexibility.</B> With this classification we can introduce the cranes in
			creative new ways (think ultralight airplanes!) to save them from extinction. While
			we have tested our reintroduction techniques on sandhill cranes, our current efforts
			with whooping cranes are new, ground-breaking attempts to save an endangered species.
			The &quot;experimental, non-essential&quot; classification allows the biologists
			and specialists involved to make good, fast decisions that are best for the birds
			without wrestling with the Endangered Species Act. It trusts the team to do what
			is best.<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;<B>Support. </B>Without the experimental nonessential classification, I think
			it's unlikely that we would be able to do this project at all. The support of the
			people in each state along the flyway was vital in our efforts to reintroduce whooping
			cranes. People need to be assured that our efforts to save this magnificent bird
			won't interfere with their rights to live their life as they did before the project.
			For example, with &quot;experimental nonessential&quot; classification, if I am a
			farmer in Wisconsin and these cranes decide to nest on my farm, I will still be able
			to farm my land without concern that I am violating the Endangered Species Act. It
			means that if they land in my yard I can keep living as I had been without worrying
			about losing my property rights because I now share my property with an endangered
			species. The classification allowed us to gain the support of every state between
			Wisconsin and Florida - something I don't believe ever would have happened without
			the classification (and without the support of the states, we don't have a project).&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Rachel reminds us: &quot;Keep in mind that the whooping cranes are still protected
			from intentional harm. A man was charged in Florida last year for intentionally shooting
			two 'experimental, nonessential' whooping cranes that are a part of the non-migratory
			flock of Florida whoopers.&quot;<BR>
