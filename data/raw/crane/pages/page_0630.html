        like the project we are doing in art. We are making paper
        cranes. They are quiet cool. Our class had 6 mentours to
        help us make cranes. Are mentour for my table was Nick.
        He is cool. I made four cranes. They are hard to make. I
        don't know how many are class made yet, but I want to
        know. It took a lot of work. .<strong>..Drew</strong></font><p><font
        face="Comic Sans MS">In art we made paper cranes. This is
        called origami. We did this to honor Sadamo. Sadako was a
        little girl that had lukemeia.. She heard that if she
        made 1,000 paper cranes the gods would grant her a wish.
        During art we made paper cranes to donate to the statue
        of Sadako somewhere in Japan. Junior high kids helped
        mentor us if we got lost. My crane was a red one and it
        turned out good. i wish I got to keep it, but it was
        alright to donate it for a good cause. I hope we get to
        do it again soon. .<strong>..Jake G.</strong></font></p>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I liked this activity a
        lot. It was very hard to make. It took a long time to
        finish. There was a jr. high person there to help us. We
        are making these canes to send them to Japan because we
        dropped an atom bomb there. Paper cranes are a sign of
        peace there. Our Art teacher read us a story about
        Sadako. <strong>...Aaron</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In art we are making paper
        cranes. They are hard to remember how to make. We are
        making them for the movie Sadako. When this girl was very
        litle there was a big bomb that made a whold lot of
        people sick. There is a myth that if a person makes a
        thousand cranes they will be better. So that is how we
        are helping her. .<strong>..Zac</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">First our Art teacher
        showed us how to make it step by step. When we were done
        we had to blow air in a little hole so it is blown up and
        puffy. Then we got to do it by our salf but we had a
        junier hi person help us when we got stuck on a part. W
        did the cranes because of a girl named Sadako. When
        Sadako died they bilt a statue of her and her class mates
        folded the rest of the cranes for her so she could be
        barried with 1000 paper cranes. her sperit is in a good
        place now. She is not suffering any more. <strong>...

        face="Comic Sans MS">When we were in Art Class we made
        paper cranes. Why? Because there was a young girl named
        Sadako. This young girl died because she had laukimia
        from the atom bomb but she never gave up. When she was in
        the hospital her older brother reminded her about a myth
        that you had to make 1000 paper cranes so she tried but
        she did not make it but kids all over the country sent
        paper cranes for Sadakio. That's why were doing the paper
        cranes. <strong>...Hunter</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When I did my
        paper crane in art class I had a high school student help
        me. She didn't help me the whole time but only sometimes.
        It was really fun making paper cranes. When the whole
        school makes 1,000 cranes we are going to send them to a
        statue in Japan. I only made one but the rest of the
        school is probably going to make the rest. I think it
        will take another two weeks to fold the rest of the paper
        cranes. .<strong>...Chad</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monday we made
        some paper cranes. We ferst wached the movie Sadaco a
        week before. The thing I liked the most was when we were
        doing this we got to see different colored cranes. We are
        making the cranes for a memorial. <strong>...Andrew C.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In art today
        we made paper cranes. We had a Jounier high kid come in
        and help us. they were a big help. I did not really
        understand it . But my partner helped me. The cranes are
        so cool and cute. <strong>...Gabe H.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I think making
        paper cranes is very fun. Making the cranes is hard
        because you have to fold and fold and fold. Our partner
        was Nick. He can make cranes very fast. He has made a
        total of 204 cranes! Mrs. Woolman let us keep our second
        crane. I can't make paper cranes. We are hanging our
        cranes in the library. <strong>...Travis</strong></font></p>
