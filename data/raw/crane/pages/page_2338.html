<FONT SIZE =3> Avid crane watchers can observe sandhill cranes and other bird species at special crane viewing sites from southeast of Alda to west of Gibbon in the Platte River basin.<P>

 Many avian aficionados used the five sites in 1997, the first year they were open, said Milt Moravek, projects director for the Central Platte Natural Resources District.<P>

 The NRD also learned that Hall and Buffalo county sheriff's departments received fewer complaints of cars stopped along roadsides, he said.<P>

 "Apparently, more people are using crane viewing sites instead of parking on roads and bridges," Moravek said. "But we don't have any numbers."<P>

 However, he recalled that parking lots at Gibbon and Alda sites were full at one time. Moravek said the NRD will conduct a survey at various locations to gauge attendance this year.<P>

 Two Alda and Gibbon sites along the Platte feature three viewing decks with combined parking space for more than 100 cars and four buses at a time. New kiosks, or information centers, have been installed to provide tourists with details about the Platte River Valley and crane viewing.<P>

 The Gibbon site also features a walking trail, which provides ideal access for crane viewing and ambling around a recently developed wetland, Moravek said.<P>

 "You can get a nice view of the river from the trail," he said.<P>

 The Alda site is about seven and a half miles south of Alda, and the Gibbon locale is four and a half miles south of Gibbon.<P>

 Three pull-off sites allow drivers to observe the birds safely in parking lots without stopping on county roads or bridges.<P>

 Hall County has two roadside stops near Alda. The first site is one mile south and one mile east of the Alda site. The other is a half mile north and one mile east of the first site.<P>

 The Audubon Society's Rowe Sanctuary also operates a pull-off site two and a half miles west of the Gibbon site.<P>

 Another site is being proposed for two miles south of the Minden interchange on Interstate 80 on the Platte's south channel, Moravek said. If built, the site would include a viewing deck and parking area.<P>

 The NRD is seeking $80,000 in federal funding for the site, with total cost at $110,000. If funding from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act program is granted, construction would start next spring and the site would be ready for crane watchers in 2000, he said.<P>

 Brochures with a map of the sites are available at the NRD office at 215 N. Kaufman or at rest stops along the interstate.<P>
