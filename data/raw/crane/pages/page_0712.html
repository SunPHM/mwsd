            <font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"> The installation of a San Juan 
            Fiberglass pool is a much simpler task than most people think. What 
            is important to understand is that each portion of the job must be 
            carefully thought out in advance of actually doing the work. Remember 
            that it is much easier to do the job right the first time. 
            <p><strong>Please read this manual completely through prior to starting 
              the installation of your San Juan fiberglass swimming pool.</strong> 
            <p></p>
            <a name="Step 1"></a> <strong>STEP #1 - Selection of the Pool Site</strong> 
            <br>
            <img src="san_juan_files/doit1.gif" alt="DIY - Image 1" width="188" height="229" border="0" align=left>Selection 
            of the pool site will determine how much grading will have to be accomplished 
            prior to the actual dig for the pool. Naturally, a level area is best 
            because it will require the least amount of preparation for the dig, 
            but in many cases there is no level area, therefore, the site must 
            be prepared to accept the pool prior to dig. The pool site should 
            be elevated slightly higher than the surrounding area. It is most 
            important that drainage from the surrounding area does not run into 
            the pool. When dealing with slopes, the severity of the slope will 
            determine if retaining walls must be built in order to have a level 
            area for the pool. If the slope is relatively minor, a simple wall 
            built from railroad ties or landscaping timbers may be all that is 
            needed, but if the slopes are severe you may be forced to construct 
            a major load bearing retaining wall. If you are not certain, consult 
            a local civil engineer. Poor planning at this portion of the job can 
            cause real problems later on, so make certain you are dealing with 
            your grade properly. 
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> After you have selected your pool site area 
              and before any earth moving, contact your local utility companies 
              and have your gas line and any underground power lines marked prior 
              to digging. <strong>This is most important</strong>. </font>

            <strong>STEP #2 - Preparation for the Excavation</strong> <br>
            <IMG src="san_juan_files/doit3.gif" align=left> With the area for 
            the pool properly graded to accept the pool, we are now ready for 
            the excavation. You should have a "dig diagram" furnished by San Juan 
            for the pool you are installing. Each pool is different, so make certain 
            you have the correct diagram. A good way to start is to set up grade 
            stakes and string or 2x4s outlining the area for the excavation. 
            <P>The grade stake at the string level should designate the top of 
              the pool, and all dig dimensions are from that point down. Remember 
              to consider the type of decking you are going to use, as this will 
              make a difference. With a cantilevered deck, the top of the pool 
              will actually be 3 1/2" below the top of the concrete. This measurement 
              may change due to the type of form you are using. If your deck is 
              going to come to the top of the pool shell only, not cantilevered, 
              than the top of the pool is your string, remember to consider this 
              for your finished elevation. "Cantilevered decks are recommended 
              by San Juan Pools." 
            <P><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your finished elevation, the top of your 
              concrete decking, should be 4" to 6" above the surrounding area 
              for proper drainage away from the pool.

            <a name="Step 3"></a> <B>STEP #3 - The Excavation</B> <br>
            <IMG src="san_juan_files/doit4.gif" align=left> With the pool area 
            and all elevations planned including your decided type of decking, 
            you are now ready to proceed with the dig. An ideal excavation is 
            one that is as close as possible to the dimensions of the pool shell, 
            but with the following rules in mind. The excavation should be 2&quot; 
            to 4&quot; deeper than the actual pool for your sand bed. The sand 
            bed is to level the pool shell and provide a perfect support base 
            with no voids when the pool is lowered into the hole.<IMG src="san_juan_files/doit5.gif" align=right> 
            Your excavation should be approximately one foot longer and one foot 
            wider than the pool shell. This will allow for a six inch over dig 
            all the way around the pool once it is in place. Additional hand excavation 
            will be required to insure the skimmer when attached to the pool will 
            fit in the excavation. A transit and story pole, when used properly, 
            will insure an accurate dig. Remember to double-check all measurements 
            in the excavation for accuracy prior to letting your excavator leave. 
            <p></p>
            <font color="#006666" size="1" face="Trebuchet MS">^ <a href="#">Top</a></font>

            <a name="Step 4"></a> <B>STEP #4 - Preparing the Hole for the Pool 
            Shell</B> <br>
            Sand or rock dust must be used to bed the shell into the excavation 
            and for backfill. In no event is dirt to be used. One of the easiest 
            ways to know how much sand is needed to be placed on the bottom of 
            the excavation is to set a grade stake at all four corners, and one 
            on each side of the center line in the bottom of the hole. If you 
            are installing our deeper models with breaks for deep ends, than each 
            individual depth change must be noted. By using the transit and shooting 
            down from your grade stakes indicating the top of the pool, you will 
            know exactly where on the bottom stakes the pool should be to maintain 
            an exact level for the pool. With each stake marked where the bottom 
            of the pool will rest, a taut nylon string can be tied around each 
            of these bottom stakes which will than outline the entire pools bottom 
            at its various depths. Ideally, if your excavation was perfect the 
            string would be the same two to four inches off the bottom of the 
            excavation as planned, but don't be concerned unless there are areas 
            of the holes dirt bottom than come above your strings. If this is 
            the case, your hole is not deep enough in these areas and additional 
            excavation must be done. If there are areas that are deeper than the 
            2 to 4", these can be filled with sand and are of no consequence. 
            <P><IMG src="san_juan_files/sectiondoit.gif"> 
            <P>An area approximately 4'-6' long, 2'-3' wide and 12" deep should 
              be dug out at the middle of the deepest end of the pool. , If the 
              pool is going to have a drain in the bottom it could end up in this 
              area and the sump hole will need to accommodate the drain as well. 
              This area is for a dry well sump, which has a gravel bottom, 2" 
              perforated PVC pipe with an end cap attached to a 1 1/2" or 2" PVC 
              line that is run under the pool and up and out of the excavation 
              under the deck. This line can than be attached to a pump. The remainder 
              of the sump hole, after the pipe is installed, should be filled 
              with1/2" or larger gravel. This will allow for underground water 
              that may accumulate under the pool during and after the installation 
              to be removed, and is a permanent part of the installation. <br>

            <P><strong>NOTE:</strong> Failure to install a dry sump well could 
              cause hydro-static water pressure to build up under the pool during 
              the washed sand backfill along with long term water build up during 
              the life of the pool. 
            <P>You are now ready to put the sand base into the pool hole. 
            <P><IMG src="san_juan_files/doit7.gif" align=left> A level 2x4 as 
              long as the width of the pool will provide for an excellent screeting 
              device to level the sand to the top of the string. The objective 
              is to compact the sand into a smooth level bed to the depth of the 
              string outline of the pool bottom. When finished you should have 
              a perfect bottom for the pool shell to rest on. When you have double-checked 
              your measurements and are confident this portion is correct you 
              may remove the stakes and string at this point.<IMG src="san_juan_files/doit8.gif" 
      align=right> Be very careful not to allow any sharp objects or loose clumps 
              of dirt to fall onto or disturb the sand bed. A stake left unnoticed 
              or a large clump or rock could pierce your pool shell when it is 
              filled. With all areas checked and double-checked, you are ready 
              to proceed to the next step.

            <IMG src="san_juan_files/doit9.gif" align=left> Your San Juan pool 
            is delivered to the site with most of the fittings in place. You may 
            have to mount supplemental items not ordered with your pool, such 
            as additional inlets or jets. It is easiest to drill and install these 
            items while the pool is out of the ground. Most of the pool's plumbing 
            should wait until the pool is in the ground, except for the main drain 
            line. This line should be stubbed up and tied to the pool prior to 
            setting the pool in the hole. There won't be room to do this once 
            the pool is in place. If any additional plumbing is attached to the 
            pool prior to setting, extreme care must be used to insure these pipes 
            are not damaged while setting the pool. It is best to leave additional 
            plumbing lines until after the shell is inserted. <br>

            <P>A suitable sized crane is recommended for this job. Although certain 
              size backhoes and trackhoes are capable to do this job, a crane 
              is the safest and most suitable piece of equipment to use. It is 
              designed for this purpose and can easily lift the pool back out 
              of the hole for corrections in the sand bottom if necessary. Your 
              San Juan Pool has four lifting areas, PVC pipe reinforced with fiberglass, 
              under the coping at each corner of the pool shell. Chains are usually 
              shipped with the pool to attach lifting straps to be attached to 
              the crane. 
            <P>Make certain these straps, usually supplied by the crane company 
              are in good condition and long enough not to bind or pull the pool 
              in when lifted, and double check al1 chains to insure they are properly 
              secured to the pool shell.<img src="new_images/diy_crane.jpg" alt="Do It Yourself - Crane" width="300" height="225" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">
            <P>Most models of San Juan pools are shipped with spanner bars bolted 
              across the center line of the pool shell. These spanner bars are 
              there to prevent the pool from buckling during the setting procedure 
              and should not be removed at this time. <br>
              If the pool has a drain on the bottom of the shell, careful measurements 
              must be made at this time, directly off the pool, to determine exactly 
              where the hole must be dug in the bottom to accept the drain. This 
              hole should be carefully hand dug and a proper fit is imperative. 
              <strong>(This is a most important area of installation, and exact 
              measurements are required.)</strong> Remember your gravel sump may 
              be in this area and if so, should be deep enough to accommodate 
              the drain and the PVC line running from it to the pump. 
            <P>Rope lines should now be attached to the pool to help guide it 
              when lifted by the crane. Carefully and slowly lift the pool slightly 
              off the ground or trailer and double check all chains and straps. 
              Insure everything is properly rigged before proceeding. It is not 
              advisable to lift the pool during any type of wind. The pool will 
              act as a giant kite. Make certain wind is at a minimum. Very slowly 
              lift and move the pool to the excavation. It is recommended to keep 
              the pool as low to the ground as possible, this will help in handling 
              and lower the effects of wind movement. Once over the hole, line 
              up the shell, make certain no debris has fallen into the hole and 
              slowly lower the pool into the excavation. If any area of the shell 
              is binding, stop and correct the problem before proceeding. Make 
              certain the bottom drain, if your pool has one, fits correctly into 
              the hole you have dug for it. It must fit perfectly, so go slowly 
              and carefully. It must fit completely flush to allow the pool bottom 
              to set directly on the sand with no strain on the drain. Most models 
              have been molded with a recess in the center of the back wall at 
              the deep end to accept the drain and pipe. These models require 
              little preparation for the drain. Check your pool for this feature, 
              but in any case the drain must not bind or be subject to pressures 
              that may crack it.

            <a name="Step 7"></a> <B>STEP #7 - Leveling the Shell in the Excavation</B> 
            <br>
            <IMG src="san_juan_files/doit11.gif" align=left> With the shell setting 
            in the hole and the main drain and attached pipe double checked to 
            insure it is not damaged, it is time to check your level. Standing 
            and jumping on all four corners will help settle the pool in place 
            to insure it is not hung up. When you are certain the pool is all 
            the way in the hole, measurements should now be taken with your transit. 
            Set your story pole on the top of the coping at each corner, staying 
            away from seating areas and steps, and take your measurement at each 
            corner. Remember to sit your pole on the same place at each corner. 
            Particular attention must be made on all 8' or deeper models to insure 
            the break points are setting where they were planned without voids 
            or binds. 
            <P>If everything was properly measured your pool should be level. 
              If not, don't let the crane go, as you will have to correct it by 
              lifting the pool from the hole and either adding or raking away 
              sand from the low or high areas to allow the pool to set level. 
              With this completed, lower the shell and follow the same instructions 
              as before for checking the level. It is not uncommon to have to 
              lift and set the shell several times prior to getting the pool level. 
              Take the time, whatever it takes, to insure the pool is level before 
              letting the crane go. 
            <P>It is possible to correct for slight variations of 1" or less on 
              a low corner simple by lifting the pool at the low corner with a 
              fulcrum and lever and washing additional sand under the low area 
              until it is level. If a comer of the pool is too high, the shell 
              will have to be lifted from the hole in order to remove the required 
              sand. With the pool properly leveled in the excavation, all lines 
              and drains checked and re-checked, you are now ready to proceed 
              with fill and backfill. 
            <P><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not leave the pool at this point if rain 
              is in the forecast. Heavy rain now would float the pool, ruin the 
              bottom and destroy all your work. Weather planning is extremely 
              important when starting your excavation.

            <P><B>STEP #8 - Filling and Backfilling</B> <br>
              <IMG src="san_juan_files/doit12.gif" align=left> The important thing 
              to remember is that Fiberglass Pools are flexible, and equal amounts 
              of pressure on each side of the pools walls must be maintained at 
              all times. 
            <P>Start by filling the pool with one-foot (1') of water. This will 
              securely anchor the pool into the excavation. Now recheck your measurements 
              with your transit. You may find that the corners are level, but 
              the step and seating areas are slightly lower. This is because these 
              areas may sag and will required additional reinforcement. 
            <P>Start by adding sand or rock dust around the pool. Dirt is totally 
              unsuitable for this portion of the backfill and will void your warranty. 
              You want the sand to fill all voids as your backfill. The best way 
              to do this is to wash the sand with water under and around all areas 
              of the shell. A "sand wand", a 1" piece of PVC pipe approximately 
              6' - 8' long attached to a garden hose is the preferred method. 
            <P><IMG src="san_juan_files/doit13.gif" align=right> By ramming the 
              wand into the sand and removing it slowly, the water from the wand 
              will wash the sand into the areas required. Too much water is not 
              good, so common sense should be used for the proper balance. Areas 
              under steps, seats, and the main drain must he completely filled 
              in with washed sand and compacted to prevent settling. 
            <P>The amounts of sand or rock dust required for each pool is different, 
              and the amount will also be effected by how close your hole is to 
              the dig specs. In genera a 12' wide pool will take 20-30 tons, 14' 
              wide 30-40 tons and 16' 40 tons +. In any event, ordering 20 tons 
              to be delivered to the site initially will bed in all pools and 
              allow some sand for the backfill. After that, you can order as needed, 
              but remember, dirt cannot be used. 
            <P>The water in the pool should be added at a rate equal to the rate 
              of backfill. The water should maintain a level one-foot higher than 
              the sand backfill throughout the entire fill and backfill procedure. 
              It is very important to keep equal1 amounts of pressure on the pools 
              walls. Too much water could bow and even break the pool outward, 
              and to much sand could bow the walls inward. A bowed wall inward 
              means you have added too much sand and it must be dug out until 
              the wall is straight and a bowed wall outward means your water is 
              too high in the pool and the sand must be brought up. 
            <P>The jobs water pressure determines the time this procedure takes. 
              Remember, you cannot fill the pool any faster than you can backfill 
              it, so if you are using hydrants or water trucks, this same fill 
              and backfill rule applies. 
            <P>While the pool is being filled and backfilled, this is the ideal 
              time to start you plumbing runs. When your backfill is up approximately 
              one third of the pool, this is the time to remove the spanner bar 
              if your pool came with one. Removing the spanner bar may cause the 
              pools walls to bow out, but by adding additional sand without adding 
              additional water will cause the walls to bow back in. A proper balance 
              of sand backfill and water fill in the pool will keep the walls 
              true throughout the entire installation.

            <IMG src="san_juan_files/doit14.gif" align=left> This manual will 
            assume the installer understands basic pool plumbing, if not, it is 
            recommended that a professional pool service company is contracted 
            with to do this portion of the job, but we will cover some basics. 
            <P>All plumbing should be 1 1/2" PVC schedule 40 pipe or 2" if the 
              pump and filter is over 30' feet from the equipment. The lines around 
              the pool should not go in until the sand backfill is up high enough 
              to allow setting these lines, at the height of the returns and skimmer, 
              on top of the backfill. This will prevent the lines from sagging 
              and possible cracking. After they are run, the balance of the backfill 
              can continue over these lines. You should have separate lines from 
              the pool to the equipment for the skimmer, main drain and pool returns. 
              You may have additional lines if you are planning a pressure side 
              pool cleaner, spa jets or fountain/waterfall. 
            <P><strong>NOTE:</strong> All plumbing should be pressure tested prior 
              to pouring your concrete decking. 
            <p></p>

            <a name="Step 10"></a> 
            <P><B>Step #10 - Pouring the Deck</B> <br>
              It is recommended that all electrical hook ups be completed before 
              pouring the concrete. Make certain all electrical inspections on 
              lights, bonding and all other electrical work have been completed 
              and checked off by the local inspectors prior to proceeding with 
              your concrete. It is a good idea to run the pool for at least 24 
              hours before pouring the concrete to insure there are no leaks. 
            <P>As previously discussed in this manual, the type of decking you 
              have selected will have determined the grade of the pool. If you 
              are going to use cantilevered forms as recommended, the top of the 
              pools coping should be level with your surrounding grade. If you 
              are pouring a regular deck up to the pools coping, than the top 
              of the coping should be 4" above the surrounding area. In either 
              event, it is recommended to dig out an area around the pool exposing 
              the flange of the coping and just under it. This is important, as 
              concrete should be packed under and over the flange of the pool, 
              as the deck is poured. This will lock the pool into the concrete 
              and provide for a much stronger bond of the pool to the deck. It 
              will also eliminate cracking of the deck where it meets the pool. 
            <P>When setting your outside forms, remember you want any water from 
              rain or splash out to run off the deck, not into the pool. Plan 
              for a slope of 1/4" per foot away from the pool. If your deck is 
              going to tie into an existing deck, than some type of drain system 
              should be planned to handle the run off. Proper drainage planning 
              is very important. 
            <P>An experience concrete finisher should always be used when pouring 
              pool decks, especially when you are doing a cantilevered deck, as 
              the forms must be taken off at the proper time to allow finishing 
              of the inside of the form. Fiberglass pools are different from Vinyl 
              or concrete in that the pools are full when the concrete is poured. 
              Make certain your concrete man is aware of this because getting 
              into the pool in the winter is a chilling experience. Sporting goods 
              stores offer a floating ring with built in waders for fisherman. 
              This is a perfect item to have on hand for this job. A poor quality 
              concrete job will ruin the most beautiful pool, and is very expensive 
              to correct.
