The whooping crane is an endangered species with a success story to tell. Its population
			hit an all time low in 1940 when there were only 22 cranes left in the wild. Since
			then numbers have been steadily building, year-by-year.<BR>
			<BR>
			Each spring the entire flock of wild whooping cranes takes the annual 2,700 mile
			journey from the species' wintering grounds in Texas to its nesting grounds in northern
			Canada. The cranes usually arrive in late April or early May, just as ice and snow
			are melting from the marshes.<BR>
			<BR>
			Tom Stehn, Refuge Biologist at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Austwell, Texas,
			will provide updates this spring as the cranes begin their journey. When the migration
			is underway, weekly weather reports and migration news will be shared once again
			this year by Wally Jobman. Wally is based at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office
			in Grand Island, NE. Finally, from the far north, each spring Canadian biologist
			Brian Johns, of the Canadian Wildlife Service, shares the excitement when the cranes
			arrive once again on their ancient nesting grounds. We hope you enjoy traveling with
			the whooping cranes this spring!

			<BR>
			Dear Journey North, <BR>
			This year has been a struggle for the whooping cranes, with difficult habitat conditions
			both summer and winter. However, the flock has managed to INCREASE their numbers
			by TWO to reach 185, a record number. <BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="Why"></A><B>Why Only Two More Whooping Cranes?</B><BR>
			Below is a brief chronology of the whooping cranes' year. I begin on the nesting
			grounds--with the birth of last summer's young--and go through all phases of their
			lives leading up to the present. As you read about the many challenges the cranes
			face make a list, then see if you can answer this question:


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Challenge Question #1</B><BR>
			&quot;Why are there only 2 more whooping cranes in the population this year? How
			many different reasons can you find that explain why the number is so low?&quot;

			<P><BR>
			<B>SUMMER 1999, WOOD BUFFALO NATIONAL PARK<BR>
			&quot;</B>When the whooping cranes reached the nesting grounds in Wood Buffalo National
			Park in the Northwest Territories of Canada, below-average snows during the winter
			had left the marsh with low water levels. Much-needed rainfall came the first week
			in June, but unfortunately right when the eggs were hatching. Some of the very small
			chicks did not survive in he wet, cold weather. Forty-eight nesting pairs did produce
			48 chicks, including 10 pairs with twin young. However, none of the sets of twin
			young survived, and only 20 chicks were still alive in mid-August as they began flying
			lessons at about 10 weeks of age. Seventeen of these survived the hazards of the
			long, 2,500-mile migration and made it to Aransas by the end of the year. This compares
			with 18 chicks that reached Aransas last year.

If you were a Whooper, you'd be where the winter is mild, where saltwater tidal marshes
			change to freshwater ponds as you move inland, where the waters are filled with the
			clams and crabs you love to feast on. You'd be at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.
			Established in 1937 to protect the vanishing wildlife of coastal Texas, Aransas is
			home for many species of wildlife.</P>
			<P>The freshwater ponds inland, created by rain and ranging in size from puddles
			to lakes, are a haven for alligators, turtles, frogs, snakes and birds such as pelicans,
			egrets, spoonbills, ducks, and geese. In the winter, the world's only wild flock
			of Whooping Cranes lives in the saltwater marshes. Aransas is heavenly habitat for
			thousands of migratory birds of more than 389 species.<BR>

			These magnificent endangered birds have slowly been making a comeback. How did a
