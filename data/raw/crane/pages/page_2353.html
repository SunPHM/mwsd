Wisconsin near Baraboo, I happened on a brochure for the
International Crane Foundation. Having had some previous contact
with a Sand Hill Crane, we decided it would be interesting to see
what the ICF was all about. In today's world it is easy to sit
back and say &quot;Oh, there's nothing I can do about XXX&quot;
so we do nothing. Fortunately for the cranes there were two men
back in 1973 that believed they could make a difference and have.
These two men, George Archibald and Ron Sauey met in 1971. George
was investigating crane behavior while Ron was studying their
ecology. Realizing that cranes were under intense pressure from
the world's rapidly expanding human population, George and Ron
decided to establish an organization dedicated to the study and
preservation of cranes. In 1973, they founded the International
Crane Foundation (ICF) on the horse farm owned by Ron's parents
just north of Baraboo, Wisconsin. Although cranes had been held
in captivity for thousands of years, little was known about their
breeding behavior and </strong></font><strong><img
src="image01.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"
width="257" height="164"></strong><font size="4"><strong>few had
hatched in captivity. George and Ron reasoned that breeding
cranes in captivity was an important step toward preserving them.
They wanted to create a &quot;species bank&quot; where cranes
could be kept safely until the factors causing their decline,
such as loss of habitat and indiscriminate hunting, were
corrected. Construction of crane &quot;bungalows&quot; with large
outside pens soon began at the Sauey farm. An incubator was
installed in the basement of the barn, while the horse stalls
were remodeled into crane pens. Once adequate facilities were
ready, Ron and George contacted zoos all over the world, asking
to borrow cranes.</strong></font><strong><img src="image03.jpg"
align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="208" height="160"></strong><font
size="4"><strong> Birds began arriving from zoos in Japan,
Europe, North America, and Russia. Eurasian and Siberian Crane
chicks, hatched from eggs retrieved from wild nests in Sweden and
Russia, augmented the growing flock. ICF's reputation spread with
a succession of &quot;firsts&quot; in captive breeding: Hooded
and Siberian Cranes produced young for the first time in
captivity and Brolgas and Black-necked Cranes hatched for the
first time in North America. ICF's biologists were the first to
hatch an endangered species from an egg fertilized by
cryogenically-preserved (frozen) semen. As the expertise of the
staff grew, new opportunities followed. In 1989, the Patusent
Wildlife Research Center, home to nearly all captive Whooping
Cranes, </strong></font><strong><img src="image04.jpg"
align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="133" height="280"></strong><font
size="4"><strong>sent half of their flock to ICF. In addition to
working with the cranes ICF's staff also works to help preserve
and restore the habitat for the various species of cranes. Part
of doing this involves educating people as to what impact their
actions have towards the wild creatures of this world. Their
final move after breeding and raising the cranes, and restoring
their habitats is to release the cranes back into the wild. In
the early spring of 1983, ICF moved its offices and its captive
flock five miles north of the Sauey farm to a new 160 acre site,
later expanded to 225 acres. A new headquarters building was
constructed which now houses offices, laboratories, and a
hatchery. They also included a library and a museum, where they
had pictures relating to Cranes and their habitats drawn by
students from all over the world. Some of the artwork was
spectacular. It was evident that a number of these children
definitely had artistic talent. In another building they had
their incubator set up in such a way that it was possible to see
the chick in his habitat. One of the things that they are very
careful about is &quot;imprinting&quot; the chick with the image
of a &quot;bird&quot; parent not a human, so it will be possible
for him/her to </strong></font><strong><img src="image02.jpg"
align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="203" height="189"></strong><font
size="4"><strong>know that he is a bird and not a human as he
grows to adulthood. They do this by putting a bird puppet over
their hand and feeding the chick in this manner. When it is
necessary for the human handler to go into the cage they actually
wear an entire &quot;bird costume&quot;. In Baraboo and around
the world, ICF concentrates on its five major program areas:
education, research, habitat restoration and preservation,
captive breeding, and reintroduction. Today, in their quarters in
Baraboo, visitors can walk nearly three miles of trails through
the restorations, or take a guided tour of the most complete
collection of cranes in the world. We were fortunate to have a
lovely lady by the name of Jeanie, for our guide. She did an
excellent job, explaining the beginnings, and the purpose of ICF.
It was obvious the pride that she took in the part she played in
ICF. It was fascinating to see these endangered birds up close.
Many of these birds are seldom seen in their natural habitat
because they can be shy, reclusive birds. After spending time
visiting the facilities and seeing these beautiful birds, I was
very impressed with the work that has been accomplished by two
men who had a dream, and the belief that they could make a
difference.</strong></font></p>
