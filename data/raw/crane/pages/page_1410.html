<p>"All you works of God, every mountain, star and tree,
<br>Bless the One who shaped your beauty, who has caused you all to be
<br>One great song of love and grace, ever ancient, ever new,
<br>Raise your voices all you works of God." (Haugen)
<p>Some would expect the hymn of St.. Francis to dominate this day.&nbsp;
But Marty Haugen's hymn which was our entrance song, captured the sights,
sounds and heart-moments of this day of pilgrimage. This morning's liturgy
allowed those of us whose major language is English to more fully capture
the lived experience of liturgical celebration.
<p>As we entered St. Mary of the Angels' Church, we saw signs forbidding
photography so there was a momentary sharp intake of breath as we thought,
just for the moment, that we would not be allowed to film our special liturgy.&nbsp;
However, the Franciscans were great.&nbsp; Not only did they allow all
types of photography but the Friar who was taking the Church's photography
invited me (Sr. Paulette) to the pulpit (photo to follow) to get some "higher"
views.&nbsp; Our presider today was the Most Revered Adam Exner, OMI.,
Archbishop of Vancouver, B.C.&nbsp; His reflections in English, French
and Spanish allowed for total inclusion of our pilgrims.
<p>After yesterday's walking tour of Ancient Rome and its pagan overtones,
today's visit to Assisi was a nice contrast.&nbsp; We had a three hour
bus trip to Assisi so this wake up call was our earliest so far.&nbsp;
When you leave St. Mary of the Angels, you board the bus for the trip up
the mountain side to the Assisi village.&nbsp; Since the tour guides are
not allowed in certain parts of the Basilica, we did some touring ourselves
before the guided tour.&nbsp; Picture if you will, forty-five degree angles
of incline in hot Italian sun.&nbsp; We had a boxed lunch, then visited,
then gathered for the guided tour.&nbsp; It also gave us a chance to see
some of our Canadian friends who were following a similar schedule.

<br>At first glance, the cranes reminded those of us from Massachusetts
of our "Big Dig" project.&nbsp; The Italians will be finished first!
