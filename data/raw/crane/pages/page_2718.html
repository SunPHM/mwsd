<font color="#000000">Two sandhill cranes showed up in the Titusville neighborhood.&nbsp;
They are common to central Florida.&nbsp; Some migrate from Canada and
others live here.&nbsp; The crane is a migratory bird like the stork.&nbsp;
In the Bible, crane is the Hebrew, <i>`agur</i>.</font>
<blockquote><font color="#CC0000">Even the stork in the sky knows her appointed
times; and turtle-dove, swallow, and crane, keep the time of their coming
(<i>migration</i>); but my people do not know the judgment of the LORD.
(Jeremiah 8:7)</font></blockquote>
<font color="#000000">Jeremiah described the ignorance of Israel before
the Fifth Cycle of Discipline by using the analogy of the stork and crane,
which migrate.&nbsp; Even the stork and crane know when to migrate, but
the people of Judah were ignorant of the approaching judgment of the Lord,
who was about to destroy them.&nbsp; They were afraid of Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp;
They should have been afraid of the Lord.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#000000">The sandhill crane is known for its chirping,
trumpeting sound, which is like a holy roller prayer meeting.&nbsp; Hezekiah
prayed like a holy roller when he was dying the <a href="../define/sinuntodeath.htm" TARGET="out1">sin
unto death</a> before he remembered his doctrine and called for Isaiah,
the prophet, to pray for him.&nbsp; After Hezekiah recovered, he wrote
a testimony about it.</font>
<blockquote><font color="#CC0000">Isaiah 38:13-14</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">13 “I waited patiently till the morning; like
the lion,</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">So He broke in pieces all my bones:</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">From day to night You make it all over with me.</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">14 Like a swallow, a crane, so I chirped;</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">I cooed like the dove;</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">My eyes pined for the height.</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">O Lord, men assault me! Be bail for me.”</font></blockquote>
<font color="#000000">Hezekiah, who had been a student of Bible Doctrine
and who had great prosperity, neglected doctrine and became a coward.&nbsp;
He was frightened to death of Sennacherib, king of Assyria.&nbsp; His fear
led him to negotiate peace with Sennacherib, who was one of the world's
worst terrorists.&nbsp; Hezekiah was afraid to stand and fight.</font>

a weather elephant over California was in sequence with another off the

<h3>
<i><font color="#CC0000">Conclusion</font></i></h3>
<font color="#000000">Fear drove people in a Chicago nightclub to their
deaths.&nbsp; The tragedy was symbolic of current war preparations for
Iraq.&nbsp; If Iraq has chemical and biological weapons, the way to get
it to use them is by a US attack.&nbsp; Fear of Saddam is the mark of a
coward.&nbsp; The man is inept in warfare, and yet the Bush Administration
is giving him top billing.&nbsp; The spraying of mace or pepper spray in
the Chicago nightclub represented the panic from chemical weapons.&nbsp;
The people in the nightclub didn't know when to stand and when to run.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The nightclub is at 2347 S. Michigan, which stands
for a Spiritual uptrend (23) and peace (47).&nbsp; Chicago is in the region
of Naphtali, the doe and symbol of peace.&nbsp; Thus, the tragedy was tied
to the Middle East peace process, which is part of US foreign policy.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Hezekiah, King of Judah, was a coward after he
neglected Bible Doctrine.&nbsp; When he began to die, however, he prayed
like a holy roller.&nbsp; He sounded like a sandhill crane.&nbsp; He was
afraid of Sennacherib, King of Assyria, and tried to negotiate peace with
a terrorist.&nbsp; Terrorists should be killed, not brought in for peace
talks.&nbsp; Leaders who lack backbone are just like Hezekiah.&nbsp; They
don't kill terrorists.&nbsp; They go to the United Nations and talk peace.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The same was true of the king in Jeremiah's day
before the fall of Judah in the Fifth Cycle of Discipline.&nbsp; The king
was negotiating peace treaties.&nbsp; He had a coalition with Egypt for
protection against Babylon.&nbsp; And the believers of the day were like
Hezekiah.&nbsp; They lived in fear because they rejected the Lord's help
through Bible Doctrine.&nbsp; Israel has done the same, and so has the
USA.&nbsp; Terrorism brings out the fear in cowards.&nbsp; Israel killed
a leading Hamas terrorist today.&nbsp; That was good.&nbsp; Did you hear
any words of praise from the White House?&nbsp; No.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Two sandhill cranes were brought on a tour of
a Florida neighborhood this afternoon by the angels.&nbsp; The sandhill
cranes did not represent the exodus from an Iraq war.&nbsp; They represented
people who know less than migratory birds and the likes of Hezekiah, who
tried to negotiate peace treaties with terrorists.&nbsp; Hezekiah, without
Bible Doctrine, became a coward.&nbsp; But when he was dying, he began
to pray like a holy roller. The only difference between the holy rollers
and the people who died in the Chicago honky tonk is that the holy rollers
are going to Heaven after they die the sin unto death.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Today was February 17th, for lawlessness, which
is synonymous with the peace crowd and party crowd.&nbsp; And it was Day
48, for the inheritance of the Levites, which is an icon of the Promised
Land.&nbsp; Today was a reminder that the Lord remembers the Abrahamic
Covenant even when Jews and Christians without doctrine forget it.</font>
<h3>
<i><font color="#CC0000">Bible Doctrine</font></i></h3>
<font color="#000000">This is Bible Doctrine.&nbsp; Even a sandhill crane
knows when to migrate, but Christians without Bible Doctrine don't even
know that it is the Lord who is bringing the terrorist cursing upon the
USA and Israel.&nbsp; Even bin Laden knows his enemy, but do the Christians
in the USA?</font>
