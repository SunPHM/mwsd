<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">This is the second rarest crane in the world
(after the Whooping Crane of North America). The total population in the wild
has recently been between 1,700 and 2,000 birds.</font><font size="2" face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><br>
<br>
</font><font size="2" face="Tahoma">There is a resident population on Japan's
northern island, Hokkaido. That is the only place in Japan where the species
normally occurs. At one time, it bred on all 4 of the main Japanese islands, but
it declined dramatically in Japan in the 19th Century. By 1890, it remained only
in Hokkaido, where it nested (and continued to do so) in marshes in the
southeast part of the island. In the 1920's, the total Japanese population was
ONLY ABOUT 20 INDIVIDUALS. Since then, the number in Hokkaido, due to protection
and artificial feeding (in the winter), has increased to approximately 900
birds.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">A migratory population on continental Asia (of
about 1,050 birds) breeds in northeast China, eastern Russia, and Mongolia, and
winters in eastern China and Korea. Nesting is in large wetlands. Feeding is in
marshes with relatively deep water. Nests are in areas with standing dead
vegetation. Preferred foraging sites are wet (such as rivers, marshes, and
lakes), but on occasion birds will forage on dikes and in croplands.<br>
<font color="#003399">One of these Red-crowned Cranes (a &quot;Manchurian
Crane&quot;, rather than a &quot;Japanese Crane&quot;), an immature bird, that
would normally winter (as noted above) in eastern China or Korea, was seen on
the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, with wintering White-naped and Hooded
Cranes, during our FONT tour in February 2005. It was the first occurrence of a
Red-crowned Crane there in 37 years!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br>
<br>
<i>Watching and listening to a flock of Japanese Cranes, as we do during our
tours in the winter on Hokkaido, in northern Japan, as the birds fly against a blue sky and feed
and dance on a snowy field is one of the world's thrilling natural experiences!<br>
During our tours the spring, we enjoy family groups of these cranes in the marshes, along
with other sights and sounds of that season.<br>

most part, in wetlands in northeastern China, at about 6 localities. Some
(several hundred birds) breed in adjacent Mongolia. A few (less than 20 pairs)
breed in southeast Russia. The total population of the species is estimated at
about 5,000 individuals.<br>
<br>
Birds from the western portion of the breeding range (approximately 2,000)
migrate south through China, resting in the Yellow River Delta, and then
wintering in the middle Yangtze River
Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Birds from the eastern portion of the breeding range (approximately 2,000)
migrate south through the Korean Peninsula. Several hundred winter in the
Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. The remainder continue to the
Japanese island of Kyushu, particularly to the area of Arasaki on the west side
of the island. In the past, the White-naped Crane was more numerous and widely
distributed than it is now. However, also in the past (but not as long ago),
there were less than there are today. The population was at its lowest after
World War II and the Korean War. Since then, numbers have increased in parts of
the range, and decreased in others.<br>
<br>
Arasaki, on Kyushu, Japan, is a very important wintering site for the species.
It is the only Japanese site for the bird. In 1992, just over 2,000 White-naped
Cranes wintered there, along with over 8,000 Hooded Cranes. By the year 2000,
there were about 2,500 White-naped Cranes wintering at Arasaki.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size="2" color="#000066"><b><i><br>

<p><b><font face="Book Antiqua" size="2" color="#CC0066">Siberian (White) Crane<br>
<br>
</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">This large white bird, with black on its
wings, is the third rarest carne in the world (after the Whooping and
Red-crowned Cranes). Until 1981, it was thought to be even more rare and
endangered. During that year, about 800 birds were discovered wintering at Lake
Poyang, China's largest freshwater lake, along the Yangtze River. With that, the
known population nearly doubled. Subsequent field surveys showed the total
population of the species to be about 3,000 birds.<br>
<br>
But still the outlook for the species certainly continues to be precarious.
According to the crane specialist, George Archibald, &quot;from the tundra to
the subtropics, few endangered species involve so many complex problems in so
many countries as does the Siberian crane&quot;. So, the apt classification of
the species as &quot;endangered&quot;.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">There are 3 populations of Siberian Cranes. All
but a few of the 3,000 birds belong to the eastern population, which breeds in
northeastern Siberia, and winters along the Yangtze River in China.<br>
<br>
Another very small central population has bred in the lower basin of the Konovat
River in western Siberia, and has wintered in the Indian state of Rajasthan
(most regularly in the Keoladero National Park). When this population was
observed at its wintering grounds in 1992-93, it included just 5 birds. Only 4
birds were observed in the Kunovat breeding grounds in 1995.<br>
<br>
The western population (also very small and threatened), which apparently held
at 8 to 14 birds in the late 1980's and early 1990's, has wintered at a single
site along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea in Iran. The exact location of
the breeding grounds of that population is unknown, but it's thought to be in
the extreme northern portion of European Russia.<br>
<br>
Thus, two populations of this species are extremely vulnerable (on the verge of
extinction). These populations have declined from just over a hundred birds in
the 1960's (when they were discovered).<br>
<br>
The Siberian Crane has occurred as a vagrant in Japan in recent years, most
often recently with the White-naped and Hooded Cranes from mainland Asia that
winter on Kyushu. Those in Japan are wanderers, on occasion, from the larger
eastern population of the species that normally winters in China.<br>
<br>
Actually, in the past, the Siberian Crane was a common winter visitor in Japan
on Kyushu prior to the Mejii Era. Throughout the 20th Century, it became
accidental, but there were some occurrences from Hokkaido south to Okinawa.
Mostly, however, on Kyushu, but some on Hokkaido: in Oct-Dec 1977 and in May-Sep
1985. The latter was a summering bird in the Kushiro district, where the
Japanese population of the Red-crowned Crane occurs.<br>
<br>
Where Siberian Cranes breed in Asia, huge distances separate nesting pairs.
Within each 1000 square kilometers in the breeding range, there are only 1 or 2
pairs of cranes.<br>
<br>
The Siberian is the most aquatic of cranes, exclusively using wetlands for
nesting, feeding, and roosting. The nests are in bogs and marshes. In migration
and in wintering areas, the bird prefers to feed and roost in shallow wetlands,
even artificial water impoundments. Its preferred foods are roots, sprouts, and
stems of sedges and other aquatic plants.</font></p>

<br>
</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The species breeds in wetlands in two
areas of central Siberia. A very few have been known to breed in China since
1991. Nesting occurs in isolated, widely scattered bogs in the tiaga and other
forested wetlands - preferring mossy areas with a few larch trees, and avoiding
areas either too open or too densely forested.<br>
<br>
The Hooded Crane winters at a few localities in Japan, Korea, and eastern China.
The total population has been estimated, during recent years, from about 10,000
to 11,800 birds, having increased due to artificial feeding (particularly at one
prime wintering site, at Arasaki, in Kyushu, Japan). At Arasaki, more than 80
per cent of the world's Hooded Cranes spend the winter. In that area in 1992,
there were nearly 9,000 birds. The species winters at only one other place in
Japan: at Yashiro on Honshu, with about 100 birds there.<br>
<br>
In Japan and Korea, the Hooded Crane winters almost exclusively at feeding
stations and in agricultural fields. In China, they tend to roost along the
shores of rivers and shallow lakes, and to forage along the muddy edges of lakes
and nearby grasslands and rice paddies.<br>
<br>
The population of Hooded Cranes has fluctuated considerably since the 1920's,
but at present, the number is probably as large as at any point since then.<br>

Whooping Crane, seen during FONT tours&nbsp;<br>
in Texas, USA:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></i></p>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">In North America, the <b>Whooping Crane</b>, is
  the rarest crane in the world, although not as rare as it once was.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2"><b>2005</b> is a very special year for the
  Whooping Crane. That is particularly so in relation to the long-established
  population that breeds in the Northwest Territories of Canada and winters in
  the Aransas area of coastal Texas.&nbsp;<br>
  A census flight, this winter, in a light plane over Aransas counted <b>216
  Whooping Cranes</b>, the most there in about a century!</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">Since the birds reached their low point in 1941,
  with only 15 recorded in Texas after the disappearance of those that had
  wintered nearby on the immense King Ranch, the wildlife services of the United
  States and Canada, working together, have brought about an amazing comeback.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">After years of work, protecting and nurturing the
  birds, the total Whooping Crane population in North America is now <b>470</b>.
  And, <b>213</b> of them are in the self-sustaining natural flock that arrives
  each fall at Aransas in Texas. The rest are resident in Florida, in captivity,
  or in a flock that was re-introduced in Wisconsin and taught to migrate to
  Florida.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Texas cranes had an excellent breeding season
  last year in the<font color="#008080"> </font>Wood Buffalo National Park in
  the Canadian Northwest Territories, where <b>54 nesting pairs fledged a record
  40 chicks.</b> Most of them were old enough to fly by mid-August, enabling
  them to escape predators and migrate to Texas. A record 33 (birds of the year)
  arrived at Aransas this winter.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">And they're having a good year in Texas too, as
  high rainfall and abundant flowing freshwater have increased the number of
  blue crabs, their favorite food (although they also eat snakes, snails, rats,
  and other creatures).</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">Historically, fossil records suggest that
  Whooping Cranes have existed for several million years, and once lived from
  the prairies of Alberta, Canada to central Mexico.</font>
</div>
<font face="Tahoma" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
<div>
  <font face="Tahoma" size="2">Even though a very good year for the Whooping
  Crane, it sadly is noted that 2 males were shot, this past November, while
  migrating through Kansas. They were quickly discovered on the ground. One died
  within a week. The other&nbsp; had surgery to repair a broken wing, and was
  then flown to the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland,&nbsp; where
  it subsequently died due to respiratory problems related to its injuries. With
  a population of 470 birds, even though considerably more than before, every
  bird matters.</font>
