        <p>Communication is not something that is the exclusive realm of humans. 
          Coco the ape communicated very well in sign language with her trainer 
          but couldn't understand some of the concepts of language such as yesterday. 
          When Coco had her IQ tested it came out to be 80. The average American 
          is 90-120. The day came that her trainer had waited for. When she thought 
          Coco was proficient enough at sign language her trainer asked the animal 
          the 64,000 dollar question, &quot;what was death?&quot;. Coco replied, 
          in sign language, that death was being put in a warm hole. The reason 
          this question was asked was that Coco had been observed burying a dead 
          pigeon. Coco was so human like she even had a pet, a cat that she loved 
          very much.</p>
        <p>But animals do not have to be primates to communicate. Even the lowly 
          insect may be able to communicate. Take the Honey Bee for example. It 
          seems to be born with this ability. When the bee discovers a particularly 
          good flower it will fly back to the hive and do a little dance that 
          somehow lets the other bees know about the flower and its location. 
          This is one of the great mysteries of science and scientists have been 
          trying to crack the dance code for years. </p>
        <p>It is thought that certain species of fish can communicate with each 
          other. The frequency is so low that divers can not hear it. When a Black 
          grouper is startled it makes a very loud boom noise. Damselfish are 
          believed to make very complex sounds. The sound is usually made by the 
          male when he is defending his territory. This fish makes a different 
          sound when courting, that sounds like chirping. Fish have inner ears 
          that allow them to hear. </p>
        <p>A howling wolf is not howling to scare anyone. The reason he is doing 
          so is to let the rest of his pack know where he is and to tell other 
          packs to stay away, this is his territory. </p>

        <p>There are quite a few people that claim that they can communicate with 
          animals by reading their thoughts. I personally don't believe in this 
          but some people claim that their pets were helped this way. </p>
        <p>The Kangaroo rat communicates by stamping its feet. So far researchers 
          have been able to distinguish between stamping to warn off a snake, 
          stamping to get a mate and stamping for territory.</p>
        <p>Some birds are said to have certain sounds to show the difference between 
          the fact that a hawk is in the air overhead and that hawk is on the 
          ground. </p>
        <p>In 1979 another ape named Matata was being taught language through 
          the use of a keyboard and symbols. It became very frustrating for the 
          trainers and the ape. Things did not go well, then to the utter surprise 
          of the trainers, the adopted son to Matata, Kanzi went over to the keyboard 
          and began typing sentences. He had been watching the entire time Matata 
          was being taught. He even understood spoken language which really surprised 
          everyone. 90% of all his communications were spontaneous.</p>
        <p>Dolphins have often been the target of language study. This is for 
          a combination of reasons. One reason is that they have a brain which 
          is larger than a human, another is that they make many different noises 
          and yet another is that they are a very social animal. </p>
        <p>Have we been wrong about animals all these eons? Could it be that animals 
          are far more intelligent than we have been giving them credit for? If 
          this is true, our cruelty to animals is even worse then we thought. 
          Imagine slaughtering an animal's mate for some cosmetic test while his 
          mate watches from her cage? Could the animal be experiencing sorrow 
          on the scale of human sorrow, maybe so? Do we have to look at animals 
          in a different light? We certainly do.</p>
