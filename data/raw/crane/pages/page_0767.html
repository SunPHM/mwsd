      <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Trinka brought to the televised version of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea 
      a sense of calm and comfort--his character on the 
      opposite end of the karmic scale than, for example, seaman Clark.&nbsp; As 
      with the rest of the show's regulars, this had little to do 
      with any substantive depth, detail or background inherent in the scripts.&nbsp; But 
      the calm, easy-going side of Patterson wasn't always 
      apparent in the show's comparatively gritty first season, during which 
      &quot;Pat&quot;, on more than one occasion, speaks almost bitterly. <BR><BR>

            negative to say.&nbsp; But more important than his words, was his simple, 
            down to earth demeanor that gave the viewer a sense of comfort.&nbsp; With 
            rare exception, Patterson did not get excited or nervous.&nbsp; You had 
            the sense he accepted whatever happened to him, regardless of the

      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether in the context of 
      kidding around with Kowalski about something/anything or waxing 
      philosophical about being shot or beaten up again, Pat remained 
      cool.<BR><BR>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a special quality that Paul Trinka brought to the 
      role that gave the character subtext and depth, analogous to, although 
      on a different level from that of Richard Basehart.&nbsp; It felt&nbsp;as if 
      rather than plumbing the depths of great acting skills, he was just 
      kind-of being himself.&nbsp; If true, this was certainly sufficient to make the 
      character of Patterson likable and more importantly, believable. </P>

            and motorcycle enthusiast who also loved to hop on a plane and

          <I>Trinka travelled to Tahiti and other exotic

</I>What was the Admiral so all-fired anxious to talk about?&nbsp; Could it relate to 
the bizarre events that he, Jacob Compton and Lee Crane had just experienced on 
their flight to Seaview?&nbsp; Likely so, since the Captain had ushered him directly 
from the Flying Sub to the Admiral's quarters in great haste, hustling him 
rapidly past his crew mates in spite of the fact that he hadn't seen most of 
them in months.&nbsp; It felt as if Crane were trying to keep him temporarily 
quarantined.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat sat waiting and fidgeting for 
several minutes, when finally the Admiral entered, closed the door, walked to 
his desk, and sat down.&nbsp; He fiddled with his shirt pocket as if hunting for a 
package of cigarettes, then, with a sigh of frustration, gave it up.

more than that.&quot; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You don't have to, Admiral. Your
