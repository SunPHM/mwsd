There is a movement of a species of bird underway, heading for
their northern nesting environments, that takes place every year
around the time when maple tree sap is starting to run.
<p>
These birds are thought to be the most typical breeding bird of the
northern evergreen forest stretching from the Atlantic to the
Pacific in Canada and including the northern tier of counties in
Wisconsin.  Their flashy white outer tail feathers make this one
of the easiest birds on the wing to identify – the junco.
<p>
Generally it is assumed that they nest as far north as the tree
line extends into northern Canada.  However, it is considered to
be the only species of bird that nests above the tree line in the
White Mountains of New Hampshire.
<p>
Old-timers called them
snowbirds, associating their arrival in fall with the nearness of
winter.  For a long time they were referred to as slate-colored
juncos in Wisconsin until the American Ornithologists Union (AOU)
took the matter in hand. Much ado was made about similarities and
differences along with cross-breeding.
<p>
You've heard of the
"lumpers" and the "splitters" when it comes to assigning
scientific names to plants and animals.  For some reason or
other, much splitting occurred in past years when it came to
naming the juncos.
<p>
One of America's outstanding ornithologists,
Arthur Cleveland Bent (1866-1954) spent 44 years of his life
amassing and assembling first-hand accounts of birds from
hundreds of Nineteenth Century naturalists and explorers.
<p>
Bent's
gathering, editing, and writing 26 volumes of material on the
status of birds in the 48 states (at that time) included 115
pages on the various species and races of juncos alone.  The
state of Oregon was really "junco happy" as they claimed at least
seven races of these little, fast-moving birds.
<p>
Finally the AOU
did a lot of lumping in recent years and came up with one species
for the entire country, the dark-eyed junco.  However, some of
the field guides still give strong mention to a few distinctive
races.
<p>
One is the Oregon junco, known for its slatey to blackish
hood and rusty-brown back and sides.  We were so lucky to have
one of these easily identified birds at our place all winter,
along with around a half dozen of the more common, "slate-gray
back with whitish belly" kind.
<p>
Other races still being mentioned
are the "pink-sided" of the central Rockies region and the
"grey-headed" of the southern Rockies.
<p>
One other junco, this one
with an outstanding, immediately recognizable field mark, is the
"yellow-eyed junco" that we enjoyed several years ago at The
Nature Conservancy's Mile High ornithological camp in southern
Arizona.  This species, whose old name was the Mexican junco,
sports striking yellow irises giving the bird an almost glaring
appearance somewhat like the adult brown thrasher so many of you
know.
<p>
Never in our lives have Charlotte and I enjoyed watching a
junco as much as the Carolina "dark-eyed" junco we observed
building its nest on a steep rocky slope in the highest part of
the Great Smokey Mountain National Park.  Instead of migrating
hundreds of miles annually, this mountain dweller nests near the
tops of the mountains of the East, for example the Blue Ridge
Mountains, and then simply migrates in fall downward to the
valleys several miles away.
<p>
Of all the birds I banded for the US
Government, none were as gentle in the hand as the juncos.  They
hardly struggle and rarely peck at your fingers.
<p>
One did however
give me quite a surprise during one of my first years of handling
birds.  In turning that particular bird over in my hand for a
better position for fastening the tiny aluminum, numbered band
onto one of its legs, I became a bit lax.  Just that fast the
bird was off for its freedom.  Instinctively I grabbed at the
bird and caught onto its tail, only to find myself holding the
entire tail, all 10 feathers, while the now tail-less bird
continued on its merry way.
<p>
Gosh, those feathers came out easily!
<p>
Talk about being embarrassed!  Fortunately I've watched enough
tail-less birds maneuver to know that they can fly and turn and
stop quite well without a tail.  I also assumed that the junco
would grow a new tail during the next several weeks.
<p>
Few small
birds have such conspicuous, easy-to-recognize field marks as the
juncos' white outer tail feathers.
<p>
By the way, a bird's true
tail feathers, or quill feathers of the tail, are called the
rectrices (rec-TRY-seez).  One tail feather is a rectrix (REC-
trix).  As was mentioned earlier, a junco has 10 rectrices that
can be referred to as five pairs.
<p>
How we welcome the growing
flocks of dark-eyed juncos with their flashy white "tail lights"
as they slowly filter through this region on their northward
journey. Regardless of which name you prefer, including northern
junco, dark-eyed junco, or slate-colored junco, they're all the
same in that they are trusting and gentle, pleasant reminders of
approaching spring.
