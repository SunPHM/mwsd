<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crane is a very sacred bird, one of the most frequently mentioned in the 
Celtic lore. He is said to be one of the first birds to greet the sunrise, and is able to predict rains and storms.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is associated with the Ogham, and the place of knowledge (East, 
sunrise). "Crane Knowledge" is Druid knowledge, knowledge of the Ogham in particular.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manannan mac Lir possessed the Crane Bag, a bag made from the skin of 
a crane, and in it he carried his shirt, shears, a helmet, pig bones, and some other things. It would be empty or 
full depending on the tides.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tales, Cranes often appear in threes. Mider has three cranes guarding 
his castle (they had the ability to rob any attacker of his will to fight), and three cranes protect the entrance to 
Annwn, the Underworld.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fionn mac Cumhail is saved from falling over a cliff as a child by his 
grandmother, who turns into a crane to break his fall.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crane is also, in darker aspect, considered a bird of the Cailleach. Therefore 
he is a bird of old age and a guide in the Otherworld after death. (Rather reminds one of the common 
association of the "stork" bringing babies -- the spirit traveling with the stork/crane to and from this world.)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in Celtic lore (and in other cultures as well), Crane is the keeper of 
secret knowledge and symbolizes longevity.<BR>
