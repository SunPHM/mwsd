      <p class="body">I knew you wanted more... :)</p>
      <p class="body">So we dumped the oldies in Brussels and, after offering 
        to take the three sets of clogs Vanessa bought, a camcorder and a flat 
        battery due to not enough room in their suitcases, we hopped a cheap flight 
        purchased only 48 hours beforehand on the Internet. So we're in the taxi 
        at 4:00am out to Brussels International Airport. </p>
      <p class="body">The plane was surprisingly on schedule and landed in Athens 
        by midday local time. Backpacks strapped on, the very helpful information 
        man with a nametag labeled 'George' pointed us to the direction to the 
        airport shuttle bus. </p>
      <p class="body">The weather was perfect - not a cloud in the sky and a very 
        dry 30&deg;C making for some quality tanning. Sixty minutes later, the 
        bus pulled into downtown Athens and out came the Lonely Planet Guide. 
      </p>
      <p class="body">I'm not the best at initial directions (a compass would 
        probably make a good Christmas Present.. hint hint, nudge nudge!) so we're 
        looking like right Ozzie backpackers as we're twisting the map of Athens 
        to get our bearings. It only took 5 minutes rather friendly local in a 
        Hawaiian shirt asks us where we're heading. We mention the name of the 
        hotel, and he replied that it was right on the other side of town - too 
        far to walk. Which was rather nice of him, and then he said he'd take 
        us to the bus station as the taxis were on strike. Hmmm. Stories of waking 
        up the next day without kidneys was running through my mind... </p>
      <p class="body"><img src="../albums/album22/img/ph05s.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="left" alt="Ahtens at Sunset">Anyways, 
        we followed him and he pointed to the bus stop - not so dodgy after all 
        and then he asked if we were checking out any of the islands. We kinda 
        tried to shake him but with his witty salesmanship, we agreed to see the 
        'tourist information centre.' This turned out to be a little independent 
        travel agent with a heap of 'student' deals. So we asked for his business 
        card, which he wrote his name, 'George' and thanked him for the advice.</p>
      <p class="body">Now I was completely lost! Where did we come from, which 
        way was the bus station? We walked up to a busy street and hopped the 
        next bus in the direction that George told us. 15 minutes later, the bus 
        pulled off the main street. So backpacks and all, we hopped off and found 
        the next bus heading down the main street. Next thing we know the second 
        bus pulls off the main road too! Again, we're changing to a third bus 
        only to now find ourselves on the edge of a highway. Hmmm this was not 
        looking good. Did I mention that the taxis were on strike? So frustration 
        slowly set in as we made our way back to where the airport bus dropped 
        us off. </p>
      <p class="body">Three hours later, and still no sign of the hotel. Managed 
        to finally get the direction of the map right to find the real tourist 
        information centre who weren't too helpful, but managed to head us in 
        the right direction. </p>
      <p class="body">Stepping into the air-conditioned lobby we dropped the bags 
        with the three clogs, a camcorder with a flat battery only to have the 
        concierge tell us some bad news. The booked room had been flooded due 
        to clogged pipes and we had to move to another hotel. They offered to 
        drive us to the other and we checked in by about 4pm. By this time, I 
        am starving, so we bee lined it to the nearest Greek cuisine. </p>
      <p class="body">Just around the corner was this lovely little caf&eacute; 
        with rows of tables covered in yellow and blue tablecloths amongst some 
        lush potted trees. The Greek salad was huge - enough for four, this baby 
        had it all! Lettuce, chunky tomatoes &amp; cucumber, sliced rings of red 
        onion, a sprinkling of whole black olives and a big square block of goats 
        cheese all drizzled in virgin olive oil. That sure did fill the hole and 
        we were off to investigate the Plaka.</p>
      <p class="body"><img src="../albums/album22/img/ph08s.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="right" alt="The Plaka at Night">The 
        Plaka is situated around the base of the Acropolis with winding narrow 
        streets of shops, hotels and restaurants. Most of the roads are closed 
        to traffic and make for some cosy window shopping and dining. It was refreshing 
        to be shopping in without being hustled by the owners. They were more 
        interested in knowing where you were from, been and heading to. </p>
      <p class="body">The afternoon we decided to hop a 20 minute train ride out 
        of town to the Port of Piraeus - one of the busiest ports in the Mediterranean 
        servicing all the inhabited Greek Islands. We scouted out ticket deals 
        from several ferry outlets to the Island of Mykonos. Looked like the Greeks 
        don't understand competition, as all the tickets were the same price. 
        So we left the tickets for when we were ready to hop a ferry and chance 
        one of the three ferries to Mykonos.</p>
      <p class="body">So we're on the train back to the Plaka to grab a romantic 
        alfresco dinner while listening to a group of playing traditional music 
        and wandered around the base of the Acropolis splashed in amber spotlights. 
        At the base there was an opera performing in the Theatre of Herodes Atticus. 
        The acoustics were so good that we could hear the performance right along 
        the main road leading up the side of the mountain. After a long day, we 
        headed back to the hotel for some much-needed shuteye.</p>
      <p class="body">The next morning we headed up the mountain path to the top 
        of the Acropolis, bought a set of tickets and started the exploration 
        of the Acropolis. The winding steep steps climbed closer to the main entrance 
        constructed of different sized marble blocks which opened to a row of 
        towering columns on either side. The view was amazing; you could see all 
        over Athens and out to the Mediterranean. The urban sprawl of white houses 
        with all their solar heating systems reflecting the suns rays was like 
        looking upon a city of sparkling diamonds. You could hear the bustle of 
        cars and the continual honking of horns. The towering columns on either 
        side of the entrance then opened up to the top of the acropolis where 
        a slippery weather worn and well trodden marble road snaked up towards 
        the Parthenon &amp; the Temple of Athina standing majestically amongst 
        large blocks of marble strewn over the area. </p>
      <p class="body"><img src="../albums/album22/img/ph02s.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="left" alt="The Parthenon">The 
        Acropolis looked more like a construction zone, as there were cranes erected 
        and mason workers busily renovating the ancient constructions in preparation 
        for the 2006 Olympic Games. A heap of scaffolding cluttered the interior 
        of the Parthenon not making for good photo opportunities, but plenty were 
        taken anyway. So after exploring the nooks and crannies of the Acropolis, 
        we headed down the mountain to check out one of the ancient theatres. 
      </p>
      <p class="body">This theatre was amazing; the stage was made of intricate 
        black and white stones in the shape of a large diamond with the seats 
        built into the rising bank. There were reminiscent pieces of the 'first 
        class' seating in the first couple of rows that looked like marble thrones 
        and a curious drainage system around the edge of the stage. The acoustics 
        were amazing for such a stricken theatre where people speaking and a normal 
        level on the stage could be heard clearly on the top row of seats. </p>
      <p class="body">Straight above the theatre was a cave in the side of the 
        Acropolis - I managed to climb to the foot of hill to find the cave full 
        of pictures of Jesus at what seemed to be an alter at the top of a set 
        of weather worn wooden stairs. It was quite a reverent moment gazing at 
        the framed pictures though a set of thick iron gates. </p>
      <p class="body">So after checking out the theatre and exploring the foot 
        of the Acropolis, we decided to grab a Greek-Salad lunch before embarking 
        on the Ancient Agora. This was the place to be seen with Socrates, way 
        back before J.C was born. In the Agora you can make out more foundations 
        of buildings and where the main road lead towards the Acropolis. There 
        were even reminiscent remains of the complex drainage systems running 
        along sides of the excavated roads in interconnecting from other sources 
        across the field. A smaller temple like the Parthenon called the Temple 
        of Hephaestus stood majestically on the other side of the town. There 
        are also extremely well preserved oil paintings of Christ and other Christian 
        murals on the inside the Church of the Holy Apostles. </p>
      <p class="body">The Agora also has a wonderfully reconstructed open-air 
        hall called the Stoa of Attalos where many of the original marble statues 
        and carvings unearthed from all over Athens. But make sure you don't lean 
        against anything that looks old; else the Tourist Police will blow their 
        whistles at you to 'step away from the marble sir.' (or madam)</p>
      <p class="body"><img src="../albums/album22/img/ph03s.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="right" alt="The Theatre of Herodes Atticus">Anyways, 
        after getting a few snaps of the old stuff, we headed out of the Agora 
        and wandered through the neighbouring markets around Syntagma. The markets 
        were similar to the ones around the Plaka, but I think the locals visit 
        this place more - quite a few fresh-food stalls (but no cow heads like 
        the markets in Tunisia) as well as authentic Greek jewelry, leather &amp; 
        the occasional gift shop. </p>
      <p class="body">The rest of the afternoon was spent at the National Archeological 
        Museum, a 15 minute walk from the Syntagma markets. The museum holds the 
        best of the best of historical artifacts from grand bronze casts of larger 
        than life Greek Gods right down to the tools, crockery and jewelry of 
        another time. </p>
      <p class="body">And last but not least, we headed over to Lykavittos Hill, 
        the highest mountain in Athens. We caught a train to the closest subway 
        station and walked up the 200 steps to the foot of the mountain. Now the 
        Lonely Planet guide mentioned the funicular railway to take you to the 
        very top, but it was under repairs. So we were faced with another 200 
        odd steps (I wasn't a popular boyfriend) to the top to watch the sunset 
        flood the city in fiery amber as it slipped slowly behind the mountains 
        on the horizon. </p>
      <p class="body">Absolutely worn out, we waddled down the mountain to get 
        a quick Souvlaki and crashing for the night. Besides, we had a ferry to 
        catch to Mykonos...</p>
      <p class="body">I've whacked a set of photos from Athens on the website,
