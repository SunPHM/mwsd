Dear visitor!<br>
Welcome to this recently installed website about cranes in German zoos and game parks. <br>
On the following sites the zoos and the populations of the different crane-species kept in these zoos are listed up.  <br>
If there is a zoo that is keeping cranes but is not listed up here please let me know.    <br><br>
I would like to put in photographs of the biotopes and the terrains where the cranes are kept, photographs of the kept cranes in their environment and figures/numbers/facts of each zoo. <br>
Completed sites for these zoos are linked in the list and additionally marked with "<font color="#ff0000">NEW</font>".

*) "x" means that this specie is kept in the relevant zoo. The exact number of the individuals kept there has still to be tracked down -has not been done until now. Consequently the summed-up numbers of the relevant species are still to small.
