<p>Mural Description: The Tradicion y Cultura mural, also known as The Sweet as Candy Lowrider Mural, is a tribute to the familial lowrider tradition and culture in San Antonio. First-time Hard Core Crew Members, Ruth Buentello, Victor Mena, Damien Hernandez and Oscar Flores designed the mural. The crew of teenagers came up with the idea for the mural after having met the Stewart family while conducting research at the Centro Aztlan Low and Slow Classic Car Show. The mural crew, working alongside Mural Facilitator Alex Rubio, decided to create a mural based on one of the Stewart Family lowrider cars and on the tradition of lowriding within the Stewart family. The 28' X 11' mural is located at the corner of Chupaderas and Guadalupe St, in the heart of the Westside.</p>

<p>Location: 1223 Trinity, between Chihuahua and San Carlos St.</p>

<p>Lead Artist: Anabelle Rodriguez</p>

<p>Partners / Collaborators: Taller Puertorriqueño, Guadalupe Home<br />
Blessing and Dedication Date: Sunday August 10th, 2003</p>

<p>Mural Description: This mural was inspired by the indigenous aspects of the Virgen de Guadalupe. Native symbols and images have been incorporated into the mural. The use of indigenous symbols remind us of our roots and helps us to re-connect with our ancestors. </p>

<p><img alt=" girls.jpg" src="http://www.sananto.org/video/archives/ girls.jpg" width="500" height="333" border="0" /><br />
Anabelle Rodriguez works with residents of the Guadalupe Home on painting tiles for the mural. </p>

<p>This mural project is unique in several ways: <br />
* This is San Antos first Muralist-In-Residency project. <br />
* The project is a collaborative effort between San Anto Cultural Arts, The Taller Puertorriqueño Cultural Center in Philadelphia, and The Guadalupe Home for Homeless Expectant  Mothers.<br />
* This mural is our first stained-glass piece.</p>

Anabelle works with a mural crew member on cutting glass.</p>

<p>The mural, entitled Stained Glass Mosaic Para La Virgen De Guadalupe, was designed and created by Philadelphia muralist, Anabelle Rodriguez, and a crew of San Anto Cultural Arts Mural Program participants. Anabelle Rodriguez was born in Aibonito, Puerto Rico. She arrived in the United States in 1990, to pursue an undergraduate degree from Brown University (B.A. History of Art and Architecture/The Visual Arts 1994). Her work experience includes: Education Director at the Ponce Museum of Art, holder of some of the finest and most comprehensive art collections in the Caribbean. She is currently the Visual Arts Director and Curator of the Lorenzo Homar Gallery at Taller Puertorriqueño, Inc., the cultural heart of El Barrio in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Anabelle is the first artist chosen for San Anto Cultural Arts' Muralist-In-Residency Project. This project is designed to give established muralists from San Antonio and throughout the country an opportunity to create community-based murals within the San Anto Cultural Arts Westside Mural District.</p>

<h3 class="title">Virgen Indígena</h3>
<p><img alt="Virgencomplete.jpg" src="http://www.sananto.org/mural/archives/Virgencomplete.jpg" width="500" height="371" border="0" /></p>

<p>Location: Durango and Trinity</p>

<p>Lead Artists: Jane Madrigal, Jose Cosme, Louie Alejandro</p>

<p>Partners / Collaborators: Guadalupe Community Center</p>

<p>Blessing and Dedication Date: Sunday, January 11, 2004</p>

<p>Mural Description: The Virgen Indigena Mural at the Guadalupe Community Center is SACAs 25th Mural project. Production and inspiration for this mural began when we were contacted by Cindy Tellez, wife of Ray Tellez. As an inmate in one of Texas fine prisons, Ray had been submitting artwork, writngs and poetry to our Community Newspaper, El Placazo, for several years. Ray was one of our most consistent and talented contributors of prison art and writings,<br />
submitting art pieces and poems that spoke of a troubled youth, life in prison and fantasies of freedom. These Paño Arte (handkerchief art) pieces and poetry helped Ray cope with loneliness and solitude while in prison. Cindy had come by the SACA office to let us know that Ray was going to be released from prison and needed to cancel his monthly subscription to El Placazo. </p>

<p><img alt="louie.jpg" src="http://www.sananto.org/mural/archives/louie.jpg" width="500" height="371" border="0" /><br />
Hard Core Crew Member, Louie Alejandro, prepares the mural wall. <br />
     <br />
After several program strategy meetings, it was decided that we would to continue our relationship with Ray and expand the scope of our existing mural project structure. We offered the recently released inmate the opportunity to join our organization as a Lead Muralist. This project would serve as a bi-lateral learning tool for him to further develop his artistic talent as an artist, through the development of a Mural within his community, and by working directly with local youth, educate our community about his experiences before, during and after prison. This project was to serve as a creative method for Ray to re-associate himself with his community, while contributing and giving back profoundly to his community in the form of a public mural.</p>

     <br />
Unfortunately, Ray was not able to complete the intened mural and the project was put on hold. In June, 2003, Jane Madrigal was hired as Community Mural Program Coordinator for SACA. One of her first assignments was to complete the mural at the Guadalupe Communiy Center by any means necessary. After several requested design and image changes, the project has finally been completed. What have we learned from this project? Dont ever give up! </p>

<p>The Graffiti Mural is a collection of words written in an underground graffiti style which express our community's successes and sorrows. Words such as love and hate are depictedin a colorful collage of aerosol bombs and characters. Harcore garff heads, Reyes Garcia and Robert Muñoz offer the community the opportunity to see through the eyes of a graffiti writer and understand this powerful art movement. As stated by Reyes Garcia, "graffiti stains more than a wall, it stains the soul."</p>

Hard Core Mural Crew Member, Catherine Fernandez, working on the mural.</p>

<p>Description of mural: This 100' X 20' mural tackled timely issues of political corruption, economic racism, environmental racism and corporate greed and the effect those societal ills have on working class communities here in our city and throughout the world. The mural crew did extensive research for this 1 1/2 year project. The crew studied German expressionist art muralists Diego Rivera and Siqueros, the book Animal Farm, Pink Floyd's The Wall, convened neighborhood discussion and dialogue sessions regarding the mural imagery and conducted extensive community surveys before developing the final mural sketch.</p>

<p>This mural is the Heavy Metal crew's second mural with San Anto Mural Program. Their first mural is located right next to their current project and is entitled Heavy Metal. That mural was completed in September of 2000 and is also 100' X 20'. The 2-mural project took over 3 years to complete and has a final dimension of over 250' X 20'.</p>

<p>The Heavy Metal crew is communicating their ideas through the use of this mural art project. The issues being addressed by the Metal crew in this mural is corruption and greed in our government and the misery that the common citizen will go through if we do not practice our freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. The mural exhibits that dollars and profits have become more important than the well being of the hard working lower and middle class citizen.</p>

<p>The symbols used in the mural are puppet strings, pigs, a donkey, an elephant, money, hostility, war and greed. The giant hands represent the Puppet Master. The pigs, represent the greed of the corporate officials. The elephant and the donkey represent the political parties. A highly positioned political representative (the morphed donkey/elephant) hordes cash, representative of greedy kings from past nations. An elephant and a donkey fight over a dollar bill that is being used as bait by a pig. The background is a scene of despair and pollution. To the right of the mural, the working class do what they do best: work hard for the betterment of their families and community.</p>

Description of Mural: This mural is about seeing the parallels between the time of Christ and the present.  It is a contemporary depiction of christs crucifixion. Christ was persecuted for voicing his beliefs. Today many are judged, thrown into jail or harassed by authorities for being who they are. Painting this mural was an example of voicing out my beliefs. Christ is where I rest from the worries of society. This mural was designed and facilitated by 19 year-old lead artist Ruth Buentello.</p>
