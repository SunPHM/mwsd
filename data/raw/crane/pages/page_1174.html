              <p>Construction got under way in March on the much-anticipated realignment
          of NCAR. By 2006, all of the buildings on the ML, FL, and CG campuses
          will be positioned along a north-south axis, thus eliminating the variety
          of orientations now present.</p>
              <p>The realignment follows months of discussion among various committees.
                One of the most challenging tasks was to figure out whether to
                orient the axis so it points toward the geographic North Pole,
                the magnetic North Pole, or the North geomagnetic Pole. After
                a series of evaluations, NCAR decided to go with the geographic
                alignment, because &quot;we want
          to stay grounded,&quot; says NCAR director Tim Killeen.</p>
              <p>&quot;I.M. Pei is a stupendous architect,&quot; said one committee member, &quot;but
          for the life of me, I don't know why he put the Mesa Lab at those crazy
          angles.&quot; Using massive cranes, a construction team is now lifting
          the entire building and repositioning it so that the entrance faces
          due east.</p>
            </blockquote>        <p align="center"><img src="realignment.jpg" alt="mesa lab" width="396" height="325"></p>      
            <p align="center"> <em>Cranes are called in for a much-needed ML realignment.</em> </p>      
            <blockquote>
              <p>The realignment is being carried out in keeping with the principles
          of feng shui, the ancient art of harnessing energy. The Group on
          Accessing and Facilitating FEng Shui (GAFFES) has issued an extensive
          set of recommendations now being considered by the realignment committee.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Giant mirrors at each end of the main hallways will channel
                  Qi and keep Sha from collecting and moldering in the far corners,
                where visitors to the ML exhibits have reported slipping on it.</li>
                <li>Bamboo trees will be placed in each bathroom to absorb
                  moisture, reduce stagnant Chi, and help combat global warming
                  as they absorb carbon dioxide. </li>
                <li>A golden
              ship overflowing with diamonds&mdash;a feng-shui element said to help
              draw good fortune&mdash;will be stationed in the main ML lobby.
              Once the diamonds tarnish, they'll be excessed and stored at Sam's
              Warehouse, according to GSA guidelines.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Along with the realignment, the Mesa Lab will be undergoing fuel and
          air filter replacements and an oil change, from canola to sunflower,
          in the cafeteria. Also, the building's publication pressure will
          be adjusted to the standard level of 3.2 journal articles per year. Thanks
          to a coupon clipped from the Boulder <em>Daily Camera,</em> NCAR will
          receive a 10% discount on the $25 million job.</p>

              <p><em>True item: An analyst at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research,
            a think tank that seeks to foster greater economic choice and individual
            responsibility, has theorized that automobiles, even SUVs, are more environmentally
            friendly than bicycle commuters. Extra food eaten by bike commuters
            requires more land and fossil fuels to produce than the energy consumed
            by automobiles and road construction.</em></p>
              <p>A new Manhattan Institute study touting the economic benefits of driving
          has grave implications for UCAR, an organization that prides itself on
          the number of employees who bike to work.</p>
              <p>&quot;We now see that bicycle commuters, with their so-called 'healthy
          appetites,' don't foster a healthy planet at all,&quot; says UCAR president
          Rick Anthes. &quot;Every time they gobble another sports bar or grab
          an afternoon snack, we're one step closer to ecological doomsday.&nbsp; Emissions
          skyrocket, trees are clear-cut for power bar wrappers, and probably
          more baby seals get clubbed to death, too.&quot;</p>
              <p>Rick said that, in light of this research, UCAR will form a
                committee to study the appropriateness of things like bike racks,
                the Wednesday group rides at Foothills Lab, and the bicycle portion
                of the annual Up-the-Hill Races.&nbsp; He also wants to put an end to all commuting by biking
          and walking, and he recommends against exercise of any type.&nbsp; &quot;A
          completely sedentary lifestyle is undoubtedly the healthiest for the
          person and the environment,&quot; says Rick.</p>
              <p align="center"><img src="tim2a.jpg" alt="tim barnes" width="396" height="303"></p>

                <blockquote>
                  <p align="center"> <em>Like a typical bicyclist, Tim Barnes
                      used to gorge without any regard for the environment.</em></p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
              <p>EO's Tim Barnes, a former competitive biker who has overcome
                his bad habits, has been asked to head the committee. &quot;We'll explore the
          idea of canceling the Up-the-Hill bike race next year and having a Monster
          Truck race instead, so that we don't have a bunch of bikers gorging themselves
          after the race on energy-intensive food,&quot; Tim explains.&nbsp; &quot;It's
          the right thing for the planet, plus I've sort of always secretly wanted
          to do that anyway.&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>        
            <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      
            <blockquote><blockquote>
              <p align="center"><em><img src="hill3.jpg" alt="up the hill" width="468" height="312"></em></p>

                Races: Reformed bicyclists duke it out. </em></p>

            </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
        <p>Before making any policy changes, Tim said that management will ask
          bike commuters to wear caloric counters throughout the day to determine
          if they do in fact eat more. At some point in the future, it's
          possible that the caloric counters will beam measurements to one of the
          ML supercomputers that will put a stop on the employee ID cards of bike
          commuters, so that they can only order a certain amount of food in the
          cafeteria.</p>
        <p>For example, pretend you're a bike commuter who burns 200 calories on
          the ride to work. When you go through the lunch line, you might
          find yourself restricted to ordering a low-calorie Italian Garden Wrap
          rather than the heartier Meatball Sandwich with Breaded Ravioli. And
          don't even think about coming back for a cookie unless you want a demerit
          added to your annual review. </p>
        <p>&quot;These measures might seem harsh, but employees who need a higher caloric
          allotment to fuel their unsustainable lifestyles can choose to leave
            their dirty, polluting bikes in the garage where they belong and
          drive,&quot; says
          Rick, who used to bike to work but has since seen the error of his
          ways.</p>

            field, an event that happens on average every 250,000 years. The field
            has been getting weaker lately, decreasing by about 5% each century.
            This might be a sign that a magnetic field reversal is beginning. One

          </font>The existence
            of the neutrino was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 as an explanation
            for the process of beta decay, an unresolved problem in nuclear physics.
            Pauli proposed a third, electrically neutral particle. Enrico Fermi
            then called this particle neutrino, which means &quot;little
            neutral one&quot; in Italian. As you negotiate among your bickering

            waves are the sun's polar plumes-fingerlike structures that radiate
            upward from the poles. Like Snuffleopogus on Sesame Street, they've
            never been officially observed, but scientists have postulated their
            existence for many years. Soon it will be your turn also to stand

            the volcano is like on its inside. There are underground pools of hot
            molten rock called magma beneath the surface of an active volcano.
            Knowing where the magma pools are located and how much pressure they
            are under helps scientists understand eruptions. There's an important

            on symbiotic bacteria, which live inside the worms and convert chemicals
