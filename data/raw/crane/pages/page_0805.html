      </span><strong>September 28 - October 4, 2005<br />
            With Hank Vanderpol            </strong>
      <p>There are few places in North America where the spectacle of migration is as stunning as it is in Saskatchewan. In this portion of the Western Canadian prairies, thousands of geese, including Canada, Snow, Ross's and Greater White-fronteds, congregate on fields and lakes as they migrate to wintering grounds further south. </p>
      <p><img src="../photogallery/whooping-crane.jpg" alt="whooping crane" width="200" height="169" hspace="5" align="left" />On the Saskatchewan River we will see tens of thousands of Sandhill Cranes gathering on gravel beds to roost in the evening. The sight and sound of thousands of cranes coming in to roost will be unforgettable. We will spend a considerable time looking for one of the world's rarest birds, the Whooping Crane. Each fall, small family groups head south towards the Gulf of Mexico from breeding grounds in the Northwest Territories , stopping at a few favorite feeding and resting areas in central Saskatchewan . Typical prairie species like Sharp-tailed Grouse, Gray Partridge, American White Pelican, Lapland Longspur, Horned Lark and raptors will be searched for and uncommon sparrows like Harris's and American Tree sparrows will be seen. Many wetlands and lakes will be scoured for shorebirds. A Saskatchewan flavor will be incorporated into this trip as well; we will enjoy fresh baked Saskatoon pies, visit historical prairie churches, and spend two nights in a hunting lodge. We will spend a morning at the Last Mountain bird banding station and enjoy the local songbirds from a new perspective. There may be a few lingering migrants here too. Our final full day of birding will be spent with the local birding society in Saskatoon . We will join them on their full day devoted to finding Whooping Cranes in the vicinity. </p>

  <p align="left" class="sidebarHeader">Itinerary</p>
  <p><strong>Day 1 </strong>- <strong>Wednesday, September 28</strong></p>
  <p>Travel day. Arrive in Saskatoon in afternoon and meet at hotel. We may go birding at locations within the city in the late afternoon. Night in Saskatoon .</p>
  <p><strong>Day 2 </strong>- <strong>Thursday, September 29</strong></p>
  <p>Today's "day-loop" will take us south and southeast of Saskatoon , ending in the early evening at the South Saskatchewan River , near Outlook. Here we will see thousands of Sandhill Cranes coming in to roost on the river beds. We first head for the Bradwell area, where there are said to be over 20 lakes and wet areas, thus a lot of waterfowl. From there we drive south through the Allen Hills , and then west towards the Blackstrap Reservoir and Blackstrap Provincial Park . We will search the fields to the east of the lake for Lapland Longspur and Horned Lark. We will bird the park and scan the lake from both the south and north dikes. From there we head south towards Hanley, then west towards Outlook. Time permitting we could explore the reservoir at Broderick, which is 2 km south of there. At Outlook, we will bird the river around the bridge, then head to our vantage point north of outlook and wait for the Sandhill Cranes to come in. We will then return to Saskatoon and spend the night.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 3 </strong> - <strong>Friday, September 30</strong></p>
  <p>We set out from Saskatoon going east towards Wadena and the Quill Lakes area. We will stop for lunch in Leroy, an old fashioned prairie town very typical of rural Saskatchewan . From Leroy, we head towards Wadena over country roads, birding all the way. Whooping Cranes may be seen today as we explore these back roads. Time permitting we will explore the Wadena Wetlands. Night in Wadena.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 4 </strong> - <strong>Saturday, October 1</strong></p>
  <p>Our birding will be centered at the Quill Lakes . Highlites today will include both Harris's and American Tree Sparrows and Sharp-tailed Grouse. In the morning we will explore the north end of Little Quill and Middle Quill, then in the afternoon the south end of Little Quill. This is the area where tens of thousands of Snow Geese, Ross's Geese and Canada Geese come into the lake between 10 AM and noon to roost for a while. Given the right weather conditions, this can be a spectacular sight. There are accessible areas along the lake shore where shorebirds are a good possibility. At the south end we will hike for a few kilometers along shelterbelts which often hold late songbird migrants. Night in Wadena.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 5 </strong> - <strong>Sunday, October 2</strong></p>
  <p>We sadly leave Wadena, the goose capital of the world, and head south and west towards Govan, the Whooping Crane capital of the world. We bird all the way, through some interesting countryside and may visit one or more historical churches as we go. After getting our Whooping Crane pins at Govan, we will head for Last Mountain National Wildlife Refuge. If the bird banding station is still open when we get to the park, we will visit it. If not, we will bird the park which often still has lingering passerines. In 2000, the group saw a Cape May Warbler here! From there we will bird the north and west sides of Last Mountain, climb the viewing tower, and time permitting, follow the guided trail. Should we have energy to burn, we may wish to come back in the later afternoon to the north end to see the Snow Geese and some Ross's Geese come in to the fields to eat. Return to Saskatoon for night.</p>
  <p><strong>Day 6 </strong> - <strong>Monday, October 3</strong></p>
  <p>We will join a local birding society in Saskatoon on a field trip and search for more Whooping Cranes. Night in Saskatoon .</p>
  <p><strong>Day 7 </strong> - <strong>Tuesday, October 4</strong></p>
  <p>Tour concludes in Saskatoon today. If your flight doesn't leave until the afternoon, join us for brunch at the Berry Barn, famous for its pancakes and waffles with heaps of Saskatoon berries on top.</p>
  ** NOTE - This itinerary may be altered once we arrive in Saskatchewan depending on recent sightings of Whooping Cranes in the area. <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></div>
