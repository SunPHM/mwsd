<P ALIGN=CENTER>This parcel was not so much a postage stamp as a large knife
blade shaped wedge.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="prairiesketchbook6.jpg" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Only on the way back from that distant field, out of breath
and huffling a bit, did I look</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>down and begin to notice some of the nuance of what I was
tromping across. It lead me to</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>the next sketch: What if our piece wasn't totally revealed
in a tall grass landscape. Suppose the</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>wing of a crane was all that was seen from a distance in
a mid-summer landscape. When you got closer</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>you saw something like this (on the right below).</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>A Sandhill Crane mounted on a steel canvas. Part of the
body of the crane might be cut out of the steel so that the landscape could
be seen through the art. A collaborative element might be the decorating
of the steel canvas with images from field sketchbooks of conference attendees.
Some of those images of plants, or animal icons could also be cut out of
the steel. &quot;Color&quot; and patina would be supplied by the landscape.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Perhaps the piece would be supported by a base of cleared
field stones (above left photo).</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>The Sandhill to me seemed like the perfect poster bird for
the coexistance of the varied landscapes.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>It was comfortable in original prairie, but now thrives
in the stubble and puddles of farm fields. You can see</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>that I used that fence post idea as a sort of Stonehenge
type circle around the piece.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Later feedback from almost everyone gave me second thoughts
about this, so I scratched it.</P>
