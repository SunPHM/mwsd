<H2>Thursday</H2>
<P CLASS="dateline">Thu Apr&nbsp;20 2000</P>

<P>Thursday, I was ambivalent about my plan.  I'd decided to stay in 
   Takamatsu, to go to an attraction called 
   <A HREF="http://www.Shikokumura.or.jp/">Shikoku-mura</A>.
   It sounded like a mostly-inside activity, and I was considering rain
   potential. However, Shikoku-mura sounded 
   like a tourist trap, and I was still reeling from the 
   horror of Tokushima Taikenkan.

   Yashima plain. Second photo: on the walk to Shikoku-mura, going 
   through a less-dense part of town, I saw this 
   pretty veggie garden.
</DIV>

<P>Because it wasn't raining right then, I decided to walk instead 
   of taking the train.  I walked through the ferry dock area, 
   snapping pictures of boats.  I walked through the outskirts 
   of town, amongst walled yards and vegetable gardens, hopping 
   over ditches.  I walked until I reached the general area of 
   Shikoku-mura, which I never found.  My travel guide 
   said it was "at the bottom of Yashima Hill," "around seven minutes 
   north of Yashima station."  Yashima Hill isn't just some little 
   hillock.  It's this big plateau.  Its base must be tens of clicks 
   around.  In ancient days, <EM CLASS="foreign">samurai</EM> 
   went riding horses across 
   the top of the plateau to beat up on one another.  So this place 
   was at the bottom of this hill; that didn't narrow things down a 
   whole lot.  "seven minutes north of Yashima station"--did the 
   guide mean the Kotoden line's Yashima station, mentioned in the 
   previous paragraph?  Or did they mean the JR Yashima station?  
   Usually if you name a station without mentioning the train line, 
   the default train line is JR.

<P>I didn't know where the 
   JR Yashima train station was.  I though it was more 
   than seven minutes' walk from the base of Yashima Hill, but then 
   I never found Shikoku-Mura, so maybe I didn't know the local geography 
   that well.  The main local tourist attraction was Yashima itself.
   I looked for Shikoku-Mura advertisements at the place where tourists 
   could catch overhead-cable-cars to the top of the hill.  I found 
   one painted sign, flaked and faded, that could have been such an 
   advertisement, but it was in such bad shape that I couldn't tell 
   what it was saying.</P>

<P>Yes, Shikoku-mura's web site has an 
   <A HREF="http://www.Shikokumura.or.jp/gaiyo/gaiyo.html">access map</A> 
   which would have cleared up at least some ambiguity.  If there had 
   been an internet cafe around, maybe I would have found 
   their site instead of just figuring <EM>screw it</EM> and wandering 
   around back streets along roads lined with fruit trees.  

<P><IMG SRC="pht_taka_orchard.jpg" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="200"
        ALT="[Photo: Orchard]"><BR>
   I stuck together these two photos of the orchard area.

<P>They were very pretty trees with happy chirpy birds and a cool breeze 
   and a 
   cool gray sky (which is nice if you're a San Franciscan who likes fog
   more than sun), and I suspect that I liked them more than I 
   would have liked Shikoku-mura, so I don't regret not having 
   found it.  

<P>I also walked through some dockyard areas.  I looked at ships 
   and boats and warehouses.  I got my first close-up look at one of those 
   barges with a crane on it that looks bigger than the boat itself, 
   and saw how it lowered supports (presumably) to the harbor 
   floor to steady itself.  I saw some black buses with loudspeakers 
   which no doubt spent most of their time trundling Takamatsu's 
   streets, spewing brain-dead nationalistic rhetoric.

<H2>The Skateboard Park of My Undoing</H2>

   Friendly dog at the skateboard park.
</DIV>



<P><A NAME="skatepark">And</A> 
   then I found the skateboard park.  It was named "Asahi Green 
   Park," I think. I feel like I should give 
   directions to get there, though they won't be very good.  
   If you head East from 
   the railroad station along Seto-Ohashi boulevard, you'll 
   intersect a street which is labelled North Nippon Road (in Japanese).
   Go North on this street.  When you find the 5-story Sharp building, 
   look around.  You should see a park.  But not a park full of trees 
   (though there are some).  It's a park with ramps and rails and other 
   things to skateboard on.  There was also an area with pavement painted 
   cyan-blue, which was apparently supposed to be some kind of monument.
   Mostly, I was just pleased to see the skateboard park.

<P>It obviously affected me deeply.  A couple of weeks later, back 
   in San Francisco, I ran into my friend 
   <A HREF="http://euler.slu.edu/Dept/Faculty/clair/">Bryan</A>'s 
   dad at a cafe.
   He showed me some photos from his recent trip to Barcelona.  It was 
   my first time seeing the works of Antonio Gaudi, and I just blurted 
   out, "This guy should have been designing skateboard parks!"

<P>The declaration goes, "Skateboarding is Not a Crime," but 
   really, in many places, skateboarding is a crime.  (Lots 
   of buildings fronted by wide stone staircases will post signs 
   forbidding skateboarders.  If some kids want to destroy the 
   stone stairway of a public edifice with their skateboards, 
   I'm in favor of the idea. What are those stone stairways for, anyhow?
   Are they to impress people?  Why do the people inside that edifice 
   want to set themselves apart like that?)  To make matters worse, 
   many communities outlaw skateboarding in many areas--and then don't 
   give kids a place to skateboard.  

<P>Santa Fe had a little teeny-tiny skateboard park.  They maybe had a clue, 
   those Santa Fe people.  That little skatepark maybe would have kept two or 
   three skaters busy at a time.  Takamatsu's park was much bigger, and 
   seemed to have been reasonably well thought out.  There weren't any 
   skaters there when I was there--this was the middle of a school day.
   But there was someone walking a nice dog.  I sat on a bench, rested, 
   pet the dog, sat some more.

<P>Things didn't really get ugly until I left the park.  I was at the 
   end of the park furthest from the street.  Next to the park was 
   what appeared to be an undeveloped field.  I decided to take a 
   shortcut, cutting through the field diagonally.  I'd got about 
   halfway through when I saw that this shortcut wouldn't work--there 
   was a wide ditch around most of this field.  The wide ditch would 
   prevent me from reaching the street.  So I turned around and started 
   walking back to the skatepark.  Behind me, I heard barking.  
   I looked back--some dogs had scampered up out of the ditch.  Now 
   they were walking behind me, barking and growling, trying to herd 
   me away.  I'd been walking away anyhow, but now I got my back up.
   Who were these dogs to say I couldn't walk into that ditch?  I 
   started to walk towards the dogs.  They started to back away.  Ha!
   That was better.  As long as we were all clear on who was in command 
   of the situation.  I once again started to head back towards the 
   skatepark.

<DIV CLASS="illoright" STYLE="width: 300px;">
     <IMG SRC="pht_taka_skate_rail.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="200"
        ALT="[Photo: Skateboard Park]"><BR>
   Skateboard park facilities included ramps and angled rails.
</DIV>

<P>Having escaped the field, I now started walking through the skatepark
   Trudge, trudge.  Then I heard the barking off to the side.  Those dogs 
   had noticed me again.  My route through the skatepark was close to 
   that field.  The dogs, still in the field, had spotted me and had 
   decided to harass me.  Now there was a deep ditch in between me and 
   them.  Really, I could have ignored them, just kept walking.  I did 
   keep walking, but I didn't ignore them.  I looked at them, jutted out 
   my chin, and started to make faces at them.  I didn't look down at my 
   feet, and really, what would have been the point?  When the pain 
   exploded in my shin, I didn't need to look down to figure out what 
   had happened--I'd slammed my shin into a low rail, a rail low enough 
   for beginning skateboarders to hop onto.

</DIV>


<P>I didn't break anything, but I think I got close.  
   It was a pretty good kick.  I didn't dare sit down: I couldn't
   have willed myself back up to my feet.  
   Instead, I just walked along, teary and sniffling.
   Fortunately, I already had plenty of hobbling experience this 
   trip, and was able to keep walking.  After a while, the 
   pain settled down to a dull throb and I was able to start 
   looking at the world around me again.

<P>There was a guy on a skateboard, perhaps heading to the park.
   There was a poster for that Chow Yun Fat/Mark Wahlberg movie 
   I'd seen; in Japan they were calling it NYPD 15-minute something.
   I sat and ate at Cafe Tivoli under the Station Hotel, 
   where they served <EM CLASS="foreign">edamame</EM> (soybeans).
   And then I went back to my room.

<H2>Recovery</H2>

<P>I spent the rest of the afternoon in my room with my leg up.
   In my room, I spent some time contemplating the calendar on the wall.
   It was photos of Route 66.  The captions were in Japanese.
   I didn't understand them, except for those which phonetically 
   spelled out <EM CLASS="foreign">Yo quiero Taco Bell</EM>.  I tried not to 
   think about how long it had been since I'd had Mexican food.
   I hobbled out for dinner, again at the bland-but-relatively-excellent
   Spice Kingdom.  As I exited, the Indian staff said "Na-MAST-uh".  The 
   ending strange--I always thought that "<EM CLASS="foreign">namaste</EM>" 
   rhymed with "fast day".
   Was this a Japanese accent?  I didn't ask.

<P>I was glad to return and lie down and sleep.  

<H2>Faster than a Ferry</H2>

   I didn't get any exterior pictures of the Seto-Ohashi Bridge; I was on it.
   Fortunately, I got this postcard.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if this 
   postcard actually shows the Seto-Ohashi bridge.  It's labelled 
   "Iwakurojima Bridge and Hisuishijima Bridge".  I'm guessing that those 
   are two parts of the Seto-Ohashi Bridge, but what do I know?
</DIV>

<P CLASS="dateline">Fri Apr&nbsp;21 2000</P>

<P>I was awake at 5:00.  After washing, I loafed around in my room for 
   a few hours, waiting for the trains to Okayama to start running.
   (When I actually got to the station, I would get the impression 
    that they'd been running for a while--perhaps my schedule didn't list 
    all trains.  Anyhow.)

<P>I caught the Marine Liner to Okayama, going across the Seto-Ohashi 
   bridge.  This bridge crosses the inland sea, so you might think I'm 
   going to spend the next couple of paragraphs gushing about the view, 
   but we didn't spend much time over the water and really it was 
   nothing special.  Apparently the track-layers were worried that my 
   senses might be overwhelmed by the view, because they made sure 
   that I spent the next few minutes in tunnels.
   When it wasn't in tunnels, it was boring countryside. 
   Flat countryside.  I spotted
   a golf driving range from 15 klicks away.  At the Okayama train 
   station, I put my two bags in perhaps the last two empty coin lockers.

<H2>Just another Okayama Tourist</H2>

   Crane-viewing bridge at Koraku-en, with crane (you can just barely see it). Okayama castle, 
   from far away. (I didn't get any closer; it was raining.)
</DIV>

<P>There's a famous garden in Okayama, Koraku-en.  It's plenty
   pretty.  I had a nice time there, though I got rained on.  There were 
   cranes in cages, which seemed pointless.  There was a water wheel, 
   a waterwheel that wasn't hooked up to anything.  It seemed like a 
   case of engineering for engineering's sake.  Really, not much happened 
   in the garden.  I mean, I can try and make sheltering from the 
   rain sound dramatic, but I think I already tried to do that once 
   this travelogue.  I could whine about walking around with a mauled 
   shin, but I've done enough injury whining.

<P>I splashed back to the station area, checked into a hotel, retrieved 
   my bags from the station, dropped them off in my room.
