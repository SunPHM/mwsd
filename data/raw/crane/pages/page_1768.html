        The Whooping Crane is the tallest North American bird. Males, which may 
        approach 1.5 meters in height, are larger than females. Adults are snowy 
        white except for black primary feathers on the wings and a bare red face 
        and crown. The bill is a dark olive-gray, which becomes lighter during 
        the breeding season. The eyes are yellow and the legs and feet are gray-black. 
        Immature cranes are a reddish cinnamon color that results in a mottled 
        appearance as the white feather bases extend. The juvenile plumage is 
        gradually replaced through the winter months and becomes predominantly 
        white by the following spring as the dark red crown and face appear. Yearlings 
        achieve the typical adult appearance by late in their second summer or 
        fall. The life span is estimated to be 22 to 24 years in the wild. Whooping 
        Cranes are omnivorous feeders. They feed on insects, frogs, rodents, small 
        birds, minnows, and berries in the summer. In the winter, they focus on 
        predominantly animal foods, especially blue crabs and clams. They also, 
        forage for acorns, snails, crayfish and insects in upland areas.</b></font></p>

        AND DEVELOPMENT: Whooping Cranes are monogamous and form lifelong pair 
        bonds but will remate following the death of a mate. Whooping Cranes return 
        to the same breeding territory in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, 
        in April and nest in the same general area each year. They construct nests 
        of bulrush and lay one to three eggs, (usually two) in late April and 
        early May. The incubation period is about 29 to 31 days. Whooping Cranes 
        will renest if the first clutch is lost or destroyed before mid-incubation. 
        Both sexes share incubation and brood-rearing duties. Despite the fact 
        that most pairs lay two eggs, seldom does more than one chick reach fledging. 
        Autumn migration begins in mid-September, and most birds arrive on the 
        wintering grounds of Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the Texas Gulf 
        Coast by late-October to mid-November. Whooping Cranes migrate singly, 
        in pairs, in family groups or in small flocks, and are sometimes accompanied 
        by Sandhill Cranes. They are diurnal migrants, stopping regularly to rest 
        and feed, and use traditional migration staging areas. On the wintering 
        grounds, pairs and family groups occupy and defend territories. Subadults 
        and unpaired adult Whooping Cranes form separate flocks that use the same 
        habitat but remain outside occupied territories. Subadults tend to winter 
        in the area where they were raised their first year, and paired cranes 
        often locate their first winter territories near their parents' winter 
        territory. Spring migration is preceded by dancing, unison calling, and 
        frequent flying. Family groups and pairs are the first to leave the refuge 
        in late-March to mid-April.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">Juveniles 
        and subadults return to summer in the vicinity of their natal area, but 
        are chased away by the adults during migration or shortly after arrival 
        on the breeding grounds. Only one out of four hatched chicks survive to 
        reach the wintering grounds. Whooping Cranes generally do not produce 
        fertile eggs until age 4.</font></b></p>

        AND POPULATION LEVEL:<br>
        Historic: The historic range of the Whooping Crane once extended from 
        the Arctic coast south to central Mexico, and from Utah east to New Jersey, 
        into South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The historic breeding range 
        once extended across the north-central United States and in the Canadian 
        provinces, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. A separate non-migratory 
        breeding population occurred in southwestern Louisiana.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">Aransas/Wood 
        Buffalo Population: The current nesting range of the self-sustaining natural 
        wild population is restricted to Wood Buffalo National Park in Saskatchewan, 
        Canada and the current wintering grounds of this population are restricted 
        to the Texas Gulf Coast at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and vicinity, 
        is experiencing a gradual positive population trend overall, although 
        some years exhibit stationary or negative results. In January, 2000, there 
        were 187 individuals in the flock, including 51 nesting pairs.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">Rocky 
        Mountain Experiment: In 1975, an effort to establish a second, self-sustaining 
        migratory flock was initiated by transferring wild Whooping Crane eggs 
        from Wood Buffalo National Park to the nests of greater Sandhill Cranes 
        at Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho. This Rocky Mountain population 
        peaked at only 33 birds in 1985. The experiment terminated in 1989 because 
        the birds were not pairing and the mortality rate was too high to establish 
        a self-sustaining population. In 1997, the remaining birds in the population 
        were designated as experimental, nonessential to allow for greater management 
        flexibility and to begin pilot studies on developing future reintroduction 
        methods. In 2001, there were only two remaining Whooping Cranes in this 
        population.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399"><img src="/Issues03/Co03082003/Art/Whooper65.jpg" width="198" height="300" alt="Whooping Crane - age 65 days" align="right">Captive 
        Populations: As of March, 2001, there were 120 captive Whooping Cranes 
        held at six facilities. Four facilities: Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, 
        International Crane Foundation, Calgary Zoo, and San Antonio Zoo have 
        successful breeding programs. Currently, the remaining facilities, Lowry 
        Park Zoo and Audubon Institute house cranes for rehabilitative and educational 
        purposes. Chicks produced at the captive facility either remain in captivity 
        to maintain the health and genetic diversity of the captive flock, or 
        are reared for release to the wild in the experimental reintroduction 
        programs.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">Florida 
        Experimental Nonessential Population: An experimental reintroduction of 
        Whooping Cranes in Florida was initiated in 1993 to establish a non-migratory 
        population at Kissimmee Prairie. A nonmigratory population avoids the 
        hazards of migration, and by inhabiting a more geographically limited 
        area than migratory cranes, individuals can more easily find compatible 
        mates. Since 1993, 233 isolation-reared Whooping Cranes have been released 
        in the area. In Spring 2000, there were 65 individuals in the project 
        area with 10 pairs defending territories and evidence of the first successful 
        hatching of chicks. Annual releases of chicks are expected to continue 
        to augment this new experimental population.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">Eastern 
        Migratory Population: A second experimental nonessential population is 
        proposed for development in eastern United States. The intent is to establish 
        a migratory flock which would summer and breed in Wisconsin, migrate across 
        the eastern U.S. and winter in west-central Florida. The birds would be 
        taught the migration route by following ultralight aircraft. Initial experiments 
        using Sandhill Cranes, completed in the Fall of 2000, successfully led 
        11 cranes 1,250 miles from Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in Wisconsin 
        to Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in Florida. The birds will 
        remain in Florida throughout the winter and are expected to migrate back 
        to Wisconsin on their own in the Spring.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">HABITAT: 
        The nesting area in Wood Buffalo National Park is a poorly drained region 
        interspersed with numerous potholes. Bulrush is the dominant emergent 
        in the potholes used for nesting. On the wintering grounds at Aransas 
        National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, Whooping Cranes use the salt marshes 
        that are dominated by salt grass, saltwort, smooth cordgrass, glasswort, 
        and sea ox-eye. They also forage in the interior portions of the refuge, 
        which are gently rolling, sandy, and are characterized by oak brush, grassland, 
        swales, and ponds. Typical plants include live oak, redbay, Bermuda grass, 
        and bluestem. The non-migratory, Florida release site at Kissimmee Prairie 
        includes flat, open palmetto prairie interspersed with shallow wetlands 
        and lakes. The primary release site has shallow wetlands characterized 
        by pickerel weed, nupher, and maiden cane. Other habitats include dry 
        prairie and flatwoods with saw palmetto, various grasses, scattered slash 
        pine, and scattered strands of cypress. Areas selected for the proposed 
        eastern migratory experimental population closely mimic habitat of the 
        naturally occurring wild population in Canada and Texas.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399"><img src="/Issues03/Co03082003/Art/Whooper1yr.jpg" width="200" height="300" alt="Whooping Crane - age 1 year" align="right">REASONS 
        FOR CURRENT STATUS: The Whooping Crane population, estimated at 500 to 
        700 individuals in 1870 declined to only 16 individuals in the migratory 
        population by 1941 as a consequence of hunting and specimen collection, 
        human disturbance, and conversion of the primary nesting habitat to hay, 
        pastureland, and grain production. The main threat to Whooping Cranes 
        in the wild is the potential of a hurricane or contaminant spill destroying 
        their wintering habitat on the Texas coast. Collisions with power lines 
        and fences are known hazards to wild Whooping Cranes. The primary threats 
        to captive birds are disease and parasites. Bobcat predation has been 
        the main cause of mortality in the Florida experimental population.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#003399">MANAGEMENT 
        AND PROTECTION: The self-sustaining wild population is protected on public 
        lands in the nesting area at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and 
        on the principal wintering area at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in 
        Texas. A major traditional migratory stopover is at Salt Plains National 
        Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. This population is closely monitored throughout 
        the nesting season, on the wintering grounds, and during migration. The 
        Canadian Wildlife Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are involved 
        in recovery efforts under a 1990 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), &quot;Conservation 
        of the Whooping Crane Related to Coordinated Management Activities.&quot; 
        All cranes within the Rocky Mountain, Florida non-migratory and proposed 
        eastern migratory nonessential, experimental population areas are fully 
        protected as a threatened species (instead of endangered), but other provisions 
        of the Endangered Species Act are relaxed to allow for greater management 
        flexibility as well as positive public support</font></b></p>
