<P><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="ffpic2.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="LASR - Green Heron - Great Bend, Kansas">A 19,000 acre wetland just 5 miles northeast of Great Bend is a concentration point for over 320 species of song birds, waterfowl and shorebirds. Migrating birds taking the Central Flyway stop to feed and rest at Cheyenne Bottoms including some endangered species such as the Whooping Crane which is why the area has been designated as a &quot;Wetlands of International Importance&quot;. </P>
<P>Migrating ducks and cranes reach their peak numbers in late March and early April; the peak for migrating shorebirds is late April to late May, although some start arriving in late March. Some of the waterfowl and shorebirds stay at the Bottoms throughout the summer.</P>
<P><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="ffpic3.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="LASR - American Avocet - Great Bend, Kansas">Whooping cranes migrate from Texas to Northern Canada and back. They are more frequently seen in the fall, but occasionally in the spring. Waterfowl can be seen throughout the year. During migration, numbers can climb to 250,000 ducks and geese. More bird species are seen at the Bottoms than anywhere else in Kansas. Of the 415 bird species known to Kansas, 320 species have been observed at Cheyenne Bottoms.</P>
