										It was my first day back from vacation when I found out that the ManateeCam was down. And after such precautions we've taken, it left a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. New camera with its own processor, backup battery for short power outages, two surge protectors, camera now automatically reboots if there is power loss, new 56K modem, and a new secure enclosure to keep the kids hands away. So what could possibly have happened to the ManateeCam now?!<br>
										We headed to the park to investigate, only to find a mess of rodent fesces atop that brand new modem. Our little furry friend was back, just after we thought it had lost interest in the cam, the mouse was at it again. Now, we've used a plastic bag to keep the modem and power cables from any moisture, but the mouse thought the bag was meant for him - as a snack. Twice. And that is when we decided, it's time for an upgrade. Not an upgrade for the camera, nor the modem; no fancy new wireless technology so that we wouldn't need cables, but rather a RubberMaid. That's right, we've upgraded our plastic bag to a RubberMaid. We now have another brand new modem and new power cables enclosed in a new, yet modified, RubberMaid to keep our furry little friends away.<br>
										I use the term 'friends' loosely, as they are the biggest problem for the ManateeCam right now so they're more like enemies. And it's plural because as of now two mice have been caught already and relocated. So there is more than just one mouse - which would explain the insatiable appetite for plastic bags.<br>
										The ManateeCam is up and running again, but for how long you may ask. That I could never answer with certainty; however, we will always be sure to overcome any obstacles to keep it online. To all of our loyal watchers, Thank you for your patience and we hope you continue to enjoy the Manatees.<br>

										The grand opening festivities for the completion of the second phase of the Wildlife Walk at Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park is set for March 27.<br>
										But the Florida black bears that moved into their new home, the final project in this phase of the park's improvements, have already had a private celebration of their own.<br>
										Art Yerian, the park's wildlife supervisor, said each 2-year-old bear partied in its own way on Sunday when they were released into their new digs. The female did somersaults across the grass; the male chilled out in the fountain.<br>
										Yerian said the previous bear exhibit was about one-fifth the size of the new one.<br>
										Other upgrades in this project include new cougar and bobcat exhibits, new reptile exhibits, the 1,700 square-foot Wildlife Encounters Pavilion, 1,020 feet of boardwalk, two bridges and new restrooms.<br>
										At the new pavilion, which seats 175 people, park staff offer manatee and wildlife education programs throughout the day. The pavilion was completed in February.<br>

						<i>By Terry Witt</i> for Citrus County Chronicle - 2/28/2004<br>
						<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Citrus, Hernando and Levy county numbers high<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">A state scientist on Friday said the annual Florida manatee count found fewer of the animals in state waters than in the previous year, but the numbers are not an indication of a population trend.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Dr. Holly Edwards said the Feb. 20 synoptic survey counted 2,568 manatees, or 545 less than last year, but the survey is considered only a rough count of the state manatee population.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">The aerial survey found 348 manatees living in Citrus, Hernando and Levy counties' waters this year, more than in 2003 when the state conducted three manatee surveys and found 265, 283 and 219 manatees respectively living in the three counties.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Edwards, a manatee biologist for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the manatee numbers this year are consistent with a statewide trend for higher counts in northern counties.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">In some years, FWC does multiple surveys. Other years, the agency conducts one or two surveys. And, in 1993 and 1994, there were no surveys.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Edwards said she agreed with the main thrust of a Feb. 25 opinion column published by the Save the Manatee Club on the organization's Web site, which cautioned people against attaching too much significance to the state's survey numbers.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">&quot;In a general sense the synoptic survey serves a purpose in giving us a general estimate, a rough count, but because it fluctuates so much it doesn't give us an estimate of the manatee population,&quot; Edwards said.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Edwards, a manatee biologist for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said weather conditions affect the survey.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">She said a cold winter with long periods of cool weather can raise the counts, especially if they occur on calm, sunny days when water temperatures have dropped quickly.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">The quick drop in temperature forces manatees to congregate in warm water areas such as springs and power plant discharge canals.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Officials with the Save the Manatee Club say the state has no accurate count of the manatee population, and Edwards said that is true. She said the highest survey count was 3,276, which is considered the minimum number living in state waters. It is the minimum because the state assumes that not every manatee was counted.<br>
					</font><font face="arial" size="2">Edwards said the state is conducting a study in the Tampa Bay area to improve the survey methods. She said the state may decide in the future to use more than one survey method or switch to an entirely new approach.<br>
