      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1990, the Washington 
        Wildlife Commission adopted procedures for listing and de-listing species 
        as endangered, threatened, or sensitive and for writing recovery and management 
        plans for listed species (WAC <a href="http://search.leg.wa.gov/wslwac/WAC%20232%20%20TITLE/WAC%20232%20-%2012%20%20CHAPTER/WAC%20232%20-%2012%20-297.htm" target="_blank">232-12-297</a>, 
        Appendix A). The procedures, developed by a group of citizens, interest 
        groups, and state and federal agencies, require preparation of recovery 
        plans for species listed as threatened or endangered. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recovery, as defined 
        by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is “the process by which the decline 
        of an endangered or threatened species is arrested or reversed, and threats 
        to its survival are neutralized, so that its long-term survival in nature 
        can be ensured.” </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This document summarizes 
        the historic and current distribution and abundance of sandhill cranes 
        in Washington and describes factors affecting the population and its habitat. 
        It prescribes strategies to recover the species, such as protecting the 
        population, evaluating and managing habitat, and initiating research and 
        education programs. Target population objectives and other criteria for 
        reclassification are identified and an implementation schedule is presented. 
        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft state recovery 
        plan for the sandhill crane was reviewed by researchers and state and 
        federal agencies. This review was followed by a 90-day public comment 
        period. All comments received were considered in preparation of this the 
        final recovery plan. For additional information about sandhill cranes

        </b></font><img src="graphics/sandhillcrane.jpg" width="200" height="280" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="9" alt="Sandhill Crane" border="2">The
        sandhill crane (<em>Grus canadensis</em>) has been listed as an endangered species by the state of Washington since 1981. Sandhill
cranes are represented in Washington by a small number of greater sandhills that breed in Klickitat and
Yakima Counties, about 23,000 lesser sandhills that stop in eastern Washington during migration, and 3,000-
4,000 sandhills (Canadians and possibly some lessers and greaters) that stop on lower Columbia River
bottomlands. Up to 1,000 sandhills have wintered on lower Columbia bottomlands in recent years, but most
of the cranes seen in Washington winter in California. The greater sandhill cranes that breed in Washington
are part of the Central Valley Population, so called because they winter in California’s Central Valley. Other
members of this population nest in Oregon, California, Nevada, and interior British Columbia. The lesser
sandhill cranes are of the Pacific Flyway Population that stop during migration on the way to breeding
grounds in Alaska or wintering areas in California. The Canadian sandhill cranes have not been defined as
a population, and recent studies of the mid-continent population suggest that they may not differ genetically
from greaters. Some breed along the coast of central British Columbia and winter in Washington, while
some stop during migration en route to wintering areas in California. Further studies are needed to clarify
their status and distribution.

<p>The historical distribution of breeding cranes in Washington was poorly documented, but the few historical
accounts mention breeding in south-central, northeastern and southeastern regions, and the southern Puget
Sound Basin. Crane numbers had been severely reduced due to widespread habitat destruction concurrent
with human settlement, and perhaps more importantly, unregulated hunting which continued until passage
of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1916. The species was extirpated as a breeder from the state after
1941 when the last nest was documented at Signal Peak, Yakima County, in south-central Washington. Some
31 years later, they were again found summering in the Glenwood Valley on Conboy Lake National Wildlife
Refuge, Klickitat County in 1972, but it was not until 1979 that nesting was confirmed. A total of 19
territorial pairs was documented in 2000: 16 at Conboy Lake National Wildlife Refuge; and 1 each on
Yakama Indian Nation lands, Yakima County; Panakanic Valley, Klickitat County; and on Washington
Department of Natural Resource (WDNR) lands along Deer Creek, Yakima County. The total summer
population in Washington in 2000 was 53 birds. No nests produced chicks to fledging age in 2001, probably
due to factors relating to drought conditions; the total summer population was 50.

<p>Factors affecting Washington’s breeding greater sandhills include predation, incompatible grazing and
haying practices, water availability and management, and habitat loss. Crane habitat on the lower Columbia
bottomlands between Vancouver and Woodland is threatened with industrial development, conversion of
agricultural lands to cottonwood plantations, tree nurseries, or other incompatible uses and crane use is
affected by disturbance by hunters and other recreationists.

<p>The goal of the recovery plan is to restore a healthy breeding population of cranes and to maintain the flocks
that winter or stop in Washington. To reach this goal, this plan calls for expansion of the breeding range of
greaters into former breeding areas in eastern Washington and protection of habitat for crane wintering and
staging during migration. The Plan identifies recovery objectives that must be reached, and outlines
strategies to use in meeting them before down-listing of the species to threatened or sensitive can occur.

<p>The sandhill crane will be considered for down-listing from State Endangered to State Threatened status
when the state’s overall breeding population reaches at least 65 territorial pairs with an average annual
recruitment rate of >8%, and effective water management control is established at Conboy Lake National
Wildlife Refuge. The sandhill crane will be considered for down-listing to State Sensitive when the state’s
breeding population reaches at least 130 territorial pairs with an average annual recruitment rate of >8%, and habitat used by cranes at the major staging sites in eastern Washington is protected through management
agreements or easements. Also, for down-listing to sensitive, habitat needed to maintain 2,000 migrant and
500 wintering cranes should be secured and managed for cranes on the lower Columbia River bottomlands
in Washington. Recovery objectives may need to be updated as better information is available about habitat
needs.
