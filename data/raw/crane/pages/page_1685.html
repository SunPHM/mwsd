such as a&nbsp; square, a triangle, or a circle&nbsp; is inherently more rigid
against torsion than a beam with a section such as an I or H. By making a
beam out of short sections with wide flanges or closed walls at the ends, a
bridge can be assembled by bolting or welding such sections end to end. Such a bridge can be cantilevered out from the piers.
        When the ends meet,
and are joined, with suitable adjustments of the stresses, the result can be a very
strong and rigid beam.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Unfortunately there is a problem with this
idea. When the beams are still at the cantilever stage, they are subjected
to stresses which may be quite different, and in some cases much greater, than the
ones they will experience after completion. This effect led to several
collapses of box girder bridges, at a time when the stresses were not so well
understood as they are now.</font>

        a box section looks very simple, difficulties arise in
calculating the stresses. With a structure composed entirely of straight
and narrow members joined by hinges it is tedious, rather than difficult, to
calculate all the forces. But&nbsp; in a structure in which the parts have
        siginficant size in two or three dimensions, the forces vary in a complicated way throughout
each part. Until fast computers with large memories became available,
exact calculation was difficult. During construction, box girders often
        act as cantilevers, and with cranes at the extremities they are
        subjected to large bending moments at the piers.</font>

picture shows a part of the box-girder bridge which carries the A477 road over
the Cleddau estuary near Pembroke Dock. During construction, in 1970, one span
buckled and collapsed, killing four people. Note the slight taper of the piers, which improves the appearance of the
bridge. Note the cross section of the spans, which brings the forces from
the deck down into the piers. A rectangular section with wider piers would
have looked very different.</font></p>

of the West Gate bridge over the Yarra river, Melbourne, collapsed with the loss
of 35 lives. <a href="http://www.istructe.org.uk/technical/index.asp?page=47">This
        page</a> includes photograph of the Milford Haven collapse and a short
        explanation.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20" align="left"><font face="Verdana">The basic point
        here is that a rod or plate in compression is inherently less stable
        than in tension. Should there be a deviation from the correct
        shape, tension will tend to straighten it out, but compression will tend
        to make it worse, and the transition is often catastrophically quick,
        though there may be warning signs, as in the case of the Quebec bridge,
        which also failed in compression. More than that, deviations from
        the ideal can be more subtle than simple curvature of the plates: forces
        may be slightly eccentric, and there may be internal deviations from the
        ideal, such as remanent stresses from manufacture or from welding the
        parts together. A simple act like welding a stiffener, which is
        intended to strengthen the structure, may make it worse if the welding
        is badly performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p style="margin: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana">Theoretical
        calculation, too, may be problematical. The pages about beams show
        how much the forces vary within a simple rectangular beam: in a box
        section with many cells and many stiffening flanges, calculation is
        extremely difficult, even when perfection is assumed. Add to
        this the deviations inherent in practical building, and the modes of
        failure predicted by the sums may be wildly different from what happens
        in practice. Worse still, the calculations may predict failure to
        fail when failing is what happens.</font></p>

        failures mentioned earlier, and other more or less contemporary collapses brought box-girders into some
disrepute. In fact, during the early stages of development, other types of
bridge have also caused problems.&nbsp; In the early years of the American railroads,
a number of trusses collapsed, sometimes under a train. One half of the
Quebec bridge collapsed during construction, and after two cantilevers of a
stronger design had been successfully built, the suspended span fell into the
river while it was being lifted into position.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="3"> Several suspension bridges
have been damaged or destroyed because of wind-induced oscillation, and even
because of marching soldiers. Box-girder design is now much better
understood, and many elegant steel structures have been built. As well as
        metal boxes, numerous
concrete bridges also use hollow sections, held together with stressing wires to
        prevent tension from affecting the concrete.</font></p>

        cantilever without collapsing. With the concave side down, it
        collapses at a much lower span.&nbsp; Can you see why? The
        collapse near the support is typical, because that is where the bending
        moment is greatest. The first Quebec bridge did the same thing,

        when the jib is extended. Note the lightweight truss that

        people argue that form must follow function. Consider this
        box-girder bridge near Milford Haven. What function is the form to
        follow?&nbsp; At each pier the shear stress changes polarity, and the
        bending moment changes quite sharply too. Although the outward
        appearance of the beam shows no sign of it, the structure must have
        internal parts that distribute the forces from the pier to the bridge. But how could the shape express that?
        Consider another function -
        the requirement to enable vehicles to cross with minimal disturbance to
        their itinerary. This bridge, and many others with longer and
        higher spans, express this function very well indeed; the box-girder
        sweeps across the estuary without interruption or deviation.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana">The first box girder
        (actually tubular) bridges were designed by Robert Stephenson, for the
        Menai Straits and Conway. Both were for railway traffic, which is
        now a very unusual application for such bridges. But these old
        bridges were very deep, to resist the huge bending moments. Well
        designed and executed experiments were conducted in order to discover
        the strength of rectangular tubes. To resist the compression
        forces, the upper part of the Menai bridge was of cellular design.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana">The spans were built on land
        and lifted slowly into place, the masonry being built up under the ends,
        so that in the event of a problem, they could only fall a few
        inches. The four spans for each track were joined in such a way as
        to optimise the distribution of bending moments when the ends were set
        in their final positions. You could perhaps call this an early
        example of pre-stressing.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana">The next
        diagram shows the stages in building a box-girder bridge using a
        cantilever method. The sag has been exaggerated. The colours
        are blue for tension and red for compression. The picture at right shows (again exaggerated) what happens when the spans are
        connected. Note that there is still a small sag.</font></p>

        the second it has been twisted using a prop and a weight. In the
        next two pictures we see that the top of the box has been distorted into
        a parallelogram, the red diagonal being shortened, and the blue one
        stretched. The structure is not inherently very rigid. This
        means that plate girder spans, with two vertical planes and a horizontal
        plane, have to be prevent from twisting, usually by providing solid
        supports at all four corners. You have probably spotted the
        solution to the problem - provide diagonal members that resist the
        changes in length. Such a structure, upside down, provides a stiff
        span with a deck.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/BoxGirder688B.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="BoxGirder688B.jpg (143845 bytes)" width="80" height="66"></a>But
        why is the box so feeble against torsion? It seems to be a case
        where the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. In this
        picture, red and blue lines have been drawn, so suggest what happens
        when one strip of card is twisted. In order for the twist to be
        possible, either the top and bottom edges must stretch, or the centre
        line must shorten, or both must happen.&nbsp; In fact, all parts of the
        strip are changed by varying amounts. But the amount of strain at
        any point is very small compared with the overall twist, making the
        strip very flexible.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/BoxGirder690.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="BoxGirder690.jpg (116274 bytes)" width="80" height="60"></a><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/BoxGirder691.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="BoxGirder691.jpg (91346 bytes)" width="80" height="65"></a><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/BoxGirder693.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="BoxGirder693.jpg (78346 bytes)" width="80" height="55"></a><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/BoxGirder694.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="BoxGirder694.jpg (52974 bytes)" width="80" height="134"></a>But
        now we try a box with a top, making it closed all round. The first
        picture shows its comparative rigidity. In the second picture,
        half of the lid has been removed, and torsion occurs. The third
        picture shows how much, while the fourth shows that the parallelogram
        effect occurs, of course, only in the half with no lid. The
        torsion is uniform throughout the length, however, because of the shear
        stiffness of the sides in their own plane. That is the secret of
        the box - it uses the great resistance of sheets to shear in their own
        plane, as compared with their weakness in torsion. We've turned
        torsion into shear, and in shear, the local strain is very much greater
        compared with the overall deflection than it was in the case of torsion.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The
        models used here are very weak, but you can sometimes learn more about
        behaviour in this way than you can with strong ones, at least as regards
        first principles. But to examine the behaviour of real structures
        you need realistic models, and then the deflections may be so small that
        you need expensive equipment to measure them.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/B52NoseD.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="B52NoseD.jpg (101199 bytes)" width="80" height="62"></a>So
        that's it - a closed box is very much stiffer than an open one. The relationship between stress and strain is now linear and
        Hookean. Real box-girders have internal flanges and diaphragms, because no
        section of unsupported plate must be large enough for buckling to
        occur. Buckling is often the limitation before the elastic limit
        is reached. The picture shows the forward section of a B-52 at
        Duxford aircraft museum. The shear field is revealed by the
        diagonally rippled surface. In flight, the nose is lifted by aerodynamic
        forces, smoothing out the surface. The box or tube is a basic
        structure that is found in many aircraft and ground vehicles, as well as
        arthropod animals and many plants, in a great variety of shapes. See also the page about <a href="tubes.htm">tubes</a>.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 20"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Continuing
        the theme of containers, you can in fact learn quite a lot about about
        structures from articles in common use. Some cans of drink are
        very thin, yet they do their job well. Surprisingly heavy objects
        can be safely transported in cardboard boxes, especially when surrounded
        by closely fitting pieces of expanded polystyrene. The designers
        of packaging, by making use of the minimal quantity of material,
        contribute significantly to the economy. The efficiency of the
        designs reduces cost of materials, and the use of materials which may
        exist in finite amounts, and the saving in weight reduces transport
        costs.</font><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/Box736.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="Box736.jpg (73376 bytes)" width="80" height="50"></a><a href="http://www.brantacan.org.uk/Box737.jpg"><img border="0" src="ZYX_small.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=5 alt="Box737.jpg (74624 bytes)" width="80" height="50"></a>These
        two pictures show a simple plastic tray for holding food in a
        shop. It can take the weight of a large number of books with no
        sign of distress. Although the box has only four sides and a
        bottom, no top being provided, the slope of the sides ensures that there
        is no buckling, which might well occur with vertical sides. The
        many deviations of the&nbsp; surfaces from simple planes create the stiffness.</font></td>

would you expect to find the longest box-girder in the world? There is a
long one in the Humber Bridge in England, and a shorter, similar, one in the <a href="susptwo.htm">Severn
suspension bridge</a>, also in England. Similar suspension bridges with
box-girder spans are found over the Bosporus and
elsewhere. The streamlined box enabled the designers to achieve a narrow,
light structure which was rigid enough to resist torsional and flexural
oscillation, and at the same time avoiding the conversion of wind energy into
oscillation energy.</font></p>
