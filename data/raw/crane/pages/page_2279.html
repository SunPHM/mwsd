This is the story of Atu, an ancient civilization pioneer who fled Atlantis before its destruction. Entrusted with sacred knowledge that had been encoded in a set of tablets, Atu buries the tablets and begins a twelve and a half thousand year journey into the future looking for his future self that would be alive during a time when the tablets would be discovered. Atu must connect with this future self and guide him into remembering the tablets and how to decode them. In his search for this future life, Atu finds himself connecting with several of his other future selves and he begins to see karmic threads develop. Only by going through all those other lives can Atu understand that future life he was trying to reach. From the land of the Maya to Ancient Egypt to Ancient Persia to Europe during the plagues to Greece and Troy to the American South to the windswept plains of the Lakota, Atu journeys across history in search of himself. The first novel in the Rejuvenation Series. The second novel in the series is due out in 2005.

Once, long ago, the ruler of a mountainous Asian nation sought counsel from a Tibetan holy man on how he could help lead his people through change. The holy man gave the leader a magic flute that would drastically change his life. This is the story of that flute which led the leader on a journey of self-realization. The flute would eventually lead him to a young farm girl who had the most divine singing voice in the world. When she sang, people wept at the beauty of it and people were also healed. What happened when the flute, the leader, and the singing girl got together is an event of divine proportions. A very moving story.</b></font>

As humankind goes through a radical and massive shift in consciousness that original way of living is being remembered. Through his philosophical rambling and his heart warming storytelling, White Feather sheds light on that old way of living in joy, gently coaxing it out of the recesses of our soul memory. Through eloquence and humor, White Feather tweaks our perspectives in such a way as to make this shift in consciousness easier to see and understand and embrace. This is a collection of some of White Feather's most moving writings.</b>
