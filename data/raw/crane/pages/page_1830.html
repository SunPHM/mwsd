The whooping crane is an endangered species with a success story to tell. Their population hit an all time low
			in 1940 when there were only 22 cranes left in the wild. Their numbers have been steadily building, year-by-year
			and, as you'll read today, the comeback has broken all records this year.<BR>
			<BR>
			Each spring the entire flock of wild whooping cranes takes the annual 2,500 mile journey from their wintering grounds
			in Texas to their nesting grounds in northern Canada. They usually arrive in late April or early May, just as the
			ice and snow are melting from the marshes. <BR>
			<BR>
			Tom Stehn, Refuge Bilogist at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Austwell, Texas will provide updates this spring
			as the cranes begin their journey. <BR>
			When the migration is underway, weekly weather reports and migration news will be shared once again this year by
			Wally Jobman. Wally is based at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Grand Island, NE. Finally, from the
			far north, each spring Canadian biologist Brian Johns, of the Canadian Wildlife Service, shares the excitement
			when the cranes arrive once again on their ancient nesting grounds. We hope you enjoy traveling with the whooping
			cranes this spring!<FONT SIZE="4"><B><BR>

To: Journey North <BR>
			From: Tom Stehn<BR>
			Aransas National Wildlife Refuge<BR>
			Austwell, Texas</P>
			<P>Dear Journey North, <BR>
			It's been a RECORD season for the whooping cranes. (Count how many times I use the word record in this letter!)
			During the summer, a RECORD 51 nesting pairs produced a RECORD 58 chicks, including a RECORD 16 sets of twins.
			Although the usual high mortality occurred on the young chicks, by mid-August between 32 and 38 juveniles reached
			flight age, including two sets of twins.<BR>
			<BR>
			At Aransas, my weekly aerial counts in November and December as the flock arrived skyrocketed to 152 adults and
			30 juveniles for a RECORD total of 182 whoopers. The 30 juveniles in Texas is also a RECORD, surpassing the previous
			high of 28. Last winter, we had 160 whooping cranes, so the flock made a huge gain of 22 birds in one year.<BR>
			<BR>
			Especially exciting, one set of twins arrived safely. This is the first set of twins to reach Aransas since 1964.
			Starting in 1965, Canadian biologists visited nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and removed one egg from each
			two-egg nest.</P>

			<P>Since whooping cranes normally are only able to raise one chick, the population continued to grow even when
			the eggs were taken. In fact, researchers believe the rate of growth actually increased because biologists would
			ensure that each nest contained a healthy egg, sometimes swapping a good egg for a bad egg and giving the parents
			a second chance to hatch a chick. This egg pickup over the past 30 years has allowed biologists to start a captive
			breeding flock that now totals 114 whooping cranes.</P>

			<P>The captive flock is raising chicks of their own which are being transported to Florida and released to start
			a new non-migratory flock of whoopers. Why do you think the Florida whooping cranes wouldn't migrate up north during
			the summer? It is because parent cranes have to teach their &quot;children&quot; the migration route. The Florida
			whoopers were raised in captivity and thus stay in central Florida where they were released. <BR>
			<BR>
			Back to the egg pickup and the set of twins at Aransas this year. In the summer of 1997, the Whooping Crane Recovery
			Team decided that the captive flock was doing well enough so that we would no longer have to take any eggs out
			of Wood Buffalo. So in the very first year of leaving two eggs in every nest, one set of twins made it safely to
			Aransas. But this shows you how difficult it is to raise twin chicks since of the 16 sets of twins found in June,
			only one set survived through the fall migration. Normally, whooping cranes can raise twin chicks only 14% of the
			time. So this made it especially exciting when I saw for the first time in my 16 years at Aransas a set of twins.<BR>

The 30th juvenile to reach Texas this winter is not at Aransas. It is apparently a juvenile that got separated
			from its parents during the fall migration and followed sandhill cranes to the Texas coast. It was seen January
			22-24 about 100 miles north of Aransas near Brazoria, Texas. We don't know where it is now, but it WILL return
			to Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest Territories of Canada where it was hatched to find other whooping
			cranes.<BR>
			<BR>
			We also know about one other wayward bird in the flock. A whooping crane was sighted in mid-February on the Platte
			river in Nebraska. (<A HREF="/jnorth/spring1998/critters/crane/Update022498.html">See last week's News Flash</A>.)
			It presumably followed sandhills north to the Platte where thousands of sandhills &quot;stage&quot; for weeks,
			building up fat reserves for the migration. We don't know if the Platte whooper is one of the Aransas whooping
			cranes that started the migration early, or whether it possibly is a crane that wintered with sandhills someplace
			else. We have never had an Aransas whooping crane start the migration in February before. (Another RECORD?) A few
			birds sometimes leave in early March, but most of the whooping cranes won't depart until the last week in March
			or the first two weeks in April.</P>
			<P>Despite the very mild winter due to El Nino, the whooping cranes know not to leave too early or they will find
			nothing but ice and snow when they return to their nesting grounds in Canada. How do you think they &quot;know&quot;
			this?</P>
			<P>So despite the very warm winter, I think the timing of the whooping crane migration this spring will be similar
			to the way it always is. I wonder how other species are affected by mild winters. All the whooping cranes have
			survived the winter here so far and should be in good shape when they return to nest in Canada. I'll let you know
			when the birds start leaving.<BR>
