            Yard. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The track was originally 
            laid in 1971, prior to construction of the Museum building. The normal 
            deterioration that occurs, plus the need to modify some of the track 
            alignments to allow for more efficient movement of locomotives, necessitated 
            the current project, which was assisted by the Intermodal Surface 
            Transportation Enhancement program.</font></p>
