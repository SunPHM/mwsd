      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black">There is a concept that we 
        are all one – that we are all part of humanity and everything that makes 
        up the elements of the universe. No one person lives in isolation; we 
        are all part of a larger consciousness. This concept can be applied to 
        reflexology. Whatever happens to any individual reflexology practitioner 
        may affect other reflexologists. Wherever the ability to practise reflexology 
        is threatened or granted credibility, it will affect other reflexologists 
        globally. That is why we keep a watchful eye on how reflexology is received 
        by health authorities around the world.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflexology has been defined as a touch therapy. 
        It involves the application of the appropriate pressure to the reflexes 
        of the feet and hands by a trained practitioner to bring about a physiological 
        and psychological change by stimulating subtle energies. Treatment in 
        the East and West is very much patient centred regardless of which technique 
        is used.</font></p>

      <p><font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>As 
        I travel around the world lecturing, I come into contact with many different 
        types of reflexology with different training methods, and reflexology 
        is recognized in too few countries.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>I personally have always 
        used combination treatments incorporating the hands, feet and, in later 
        years, the ears. I have always embraced the zonal and meridian theory. 
        I find a reasonably firm pressure, working within the patient’s pain threshold 
        and adapting my pressures on the reflexes according to the state of the 
        body, to be my best guide. I have utilized acupressure therapy, which 
        is really a traditional Chinese art technique, as a further adjunct to 
        my reflexology. Using specific acupressure points on the feet, legs, hands 
        and arms stimulates the meridians, which promotes healing either directly 
        or indirectly to modulate the autonomic nervous system.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>When training other 
        graduates in reflexology, I have always aimed at the highest level. All 
        my graduates achieved over a 70% pass in anatomy and physiology and reflexology. 
        This ensured that the education was maintained. Contra-indications should 
        always be addressed. It should be borne in mind that if any factor suggests 
        that the treatment is unsuitable, one should err on the side of caution 
        and if in doubt, do not treat.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>The capacity of reflexology 
        and its all-embracing range of benefits are even more remarkable today. 
        Every reflexologist can attest to an increase in the blood circulation. 
        Tension is immediately relaxed in the nervous system and the normal energy 
        flow is restored, and numerous disorders are helped.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Many explanations have 
        been given for the marvellous results a reflexologist obtains when giving 
        treatment. Basically, I think the most important thing is to cover the 
        dorsal and plantar areas as thoroughly as possible. If the foot is in 
        the correct position, not only the nerves but also the acu-points can 
        be worked from toes to knee. Even though reflexology and the meridian 
        theory are totally different concepts, the nerve line at the commencement 
        of the meridian will access the central nervous system.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>We know the acu-points 
        on the extremities are particularly potent, with the points on the feet 
        being more dynamic than those on the hands. These are designated as the 
        fountainhead or well points on the fingers or toes, and the source points 
        are found around the ankle or wrist. We know that the energy or <i>Qi</i> 
        at this point is very powerful and has a very strong action. The energy 
        at the sea points, which lie on the elbows or knees, is said to be more 
        general and less active, thus achieving a slower response. Therefore, 
        if these acu-points are incorporated into every treatment session the 
        patient benefits twofold.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Reflexology is at an 
        interesting stage in its development: research programmes are emerging 
        from around the world; there is a greater demand for complementary therapies, 
        and some countries are beginning to recognize their worth.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently Prince Charles urged the government to 
        put millions of pounds of public money into researching alternative health-care. 
        The Prince of Wales is Patron of the Foundation for Integrated Medicine 
        (FIM) its aim being to raise the profile of complementary medicine. FIM 
        have been very instrumental in helping us to further our quest to be recognized 
        at the professional level that reflexologists deserve.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Background<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the issue 
        of safety is paramount, the regulation of reflexology is very much under 
        way. Regulation is most important, as it means that the general public 
        are assured of having treatment by suitably qualified practitioners. Here 
        in the UK we launched both the newly formed Reflexology Forum and World 
        Reflexology Week (WRW) on Monday 25 September 2000 at the Royal Society 
        of Medicine, Wimpole Street, London. Invitations had been sent to government 
        officials and over 500 members of the press. </font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At 
        the Royal Society of Medicine at the Launch of the Reflexology Forum</font></p>
      <p><font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>The 
        launch took the form of an address by three speakers: Michael Fox, chief 
        executive of the FIM, which had been instrumental in bringing the Forum 
        together and had allowed us to use its head office, which provided us 
        with neutral territory for the organizations to meet; Simon Mills, independent 
        chair of the Reflexology Forum, who had helped us to develop the regulatory 
        path we must now follow; and myself, as president of the International 
        Council of Reflexologists (ICR).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>The Reflexology Forum 
        has created a body with two main aims:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font color="black">To develop a national qualification framework 
          based on the revised National Occupational Standards (NOS) for reflexology, 
          which should be published later this year;</font></li>
        <li><font color="black">To pave the way for regulation – ‘Paving the way 
          to regulation’ is the wording that is on our banner.</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>We 
        are still on the bottom rung of the stepladder. We still have to examine 
        the options open to us, i.e. voluntary or statutory self-regulation. There 
        is still a lot of work to be done before we become totally unified. The 
        Reflexology Forum may well be a pilot scheme for other complementary therapies 
        to follow. It is quite true that there is a great variation of training 
        throughout the UK. There must also be some monitoring of quality and this 
        can only be achieved by having a controlling body, which will go some 
        way towards creating the correct structure to regulate reflexology.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>In my launch address, 
        I spoke about how the initiative of WRW was first formulated in London 
        in 1997 at one of the ICR board meetings and how, in 1999, the Governor 
        of the State of Hawaii issued a proclamation to this effect, announcing 
        that every year, during the last week of September, celebrations for WRW 
        would take place. Over 32 countries had been notified about WRW, and information 
        is still coming in from them, reflecting the enormous amount of enthusiasm 
        that everyone entered into this global event.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Hopefully, we can all 
        look back on our achievements in the coming weeks to see if all the hard 
        work and time spent have been worthwhile and maybe this year there will 
        be even more participants.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many weeks the Education Working Group of 
        the Reflexology Forum have been meeting, discussing and finalizing the 
        revised National Occupational Standards for Reflexology with the help 
        of Stephanie Kiryluk, the Complementary Medicine Project Manager of the 
        Health Care National Training Organization. Eventually a final draft was 
        agreed and Stephanie then forwarded the finished documents to everyone 
        who would be attending the Reflexology Forum Meeting on the 7th February 
        2001 at the FIM Head Office in North London. All representatives of the 
        major reflexology organisations agreed these standards, and the Project 
        Manager will now be submitting them to the Projects and Standards Advisory 
        Group for approval. This is another step forward in the development of 
        Reflexology in the UK as a profession.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Various 
        Types of Reflexology in the UK<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>The 
        Ingham method was formulated by Eunice Ingham, who is known as the ‘mother’ 
        of reflexology, and this forms the basis of Western reflexology practice. 
        This specific method utilizes the finger and thumb to walk all areas of 
        the feet. Doreen Bayly was also a pioneer in reflexology. She trained 
        with Ingham and returned to England to practise and teach reflexology. 
        Many different versions have grown from this as people adapt their method, 
        but hopefully the key principles have not been lost.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>From this original 
        technique of pure reflexology, many of the light touch techniques emerged, 
        some linking one or more points; when linking, constant light pressure 
        is maintained. There is a lengthy list of differing techniques for contacting 
        the reflexes, which can be positively daunting to a reflexologist who 
        wants to pursue all avenues. For instance, there is synergistic reflexology 
        and colour reflexology, and also the MagneTech, which is an instrument 
        that can be used with perfect safety on the reflex points. The rotational 
        effect changes the poles 260 times, far too fast for the body to recognize 
        that the north pole is supposed to calm the body down and the south pole 
        revitalize the body. A pure magnetic field is produced, and this provides 
        a sustained and stabling effect, thus enabling the body to regain control 
        and balance.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="booth63.htm">Vertical reflexology</a> 
        is a system that you can read about in another article in this issue of 
        <i>Positive Health</i>, (see page 15) the theory being that, when treatment 
        is given in the standing position, the vertical weight bearing amplifies 
        the stimulation. This only confirms the use of the many implements sold 
        to the public in China: many weight-bearing stones and appliances, some 
        of which are electrical with a lower platform moving, some excruciating 
        to stand on, and some with an area shaped like the feet with raised nodules 
        on the spinal area – this multi-pointed sole massager is specifically 
        used for low back pain. The standing position is usually recommended for 
        only three minutes. Stimuli are on the arch of the foot, and the treatment 
        is repeated 3-4 times each day until the person has more mobility and 
        less pain.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#3333FF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Germany<br>
        </b> </font><font color="black"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>In 
        Germany there is a method called energetic reflexology. There is no physical 
        contact; the hands are held as near to the feet as possible without touching, 
        and movement can be all over the feet. If the therapist feels there is 
        a blockage, then the hands become static, the theory being that the energy 
        from the therapist’s hands unblocks any imbalance.</font></p>

        Rwo Shur method was brought to China in 1986 by Father Joseph, a Catholic 
        priest who was born and raised in the eastern part (German section) of 
        Switzerland. Father Joseph, who speaks English, French and German plus 
        several Chinese dialects, went to Taiwan in 1970. He belongs to the Missionary 
        Society of Bethlehem, which has missions in several different countries 
        around the world. He suffered with rheumatism in the knee and could hardly 
        walk. A colleague had brought a reflexology book back to Taiwan and this 
        friend worked on him, following the diagrams in the book. Father Joseph 
        found the treatment very painful, but received almost instant relief. 
        He obtained and read the book <i>Good Health for the Future through Foot 
        Reflexology,</i> written in German by a Swiss nurse, Hedi Masafret, and 
        started practising immediately. He was a totally self-taught man.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Father Joseph worked 
        on the many Christians who could not attend church due to ill-heath. He 
        would go and visit them, treating them and training many others on the 
        way. Over a period of time many thousands of people were helped. Some 
        doctors heard about the priest who could help most problems, and it had 
        already been noted that there was a drop in the amount of medication being 
        prescribed. Father Joseph then received a letter from the Health Minister 
        forbidding him to do any more reflexology. He immediately wrote a letter 
        to the President and Vice President of Taiwan, and he also encouraged 
        anyone who could speak on his behalf to do so as well. The Vice President 
        invited him for a meeting together with the Health Minister. The Vice 
        President was quite sympathetic and said to the Health Minister, “You 
        cannot forbid Father Joseph from doing reflexology. Just because it is 
        a method that you do not understand, how can you forbid other people from 
        doing it?” The Vice President found a hospital where Father Joseph could 
        continue his work, and he worked under the guidance of a doctor. Many 
        doctors still wanted to get rid of him, but he had the protection of the 
        Vice President.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Soon, however, Father 
        Joseph became exhausted and he realized that he could not continue the 
        work by himself. He started to train many other Chinese helpers, and there 
        was hardly anyone in Taiwan that had not heard of reflexology. He was 
        then asked to introduce the method to Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and China.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Rwo Shur are the two 
        characters of his name Joseph, and it was subsequently called the Joseph 
        method. The Rwo Shur Health Method came to China in 1986, although Father 
        Joseph never went to China until 1990. That is where I first met this 
        most remarkable, wonderful man. The Chinese people loved him, as he is 
        a very charismatic character. Treatment was very aggressive and painful 
        in those early days; nowadays, hopefully because of the Western influence 
        a much more nurturing touch is used. Treatment can still be painful, as 
        the theory is such that you only get the best results if you work a little 
        deeper. Sometimes treatments are twice a day and they work to the level 
        of pain that you can stand. It is quite amazing how many successful case 
        histories they have amassed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Many of the Far Eastern 
        practitioners now use wooden or magnetic implements to push and probe 
        the reflexes; many also use the knuckles. A lubricant, cream or oil, usually 
        herbal in origin, is always used during a treatment session.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>My first visit to China 
        had been a personal visit in 1987, and this was brief but most exciting. 
        It was a short trip that became a memory of a lifetime; the country was 
        steeped in history. I was told that a short trip into China would only 
        be a preview and little did I know that I would visit time and time again 
        as I grew to admire and love the people that I became involved with in 
        the reflexology world. I saw great changes in the people and watched the 
        country change and develop further over a few short years, even from the 
        wearing of their traditional blue outfit to modern Western dress.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>I had become interested 
        in reflexology in the early 1980s, and my obsession grew. This science 
        became so fascinating that I was hungry for information from every source. 
        Unknowingly, in 1987, I had already become involved with China, as on 
        this first visit I had a body massage at the hotel where we were staying, 
        which also involved my feet being worked. The Chinese therapist had asked 
        me if I was involved in healing because my surname ‘Crane’ denoted ‘longevity’. 
        I replied that I was already participating in a growing and deep commitment 
        to reflexology, which was beginning to take over my working life. He did 
        not understand about reflexology, as all areas of my feet were worked 
        in the most excruciating way. So, when I started my school in 1988, I 
        used the Latin term of <i>‘Longus Aevum’ </i>(meaning ‘Long Life’) on 
        a banner beneath two graceful Crane birds, and this is my individualistic 
        logo to date.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>So when an invitation 
        arrived on my desk six years later inviting Westerners to attend the first 
        China Reflexology Symposium in Beijing in 1993 and also offering me the 
        chance to present a paper, I decided that this visit was a must. It was 
        the start of many return trips to China and a wonderful friendship with 
        Hang Xiongwen, chairman of the China Reflexology Association (CRA) and 
        Zhang Hongjing its general secretary. I also developed a friendship with 
        Christine Issel, the Australian and Danish reflexologists and the many 
        worldwide reflexologists I have met and exchanged views with since. Of 
        their 31 regions, 29 sent a representative to the first CRA Symposium, 
        so many people practise in China. Many doctors, because they have to retire 
        at the age of 65, find that doing reflexology in private practice is an 
        advantage. Many have submitted anecdotal evidence to the CRA on the therapeutic 
        value of reflexology.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culmination of all these marvellous visits 
        took place in October 1998, when the CRA took us on an awe-inspiring visit 
        to the Great Hall of the People, where we were introduced to leading personnel 
        of the Chinese State Government. Not only was Chairman Hang Xiongwen proud 
        and visibly moved by this acceptance and endorsement of reflexology by 
        the Chinese Health Officials, but as an early visitor my heart also swelled 
        with pride that this wonderful science was shared by so many, as over 
        800 delegates gathered together to have a photograph taken.<br>
        </font><font color="black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>When 
        we returned this time, there was evidence of even greater change – the 
        brand new futuristic airport was open. The pavements and pathways have 
        all been renewed; several more shopping malls have opened and there are 
        also walk-in reflexology clinics. Reflexology has become big business. 
        One of the reflexology clinics had 100 couches laid out, and at 10 pm 
        in the evening every one of these was occupied. Clients are allowed to 
        smoke, and many overseas visitors and businessmen frequent them. Some 
        of the smaller centres have as few as ten beds. Treatment is very uniform 
        and very painful; no contraindication list is given to you, as the therapist 
        tells you what is wrong with you. This is not how I see reflexology progressing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>China has gone through 
        a transition, but the experience will always be different to anything 
        else because of its culture, which is evolving and exciting and, as is 
        often stated in many guide books, ‘China is still a country like no other’.</font></p>

        in practice in the United States is the same as in the UK. Most people 
        work from home in private practice, some have their own clinics or work 
        within a beauty salon or other multi-discipline centre, and a few work 
        within a hospital setting. Treatment is the same, and you go to whomever 
        you are most comfortable with. In the United States the Reflexology Association 
        now covers a similar curriculum to the UK. You can still get the short 
        courses, but most people now realize that educational standards are of 
        the utmost importance and they aim for the highest level.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>The situation in the 
        US is somewhat unique, as, unlike most nations, the United States has 
        no national health laws. Most of the power to make laws regarding health 
        is held in the hands of each individual state. To obtain a reflexology 
        law with the necessary standards would require legislation being passed 
        50 different times. This would require an immense amount of time and thousands 
        and thousands of dollars.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="black"></font>Reflexology treatment 
        is seen as a stress reducer, with less emphasis on disorders. People in 
        the US use the term massage very loosely to include many of the touch 
        therapies. Massage therapy is very powerful in the United States: each 
        state has its own association and millions of dollars in its national 
        treasury to spend on legislation. So it is very hard to work against the 
        massage profession in the US, as they are most determined to have anyone 
        who touches and works on the body in any way to be licensed and ruled 
        by them. However, because of the reflexology following, and in order to 
        keep its regulation separate from the massage laws in the US, the Reflexology 
        Association and the American Reflexology Certification Board (ARCB – a 
        voluntary independent certification board) work hard to promote public 
        safety through the recognition of practitioners meeting certain standards. 
        Part of the ARCB’s time is spent in educating other bodywork disciplines 
        and government officials about the differences between reflexology and 
        massage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massage has to be licensed to protect the public

        has only 24 state associations; many are very small, some having less

        laws – the state of North Dakota – and there are two states, Washington 
        and Arkansas, that have reflexology mentioned within the massage laws.</font></p>
