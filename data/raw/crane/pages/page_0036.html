<BR><I><B>From Track to Track: The Ballad that Biggie Built</B>, a mixed media installation by Ryan A. Berg, is one of the pieces in the </I>Master of Fine Arts 1998<I> Exhibition now showing at the Henry Art Gallery. The South Gallery is devoted entirely to the artwork of graduate students and their advisors and represents a culmination of two years of study. This year's exhibition features 22 artists in a variety of media and concepts, interpreting important issues and illustrating the mastery of techniques. The annual showcase for MFA candidates runs through June 21.

<BR><B><I>Ramp frame installed</I></B><I>—A large crane blocked the entrance road at the front of UW Medical Center on Thursday and Friday morning last week to install the steel frame for a ramp on the east side of Hogness Auditorium. This project, along with the new elevator for the auditorium, should be finished by fall. The crane work was completed on schedule by noon on Friday and the road reopened.

<BR><I>This diagram shows a cross section of the ridge known as the East Pacific rise. Here, the Pacific and Nazca plates are pulling apart faster than most other plate separations on the planet. It is one of the most volcanically active regions on Earth. The separating plates release pressure in the mantle, causing the rock below to rise, melt into magma and percolate up to fill the gap. The melting process begins as deep as 100 miles (about 200 kilometers), although most melting occurs at less than 60 miles down. The two darker shaded areas, labeled primary melting and “incipient melting”, show the melt zones, including areas with unusual temperatures or composition labeled “embedded heterogeneity.” The black lines with arrows show the upwelling pattern suggested by seismic waves that found aligned crystals in the upper mantle.
