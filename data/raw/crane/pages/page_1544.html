<img src="http://www.panelpros.com/news/Toh_1.jpg" width=200 height=240 border=0 align="left" alt="Metal roof" hspace=10 vspace=10>Like the tools it houses, the workshop building
        marries old-world craftsmanship and cutting-edge
        technology. The standing-seam metal roof (left)
        resembles tin roofs that have capped farm outbuildings
        for 200 years. But these panels, made of aluminum-coated
        steel, were formed by a computer controlled $25,000
        on-site crimper-cutter. Installation took just two days.</p>
<P>
Even more impressive, however, is
        the building&#146;s structure. Made of structural
        insulated panels (SIPs) and erected in an astonishingly
        quick six hours, many believe this is the next
        evolutionary step beyond stud-and-rafter framing.
        &quot;For new construction,&quot; says Norm, &quot;I
        don&#146;t think there&#146;s any reason to use anything
        but the panels.&quot;</p>

<p>

SIP design is simple: a core of rigid foam insulation
        sandwiched by flakeboard. Extraordinary strength and
        stability spring from the two separated but connected
        wooden faces. &quot;It&#146;s the same concept that gives
        an airplane fuselage rigidity despite its light weight
        &#150; it&#146;s got an inner and outer skin,&quot; says
        Frank Baker, owner of Great Lakes Insulspan, which
        supplied the workshop&#146;s panels. In this workshop,
        the only extra support required was a single laminated
        ridge beam, middle. The basic advantage of SIPs is
        thermal efficiency. Though a t-inch-thick, conventionally
        framed wall may be stuffed with R-19 fiberglass batts,
        the wall&#146;s solid wood studs, which are poor
        insulators, drop the whole wall&#146;s value to R-15.5.
        An equally thick SIP wall is an honest R-24.</p>
<P>

Panels are huge, so construction zooms. This
        42-foot north wall consists of just two SIPs: one 24 feet
        long, the other 18 feet. They were placed by cranes and
        assembled with construction adhesive and 8-inch screws.
        The factory-carved rough openings meant Tom Silva and his
        crew needed only to install siding, windows, doors,
        skylights and trim (right).</p>

        <p>Baker says modern expanded polystyrene foam
        doesn&#146;t give off toxic fumes and shrinks forma
        flame. The old weaknesses of flakeboard, now called
        oriented strand board (OSB), are vanishing as well.
        Presses align the flakes to maximize swelling when wet.
        Since modern phenolic adhesives emit so little
        formaldehyde, federal guidelines exempt phenolic-bound
        OSB from formaldehyde testing.</p>


<p>Until about two years ago, SIPs were significantly more
expensive than framing, but rising lumber prices and dropping OSB
costs have narrowed the margin: A 1996 article in the <i>Forest
Products Journal</i> explains that a 6-inch stud wall surrounding
a 2,000-square-foot house would cost $9,265; a comparable SIP
wall would run $9,890.</p>
