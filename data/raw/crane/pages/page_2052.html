The overhanging limestone walls of Mallorca provide perfect opportunities to forge routes sans ropes with the Mediterranean Sea 60 feet below as a sensual crash pad.<br>

										<i>
										Steve Robitaille &amp; Leslie Gaines
<br>
										</i>Few authors so artfully span the worlds of fiction and non-fiction as Peter Matthiessen (The Snow Leopard, Killing Mr. Watson), and few subjects so hold his attention as birds, whether in Tibet or Central Florida. To chronicle the arrival of the first whooping crane chick born east of the Mississippi in over a hundred years - the result of an international restoration project - Matthiessen joined an expedition that provided him the concluding episode of his recently published book Birds of Heaven, Travels With Cranes.<br>

											<img src="images/mountainfilm04/catchafish.jpg" alt="" height="96" width="125" align="right" border="0"></i>Filmmaker Howard Donner was ejected from a whitewater raft that he was guiding and landed on a story. As he was recovering from his ailments on the riverbank, he met a hermit named Kelly C., who appeared with a poultice made of blanched comfrey leaves. In the days that followed, Donner had many discussions about living the simple life with a man who dines on the local cuisine of wild mushrooms, acorns, fish and the occasional road-killed deer. The film follows Kelly on a typical day, and is ultimately less about what he does and more about his simple yet poignant philosophy. &quot;I Need to Catch a Fish&quot; touches on aspects of freedom and the typical human addiction to collect more stuff. It speaks to living each day, and relishing in the simple pleasures that every day brings.<br>
