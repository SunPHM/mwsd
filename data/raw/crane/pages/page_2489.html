Normally, the first cranes arrive in mid-February. Crane numbers peak in
mid-to-late March. All Sandhill Cranes continue north to nesting areas by
mid-April.<p>

<h2>1997 Update</h2>

<h3>Mid March</h3>
Moderating temperatures and strong southerly breezes have brought thousands of cranes into the Big Bend Region. Viewers
can see large concentrations of cranes between Kearney and Grand Island. <p>

<h3>Mid February</h3>
Crane numbers are increasing, but are still low. Very warm temperatures
on the 18th and 19th, combined with generally southern winds,
increased migration activity.  Currently, nearly all the cranes are
concentrated in the Rowe Sanctuary area south of Gibbon. <p>

<h3>Early February</h3>
Early February was cold and snowy. A few cranes began to arrive on
February 13th, carried north on a strong southern breeze. <p>
While there are only a few cranes, large numbers of Canada and Whitefront geese are now using the Big Bend
area. Prime viewing is available in the Rowe Sanctuary area south of
Gibbon.  A new viewing facility has been constructed by Central Platte 
Natural Resource District and the State of Nebraska.  Two viewing platforms are located on the
south bank of the Platte south of the Gibbon I-80 exit.<p>
