CRANE: And my promise to you is to prosecute those who bear the greatest responsibility 
for the tragedy that took place here in Sierra Leone over the past ten years. 
</p><p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war saw brutality 
taken to new lows. </p><p>In all, 75,000 people were killed, and about two million, 
almost half the entire population, was displaced from their homes. </p><p>Twenty 
thousand civilians were randomly targeted for mutilation by all sides of the conflict, 
many by limb amputation. One victim was Alusine Conteh. </p><p>ALUSINE CONTEH: 
The hand is took. They slashed it like that. </p><p>ALUSINE CONTEH (Translated): 
They first used the axe to chop the left hand off. After that, they wanted to 
chop the other, and this little boy started crying and said, &quot;please, soldier, 
don't cut off my poppa's other hand.&quot; </p><p>So they said, &quot;let this 
woman remove this child from her back. We'll chop off his arm.&quot; And I said, 
&quot;no,&quot; and they decided to chop the other hand off. </p><p>FRED DE SAM 
LAZARO: So they basically said you could have your right hand if you gave your 
son's hand? </p><p>ALUSINE CONTEH: Yes. </p><p><IMG SRC="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_armycurrent.jpg" WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="113" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Army">FRED 
DE SAM LAZARO: Many of the soldiers were children abducted into the notorious 
revolutionary united front, the rebel force. Sorie Sheriff managed to escape combat 
duty. He did hard labor with his father, who died when they tried to escape. </p><p>SORIE 
SHERIFF: He want to run. He halts my father, say, &quot;stop!&quot; My father

        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: With diamonds, gold, and bauxite, Sierra Leone 
          should be as wealthy as it is picturesque. Instead the natural abundance 
          has meant only tragedy and genocide. </p>
        <p>DAVID CRANE: This civil war wasn't caused by a political vision or 
          for religious reasons or for ethnic reasons -- not that that excuses 
          war crimes or crimes against humanity. </p>
        <p><img src="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_golddiggers.jpg" width="149" height="134" align="right" alt="Diamond diggers">This 
          was done for pure greed. This was done to control a commodity, and that 
          commodity was diamonds. </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As they have for decades, thousands of young men 
          dredge and sift gravel in the diamond-rich eastern region. Few of these 
          freelance prospectors ever find much. The big payoffs have always gone 
          mainly to foreign dealers working with the political elite that has 
          controlled the official trade. </p>
        <p>Today this former British colony has the world's lowest per capita 
          income. Two thirds are illiterate, their plight worsened by the fighting. 
          The war began in this region a decade ago, when the RUF rebels, backed 
          by neighboring Liberia, fought the government and army for control of 
          the diamond trade, which in turn fueled arms purchases. </p>
        <p>SPOKESMAN: This is for antitank. </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Finally, late in 2000, after smaller West African 
          and U.N. peacekeeping forces failed to stop the carnage, British troops 
          began to restore calm, paving the way for a massive U.N. deployment 
          which completed disarming the combatants in January 2002. Today, some 
          17,000 international troops patrol in Sierra Leone. In early December, 
          the U.N. also swore in the international court to try those most responsible 
          for the killings. </p>
        <p>SPOKESMAN: I, Geoffrey Robertson... </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: British Judge Geoffrey Robertson is president of 
          the new court. </p>
        <p><IMG SRC="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_robertson.jpg" WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="145" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Robertson">JUDGE 
          GEOFFREY ROBERTSON: I think the world is moving towards the position 
          that there can be no lasting peace without a measure of justice, and 
          that the reason why we are, in a sense, parachuting in a justice system, 
          international judges to deal with particular crimes, is that there are 
          certain crimes that are so heinous that they diminish us all as human 
          beings. </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Unlike similar tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, 
          this one is located in the country where the crimes were committed, 
          invited by the leadership. Pres. Tejan Kabbah was first elected in 1996, 
          deposed in a coup a year later -- then reinstated by a Nigerian-led 
          troop intervention. </p>
        <p>PRES. AHMAD TEJAN KABBAH: The main reason for the whole exercise is 
          really to make sure that people see and understand that if they behave 
          in the way they behaved here in the recent past, then it will all catch 
          up with them. That's the message. It's not a question of retaliation 
          or vengeance, no. </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: With limited resources and thousands of perpetrators, 
          the court will only try about 20 of the war's kingpins. Most of the 
          others accused will appear before a truth and reconciliation commission. 
          It will offer amnesty in exchange for confessions. Sierra Leone's truth 
          commission follows a concept first tried in post-apartheid South Africa. 
          Dr. Alex Boraine served on that body, and now runs an Institute for 
          Transitional Justice in New York. </p>
        <p><IMG SRC="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_borraine.jpg" WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="122" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Boraine">DR. 
          ALEX BORAINE: I think the idea of having the truth commission as well, 
          not only for the victims to come and tell their stories and to seek 
          answers, but also for perpetrators to be reintegrated into society so 
          that they don't feel they have to go back into the bush and pick up 
          their guns and kill all over again. </p>
        <p>SPOKESMAN: You can talk to anybody in the commission... </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The truth commission held its first meeting recently 
          in Bamaru, a village on the Liberian border where the civil war began. 
          Villagers fled when the firing started, and returned when it was over 
          to bury 15 people who couldn't escape. &quot;We don't care whether or 
          not the perpetrators are brought to justice,&quot; a village elder told 
          us. &quot;It's between them and their God.&quot; </p>
        <p><IMG SRC="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_map.jpg" WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="129" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Map">Residents 
          said their biggest wish is for peace in this precarious setting, a stone's 
          throw from the Liberian border. Sierra Leonean soldiers stand guard 
          here, some themselves former RUF rebels. Keeping soldiers loyal is considering 
          key to keeping the peace, especially when the court begins continue 
          to indict suspects, many of whom remain powerful players. </p>
        <p>They include current Defense Minister Hinga Norman, whose faction, 
          the Citizens Defense Force, like the rebels, is widely accused of atrocities. 
          Norman says there may well be renewed instability and social unrest 
          if the court is perceived as unfair. </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So you think that the prosecutors should take into 
          account the potential destabilizing effects? </p>
        <p><IMG SRC="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_norman.jpg" WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="138" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Norman">HINGA 
          NORMAN: I believe that they do take that. I believe. It is my belief 
          that such mature people cannot just go riding high without thinking 
          that it could be. </p>
        <p>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: However, Judge Robertson says to fulfill its mandate 
          of dispensing justice, the court must work strictly off evidence, with 
          no regard for potential consequences. </p>
        <p>JUDGE GEOFFREY ROBERTSON: There will always be preference for doing 
          deals, for allowing the torturers and tyrants to leave the bloody stage 
          with amnesties in the back pocket, with their Swiss bank accounts intact. 
          But that seems to me to be yesterday's argument. It's for those who 
          are in charge of what, touch wood, is the improving security position 
          in this country, to look after. And indeed, those who do seek-- if any 
          do-- to drag this country back into barbarism will themselves face trial, 
          perhaps before this court or a successor. </p>

DE SAM LAZARO: The U.N. may have brought a precarious peace, but little long-term 
economic improvement. Despite efforts to certify and tax diamonds, official estimates 
are that 60 percent of them are still smuggled to neighboring countries for export 
to the world markets. And there have even been recent reports by the Washington 
Post, among others, that island al-Qaida to the diamond business. </p><p>Following 
its implication in the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa, the terrorist 
organization sought a safe haven for its assets. That haven was reportedly vast 
quantities of West African diamonds purchased in the late '90s. Day to day, many 
ordinary Sierra Leoneans say it's not the fight against terrorism, or even retribution 
for the crimes against humanity that's on their minds -- rather, it's how to meet 
life's most basic needs. </p><P>ALUSINE CONTEH ( Translated ): We have nothing. 
We have no medicine for the children. If they need medicine, we have to beg on 
the street. </P><P>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sorie Sheriff is a good student and wants 
to become a doctor, but he's not sure he'll get past sixth grade, since his mother 
cannot afford the tuition. For many young people, businessmen Andrew Kromah says 
soldering remains the only option. </P><P>ANDREW KROMAH: We still have imminent 
danger in the country. Number one is, like, the economy. People are still poor. 
And you have youths among them... if you keep them idle for so long-- even adults 
who are unemployed-- you keep them idle for so long, they can be candidates for 
mercenary action. They can be candidates for terrorism. </P><P>FRED DE SAM LAZARO: 
Prosecutor Crane says that instability is just one reason Americans should be 
concerned. The other is the diamond trade. </P><P><IMG SRC="../../../images/africa/jan-june03/sierra_crane.jpg" WIDTH="149" HEIGHT="147" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Crane">DAVID 
CRANE: It does affect the American people, because we are in fact one of the major 
purchasers of that commodity. I'm not sure of the exact number, but it is well 
within the 70 percent. And so the American people need to understand that a diamond 
is a wonderful gift, but one has to remember that some of those... the origins 
of some of those diamonds may be, in fact, coated in blood. </P><P>FRED DE SAM 
LAZARO: Crane will not disclose his specific timeline, but the first indictments 
are expected in the next few months. </P><!-- #EndEditable --> </td><td width=109 valign="top"><!-- #BeginEditable "Part%20Three%20pull%20quote" --><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
