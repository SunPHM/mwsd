<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
this paper, we describe how the vee diagram was used in elementary science
methods courses. We used student-centered investigations to provide the
context to test the assumption that the vee diagram was a tool to help
prospective teachers with their construction and implementation of investigations.
The following questions focused the study:</p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">1. Do the prospective teachers show improvement
in their use of vee diagrams while designing and implementing investigations?</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">2. Do the prospective teachers show a reduction
in anxiety toward doing investigations, as a result of using vee diagrams
while designing and implementing investigations?</font></p>

<p>3. What patterns are revealed through analysis of pretest and posttest
vee diagrams?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Students</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students
participating in this study were enrolled in one of three sections of a
elementary/middle school science methods course (3 credits). Students in
science methods represent one of three programs leading to licensure: 1)
pre-school, kindergarten, and elementary school, (preK-6); 2) elementary
school, (grades 1-6); and 3) elementary and middle school, (grades 1-9).
Just over half of the students were either 1-6 or 1-9 majors. As is typical,
the students in these methods courses were female, from rural or suburban
schools, and White. Most male students were elementary/middle school majors
(1-9 majors).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior
to enrollment, students completed two years of general studies and a nine
semester credit Pre-Professional Program including an eight day urban f~eld
experience. Most students completed the mandatory eight semester credit
hours of science including a five semester credit</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laboratory
science course and a three semester credit non-laboratory science course.
These courses must be either physical science or life science. Few students
choose to complete the 24 credit general science minor that can be elected.
None of the students had previous experience with constructing investigations
or vee diagramming. Students at the beginning of one methods course were
asked to respond to questions about their previous science experiences.
The following statements from that openended survey are representative:
&quot;In middle school my teacher taught science through lectures and movies.
I really didn't learn much about science during these years.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I
have not really learned a lot about science during my college years. I've
had one biology class where all of the exams were open book.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;[In
college] Lectures and lab. Both were interesting, but the lab really caught
my attention and was easily remembered, where in lectures there was a lot
of memorization.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Anxiety</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zuckerman's
instrument (1960) was used to document students' anxiety towards constructing
and implementing investigations. Jegede, Alaiyemola, &amp; Okebukola (1990)
used this instrument and found gender specific trends (among males) between
anxiety reduction and achievement. The instrument has twenty-one adjectives
reflective of anxiety embedded in a field of sixty adjectives. Scores lie
on a scale of 0-21, 0 indicates no anxiety and 21 indicates high anxiety.
A more complete discussion of Zuckerman's anxiety instrument was provided
by Jegede et al. (1990).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Vee Diagram</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
vee diagram instrument was designed for students to construct responses
to capture their investigative operations. This instrument includes a simple
description of vee diagrams, a blank vee diagram, graph paper, narrative
data, and tabular data. The narrative and tabular data consist of information
about Whooping Cranes (Stoker, Agsteribbe, Windsor, &amp; Andrews, 1972).
The narrative portion provides a brief description of the Whooping Cranes'
migratory pattern, nesting and feeding habits. The tabular set provides
data students might modify to answer questions they pose. For example,
students can convert snowfall into rainfall then combine rainfall with
snowfall. Variables include year of migrating adults, number of migrating
adults, number of nests, eggs laid, eggs hatched and precipitation. The
graph paper is provided to support students while they search for relationships.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
rubric for scoring vee diagrams provided by Novak &amp; Gowin (1984, p.
71-2) was mod)fied. Table 1 shows the modified scoring scheme with a total
possible 18 points. Students were asked to apply the concept of variables
in their Focus Question and Principles &amp; Concepts. The Transformations
section emphasized skills associated with graphing (McKenzie &amp; Padilla,
1986). Students were not asked to include the following sections of Novak
&amp; Gowin's vee diagram: World View, Philosophy, Theory, and Value Claims.</p>

<center><p><u>Procedures</u></p></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
study involved three sections of science methods courses taught by two
different science educators. In the descriptions that follow, the two method
sections are referred two as Group 1 (taught by one investigator) and the
third section as Group 2 (taught by the other investigator). </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Group </u>1</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students
in the first two sections (n = 51) completed approximately 10 investigations
using vee diagrams. As the semesters progressed, the strategy was to shift
from investigations initiated by the instructor to those constructed by
the students. Butts' (1966) model of inquiry was used to engage students
in investigating. Butts suggested that students search information, process
data, discover ideas, verify ideas, and transfer ideas as a &quot;cyclic
operation&quot; (p. 6). Early in the semester, students were provided data
(in tabular form) from which they searched for relationships, or asked
a question (e.g., What factors might affect . . .) from which students
generated a list of ideas to investigate. Students used science resource
books to generate investigations later in the semester.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early
in the semesters, students were introduced to the following ideas: 1) variables
(dependent, independent, and controlled), 2) determining ways to control,
measure and manipulate variables, and 3) constructing graphs using the
variables they tested. Students were then introduced to vee diagramming.
Questions that students asked were used to explain the components of the
vee using ideas from Tobin &amp; Capie (1980). Table 2 shows how the integrated
process skills were related to selected components of the vee diagram.
Most instructional time was used to discuss students' ideas for measuring
and manipulating both the dependent and independent variables (Concepts)
of the investigation.</p>

Students (n = 27) in this section completed seven investigations and vee
diagrams. The first investigation was a demonstration used to introduce
two major themes: 1) the process of restructuring &quot;activities&quot;
such as those found in popular science resource books as investigations,
and 2) vee diagramming as a tool for deriving meaning from the investigation.
In this investigation, the instructor established the context (linear inertia)
and dependent variable while the students determined the independent variable
and its forms, the focus question, method of data collection, data transformation,
and knowledge claims.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Following this initial introduction, students located an activity and redesigned
it as an investigation, located appropriate materials and equipment, and
&quot;taught&quot; their activity to three other members of the class.
Each &quot;teacher&quot; was to have his/her &quot;students&quot; construct
vee diagrams for the investigation. The &quot;teacher&quot; then graded
the vee diagrams from his/her &quot;students.&quot; Because the students
were organized in groups of four, each class member constructed three different
vee diagrams, one for each of three investigations.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As part of the prospective teachers' construction of a unit plan related
to some science content area, they were to design and implement investigations
and construct associated vee diagrams related the following aspects:</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">1. Practice of inservice teachers when
they teach science, especially in the content area of the unit,</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">2. Two areas relevant to understanding
the interaction between children and science, particularly that which is
tied to the unit topic area: content knowledge, attitude toward learning
science, motor skills, and thought patterns.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These investigations were to result in three vee diagrams, one related
to the investigation of inservice teachers and two related to grasping
an understanding of children in each of two relevant domains.</font></p>

Elementary methods students pre-vee mean scores and their respective post-vee
scores were analyzed to determine whether students showed improvement in
their use of vee diagrams while designing and implementing investigations.
Because Group mean scores showed no statistical difference, students' scores
were combined.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A total of 78 mean scores were compared using a t test for Correlated Samples
(See Table 3). The mean score of the pre-vee was 6.2 (SD = 4.1)<i> </i>and
the mean score of the post-vee was 11.9 (SD =<i> </i>2.7), thus indicating
a mean gain of 5.7 (p &lt; .05). Preservice elementary/middle students
in all three sections showed significant improvement in constructing vee
diagrams.</font></p>

The mean scores of students' who completed both the pre- and post- vee
diagram tasks were used in this comparison. Because students pre-anxiety
and post-anxiety mean scores showed no statistical difference, both Groups'
scores were combined. This comparison answered the question: Do the prospective
teachers show a reduction in anxiety toward doing investigations, as a
result of using vee diagrams while designing and implementing investigations?</font></p>

Zuckerman's anxiety instrument (Zuckerman, 1960) was used in pretest and
posttest fashion to compare 78 preservice elementary/middle school students'
anxiety towards investigating. Table <i>4 </i>shows the comparison between
pre-anxiety and post-anxiety mean scores. The pre-anxiety mean score was
13 <i>(SD = </i>3.3) and the post-anxiety mean score was 9.7 <i>(SD = 1.9)
</i>with a mean difference of 3.3. The t value was 8.39 (p &lt; .05). The
methods class treatments significantly shifted students anxiety in a positive
direction (O - low anxiety). However, no significant correlation was found
between investigation anxiety change and vee diagramming change scores
(r = .06, p = .22).</font></p>

At the beginning of the semesters many students chose not to attempt the
Whooping Crane task. The rubric previously discussed was used to reveal
strengths and weaknesses in students' investigative skills. Table 5 shows
the components of the vee emphasized in the courses and the distribution
of students' scores. While the Possible Score shows the score for the criterion
of each component, the Percent (Pre-Vee &amp; Post-Vee) shows the proportion
of students </font><i><font FACE="Geneva,Arial">(N = </font></i><font FACE="Times New Roman">78)

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From pre to post, students showed improvement in constructing all components
of the vee diagram. The students achieved the greatest improvement in their
focus questions, objects/events and records. On the post-vee, the students
received the maximum score for the following: </font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">1. developing a clear focus question with
specific suggestion of both independent and dependent variables (72%, Possible
Score = 3),</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">2. identifying records consistent with
the focus question or major event (83%, Possible Score 2), and</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">3. identifying objects/events consistent

<center><p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><img SRC="96696.jpg" HEIGHT="527" WIDTH="505" alt="Table 5."></p></center>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students had more difficulty improving their knowledge claims, transformations
and principles/concepts. The greatest percentage of students (35%) did
not construct knowledge claims (Possible Score = 0) on their pre-vees.
On the post-vee, most students' knowledge claims (55%) included inconsistent
generalizations or their claims were not clearly derived from the data
(Possible Score = 2). However, 28% of the students constructed post-vee
knowledge claims appropriately derived from the records and transformations
(Possible Score = 3). In comparison, only 19% of the students constructed
knowledge claims appropriately.(Possible Score = 3) on the pre-vee.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students showed a positive shift in constructing their transformations.
While 41% of the students did not construct graphs in their pre-vees (Possible
Score = 0), 35% of the students correctly combined data, and correctly
made graphs consistent with their focus question (Possible Score = 3) on
their post-vees. However, on the post-vees, the greatest proportion of
students (46%) correctly processed data (e.g., combined rainfall and snowfall),
but their graphs were incorrectly constructed (Possible Score = 2). Two
common difficulties emerged from analysis of the students' graphs. Students
often placed the independent variable on the y-axis or incorrectly labeled
their graphs. Other students tried to show relationships between too many
variables. Often times, they made scatter plots in chronological order
(x-axis = Year), then plotted number of eggs hatched and precipitation
on the y-axis. A clearer approach might have compared precipitation with
the number of eggs hatched, by rearranging the data according to the quantity
of precipitation.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Students had the most difficulty in constructing their principles/ concepts,
with respectively 32% (pre) and 49% (post) of the students identifying
concepts and principles sought in the knowledge claim (Possible Score =
2). Few students, on the post-vee, developed non-redundant principles/concepts
(13%, Possible Score = 3) and only 3% went one step further by operationalizing
the concepts (Possible Score = 4).</font></p>

<center><p><u><font FACE="Times New Roman">Conclusions</font></u></p></center>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When science methods courses emphasize investigations and the processes
involved in &quot;doing science,&quot; prospective elementary/middle level
teachers generally show a sign)ficant reduction in anxiety about using
investigations in the classroom. In terms of the sections of the vee diagram,
the prospective teachers tended to move to maximum scores on the more concrete
levels of the vee diagram, objects/events and records, as well as the focus
question. The conceptual side of the vee diagram and the more abstract
portions of the methodological side of the vee diagram showed the least
change. Students continued to show problems in the following more creative
aspects of investigating:</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><font FACE="Times New Roman">In the principles and concepts, students
identified concepts and principles sought in the knowledge claim.</font></li>

<li><font FACE="Times New Roman">In the transformations, students need
to take the risk and restructure the data in such a way that it clearly
answers the focus question.</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The often heard rhetoric of &quot;hands-on, minds-on&quot; science is lacking
tools to make thatconnection possible. The vee diagram is just such a tool.
In this study, the elementary/middle level methods students showed improvement
in the use of this tool and in the willingness to&nbsp; engage in investigations,
but they also had difficulty with the &quot;minds-on&quot; portion of the
investigation. The challenge is captured by the following statement by
Hodson (1992)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p><font FACE="Times New Roman">. . . doing science is not just theory-driven,
it is <i>experience driven, </i>and . . . a major element in a scientist's
ability to do science successfully is the steady accumulation of the tacit

investigations, should be a major priority in science education (p. 136).</font></p>
