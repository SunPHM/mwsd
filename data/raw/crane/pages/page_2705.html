Have you noticed that days are getting noticeably longer? The Sandhill cranes have,
			and they are some of the first birds to feel a surge of spring restlessness. By Valentine's
			Day, migrants that had wintered in New Mexico and other southern areas appear along
			the Platte River in Nebraska. In this critical resting place, each pair spends three
			or four weeks building up body fat and hormones before completing their long migration
			and starting to nest. Some of them will migrate through central Nebraska, fly up
			to far northwestern Alaska, and cross the Bering Strait into Siberia! The fat they
			put on in Nebraska is the fuel that will power their flight over those long miles.
			After a day of pigging out on the leftovers from last year's corn harvest in fields
			and meadows, they retreat to the river every evening to sleep standing close together
			in shallow water and on the sandbars. The river is shallow enough for them to stand
			in while deep enough to discourage most predators.<BR>
			The cranes--about 80-90% of all the Sandhill Cranes in the mid-continent population--stop
			at the short stretch of the Platte River between Lexington and Chapman, Nebraska.
			Bill Taddicken, assistant manager of the National Audubon Society's <A HREF="http://rowesanctuary.org/
">Lillian
			Annette Rowe Sanctuary</A>, told Journey North he first noticed cranes on February
			9 or 10. By the 19th, there were fewer than 500 along the river, but every day Bill
			sees more than the day before. About 500,000 cranes descend on this short stretch
			of river every spring. Some leave before others arrive, and the peak number present
			at one time is about 350,000! So many cranes in a small area makes for terrific crane
			watching! Pull out a map and see if you can answer:

You may have seen the film &quot;Fly Away Home,&quot; where geese learned their migration
			route by following an ultralight airplane instead of their parents. Now Sandhill
			Cranes are helping scientists develop successful rearing and migration techniques
			to use with endangered whooping cranes. On October 3, 2000, 13 Sandhill Cranes followed
			an ultralight plane in Operation Migration, an exciting migration experiment co-founded
			by Bill Lishman and Joe Duff. This migration ended successfully when two ultralights
			landed at the St. Martins Marsh Aquatic Refuge in Florida with 11 cranes on the 11th
			day of the 11th month; Veterans Day in the United States, Remembrance Day in Canada.
			As soon as government approval is gained, crane experts will use the information
			gathered to show the same migratory route to the world's first reintroduced flock
			of migratory Whooping Cranes. Team Leader Joe Duff and Lead Pilot Bill Lishman predicted
			the 1065-mile trip would take 32 days, but at day 17 they weren't even halfway. Why?
			What happened when one of their cranes dropped out to join a wild flock of Sandhill
			Cranes along the way? What was the toughest part of the whole project? Watch for
			these history-making cranes in the news this spring to see if they will fly away
			back home to Wisconsin, all on their own. Now read highlights from the Operation
			Migration Journal here:

<A NAME="High"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>High Wire Hazards</B></FONT><BR>
			Journey North's Laura Erickson visited Nebraska to observe the crane migration in
			early March 1996 and won't forget what she saw. Below-zero temperatures, high winds,
			and huge chunks of ice in the river made conditions very dangerous for the cranes.
			Worst of all, biologists had found at least 17 dead cranes under the power lines
			that cross the river in several places. For some reason, birds have a very difficult
			time seeing wires, and with the high winds were having problems enough controlling
			their flight.<BR>
			While Laura was there, people at the Rowe Sanctuary told her they were trying to
			raise money to put special little devices called Bird Flight Diverters (BFDs) on
			the wires. BFDs are small, simple coils, but when placed every 2 meters along a wire
			somehow help the cranes to notice the wires before bonking into them. The BFDs are
			inexpensive, but the Sanctuary needed to raise thousands of dollars because power
			company crews had to use a lot of equipment and people to actually put them on the
			wires. They finished the job in fall 2000, so this will be the first &quot;wire-safe&quot;
			migration since the power lines were built. Let's hope for smoother sailing for the
			cranes!

			&quot;Why do you think cranes have difficulties seeing wires? How do you think little

			Laura Erickson just spent five days in central Florida, where Sandhill Cranes live
			year-round. In one neighborhood in a city called Lake Placid, cranes walk through
			people's backyards, and even come to bird feeders filled with cracked corn! Laura
			watched one crane pick up a snake, shake and toss it, pick it up again, shake and
			toss it again, and again, until the snake was dead. The crane didn't eat it, but
			threw the dead snake in a little pond. Laura was too far away to see what species
			the snake was, but talked to some people who had seen a coral snake in the area the
			day before. Do you think the cranes suspected that this snake could be poisonous?
			<BR>
			Cranes in Florida nest earlier than those going to Canada and the northern states.
			Every crane Laura saw was with its mate, and sometimes pairs were dancing. As cranes
			become more interested in romance, they start their courtship dance. Each pair spreads
			its wings and jumps and leaps into the air in a beautiful display that helps cement
			their pair bond. <BR>
