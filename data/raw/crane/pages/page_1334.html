Working high atop one of the two tower cranes on OHSU's biomedical research building construction site, J.J. Sisson says he thrives on the challenges of his job.
</p>



<p>
"I like being in a specialty trade that not everyone can handle," he said, "where there is no room for mistakes."
</p>

<p>
The challenges start with climbing a 200-foot ladder to the crane's cab, sometimes enduring severe weather. And during peak periods of construction crane operators may work 12 to 14 hours a day, performing tasks that require patience, a steady hand and concentration. As a rule, operators don't come down until the end of a shift, eating lunch inside the cab or outdoors on the back of the crane. 
</p>

<p>
Typically the loads that Sisson moves with a hook attached to the crane's boom weigh between 500 pounds and  5,000 pounds. All the while, the crane is twisting and teetering and rocking in the wind - and the operator must perform tasks smoothly and efficiently without causing injury or damage.
</p>

<p>
It takes timing, rhythm and good judgment to operate a crane well, Sisson said. "You also need excellent hand-eye coordination and depth perception and must be 100 percent alert no matter what," he added.
</p>

<p>
At the patient care facility site Anson Barrow operates the tower crane closest to the hospital. "You take on a lot of responsibility as a crane operator," Barrow said. "First and foremost you have to be safety conscious - you have to be almost psychic, anticipate everything and communicate clearly."
</p>

<b class="head3">Facts about tower cranes</b><BR>
&#149; Four tower crane operators, two per site, do much of the heavy lifting to distribute products, materials and equipment for the patient care facility and biomedical research building construction sites. Some of the cranes also help assemble portions of the buildings.<BR>
&#149; Four cranes are required because of limited access and difficult terrain. <BR>
&#149; The crane cabs are approximately five feet square and six feet tall.<BR>
&#149; The bellman is the crane operator's eyes and ears on the ground. The two communicate primarily via two-way radio. The bellman makes sure material is rigged properly and coordinates crane activity with the various trades. 
</p>

<p>
One of Barrow's critical responsibilities is keeping in touch with the Emergency Communications Center (ECC) in OHSU's Emergency Department, which coordinates Life Flight and other emergency air transport arrivals and departures with the crane operators. "I contact ECC first thing each morning to let them know I'm starting and running the crane all day," he said.
</p>


<p>
A protocol ensures safety and gives crane operators the longest possible advance warning concerning a helicopter's arrival. "All four cranes must stop movement until a helicopter lands and is totally shut down," said Sherrie Forsloff, ED administrative manager. ECC sends priority pages to the operators twice: first when an emergency helicopter is outbound or just landed to pick up a patient and again when the chopper is lifting off with the patient on board, generally about five minutes from OHSU.
</p>

<p>
"We want to make sure the patient, the crew, the crane operator and everyone on the ground is safe while giving the crane operators maximum use of their time," Forsloff said. "We've had no major problems, and the protocol continues to work well."
</p>

<p>
Meantime Sisson and Barrow are in agreement concerning what their greatest challenge is: working in the fog. When you can't see the ground, they said, you have to rely on instinct.
