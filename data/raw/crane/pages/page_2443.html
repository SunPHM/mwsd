<h4>An uncommon visitor to the Long Point Marshes during it's migration to it's nesting grounds in the tundra lands of North America. A uniform colour of grey with a bare red cap and it's large size with long legs will identify this rare visitor. The Sandhill Crane likes to eat rodents, frogs and insects. When one who is familiar with the marsh sounds of Long Point hears a very different loud musical rattle sound, they can very well expect to track down and witness a Sandhill Crane.</h4>
