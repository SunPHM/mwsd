        WHOOPING CRANE PROJECT REACHES MILESTONE</font></h2>
      <p>A young whooping crane survived dogs, eagles, cold temperatures and drought 
        to become the firstof its kind to fledge in the wild in the United States 
        in 63 years. The fledgling, dubbed &#147;Lucky&#148; by volunteers, made 
        history on June 7 when it spread its mighty wings and flew effortlessly 
        across the Leesburg marsh in which it was hatched and reared by first-time 
        parents.<br>
        <img src="leesburg%20chick%20fly1%20copy.jpg" width="400" height="276" align="right" border="3"><br>
        &#147;There are fewer than 400 whooping cranes left in the world and this 
        bird&#146;s history-making flight is a significant milestone in our efforts 
        to restore the whooping crane to its former range in the Southeastern 
        United States,&#148; said Steve Nesbitt, non-migratory whooping crane 
        project leader for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
        (FWC).<br>
        <br>
        Biologists and volunteers have closely monitored the Leesburg whoopers 
        since the pair arrived at the small wetland area last December and began 
        showing an interest in nesting there. By mid-February the female was sitting 
        on eggs and on March 12, Lucky, the first of two chicks, hatched. Two 
        days later the second chick hatched but survived only a few hours before 
        it was taken by a bald eagle.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;While it&#146;s sad that the second chick was taken so quickly, 
        it is normal for whooping cranes to hatch two chicks but raise only one,&#148; 
        said Marty Folk, FWC biological field coordinator for the non-migratory 
        whooping crane project.<br>
        The fact that Lucky has fledged, meaning it can fly on its own, and now 
        has essentially the same chance for survival as its parents, is a giant 
        step for this project. The Non-Migratory Whooping Crane Reintroduction 
        Project began nearly 22 years ago, with 13 years of preliminary study 
        of sandhill cranes before the first captive-reared whooping crane was 
        released in Florida in 1993.<br>
        <br>
        Since then four chicks have hatched in the wild &#150; the two in Leesburg 
        this year, and two in Osceola County in 2000. The only survivor is Lucky.<br>
        <br>
        For the past 11 years, Gene and Tina Tindell have lived on the edge of 
        the Leesburg wetland the whooping cranes decided to call home. One day 
        in December they saw a couple of large white birds in the marsh they had 
        never seen before. At first they thought they were sandhill cranes but 
        then realized there was something just a little different about them.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;I didn&#146;t know what whooping cranes looked liked, but we knew 
        those birds were something special when we saw the radio transmitters 
        attached to their legs. I figured we&#146;d be hearing from the Fish and 
        Wildlife Commission before long,&#148; said Gene Tindell.<br>
        <font color="#006633"></font><font color="#006633"><font color="#006633"><img src="leesburg%20cm-84d%20copy.jpg" width="216" height="224" align="left" border="3"></font></font><br>
        And sure enough they did when biologist Jeanette Parker arrived one day 
        during her daily monitoring of the birds.<br>
        &#147;I asked her if she hadlost something,&#148; Tindell said, smiling. 
        &#147;She told me, &#145;No, I know right where they<font color="#006633"></font> 
        are.&#146;&#148; That began the Tindell&#146;s role as volunteer crane 
        observers, a job they took on willingly and now can claim to have been 
        a part of something few if any other people ever have.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;The Tindells, because of where they live and the countless hours 
        they&#146;ve spent watching these birds, have now witnessed more in the 
        life of a whooper family than anyone else on earth,&#148; said Folk.<br>
        <br>
        They&#146;ve seen bald eagles attack the chicks, they&#146;ve seen dogs 
        chasing the birds and the birds chasing cats, they&#146;ve seen the intimate 
        communication between parents and young, and they saw Lucky take to the 
        sky for the first time.<br>
        &#147;It was like seeing a baby take its first steps,&#148; said Tindell. 
        &#147;It&#146;s a relief really because now he has a better chance for 
        survival, but in a way we hated to see it because we know now he&#146;s 
        going to leave.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        But Lucky probably won&#146;t leave too soon. The chick will likely remain 
        with its parents until a few weeks before they begin to nest again - probably 
        in January or February. In the meantime, they will teach the youngster 
        everything it needs to learn to survive without them.<br>

        <font size="-1"><i>By Robert P. King, Reprinted in full with permission

      <p>For decades, Johnny and Mariana Jones cajoled lawmakers and governors 
        to save Florida&#146;s wild landscape. <br>
        Now they&#146;re a permanent part of it. <br>
        <br>
        The state has renamed a wildlife area in Martin and Palm Beach counties 
        after the West Palm Beach couple, whose legacy includes the Kissimmee 
        River restoration, the Big Cypress National Preserve and crucial state 
        efforts to buy environmentally valuable land. <br>
        <br>
        The state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission approved the naming 
        unanimously at a meeting in May 2002 in St. Augustine. The 10,294-acre 
        site north of Beeline Highway is now called the John C. and Mariana Jones/Hungryland 
        Wildlife and Environmental Area. <br>
        <br>
        Best of all, Johnny Jones said Thursday, he and his wife didn&#146;t have 
        to die before receiving such an honor. <br>
        &#147;I worked hard for a lot of years to do a lot of things, and my wife 
        worked just as hard as I did,&#148; said Jones, 69, who still lives in 
        the Haverhill Road home where the couple ran the Florida Wildlife Federation 
        in the 1970s and &#146;80s. &#147;The only thing was, I got all the credit.&#148; 
        <br>
        <br>
        &#147;It was a nice surprise,&#148; Mariana Jones said. &#147;You don&#146;t 
        expect to see an honor like that.&#148; <br>
        <br>
        It&#146;s richly deserved, other environmentalists said. <br>
        <br>
        &#147;There are huge pieces of Florida that were saved from development 
        because Johnny Jones was there,&#148; said Charles Lee, senior vice president 
        of Audubon of Florida. <br>
        <br>
        In their heyday, Johnny Jones was executive director of the Wildlife Federation 
        while Mariana Jones was the group&#146;s executive secretary. They allied 
        themselves with such leading environmentalists as Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
        and ecologist Art Marshall, and befriended such powerful politicians as 
        then-Gov. Bob Graham. <br>
        <br>
        Their work won Johnny Jones a reputation as one of the state&#146;s most 
        influential lobbyists - and one of its most pugnacious and hard-charging. 
        He estimates they won passage of 67 state laws, including programs that 
        have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to conserve land. <br>
        <br>
        The Joneses grew up in West Palm and married 53 years ago, when he was 
        16 and she was 15. <br>
        <br>
        More than 30 years ago, Mariana recalled, she and her husband used to 
        hunt and fish on the land that now bears their name. <br>
        <br>
        &#147;Long after Johnny and you and I are gone, that name will still be 
        there,&#148; said Wildlife Fed-<br>
        eration President Manley Fuller. &#147;I think that&#146;s very fitting.&#148;

          BUST By UNDERCOVER OFFICERS<img src="GREEN%20TURTLE.jpg" width="250" height="221" align="right"></font></h2>
      </div>
      <p>A 43-year-old Riviera Beach man was jailed recently after allegedly selling 
        a dozen protected marine turtle eggs for $30 to an undercover officer 
        with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).<br>
        &#147;Another 324 sea turtle eggs were found in the back of the defendant&#146;s 
        pickup truck parked under a car port at his address,&#148; FWC Capt. Jeff 
        Ardelean said. &#147;The raw eggs were packaged in 27 plastic bags while 
        egg fragments were found on the ground nearby.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Officers also found a three-foot wooden staff caked with sand and what 
        officers believe is sea turtle embryonic fluid. Ardelean said turtle poachers 
        commonly use poles to probe for buried sea turtle nests along the beaches.<br>
        The arrest occurred at approximately 7:30 p.m., Wednesday, July 10 in 
        the street in front of the suspect&#146;s home. The defendant was booked 
        at Palm Beach County Jail around midnight, and made an initial appearance 
        in court the next morning. Bail was denied.<br>
        <br>
        The man was charged with violation of the U. S. Endangered Species Act 
        punishable by up to one year in jail and a $50,000 fine, and violation 
        of the federal Lacey Act punishable by five years in jail and a $20,000 
        fine. The defendant was charged federally because potential penalties 
        are more severe than state charges, Ardelean said.<br>
        The eggs are probably either loggerhead sea turtles or green sea turtles, 
        both protected under federal and state law, Ardelean said. DNA testing 
        will determine the species. Lab tests will also determine if the fluid 
        coating the probe stick is sea turtle embryonic fluid.<br>
        <br>
        FWC officers conducted a consent search of the defendant&#146;s home following 
        the arrest where they discovered two rifles in his room. Ardelean said 
        the weapons were seized since the defendant is a convicted felon. The 
        U. S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is pursuing possible charges.<br>
        <br>
        The FWC surveillance team was assisted by Officer Bill Calvert with the 
        U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, headquartered at the Loxahatchee National 
        Wildlife Refuge in Palm Beach County. <br>
        <br>
        Ardelean said the 341 eggs probably represented the content of three to 
        four sea turtle nests. July is the peak of the sea turtle nesting season 
        along south Florida beaches. A frequent target of turtle egg poachers 
        is J. D. McArthur Beach State Park located near Riviera Beach.<br>
        <br>
        Sea turtle eggs are considered a delicacy among certain ethnic groups 
        while some incorrectly believe that the eggs are an aphrodisiac. Similar 
        myths pose a threat to other wildlife species including the eastern black 
        bear whose gall bladder is considered an aphrodisiac by many Orientals.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;A thriving black market exists for the sale of these sea turtle 
        eggs,&#148; Ardelean said. &#147;Most of the poaching occurs between midnight 
        and 4 a.m. And, since our officers must cover hundreds of miles of beaches 
        it is extremely difficult to catch violators.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Prices for the endangered sea turtle eggs are market driven, but Ardelean 
        said the price appears about $5 higher for a dozen eggs compared to last 
        year. Cooked eggs bring higher prices.</p>

        <font color="#006633">BUSH, FLORIDA CABINET CALL for end to DREDGING in 
        APALACHICOLA RIVER</font></font></h2>
      <p>Governor Jeb Bush and the Florida Cabinet voted unanimously for a resolution 
        to end dredging in the 109-mile Apalachicola River that stretches from 
        the Georgia border through the Panhandle to the Gulf of Mexico. The resolution 
        asks the U.S. Congress to pass legislation to stop the U.S. Army Corps 
        of Engineers from dredging the waterway to maintain a shipping channel 
        for barges, a project that costs American taxpayers $20 million annually 
        or about $30,000 per barge.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;It&#146;s incredibly expensive &#150; higher than the $600 toilet 
        seat the Department of Defense used to buy,&#148; said Governor Jeb Bush. 
        &#147;With all the environmental damage, and the cost, it simply doesn&#146;t 
        make sense.&#148;<br>
        Dredging destroys the river&#146;s bottomlands, which provide a critical 
        habitat for aquatic species at the base of the food chain. Sand dredged 
        from the bottom of the river is dumped along the banks, which chokes native 
        vegetation and destroys natural habitats. For every dollar spent on dredging, 
        the Corps estimates an economic benefit of only 40 cents.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;The cost of dredging outweighs the benefit &#150; both environmentally 
        and economically,&#148; said DEP Secretary David B. Struhs. &#147;Ending 
        the expensive practice of dredging will improve water quality and restore 
        the natural aquatic habitats of the Apalachicola River, which are essential 
        to sustaining the ecosystem and the local economy.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        In terms of flow, the Apalachicola is the largest river in Florida and 
        provides a natural habitat for many rare, threatened and endangered plant 
        and animal species. Apalachicola Bay supports an excellent recreational 
        and commercial fishery &#150; producing 90% of Florida&#146;s oysters 
        and the state&#146;s third largest shrimp harvest. The local economy depends 
        on the fishery, which has annual seafood landings reaching millions of 
        dollars dockside.<br>
        <br>
        Also, Florida officials agreed to a 30-day extension of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint 
        (ACF) River Compact, which was established in 1997 as a means for Florida, 
        Georgia and Alabama to develop an interstate agreement for sharing water 
        in the river system. Florida wants to ensure an adequate flow of water 
        for natural systems in the Apalachicola River and Bay.<br>
        <br>
        *Editors note: Senators Graham and Nelson will introduce legislation to 
        deauthorize dredging on the Apalachicola and to commission a restoration 
        study to be conducted by the U.S. Army Corps, federal natural resource 
        agencies and the state of Florida.<br>

        <font color="#006633">PLANTING in JULY PRODUCES DOVES in OCTOBER</font></font></h2>
      <p><img src="Dove.jpg" width="250" height="194" align="left">The first flights 
        of doves in October seem to be a distant dream when July temperatures 
        soar into the 90s, but now is the time to prepare to enjoy those mild 
        hunting afternoons in the dove field.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Grain crops for doves must be planted by mid to late July to mature 
        before the opening of dove season in October,&#148; said Dewey Weaver, 
        public information coordinator for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation 
        Commission (FWC).<br>
        <br>
        Although federal law prohibits dove hunting over baited fields, it is 
        legal to hunt doves over standing crops, including those that have been 
        mowed or disked. Brown-top millet is a prime food for mourning doves. 
        However, you can also plant sunflowers, grain sorghum and other grain-type 
        crops.<br>

        &#147;Millet matures quickly, is easy to grow, and is well-suited for 
        Florida,&#148; Weaver said. &#147;It does a good job of attracting doves 
        if you plant a minimum of about 10-15 acres and mow or lightly disk it 
        in alternating rows after it matures to provide seed and bare ground for 
        the doves. Bigger fields seem to be even better.&#148; <br>
        <br>
        By planting part of the field around mid-July and another section a few 
        weeks later, dove hunters can extend a field&#146;s attractiveness to 
        the birds, because the second planting matures later in the season. <br>
        <br>
        County agricultural extension offices or the Commission&#146;s regional 
        offices can also further advise landowners about which crop is best for 
        specific areas.<br>
        <br>
        For those hunters without access to private fields, the FWC offers dove 
        hunting annual permits for a number of locations throughout the state. 
        Visit the FWC's website below for locations.<br>
        <br>
        The cost of an annual dove-hunting permit is $150. Applications are available 
        from FWC offices or on the FWC Web site at <a href="http://www.floridaconservation.org">www.floridaconservation.org</a>.

        <font color="#006633">FWC RECOGNIZES AMOS MORRIS</font></font></h2>
      <p>When the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) met 
        in St. Augustine, Commissioners honored Jackson County resident Amos Morris 
        for his more than 22 years of volunteer service to the FWC and the people 
        of Florida.<br>
        <br>
        Morris, who is 70, and his wife, Aline, live in the community of Kynesville, 
        just south of Cottondale. Morris is retired from the logging industry 
        but one of his passions continues to be his involvement with the Wildlife 
        Alert Reward Association.<br>
        <br>
        In October 1979, Morris was asked to serve as one of the original 13 citizen 
        members of the Wildlife Alert Reward Association committee. Wildlife Alert 
        was only the second such reward program of its type in existence and designed 
        for the public to get information about wildlife and fish violations directly 
        to the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission (GFC).<br>
        <br>
        In 1999 the GFC changed to the FWC, but Wildlife Alert continues to be 
        one of the most successful fish and wildlife violation reporting programs 
        in the nation. The program has recently expanded its mission to include 
        marine fishery violations. Since its inception, Wildlife Alert has led 
        to more than 20,000 arrests and paid out more than $300,000 in rewards. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &#147;When I was asked to serve I just wanted to be part of helping to 
        protect and restore wildlife and fish populations,&#148; Morris said. 
        &#147;The way the public has gotten involved shows that people care when 
        it comes to wildlife laws.&#148;<br>
        As the saying goes, Morris has not only &#147;talked the talk, he&#146;s 
        walked the walk.&#148; A few years ago Morris and his brother were fishing 
        at a lake in south Florida when he overheard a discussion about the illegal 
        sale of alligator meat. Morris contacted agency investigators and his 
        information led to a lengthy investigation and the arrest of several people 
        involved in commercially trafficking in alligator, deer and turkey.<br>
        <br>
        Morris is one of only two of the original appointees to the Wildlife Alert 
        committee that are still serving. The other is Mrs. Peggy Johnson of Miami, 
        a long time supporter of the Florida Wildlife Federation. Morris has served 
        as chairman of the Wildlife Alert committee since the mid 80s.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to being an avid fisherman and hunter, Morris is well known 
        in Jackson County where he often cooks for large groups.</p>

        FWF SPONSORS WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PROFICIENCY AWARD<img src="ffa.jpg" width="300" height="190" align="left" border="3"></font></h2>
      <p>The Florida Future Farmers of America Foundation (FFA) has awarded Jimbo 
        Gladwell the Wildlife Management Proficiency Award for 2002. Other finalists 
        recognized were Herbert Brown, Ryan Monk, Patrick Robinson and Tyler Stoutamire. 
        Each year these awards are sponsored by the Florida Wildlife Federation.<br>
        <br>
        Wildlife Management Proficiency involves activities to improve the availability 
        of fish and wildlife or improve existing habitat for wildlife. Gladwell's 
        project included implementing a wildlife program that would increase the 
        number of deer and turkey on his family's property and decrease the number 
        of wild hogs and predators.<br>
        <br>
        FFA is a national organization of students preparing for leadership and 
        careers in the science, business and technology of agriculture with chapters

      <h2><font color="#006633">ENDANGERED FLORIDA PANTHERS HAVE <br>
        GOOD NEWS FROM The NURSERY</font></h2>
      <p>A rare event in the population of the endangered Florida Panther at the 
        Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) has occurred. Two litters 
        from two female panthers were simultaneously recorded on the refuge near 
        Naples, Florida. This year&#146;s births are a highlight for the refuge 
        in the recovery of the imperiled cousin of the mountain lion or cougar. 
        Only 80 to 100 Florida panthers remain in the wild, making Florida&#146;s 
        official state animal one of the most endangered mammals in the world. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &#147;We&#146;re also pleasantly surprised about the size of the litters,&#148; 
        said Sam D. Hamilton, Southeast Regional Director of the U.S. Fish and 
        Wildlife Service &#147;The dens produced three kittens in one litter and 
        four in the other.&#148; <br>
        <br>
        There are many reasons for the demise of the animal&#146;s population. 
        Because of unfounded fears for livestock and human safety, bounties were 
        placed on the cats from the late 1800&#146;s through the 1950&#146;s, 
        greatly diminishing their numbers. However, today other factors threaten 
        the species recovery.<br>
        <br>
        &#147;Car collisions have killed over 44 panthers since 1972,&#148; said 
        Ben Nottingham, Deputy Refuge Manager from the Florida Panther NWR. &#147;Also, 
        aggression among the male cats has caused other deaths. However, the biggest 
        cause of diminished numbers is loss of habitat.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        Hamilton added, &#147;The panther deaths from car collisions can be greatly 
        reduced if people will share a little of their time with the animals and 
        slow down to the posted speed limits.&#148;<br>
        <br>
        The extensive development over the last few decades has greatly reduced 
        the panther&#146;s preferred habitat of hardwood hammocks and pine flatwoods 
        as well as wet prairies, marshes and swamp forests. <br>
        <br>
        Florida panthers are most active at night and usually avoid one another 
        except during breeding season. Adult males defend territories averaging 
        200 miles while females have territories of 75 square miles. Kittens weigh 
        around a pound and are born with their eyes closed. Their mother nurses 
        them for about 2 months until they are able to eat fresh meat. <br>
        <br>
        Florida panthers, like all cougars, stalk and ambush their prey. They 
        leap distances of more than 15 feet and rely on surprise. The cats run 
        up to 35 miles an hour for short distances. Panthers prefer large animals 
        such as deer and wild pigs but will eat smaller game such as raccoons, 
        armadillos, rabbits and even alligators.<br>
        <br>
        While the Florida panther appears similar to other cougars, it is distinctly 
        different. Its fur is darker, shorter, and coarser. Although, the Florida 
        panther has a smaller body size and feet than its cousins, it has longer 
        legs. Other differences are found in skull size measurements, a distinctive 
        cowlick in the middle of the back, and a right-angle crook at the end 
        of the tail.<br>
        <br>
        The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is actively working with a number of 
        federal and state agencies such as the Florida Department of Environmental 
        Protection as well as private organizations to save the Florida pant<font color="#006633"></font>her 
        from extinction and develop healthy populations free of several genetic 
        problems that have shown up over the years.<br>
