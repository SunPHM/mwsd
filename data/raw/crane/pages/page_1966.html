<p><font size="3" face="Arial">If you want to have the unique opportunity to see wild Whooping Cranes up close and personal, if you want to spend a day or two or three surrounded by nature and unbothered by anything else or if you just want to get away from it all - you have check out The Crane House.<p></p>  Located near Rockport, Texas, this is a wonderful B&B that very comfortable, very well provisioned and quite reasonable.  Al and Diane Johnson have 800 plus acres that you are free to roam but if you just stay on the porch you will see Whooping Cranes, Sand Hill Cranes, Javalinas, White tail deer, and a great variety of other birds.<p><center><a href="http://www.cranehouseretreat.com/">Click here to visit the Crane House Website</a></center></font>
