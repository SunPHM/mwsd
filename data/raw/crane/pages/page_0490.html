               a permit from Transportation &amp; Environmental Services. Such

          <P>A permit for work in/use of the public right-of-way should be applied
            for five (5) working days prior to the start of the work. A drawing
            may be required showing the location of the work/use and equipment,
            along with a maintenance of traffic plan, depending on the work requested.
            Please note that if the drawing is not clear, or if the maintenance
            of traffic plan is not adequate, these will be returned for clarification.
            If reserved parking is needed, it must be applied for no later than
            three business days prior to when it is needed (weekends and holidays
            excluded). See the sheet for Temporary Parking Regulations, attached,
            for requirements and fees. <strong>Please note that all drawings are required
            to have a North arrow so that the exact location of the work can
          be determined.</strong></P>

                reasonably and practicably have been obtained beforehand, the

            Notification must be given to surrounding residents/businesses 24
                 hours before any work is to begin. Excavations which will take
                five (5) days or longer to complete will require
                notification to the residents/businesses two (2) weeks prior
                to starting any work. Before any digging begins, you must call
                Miss Utility at  1-800-552-7001, call Traffic Control for underground
                traffic conduit locations at 703-838-4664, and call Sewer Maintenance
                at 703-838-4488 for sewer locations. Each day, before work begins,
                you must call this office for a control number. You may do this
                by calling 703-838-4324 after 7:00 a.m. Failure to have a control
                number each day will result in your job being closed down for
                that day. Per city code section 5-2-148, a surcharge will be
                added to the permit fee when a street which has been paved within
                the past 5 years is cut. Openings in excess of 50 feet in length
                will have an additional surcharge. When steel plates are left
                in the roadway, warning signs must be used in each direction
                warning motorists of steel plates ahead. Flashing lights may
                also be required. During winter months, you must contact the
                Maintenance Division at 703-838-4488 to report steel plate locations.
                Cut sheets must be submitted and approved prior to installation
                of sewers or curbs and gutters before any excavation may take
                place. When all work has been completed, you must call 703-838-4324
