    <p>ABILENE &#151; Like it did last season, the Crane High School football team saw another
    dream season come to an end on a cool, slate-gray day at Shotwell Stadium.</p>
    <p>However, it was different because the Golden Cranes were a round deeper in the playoffs
    than they were last season, when they were beaten 10-7 by Childress in the quarterfinals.
    And there was a lot more at stake.</p>
    <p>With a berth in the Class 3A Division II state championship game on the line, the No.
    6-ranked Cranes were stunned 30-0 by the No. 3 Commerce Tigers in a state semifinal before
    approximately 8,000 fans.</p>
    <p>Commerce improved to 15-0 with the win and will play Sealy at 7 p.m. next Saturday at
    Texas Stadium. Sealy has beaten Commerce twice in the 3A state title game in the 1990s.
    Crane, which set a school record for playoff advancement, finished 14-1.</p>
    <p>&quot;They&#146;re great,&quot; Crane coach Alan Cherry said of the Tigers. &quot;We
    got beat by a better team today. But we have nothing to be ashamed of. Our kids played
    hard and I&#146;m proud of them. We&#146;re not gonna hold our heads down at all.</p>
    <p>&quot;We had a great season. We were 14-1 and I&#146;m telling you this is not a
    disappointment. We got beat by a great team and we&#146;re not gonna dwell on it.
    We&#146;re gonna learn from it, and the next time we get here, we&#146;re gonna make a
    difference.&quot;</p>
    <p>Cherry was right. Other than a few positions, the Cranes simply did not match up with
    the size or speed of the Tigers. Ironically, Crane was thought to have too much speed for
    almost all of the teams it played this season. That wasn&#146;t the case Saturday.</p>
    <p>That speed difference showed up especially in the Commerce secondary. Crane quarterback
    Clay McGuire, who had thrown just one interception all year, was picked off three times.
    Crane had a fourth interception when Manuel Rodriguez was picked off on a gadget play.
    McGuire also was hit while trying to throw in the fourth quarter, causing a fumble that
    served as Crane&#146;s fifth turnover.</p>
    <p>Of course, it didn&#146;t help that five of McGuire&#146;s passes were dropped by his
    receivers. The Cranes also had seven 5-yard penalties. Needless to say, none of those
    things added up to a recipe for success against a powerhouse Commerce team. The final
    score was a combination of the Cranes playing poorly and the Tigers being extremely good.</p>
    <p>&quot;You gotta hand it to &#145;em,&quot; a red-eyed McGuire said of Commerce.
    &quot;We played hard, but they just dominated us. No excuses. This is the worst game we
    ever played and the worst game I ever played.</p>
    <p>&quot;They were ready and I gotta hand it to &#145;em. Every time they were there.
    Those guys are just great athletes. It didn&#146;t seem like they did anything bad, had
    any bad plays.&quot;</p>
    <p>Even though Commerce jumped out to a 14-0 lead on Crane in the first quarter, the
    Cranes had a great chance to get right back into it at the beginning of the second. The
    Tigers&#146; Avin Johnson fumbled on the first play of a drive from his own 20-yard line
    and the ball was recovered by Crane&#146;s Willie Morris.</p>
    <p>On the next play, though, the Cranes tried a double-reverse pass and Rodriguez, trying
    to wait for a receiver, threw into the arms of Commerce&#146;s Greg Washington.</p>
    <p>However, it&#146;s the holiday season and Commerce was in a giving mood. Quarterback
    Chad Anderson kept on an option left but fumbled at the end of an 8-yard run. Crane&#146;s
    Cory Aguilar recovered and the Cranes were in business again, this time at the Commerce
    33-yard line at the 11:53 mark of the second.</p>
    <p>Again, though, the Cranes were unable to move. On fourth-and-one at the 24-yard line,
    the Cranes ran a fake right and McGuire threw to an open Lino Garcia, who dropped the
    ball.</p>
    <p>&quot;That hurt us,&quot; Cherry said of not capitalizing on the fumbles. &quot;Those
    were our opportunities and we didn&#146;t take advantage of them.&quot;</p>
    <p>After the teams exchanged punts, Commerce embarked on a 10-play scoring drive to make
    it 17-0 after a 23-yard field goal by Ryan Sienty. That kick came just after a
    controversial call in the end zone, where Antonio Burrell was ruled to have trapped a
    throw by Anderson.</p>
    <p>McGuire was intercepted by Tommy Wright at the Crane 33-yard line on the fourth play of
    the next drive, and Commerce drove in for a score that essentially put the game away. A
    7-yard completion from Anderson to Greg Washington was followed by a 26-yard pass to
    Johnson that made it 24-0 with 25 seconds to play in the half.</p>
    <p>&quot;That touchdown was ruled not a catch &#151; and our kid said it wasn&#146;t a
    catch &#151; and then we kicked a field goal. That was a downer,&quot; Commerce head coach
    Steve Lineweaver said. &quot;But then they got conservative down there and we got the ball
    back and scored before the half, and I thought that was the key.&quot;</p>
    <p>The first half was ugly for the Cranes. They were held to one first down, 29 rushing
    yards, and 15 passing yards. On the other hand, Commerce had 220 yards at the half, 143 of
    which came on the ground, and scored on four of eight possessions. Anderson was 2-of-5
    passing in the first half and both completions were touchdowns, the first of which was a
    35-yard toss to an amazingly wide-open Brodrick Kelley at 3:15 of the first quarter.</p>
    <p>Commerce&#146;s first score was a 5-yard run by Sienty, a bruising fullback who is
    being recruited by more than 20 Division I colleges. Sienty was the game&#146;s leading
    rusher, finishing with 90 yards on 17 carries.</p>
    <p>The third quarter was scoreless, but the Cranes played better and Commerce played like
    a team with a 24-point lead. The Tigers added a final score at 6:14 of the final quarter
    when Anderson scored from one yard out on a quarterback sneak. That came four plays after
    Washington&#146;s second interception.</p>
    <p>The Cranes finished with 73 rushing yards and McGuire passed for 102 yards, but both
    phases of their offense failed to generate much steam. For the day, Crane was 0-for-4 on
    fourth-down conversions. The Cranes, who averaged over 400 yards per game at times this
    season and went into Saturday&#146;s semifinal averaging more than 330 yards per game,
    were held to 175.</p>
    <p>&quot;We had the ball in the red zone two times, but we didn&#146;t execute like we
    should&#146;ve,&quot; said McGuire, a senior. &quot;It was just a couple of plays like
    that, and those hurt against a team like that.</p>
    <p>&quot;But I&#146;m happy for the guys. I&#146;m proud of them. Crane is gonna be good
    from now on. I think we&#146;ve set a good example. It feels good to be here, but it would
    be better if we were moving on to the next game.&quot; </p>
