<p><b><font size="+3" color="#004794">D</font></b>owntown&#146;s profile bristles these days with so many construction cranes &#151; six to 10 at any given time &#151; that they could be called the official bird of San Diego. Without them, not one of the city&#146;s high-rises would exist. But if passersby have become blas&eacute; about the behemoths, that&#146;s not true for those who work on them.</p>
<p>Earning salaries that can nudge nicely into six figures, crane workers are the rodeo cowboys of construction. Just as, say, a bronc rider checks the horse&#146;s straps before swinging aboard half a ton of fury, those who ride the big cranes take equal care &#151; and for much the same reason. They check that the slings and hook are rigged correctly before making a &#147;pick.&#148; They note the speed and direction of the wind, and monitor digital readouts and charts. They know that a lapse in attention, plus a sudden gust of wind, can start to topple a 165-ton crane. Or cause somebody to learn firsthand how the 1,000-pound headache ball got its name.</p>
<p>High atop the blue-and-white tower crane at Eighth and Island avenues, operator Jeff &#147;Surfer&#148; Andrews makes a slight turn with his hand and moves a million dollars&#146; worth of steel. An adrenaline-powered 45-year-old, Andre-ws sometimes talks to the calendar girl on the wall of his cab when it gets too solitary 230 feet up. But the conversations are short because every minute or two, the crackly voice of the ground supervisor comes over the walkie-talkie, letting Andrews know where the current load is going or where he will make the next pick.</p>
<p>From Andrews&#146; vantage point, the warehouse district is a collection of flattened boxes below. To the west, tiny sailboats head for open water on a breeze that makes the crane sway gently under Andrews&#146; feet. North and east, Hillcrest and Barrio Logan rise block by block into a hazy horizon. To the south, shipyard cranes look like steel birds dipping their beaks into massive gray cargo ships.</p>
<p>Inside the 4-by-6-foot cab, Andrews settles his compact, muscular frame into the leather swivel chair where he spends up to 14 hours a day. His deep tan dates as much from his years as a professional surfer in Hawaii as it does his many years in construction. Now, 23 stories above a condo project next to the ballpark site, a microwave heats up his lunch while Andrews, on his pager, dials in his wife Karen&#146;s number and adds 3838 07734. (At home, she turns her pager over and the upside-down digital numbers spell &#147;Hello Bebe.&#148;)</p>
<p>As he picks up an empty bleach bottle, he tells a visitor: &#147;We have everything up here &#151; this is if you need the bathroom.&#148; Glancing out the window, he slides a black joystick and the massive white horizontal jib below the cab swings in slo-mo like the baseball bat of a colossus. With another joystick, the hook bearing its load of steel bars 100 feet below begins to rise. But few people know they&#146;re watching turtle or greyhound in action.</p>
<p>The safety of a lift depends partly on knowing a snail from a turtle and a jackrabbit from a greyhound. A hoist-speed chart on the cab wall pictures each animal, followed by complex grids of numbers. Something small, like a pile of lumber, can be hoisted fast, at greyhound speed, but a multiton cement panel must be hoisted at a snail&#146;s pace.</p>
<p>Andrews constantly is monitoring a small black box which flickers with digitized numbers giving the weight of the load on the hook and its precise moment-to-moment distance from the tower. He has to think in several dimensions at once. Often the jib is moving sideways, and the hook is trolleying closer or away and simultaneously up or down. The jib has no brakes, so Andrews has to estimate ahead of time how far it will keep going after he lets off the power, compensating for the wind blowing, the tower moving in the wind, and the load shifting. The farther out a load is from the tower, the less load weight it takes for the crane to tip.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/cranes2.jpg" width="202" height="324" border="0" align="left">On tower cranes, an electronic sensor would normally set off a siren and shut off the crane&#146;s power before a major disaster could happen. The chances of tipping are somewhat greater on the smaller truck cranes. But any crane operator will say that exceeding the tipping fulcrum &#151; a definable point at which the crane will fall over &#151; would be his worst nightmare.</p>
<p>In his classic 600-page handbook &#147;Cranes and Derricks,&#148; Howard Shapiro says that, in the past 10 years, the public has gotten less tolerant of accidents while cranes have been getting bigger. Safety devices that work on paper, he says, sometimes fail on the job because there are so many variables, such as gusting, temperature extremes and human error.</p>
<p>Every type of crane has its particular hazards. Tom Coleman, supervising a condo project at 10th Avenue and F Street, says the front of his truck crane below the boom is called the &#147;hospital side of the load.&#148; The emergency room is where people end up if they get forgetful and stand in that spot during the pick, because the crane tends to jolt forward as it absorbs the weight on the hook.</p>
<p>On the &#147;big boys,&#148; the tall tower cranes scattered through Downtown, the tower&#146;s base is embedded in subterranean concrete. But the operator often works blind, depending on ground crew to tell him where the load on his hook is going. Andrews has never had a mishap. But at crane sites in general, the unexpected happens often enough to keep everyone on the alert.</p>
<p>When a crane accident happens, it happens big. Last February, a 32-ton crane flipped over the sea wall at Coronado Cays and landed in the bay. Jumping as the crane fell, the operator escaped with minor injuries. It took three cranes to lift the fallen one out of the water.</p>
<p>Those like Andrews who work on the cloudscrapers are a breed apart. Andrews says of the tower crane, &#147;It&#146;s one of the neatest Nintendo games ever made.&#148; High in the cab, he answers his cell phone, &#147;This is as close to God as you&#146;re gonna get without going there.&#148;</p>
