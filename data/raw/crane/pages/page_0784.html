            at 17, he attended every movie he could, with special attention paid 
            to John Wayne films. Then he joined the U.S. Navy, serving fourteen 
            weeks of boat training at Sampson, New York, followed by several 
            months of routine duty in Jacksonville, Florida. On discharge, he

                  but was confident of his ability. He would be willing to work 
                  in any capacity, in front of or behind the cameras, to get 
                  started. He enclosed a snap-shot of himself in Navy Whites,

            people in Hollywood who might be able to help if ever the aspiring 
            actor came to California. The reply wound up with: &quot;And the next

            this point, Hedison figured he should head for New York, to learn 
            something about acting. His father, however, thought Brown 
            University was the place for him, and so he reluctantly agreed to 
            give it a try. He quit after three years, and enrolled in the

            The following summer, he played four parts, all Indians, then 
            worked the following summer in &quot;Thunderland,&quot; which he calls &quot;a 
            sprawling outdoor pageant which plagues the countryside seasonally 
            in much the same way mosquitoes do.&quot;<BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneously, to 
            fill his daytime hours and his wallet, Hedison became an announcer 
            for a local radio station in Asherville. That autumn, he began his 
            second and last year at The Neighborhood Playhouse and graduated in 
            the spring. Hedison's final summer of stock was at The White Barn 
            Theater in Pittsburgh, where he played 14 leading roles in 15 weeks.
