<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#400080">Concessionaires Selected&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p><font size="5">
Bon Appetit</font></p>
<p>The <b> <font color="#400080"> Metropolitan Football Stadium District</font></b> <font color="#330066"> </font> and the
<b> Denver Broncos Football Club</b> have
selected two concessionaires to handle food service at the new stadium.&nbsp;
The board authorized the commencement of negotiations with Volume Services
America of Spartanburg, SC, and Epicurean Catering of Arapahoe County.&nbsp;
Both companies are expected to seek local food suppliers and vendors to support
their operations in the new stadium.</p>

<p>Volume Services America is expected to focus on general food and merchandise in the new
facility, while Epicurean Catering’s emphasis will be on premium food/beverage
services for the suites and non-NFL events.&nbsp; Craig Umbaugh, acting
executive director for the District, stressed the importance of selecting
concessionaires in the early stages of construction.&nbsp; “The concessionaire
plays an extremely important role in the design of the stadium’s
infrastructure.&nbsp; By consulting with the contractor in the design stages of
the building, utilities such as plumbing and electrical requirements can be
placed in appropriate places negating costly changes down the road.”
</p>
<p>Volume Services America is one of America’s largest providers of food,
beverage, merchandise, facility design, and management services for sports,
convention and entertainment venues.&nbsp; They have served as the caterer for
the Colorado&nbsp; Convention Center since it opened.&nbsp; Volume Services
America is the largest food service provider to NFL facilities serving fans of
the Washington Redskins and the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#400080">&quot;Contractor Corner&quot;&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Armendariz Construction Company of Delta, Colorado, is one of over 20 local contractors partnering with
the Turner/Empire/Alvarado construction team building the new stadium.&nbsp;
Armendariz is a sub-contractor of Phipps Baker, another partner.</p>
<p>With most of their 45 employees on site, Armendariz has been on the project since early this year. Armendariz is
charged with a number of tasks, including operating the onsite batch plant,
which provides concrete for the stadium project; tower crane operation;
fork-lift operation; and excavation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new stadium will require over 85,000 cubic yards of concrete, much of which will be produced at the
onsite batch plant operated by Armendariz. (The batch plant is neatly tucked
behind the TCI building close to I-25.)&nbsp; Once mixed, the concrete is
transported across temporary Bryant Street via cement truck to its destination
on site. Locating the batch plant adjacent to the site dramatically decreases
truck traffic in and out of the neighborhoods around the project.</p>
<p>Armendariz also employs six specialized crane operators for the job.&nbsp; Towering high above the stadium
the three tower cranes, ranging in height of 180 ft. to 240 ft., are visible
throughout the Central Platte Valley.</p>
<p>Lori Armendariz, along with her husband and company owner David, both Colorado natives, founded the minority
owned company about 11 years ago in western slope town of Delta.&nbsp; Lori
explains that in the mid 1980’s the Western slope economy was not doing very
well, “my husband and I moved to Denver, as the economy began to improve we
managed to move back to Delta.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Armendariz has worked on several projects on the western slope, New Mexico and Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Previous projects include environmental reclamation and excavation and highly
specialized uranium mill tailings remediation.</p>
<p>Lori and David Armendariz are both avid Bronco fans.</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#400080">Crane Operators take to the skies<!--mstheme--></font></h3>



<p>
Acrophobics need not apply. Five days each week
crane operators “JR” ( James Rohling) and Reggie Sanchez take to the skies high above the hustle and bustle of the
new NFL stadium construction activity some 180 ft. below.</p>
<p>Both men,
along with four other crane operators, employed by Armendariz Construction,
begin each morning with a cup of coffee, a full tank of gas and an arduous
climb to the top one of three tower cranes that occupy the skyline high above
the stadium site.</p>
<p >For JR (James Rohling) this is hat trick working on the new stadium. The 51 year old Colorado
native has operated cranes at Coors Field, the Pepsi Center and now, the latest
and greatest, new Mile High Stadium. With over 27 years of crane operation
experience under his belt, and a contagious smile on <img border="0" src="../images/crane.jpg" align="left" alt="Tower Crane" width="300" height="203"> his face, JR describes his
early beginnings as a crane operator on a small boom truck. Since then, cranes have become much more
sophisticated JR explains. The tower cranes can be erected in a day or two, but the technology is very complex. Each
of the three tower cranes is assisted in operation by an onboard computer,
which monitors a host of tasks necessary for its safe operation. “It even monitors the wind,” said
JR. “If the wind speed approaches 30 MPH a
warning sounds, if winds are sustained at 40 MPH for 10 seconds the crane will
automatically shut down.”</p>

<p>Three tower cranes currently occupy the site, the largest is 240 ft., followed by 180 ft.,
and the “baby” crane measures in at 140 ft. Tower cranes are measured by ‘hook height’ the actual height of the
crane can be much taller. The 180 ft. crane is also on rails which allows it to move horizontally on the ground, and
has a radius of 240 ft., and a capacity of 6,600 lbs. The crane weighs in a 440,000 lbs., all three are powered by
diesel generators. Because the site has three cranes running at any give time, communication among operators and
workers on the ground is key to their safe operation. Each of the operators are armed with a radios and keep in
constant contact with the other operators and workers on the ground. </p>

<p>Reggie Sanchez, 48, of Denver is another operator with over 25 years of
experience. Sanchez operates the tower crane that not only pivots but also moves on rails far below. 
Perched 180 ft. above the stadium field
Sanchez points out a yellow line painted across the tracks below. “If the base of my crane crosses that line,
the other crane operator knows his jib could hit me if he swings in my
direction. That line is one of many
precautions taken to ensure the safety of our workers.”</p>

<p>Each day brings its own challenges to the crane operators. Whether it’s hoisting scaffolding from one area of the project to
another or maneuvering concrete forms in place that might otherwise take many
men several days to relocate. One thing
both men agree on, watching the sunrise over Downtown Denver five days a week
never gets boring. </p>

<p><font color="#400080"><b>McNichols Arena has a date with the wrecking
ball<br>
</b></font>Plans have not been finalized, but preliminary discussions are underway for the
demolition of McNichols Arena.&nbsp; No future events will be held at the
facility and much of its content has been auctioned off.&nbsp; Demolition is
expected to take place in early 2000. </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#400080">MFSD introduces the STADIUM STORE<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>With the holidays just around the corner and shopping anxiety close behind, the
Metropolitan Football Stadium District has introduced the MFSD STADIUM
STORE just in time to make shopping for that “hard to shop for,”
friend or relative, a little easier.</p>
<p>In early stages, the Stadium Store will offer a few collector gift ideas including framed limited edition blueprints of the new stadium
elevations with all proceeds going towards the District’s public art and
education programs. Other items are
expected to be available in the near future. Visit the MFSD web site www.MFSD.com and click the Stadium Store
