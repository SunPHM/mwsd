			usually one of the first pairs to arrive in Wood Buffalo National Park, 2,600 miles to the north in the Northwest
			Territories of Canada.  The Pipeline Flats pair, the Middle Pond pair, and the Middle Sundown Bay family, have
			all departed from neighboring territories at Aransas. In contrast, no adult pairs or families have migrated from
			areas next to the Aransas Refuge, where whooping cranes also spend the winter. No birds have left from San Jose,
			Matagorda, or Welder Flats.  This chart shows where birds were as of my March 25 flight: <BR>

			<P><B>Challenge Question #<A NAME="4"></A>4</B><BR>
			&quot;When do young whooping cranes leave their parents for the first time?  And, since migration is so dangerous,
			why do you think the juveniles migrate 2,600 miles to the north if they're not going to nest?&quot;

			</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<P>(<A HREF="/jnorth/spring1999/species/crane/Update040199.html#How">To respond to this question, please follow
			the instructions below.</A>)<BR>
			<BR>
			I'll fly once a week over the marsh throughout April to monitor departures.  A majority of the cranes will leave
			between the 7-14 of April. A few of the younger, non-breeding cranes may still be here at the end of April before
			they fly north in early May.  You can use data from the chart above to graph the range of departure dates this
			year. Make a line graph showing the number of adults, young and total cranes still on the wintering grounds each
			week.<BR>
			<BR>
			This departure schedule may vary by about a week from year to year, but is remarkably consistent.  That is because
			the departures are based on hormonal changes the birds are undergoing that are related to the longer days in the
			spring. <BR>

			ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="8" VSPACE="8"></A>Even with so many cranes leaving within a short time period,
			they do not travel together. They leave in small groups of 2 or 3 cranes, at staggered starting times. Sometimes,
			two such units will join forces. So possibly 5 cranes, or occasionally a few more, may be flying together--but
			not the entire flock.<BR>
			<BR>
			The 15 whooping cranes that have started the migration are bound to encounter some spring snow storms.  Fortunately,
			they can tolerate cold weather very well and will simply wait until the storm is over to resume their journey.
			 Lets hope every crane has a safe trip.  With only 183 total in the wild flock, it is very important that nearly
			all of them survive the migration.<BR>

			Until next week,<BR>

			Watch the weather conditions along the Texas Gulf Coast this week, because the whooping cranes should be leaving
			any day!  After the migration begins, plan to keep a close eye on the skies of the Central Plains. During the month
			of April, whooping crane migration updates will be posted every Thursday, so you can follow their progress closely.
			 You'll need these daily weather maps to analyze the weather:

			According to Stehn, cranes usually depart when high pressure systems brings sunshine to Texas and winds from the
			south or east. Thermals and strong southeast winds provide ideal migration conditions.  In fact, all along their
			migration path, the whoopers wait for high pressure and favorable winds to continue their migration. <BR>
			<BR>
			The least favorable conditions for crane migration are low pressure systems with north winds. Low pressure systems
			are associated with storms. When the migrating whoopers encounter these storms with their north winds, the birds
			will quickly find a place to land.  They'll wait for several days until the north winds rotate back around to the
			south. <BR>
			<BR>
			During these storms, the whoopers will make short daily flights out to grain fields to feed, returning to wetlands
			where they will spend the night. It is during these short low altitude flights where they might collide with power
			lines and be killed, especially during rain or snow storms when the power lines are not very visible.

			One of the most important abilities of any migratory animal is its ability to tell time. An animal's very survival
			depends on being at the right place at the right time. The hormonal changes Tom Stehn mentions are controlled by
			invisible &quot;biological&quot; clocks that work within the cranes' bodies.<BR>
			<BR>
			Researchers have learned that people have over 100 &quot;biological&quot; clocks which control the rhythms of our
			lives. These clocks control sleep, hunger and energy cycles in interesting ways. In the lesson below, explore the
			concept of  time--and learn about your own biological clocks. Then consider the importance of biological clocks
			to migratory species. </P>
