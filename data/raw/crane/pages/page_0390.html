        <p>With modern road transport it can be difficult to realise that until 
          the 1950's the railways were the major form of transport of goods and 
          even the confines of the Isle of Wight a fleet of several hundreds of 
          wagons were required to carry the traffic on offer. The majority were 
          used for carrying coal from Medina Wharf to local merchants at many 
          of the stations but wagons for boats, cattle, chalk, coke, containers, 
          horses, oil, road vehicles, sand and gravel, sugar beet, timber and 
          general merchandise have all been required on the Island over the years. 
          The Isle of Wight Steam Railway collection reflects this diversity and 
          in addition to ex-Island stock acquired in the early days has been supplemented 
          with suitable vehicles from the mainland, either as representative of 
          a type or for specific engineering requirements. The historical details 
          of a selection of our more interesting vehicles can be found on this 
          page.</p>

          Wight Central Railway from the Midland Railway in 1912. The match wagon 
          is believed to be of London and South Western Railway origin, its date 
          of construction is unknown.. Both vehicles were acquired for the VECTRAIL 
          scheme, when this foundered ownership passed to the Wight Locomotive 
          Society in 1971. That this old crane, still having grease axelboxes, 
          survived into preservation is remarkable and it saw much use during 
          the early days of the Steam Railway being particularly active during 
          the construction of Wootton Station. It has now been honourably retired 
          from active use.</p>

          Society. It was moved by road from Ryde St Johns to Newport in July 
          1967 to join the remainder of the preserved rolling stock then in store 
          at the old station. 56046 has seen extensive use on the Steam Railway

          in 1935 as Covered Goods by planking over the open portions of the sides 
          and used principally for Passengers Luggage in Advance. 46924 was condemned 
          in 1948 and transferred to the S &amp; T Dept as stores van 1066S. It 
          remained in this role until 1966 when it was secured for preservation 
          by the British Railways Board along with three other goods vehicles. 
          After transfer to the mainland it was held in store with other National

          at each end of any Engineers train. It was found that in practice only 
          one was necessary and so DS55710 was condemned in 1984 and purchased 
          for use on the Steam Railway. DS55724 has now also been acquired and

        the Isle of Wight and which was not saved for preservation in 1966 was 
        the LBSCR 10 ton goods van. No Island examples remain and only two mainland 
        ones are known to exist. The IWSR has purchased LBSCR number 3713 from 
        the Tenterden Rolling Stock Group, who are based at the Rother Valley 
        Railway, Robertsbridge, East Sussex; this van spent many years as a store 
        on Belvedere Marshes, Kent until purchased about 1978 by members of the 
        Kent & East Sussex Railway. During the 1990's it was moved along with 
        several other items of rolling stock to Robertsbridge where it has lain 
        since. Although derelict it is capable of restoration and will fill a 
        gap in the IWSR's collection of historic goods vehicles to represent a 
        type that was a common sight on the Island from 1927 until the end of 
        steam; in fact one, number 46951, was used as an adaptor wagon to test 
        the new electric stock for clearances.</td>
