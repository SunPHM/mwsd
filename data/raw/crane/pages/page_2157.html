Hatrched at Patuxent to be one of the core flock of new Eastern migratory whooping
			cranes, Number 9's fate changed directions when some of her wing feathers grew in
			malformed. The malformed feathers would likely prevent her from going the distance,
			so this young crane will have a different career, and maybe you'll get to see her
			yourself! Number 9 will will be put on permanent display at the New Orleans Zoo.
			 Tom Stehn, Whooping Crane Coordinator, said, &quot;Although we discussed possibilities
			of waiting for the feathers to re-grow, this could take 2+ years with no guarantee
			that new feathers would be normal.  Our experience is that birds with any defects
			will not survive in the wild.  Hence my decision to put it on display.  As a display
			bird, the return of whooping cranes to the New Orleans Zoo later this fall will mark
			the historic return of this species to the Audubon Zoo.&quot; </P>

			<P>This is a historic photo, too: Number 9's first glimpse of a human NOT in costume.
			Jennifer Rabuck took the photo, and she was not wearing a costume. Jennifer explained,
			&quot;Dan is present in a half of the costume because we wanted to have the costume
			handy when the crane saw her first person as a familiar body to help if the crane
			reacted negatively. She acted offensively for the first time since Dan has known
			her!  She was showing displaced aggression when I was in her sight.&quot; Displaced
			aggression is basically when the crane wants to show dominance over those present,
			but isn't quite physically dominant enough to want to actually interact.  It is almost
			as if the bird takes its frustrations out on other items rather than the item it
			wants to: &quot;I am going to tear apart these weeds even though I want to peck you!&quot;<BR>
