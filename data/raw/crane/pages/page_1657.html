Specifically, three 100 metre tall freestanding communication         towers had to be erected. Two of the towers were to be located far into         the weapons range, where power and natural gas services were not available.         Two new buildings had to be constructed - the Exercise Control (EXCON)         building, which would host troop debriefings, and the Logistic Support         Building (LSB), where training equipment and armoured vehicles would be         stored and maintained. In addition, access roads to the remote tower sites         had to be designed and constructed. Water supply, fire fighting, natural         gas supply, and sewage treatment systems had to be provided for the EXCON         building, located 18 kilometres from the developed centre of the base.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">Associated         Engineering was retained by Defence Construction Canada (DCC), together         with subconsultant Riddell Kurczaba Architecture, to help make AWES a         reality. Our staff worked closely with personnel from DCC, BATUS, and         Cubic Defence Systems of San Diego, who designed, supplied, and installed         the electronic troop-monitoring equipment.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5"> The         first contract to be prepared was for the tower access roads. The roads         passed through environmentally-sensitive areas, and had to be designed         to facilitate restoration of the landscape once the construction of the         towers was complete. The roads had to be designed to accommodate 200 tonne         cranes that would carry parts of the towers to the site.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/0201art/excon_gen.jpg" alt="Generator supplying power to the Excon building" width="154" height="115" hspace="4" vspace="4" align="right"><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">The         second contract, entitled Utilities to EXCON, included 18 kilometre long         water and natural gas supply lines, a booster pump station, a fire pump         station, a reservoir, sewage treatment facilities and a power generation         station. Each system had to be designed to be decommissioned in the winter,         when the EXCON building would not be in use. Instrumentation and controls         systems were designed to keep operation and maintenance staff at the base         informed of the status of the various systems.<br>        Associated Engineering provided specialist structural engineering services         to DCC by reviewing the design of the freestanding towers, which was completed         by a British firm, to ensure the towers complied with Canadian standards.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">Since         two of the towers were to be located at remote sites, Associated Engineering         designed concrete &#8216;bunkers&#8217; to house generators, fuel tanks,         heating and ventilation systems, and sensitive electronic equipment.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">Approximately         17 square metres, the bunkers were designed as part of the tower foundation.         Except for an access stairwell and ventilation penthouses, the bunkers         were covered by 1.5 metres of earth to protect them from stray rounds         of ammunition.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">The final         contract was for the two buildings - EXCON and LSB. The EXCON building         is approximately 2000 square metres and houses electronic equipment to         monitor the activities on the weapons range, a theatre for briefing and         debriefing troops involved in the exercises, and various personnel offices.         The LSB, approximately 700 square metres in size, includes a 20 metre         x 20 metre garage to house and maintain the 30 tonne Mobile After Action         Review (MAAR) vehicles, as well as facilities to store and maintain backpacks         with special electronic tracking equipment worn by the troops.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">Staff         from four Associated Engineering offices contributed to AWES&#8217;s successful         implementation. They included Risto Protic, Kent Neely, Duane Strayer,         Greg Kaupp, Tony Hasiuk, Les Pederson, Barry Vallance, Marvin Akister,         Bob Hawboldt, Steve Croxford, and Project Manager Dale Loewen.</p>      <p><em>Photos</em>: Potable fire/water fighting reservoir designed for the         Excon building; Generator supplying power to the Excon building and generator</p>      <table width="300" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center" border="1">        <tr>           <td bgcolor="#CCFFFF"> <center>              <strong>Clients: </strong><br>              Defence Construction Canada; <br>              Steve Lunge, Tony Ambrosio, <br>              British Army Training Unit Suffield; <br>              Mark Revell<br>              <strong>Project Cost:</strong> $11 million<br>              <strong>Project Completion:</strong> March, 2001.             </center></td>        </tr>      </table>      <p><font color="#00538f" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="story4"></a>Bert         Munro appointed General Manager of Saskatchewan operation</font></p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5"><font color="#00538F"><em><strong>Alistair         Black</strong></em></font>, P.Eng., President and CEO, and Dan Hogan,         P.Eng., Vice President of Associated Engineering&#8217;s Saskatchewan         operation take pleasure in announcing the appointment of Bert Munro, P.Eng.         as General Manager of our Saskatchewan operation.

Dave&#8217;s first         assignment with the company was process/mechanical engineer on the design         of the City of Edmonton&#8217;s new E.L. Smith Water Treatment Plant.       </p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">This         project featured solids contact upflow clarifiers and variable declining-rate         filtration -- the first use in a water treatment plant in Canada. In 1977,         following the construction of the E.L. Smith plant, Dave transferred to         Associated Engineering&#8217;s Vancouver office. </p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">The E.L.         Smith project set the stage for Dave&#8217;s long and distinguished career         specializing in water supply and treatment. Dave designed water supply         and treatment systems for towns and cities across B.C., Alberta, and Saskatchewan,         including major plants in Calgary and Regina. Projects also took Dave         overseas to Ethiopia, Iraq, and Vietnam. Dave was the process engineer         for the design of water supply and treatment systems for three towns in         Ethiopia, bringing clean water, and moreover, ensuring a brighter future         for hundreds of thousands of people in Dire Dawa, Jimma and Moyale, Ethiopia.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">In addition         to municipal water supply and treatment engineering, Dave also participated         in the design of wastewater treatment, atmospheric emissions control,         and materials handling systems. Many of these assignments were for industrial         clients, including MacMillan Bloedel, Crown Forest Products, Eurocan Pulp         and Paper, and Alcan Smelters and Chemicals.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">Over         the years, clients, colleagues, and co-workers have come <br>        to know Dave for his professionalism, dedication, reliability, and commitment.         Associated Engineering staff, particularly those in the Burnaby office,         will miss Dave&#8217;s guidance, counsel, and mentorship.</p>      <p><img src="newsart/indent2.gif" width="15" height="5" vspace="5">Associated         Engineering thanks Dave for his dedication and contribution to the company         and his wife, Mary, who supported both Dave and the company through all         of Dave&#8217;s travels across the country and around the world.
