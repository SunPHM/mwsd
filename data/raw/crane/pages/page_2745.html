Our calendar says it's still winter, but birds don't have a clue about calendars.
			Sandhill Cranes notice the sun's angle in the sky and lengthening days, and something
			deep in their bones tells them it's time to head north, spring or not. What's on
			their minds? Romance!<BR>
			<BR>
			By the middle of March, the birds that arrived first will be nice and plump. As they
			fatten up, they become more interested in romance and less interested in food. Then
			they start their courtship dance. Each pair spreads its wings and jumps and leaps
			into the air in a beautiful display that helps cement their pair bond.<BR>
			<BR>
			Cranes mate for life, and stay together as a pair even during the winter. Most birds,
			like robins, take a new mate each year. Some, like Red-winged Blackbirds, mate with
			as many birds as enter their territory. Besides cranes, other birds that mate for
			life include Canada Geese, swans, ravens, and eagles.

			</B>&quot;What do these species that mate for life have in common? Give reasons that
			would explain why these species might mate for life when others don't.&quot;

			The first cranes of spring 2000 arrived on the Platte River in Nebraska at the beginning
			of February. Just a handful arrived to begin with, but by February 16 there were
			hundreds right in the Audubon sanctuary, according to Bill Taddicken. He said the
			next south winds will bring a big push of cranes. He expects the Audubon sanctuary
			to have about 17,000 cranes by Leap Year Day.<BR>
			<BR>
			Wally Jobman, in Grand Island, Nebraska, looks at the whole river. He said that several
			thousand cranes had arrived along the Platte as of February 17. Wally expects the
			first Whooping Crane, a lone individual who wintered with Sandhill Cranes in west
			Texas, to arrive any day now, but noted that it's too early for the Whooping Cranes
			that wintered in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge to be leaving yet.</P>

<A NAME="Air"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Air Traffic Control, Crane Style</B></FONT><BR>
			Cranes feed all day, and spend nights on the river. This means at sunrise and sunset
			tens of thousands of cranes are taking off and landing all at the same time. They
			don't have air traffic controllers to protect them from collisions, but they do have
			calls and body language to let each other know they're about to take off and where
			they're going. Before taking off, they let the cranes in their vicinity know what
			they're up to by leaping and flapping their wings and then making a pre-flight neck-stretch
			display.<BR>

Most of the cranes that spent the winter in western Texas, and some that wintered
			in Oklahoma and eastern New Mexico, migrate through central Nebraska every year.
			Each pair spends about four weeks fattening up before making the final long journey
			to the north. Some of the cranes that migrate through central Nebraska fly up to
			far northwestern Alaska and cross the Bering Strait into Siberia! The fat they put
			on in Nebraska is the fuel that will power their flight over those long miles.<BR>
			<BR>
			The Sandhill Cranes and whoopers arriving in Nebraska are hungry! They'll spend their
			first week or two eating. Long ago cranes dined on succulent tubers of aquatic plants
			as well as frogs, insects, and small rodents. Now they get their plant food from
			acres and acres of cornfields, eating the wasted corn from the previous fall. Farmers
			don't plant the new corn until after the cranes have left in spring, so cranes do
			little or no damage to the farm fields.<BR>
			<BR>
			<A NAME="Birdwatching"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Birdwatching at 70 MPH</B></FONT><BR>
			About 400,000 cranes--that's 80 to 90% of all the Sandhill Cranes in the mid-continent
			population--stop for a month or so along a 60-mile stretch of the Platte River every
			March. Interstate Highway 80 runs alongside the Platte River in Nebraska. People
			driving along the highway at sunset can see thousands of cranes right from their
			cars as they speed along! During the peak of migration in mid-March, birders can
			see as many as 70,000 cranes and about a million geese in a six-mile stretch of river
			along the Audubon Society's Lillian Annette Rowe Sanctuary near Kearney. Bill Taddicken
			of the sanctuary said &quot;The whole springtime here in Nebraska is an amazing thing--just
			amazing!&quot;<BR>

The Platte River was once called the river that was a mile wide and a foot deep.
			Long ago, water from Colorado rainfalls and melted snow from the Rocky Mountains
			rushed along this wide river valley every spring, scouring out tree seedlings and
			other land plants before they could get a toehold on the sandbars. A very wide expanse
			of river and sandbars was kept open this way. Cranes seem to need wide vistas to
			feel safe from predators, and after a day of pigging out in fields and meadows, they
			retreat to the river every evening to sleep close together in shallow water and on
			the sandbars. The river is shallow enough for them to stand in, while deep enough
			to discourage most predators.<BR>
			<BR>
			Now most of the natural wetland and prairie has been replaced by farmland, and dams
			and other water projects have stopped the annual natural flooding cycles. With less
			water, the river has become narrow in many stretches, and without the annual surge
			in snow-melt water, huge cottonwood trees have taken root along much of the shore
			and on sandbars. So large stretches of river are now too closed-in for cranes. People
			at the Lillian Annette Rowe Sanctuary keep their stretch of the river open by occasionally
			burning and cutting trees down. As a result, their 6-mile stretch remains one of
			the best places in the world for migrating cranes.<BR>

Last time we asked &quot;When do you predict ice-out will occur this year on Thoreau's
			Walden Pond?&quot; Today's the last day to enter the ice-out contest! Have you sent
			us your prediction?<BR>
			<BR>
			Steve Maanum's class in Park Rapids, Minnesota sent not only a prediction, but also
			a great math class idea:


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P>&quot;Our 5th grade class in Minnesota took guesses that ranged from late Feb.
			to mid April. It gave us a chance to do a problem with range, mode, median, and mean.
			Our class guess for ice out on Walden Pond is March 10th.&quot;
