<P>Most people would wonder what possible connection there is
between William Shakespeare and marsh marigolds, a well-known
wildflower in the process of decorating thousands of swampy
areas, wet meadows and stream banks throughout eastern Wisconsin.

<P>A phrase from his writing, &quot;And winking Mary-buds begin
to open their golden eyes,&quot; probably refers to what many
Americans call the marsh marigold, or at least a close relative
of this favorite early spring flower.

<P>His use of the word &quot;Mary-buds&quot; can in all
likelihood be associated with some form of marigold used in
church festivals during the Middle Ages as one of the blossoms
devoted to the Virgin Mary.  A marigold can actually be one of
several distinctly different genera of flowers.

<P>The so-called pot marigold, a Calendula, is one of the
best-known of this bright group of flowers.  African and French
marigolds, belonging to the genus <I>Tagetes</I>, are also very
popular plants.

<P>Several weeds fall into the marigold group.  One, the
<I>Bidens</I>, is commonly known as bur marigold, stick-tight or
tickseed.  Another very common yellow-blossomed weed in fields of
England as well as eastern North America is the corn marigold,
actually a species of <I>Chrysanthemum</I>, <I>C. segetum</I>.

<P>Those of you who have driven along the Pacific coastal
highways near Los Angeles surely admired the banks of ice plants,
also called fig marigolds or Hottentot figs.  These attractive
plants have proven their effectiveness as sand dune binders or
stabilizers.

<P>A wildflower admired by a great many Midwesterners is the
so-called marsh marigold, <I>Caltha palustris</I>.  <I>Caltha</I>
is the Latin name for a strong-scented yellow flower, perhaps the
common marigold.  Marsh marigolds, by the way, don’t have a
strong odor.  Its species name, <I>palustris</I>, means &quot;of
swamps.&quot;

<P>So the &quot;strong-smelling flower&quot; of swampy ground
carries with it somewhat of a religious connotation in its
marigold name.  Actually this attractive wildflower isn’t even
remotely related to the marigolds but rather is a member of the
large buttercup or crowfoot family, <I>Ranunculus</I>
(ra-NUN-kew-lus).  This is the name describing a little frog and
was originally applied by Pliny to these plants, the aquatic
species commonly existing where frogs abound.

<P>Ever since as a small boy I was introduced to these bright
yellow spring flowers adorning the swampy section of my Aunt
Mandy and Uncle Walter Barr’s woods northwest of Kewaunee I have
known them as cowslips.  Naturally it was easy to associate their
habitat with a place where &quot;cows would slip&quot; and
consequently I never further questioned the derivation of this
interesting plant name.

<P>It was while reading a book dealing with European primroses,
many which grow wild there, that I came across what I believe is
an accurate interpretation of the word &quot;cowslip.&quot;  One
of the wild primroses, a white-blossomed species, was called
&quot;ox-lips.&quot;  Another, a yellow-flowered variety, was
referred to as &quot;cow’s-slips.&quot;

<P>It so happened that early European settlers in eastern North
America, homesick for their favorite animals, birds and
especially flowers rejoiced when their first spring arrived and
with it the swamps filled with what looked like their beloved
cow’s-lips. Gradually through the years the pronunciation, as so
often occurs in this country, degenerated or changed from
cow’s-lips to cowslips!  I still prefer the name cowslips over
marsh marigolds.

<P>Examine their leaves and you’ll find them appearing as though
a seamstress had     trimmed them with a pinking shears.
Gradually their striking chrome-yellow blossoms, consisting of
sepals rather than true petals, will emerge, if they haven’t
already done so where you live.  Tiny nectar glands on the sides
of each pistil will entice many insects, especially the brilliant
<I>Syrphidae</I> (SIR-fi-dee) flies, into moving around the
flowers, brushing against the stigmas, and cross-pollinating
these handsome wildflowers.

<P>Depending upon where they are growing in Wisconsin, their time
of blossoming can range from mid-April into early June.
Apparently their blooming period is closely correlated with the
water and soil temperature in which they grow.

<P>What are usually looked down upon as dank, smelly,
mosquito-infested environments, the swamps, will soon come alive
with golden beauty.  Go to where the &quot;cows slip&quot; and
enjoy one of spring’s most dazzling spectacles.
