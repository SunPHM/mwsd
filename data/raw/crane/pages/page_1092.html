<h4 align="center">Moody entered the marine equipment business in
the 1920's, with a line of marine engines. Initially, we
manufactured our own engines, and later took on the line of
Waukesha engines, a manufacturer we represented for over 65
years. We acquired our first barges and tugboates in the 1930's.</h4>

<h4>In 1962, Moody Brothers, now MOBRO Marine, Inc., was formed to handle the 
  marine business and rental of large construction equipment. Our primary facility 
  is located on the St. Johns river in Green Cove Springs, Fl. approximately 60 
  miles from the Atlantic Ocean. Our Tampa branch operates from a facility on 
  Tampa Bay, just a short distance from the Gulf of Mexico. Both operations provide 
  a wide range of marine repair and construction related activities.</h4>
