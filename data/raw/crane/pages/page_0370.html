        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Readers of the
          Autumn issue of Prism will know that two international lighthouse preservation
          and alterntive use meetings were held earlier this year, one in Norway,
          and other in Nova Scotia. A paper was presented on behalf of the <a href="http://www.lighthouse.net.au/ALA/ALA.html">ALA</a>
          at the former and two ALA members attended the latter. They were historian
          and architect Donald Walker and Bob Adams, manager of the <a href="../../VIC/Cape%20Otway/Cape%20Otway.htm">Cape
          Otway Lightstation</a>. The meetings had a number of important outcomes,
          both formal and informal. One of these was the Proposal, which has been
          around for some time to, form all international association of non-government
          bodies dedicated to lighthouse preservation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">The Norwegian workshop
          was held by International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA)
          at Kristiansand, in May to discuss the Preservation of Lighthouses.
          55 people drawn from 22 countries attended this meeting. Delegates represented
          the operating authorities, tourist associations, lighthouse enthusiast
          groups and national heritage groups.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">The Canadian conference
          of international lighthouse preservation enthusiasts was also held during
          June at Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, to discuss a similar agenda. One outcome
          of both conferences was an expression of interest in the formation of
          an International Association for Lighthouse Preservation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">The aim of the
          Association would be to further the cause of preservation, the linking
          of lighthouse operators to those interested in the alternative use of
          Lighthouses and those with expertise in preservation and lighthouse
          technology.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">The Association
          Membership would be open to Lighthouse Preservation Societies, Lighthouse
          Authorities, Lighthouse Operators, Heritage Trusts, Tourism Promotors
          and Contributing Individuals or Organisations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">The latter would
          be companies or individuals whose work can be shown to be of value to
          the Association and the preservation and conservation of the worlds
          lighthouse heritage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">It is proposed
          that the Association be governed by a management board of seven people
          drawn from each sector of interest. A small secretariat is envisaged
          to look after day to day administration.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Meetings would
          normally be by electronic means (E-mail or Fax). An interactive Web
          site should be established and a Journal would be published. The publishers
          of Leading Lights, the International Lighthouse Journal have indicated
          that they would be willing to allocate space in the journal to promote
          the Association and provide members with the opportunity to broadcast
          details of their own preservation work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">An annual conference
          would be held by the Association</font></p>

        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual"><b>[PRISM, Winter
          2000 Issue]</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Donald Walker and
          Bob Adams returned from the Nova Scotia conference brimming with ideas,
          which we hope to share with you in the next issue of Prism.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">The most important
          message from the international meetings is that we are all in the game
          of Protection, Preservation and Promotion of Lighthouse Heritage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">In the Australian
          context, protection means ensuring that our lightstations are protected
          from inappropriate development. For example, in populated areas, they
          often occupy prime sea front real estate and we must make sure that
          local planning schemes have amendments to prevent the views of and from
          lighthouses from being built out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Preservation means
          more than just maintaining the fabric of the buildings. It also means
          that vital records of the past are not lost. In some cases, this may
          mean collecting oral histories, in others simply competent archiving
          of documents. For example elsewhere in this Prism, you will see an appeal
          for the whereabouts of the pre-1919 logbooks of the <a href="http://www.maizels.nu/lights/vic/wilsons_prom/">Wilson's
          Promontory lighthouse</a>. They are not in the Australian Archives or
          the Victorian Public Records Office. Where are they?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Having protected
          and preserved our lights, we need to promote them. They are an important
          part of Australia's short history of European settlement and its has
          often been said that we need to know where we come from before we can
          know where we are going.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Promotion is also
          important for building a constituency for protection and preservation
          of our heritage. Economically, promotion is important as a source of
          revenue for preservation and interpretation and because it can contribute
          to our tourism industry, which already employs about 12% of our workforce.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">It is not clear
          whether the present structure of the Australian lighthouse preservation
          movement can really serve the three Ps as well as it should. As far
          as the ALA is concerned, in the coming months we intend to look carefully
          at its structure and its relations, both existing and possible, with
          local lighthouse preservation groups, tourism bodies, government heritage
          authorities, the state National Trusts, maritime museums and relevant
          commercial organisations. We would welcome input From all our readers.
          It would be great to have a new structure in place by the beginning
          of 2002, before the IALA-AISM meeting in Sydney from 10-19 March.</font></p>

          Group will meet as part of the XIVth IALA Conference and Workshop in
          Sydney from March 10-19, 2002 so it should ,be possible to get all preservation
          groups involved in that meeting and can then extend it for a couple
          of days to have a further discussion and technical tour to expand the
          role of this group within the IALA framework.</font></p>

          trying to expand the distribution of Leading Lights and we can discuss
          links to other preservation organisations within the editorial to widen
          the scope of knowledge available to a wider public with commercial partners
          for important projects within the Maritime Heritage movement which seems

        <p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS, Albertus, Lucida Casual">Some
          of my earliest memories of Eclipse were arriving in the lighthouse tender
          ship The Cape Otway after sailing down from Fremantle and being taken
          ashore in one of the big wooden long boats along with assorted stores
          and material. It has only been in later years that I have realised the
          fear and trepidation our poor mother would have experienced when we
          were let loose on the island with the only warning given being &quot;don't
          go near the edge&quot;. Despite many adventurous exploits over the years
          spent on the island I can only say that we must have listened very well
          that day as we all survived our time without falling in.</font></p>

          the most enjoyable day for those on the island and certainly for us
          kids was &quot;boat day&quot; which was every fortnight and I think
          on a Saturday. For us it was always a competition to spot the boat first
          as it made its way around Bald Head and headed for the island. The trick
          was to spot a recurring whitecap as opposed to the hundreds of others
          that seemed to be ever present. For the adults it was a day to catch
          up on news and local issues while for us it was always what goodies
          were coming ashore and in what box were the comics or any special item
          that had been ordered. This of course all took on monumental proportions
          come Christmas. </font></p>

          from our parents, it just seemed the thing to do. The numerous fishing
          expeditions were some of the most memorable, usually under the friendly

          spots with names such as West End, Southeast Corner, Flat Rock and Groper

          sort of boat seemed wrong so on one occasion we decided to build a dug
          out canoe. Now there weren't many suitable trees on the island and the
          only ones that we thought would suit were on the north side of the island
          and the proposed place to sail it was a big rock pool on the south side.
          Undeterred we chopped the tree down did our best to fashion a canoe
          (very basic) and then spent three days with rope and crowbars dragging
          it to the other side of the island. The great moment of launch arrived
          and we slid it into the pool only to see it disappear beneath the water
          never to be seen again. The first wooden submarine!.</font></p>

          on Eclipse on most days there were days when there would not be a breath

          we had got down to quite an art) and took them up the light and out
          on the balcony when dad was lighting the light and let them go and were
          most chuffed when one of them which we watched through the binoculars

          one as a pet which we got from a burrow when it was very young and I
          became very attached to we used to enjoy catching them. This was done
          from our kitchen window usually on dusk when mum was preparing the evening
          meal. Our house was the one on the west end of the group and had fairly
          open ground across to the shed (old thousand gallon tank on it's side
          where the chook feed was kept) and we would use an old apple crate with
          a stick holding up one end with a bit of fishing line running to the
          kitchen window. A handful of wheat under the box and the trap was set.
          We caught quite a few and let most go, however I do remember this was
          our first encounter with earning money when we sold some to the other
          families.</font></p>

          we used to get up to and involved roaming around the island equipped
          with the two big crowbars out of the oil shed looking for suitable size
          boulders that we thought we could manage to get moving. After a bit
          levering and arguing we'd get the rock rolling and of course there was
          only one way for it to go, towards the ocean, usually demolishing anything
          in its path and bouncing over the rough ground with us in hot pursuit
          pulling up breathless and in awe as it would go over the edge usually
          to smash to bits on the rocks below before ending in the sea. I always
          remembered the smell (like flint or gunpowder) of the smashed rock as
          it wafted up from below.</font></p>

          The Whalechasers: </b></i>During the whale season we would spend some
          afternoons watching the whalechaser at work around the island through
          the big telescope which was mounted on a wheeled tripod in the oil shed
          and we could wheel it from one side to the other depending whether they
          were on the south side or between the island and the mainland. We would
          see them sneak up on the whales and then see the skipper run down the
          suspension bridge between the wheelhouse and the gun. Then you would
          see the puff of smoke and the harpoon strike the whale quickly followed
          by the sound of the canon going of as the sound reached us. Then sometimes
          if they were working really close to the island we could hear the grenade
          on the end of the harpoon explode to kill the whale. Pretty gory stuff
          really but quite an education for young minds</font></p>

          Hill Trolley: </b></i>Being &quot;Normal&quot; young boys it had to
          be that sooner or later we would want to build a hill trolley. The fact
          that there were no roads or even paths of suitable structure for such
          a project mattered not. One apple box (these were plentiful as our granny
          smiths, each individually wrapped in tissue were delivered in them each
          fortnight) two axles and four wheels were all we needed. Steering was
          beyond our technical abilities at this stage. Wheels were a real problem
          as we didn't have any and it wasn't as if we could scrounge them from
          anywhere so it was a case of making them out of wood (after &quot;chief&quot;
          showed us how to draw a circle with a piece of string and a pencil).
          Axles weren't quite such a problem as mum's broom handle cut in half
          made two just the right length. Nail it all together, find a rocky slope
          with bushes at the bottom and away you go. We had a lot of fun until
          dad found out about the broom handle.</font></p>
