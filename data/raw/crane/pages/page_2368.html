        from a long, expensive recovery effort that started releasing captive-bred 
        birds in 1992 As of 1999, 49 birds were alive in the wild, of a total

        The wolves introduced to Yellowstone underwent a little "re-education" 
        of their own. After being captured in Canada and shipped to the Yellowstone 
        area, they are placed in large pens for a couple of months. The goal? 
        To break the animals' homing instinct, which would otherwise cause them 
        to truck on back to Canada. </font>

        reintroductions may be impressive, but they are hardly a perfect answer 
        to the problem of vanishing species. For one thing, large, attractive 
        animals attract the big restoration money; reptiles, invertebrates or 
        plants get far less attention. </font> 
      <font size="+1"> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Since each reintroduction 
        takes so much work, the technique will never become a universal tool for 
        reviving damaged ecosystems. Instead, ecologists say, preserving and restoring 
        habitat is more appropriate for broad-scale preservation of species. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><br clear="all">
        The dispute over how to preserve species often relies on lingo "in situ" 
        versus "ex situ" conservation. To decode the Latin, "in situ" means saving 
        species in their existing locations, while "ex situ" conservation occurs 
        in seed banks, zoos and botanical gardens. Both techniques have their 
        uses, but in the last analysis, most scientists favor conserving habitat 
        rather than individual species. </font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Peter Bryant, a 
        biology professor at University of California, Irvine, said habitat restoration 
        is an elementary step in sustaining endangered plants and animals. "Most 
        endangered species are in trouble because their habitat has been fragmented, 
        destroyed or degraded, so the first requirement is to get some patches 
        back in decent shape."</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1">The Nature Conservancy 
        is a major advocate of habitat preservation. "My personal view, and that 
        of the Nature Conservancy, is that in situ conservation is what we should 
        be striving for," says Bruce Stein, a scientist who worked at the Conservancy 
        and now works for <a href="http://www.abi.org/" target="new">Association 
        for Biodiversity Information</a>. "Ex situ has a role, but it can lead 
        people to become complacent. ... The goal of any ex situ conservation 
        program has to be getting a population re-established in the wild." </font> 
      <font size="+1">
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Similarly, professor 
        of conservation biology Donald Waller, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
        says he's a "bit more cynical" about reintroduction programs. He suggests 
        that there's little biological justification for spending so much money 
        to save lovable, showy critters like wolves while shortchanging the promiscuous 
        <a href="http://www.animalinfo.org/species/rodent/dipostep.htm" target="new">Stephens' 
        kangaroo rat</a> or Florida's <a href="http://www.mobot.org/CPC/" target="new">four-petal

        so easy</font></b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"><br>
        Another factor is the simple difficulty of replicating nature, Waller 
        adds. "A lot of plants -- like animals -- are fussy about habitat and 
        culture conditions." Plants may parasitize other plants, require that 
        a certain fungus grow on their roots, or be pollinated by a rare bat or 
        moth. These conditions aren't always known, and even if they are, they 
        are difficult to reproduce in captivity and after the plant is reintroduced 
        in the wild. </font> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="+1"> Often, the argument 
        over preserving individuals or ecosystems is moot. If a species is extinct 
        in the wild, there's little choice but to <a href="../112trop_plant/4.html">work 
        with what's left in captivity</a>. Finally, restored habitats may attract 
        species thought to be locally extinct, turning ecological restoration 
        into a method for reintroducing species. </font>
