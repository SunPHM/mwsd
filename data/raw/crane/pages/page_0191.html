      about the producer's notorious insensitivity to writing and character development, 
      it's a fact that in other areas he was brilliant at assembling the 
      best available talent for his projects.&nbsp; The likes of John Williams and 
      Jerry Goldsmith (music),&nbsp;L.B.Abbott and Howard Lydecker (special 
      effects), Winton Hoch (photography) and Jack Martin Smith (art direction and 
      design) didn't just fall out of the sky by accident.&nbsp; In the case of 
      Voyage, neither did Richard Basehart and David Hedison.&nbsp; Allen knew whom he 
      wanted to cast and went after them--in Hedison's case, tenaciously.

    <TD><STRONG><FONT size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having previously worked for Allen 
      on The Lost World and having seen the Voyage pilot script, Hedison was 
      concerned about the lack of character development and the writing in 
      general and thus&nbsp;said no to Allen's offer of promotion to submarine 
      captain.&nbsp; It is well known that after Basehart stepped aboard, 
      Hedison reconsidered.&nbsp; How many serious actors could resist the 
      chance to work with a talent like Basehart?<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size="4">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is from this point that the 
      on-screen chemistry and off-screen respect between the two bloomed.&nbsp; And why 
      not, for Hedison brought a fine package of experience and talent to the 
      table to compliment that of Basehart.&nbsp; Previous associations with 
      projects and productions under Lee Strasberg, Martha Graham, Sir Michael 
      Redgrave and many others prepared the handsome young actor for the 
      challenges waiting for him aboard Seaview, both the good and the bad.

      actor's official web site, he loved working with Richard Basehart. &quot;He was 
      such a great actor, and I learned a lot from him. I thought he was just 
      terrific . . . The memories are, all in all, quite pleasant except some of 
      those shows later, in the fourth year with the monsters. I didn't like 
      doing those particularly . . . But the four years were wonderful, and I 
      liked working with Irwin Allen and particularly with Richard Basehart . . 
      . I learned a lot because some of the material was so bad, and Richard 
      Basehart said, &quot;if you can make this believable, you can do anything.&quot; And 
      I think he was right.&quot;</FONT></STRONG></TD>

      the bridge. The taller of the two, trim and darkly handsome, Lee Crane 
      watched as the Admiral touched the cigarette to his lips and inhaled. The
