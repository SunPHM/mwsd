<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Friday 15th June 2001</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a relatively late 
  night with Roger and Hebs last night it was pretty hard getting up early and 
  setting off to the airport for the last stage of our journey. There were few 
  signs of life on the streets and soon we were making our way out of the main 
  shopping areas with all their neon signs and out towards the port. As we reached 
  a huge intersection of the roads we were confronted by the amazing sight of 
  a large group of people calmly practicing Thai Chi under a fly over beside the 
  dual carriageway. The setting was by no means idyllic but they were obviously 
  making the most of the only available ground space in a city there it is in 
  short supply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The airport was a great 
  disappointment. It is full of the very expensive boutiques of the big European 
  couture houses with nothing specific to Hong Kong at all. Any views we might 
  have had during take off were totally obscured by torrential rain. At least 
  with individual TV screens on our seats we were amused during the flight although 
  I could have done without the showing of Miss Congeniality. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On arrival at Narita Airport 
  we spent a good half-hour with at the tourist office, calling endless hotels 
  until we found one that sounded nice and was reasonably priced, at least by 
  Japanese standards. We were able to exchange our rail vouchers for passes within 
  the airport and set off towards downtown Tokyo. The journey to Ikeburo was without 
  incident. It was about 5pm by this time but nothing like as crowded as we expected 
  and everyone was polite and friendly. Unlike in Thailand were you cannot help 
  but be suspicious of the motives of everyone who approaches you, the Japanese 
  were genuinely helpful, explained directions in perfect English whilst writing 
  them down in Japanese characters for us to show later should we get lost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our hotel, a traditional 
  Japanese Ryokan called House Ikebukuru was tucked away on a small side street 
  a five-minute walk from the station. From the outside it was totally unimposing. 
  Upon entering it we politely took our shoes off, (used to it now after even 
  our fleeting visit to Bangkok) and the lady on reception gestured that we should 
  each put on a pair of house slippers neatly lined up in the hallway. Upstairs 
  our room had a sliding door, traditional Tatami mat floor, with flat, futon 
  type mattresses and a low table with a TV in one corner. Most astonishing of 
  all though was not the traditional Japanese style room, but the all singing, 
  all dancing electronic toilet with its flashing lights, automatic flush and 
  electric control panel. Sadly the instructions were all in Japanese and apart 
  from an inadvertent soaking neither of us were able to make it function to its 
  full capacity. The mystery of the electronic toilet remains&#133;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/jpresto.jpg" width="264" height="198"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the things I had 
  been most nervous about coming to Japan was that modern Tokyo would fall short 
  of the romantic expectations fueled by tales of Imperial Japan and Geishas. 
  However, even on the way to our hotel I had seen two women walking down the 
  street in Kimonos, sandals and the white socks with divided toes. Soon I was 
  to discover that the sight of women of any age in a kimono is anything but unusual. 
  In contrast, what really amazed me was the groups of schoolgirls with their 
  peter pan collars, short pleated skirts and huge, scrunched down socks. Topped 
  with bunches or a kooky hairstyle and lots of make up these girls swarmed the 
  streets seven days a week, mobile phones locked to the side of their heads and 
  Hello Kitty merchandise hanging all over them.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/jpbusystreet.jpg" width="311" height="208">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/jppancakes.jpg" width="311" height="208"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Setting out to discover 
  the area around our hotel we settled for a beer in a trendy but empty cellar 
  bar and supper in one of the many restaurants that advertises itself by hanging 
  a red paper lantern outside its door each evening, not that you could miss the 
  brightly lit cabinet displaying its full menu. Somehow, without a word of common 
  language between us we managed to order the evening's set meal and two huge 
  beers. Amazingly, the food that arrived, in a mass of different dishes looked 
  identical to the plastic versions outside in every detail, down to the number 
  of courgette slices carefully places on top of the main dish. Despite us not 
  being able to identify 95% of the ingredients we really enjoyed until between 
  us we decided one dish could be either seaweed (not bad) or some unidentified 
  part of an unfortunate animal, probably lung, which put us off the rest totally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Saturday 16th June</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We spent the whole morning, 
  amazed at the sheer size of the department stores in Ikebukuru and Shinjinku. 
  Huge buildings housed the rail and tube stations in a mass of corridors below 
  ground then on top were up to 10 floors of department store selling everything 
  from exotic foods to designer clothes. Opposite the entrance to Shinjunku station 
  crowds surged along the crowed roads below a giant TV screen showing a mix of 
  pop videos, commercials and soap operas. Fans stood listening to a live band 
  whilst others watched the screen and others concentrated on the serious business 
  of shopping. Electronic goods and designer clothes were the most in evidence 
  but I also found a whole store dedicated to Hello Kitty merchandise with everything 
  from Chopsticks to kimonos printed with the now over familiar cartoon cat's 
  face logo. On a serious note, Japanese style does not come cheap and lines such 
  as Miss Lady, Paris Chic, etc were priced on the same level as the Pradas and 
  Armanis in the same department stores and even the most modest of the shops 
  own range of cotton kimonos would set you back somewhere in the region of &pound;250 
  plus close to &pound;100 for the uncomfortable looking high wooden sandals and 
  white socks with divided toes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through the day though I 
  did notice a convincing number of women going about their normal Saturday business 
  dressed rather traditionally in Kimono with their hair pinned up in an elaborate 
  style that in the west would be reserved for evenings only. One young woman 
  in a shiny blue outfit was using the cash point in a shopping arcade and anther 
  was meeting two friends, both of whom were dressed in bias cut, fashionably 
  flirty skirts, strappy sandals and twinsets. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unable to meet up with either 
  of Toby's friends we had tried to reach we decided to at least eat in the Sushi 
  restaruant in Harajuku where Mitsu works and after a long wait, demolished a 
  wide selection from a miriad of different coloured plates that glided past on 
  a conveyor belt before us. A wonder through the streets at night revealed the 
  widest selection of vending machines I had ever seen. Mostly selling cans of 
  green tea and coke, some also sell beer which would be unheard of back in the 
  UK where it would not stand a chance against vandals.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="../photos/japan/japvending.jpg" width="310" height="177"></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sunday 17th June</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intimidated after reading 
  that raw fish was a normal component of a traditional Japanese breakfast we 
  opted to follow the preferred modern alternative and joined the locals in a 
  busy coffee bar of the Starbucks type. Exceptionally friendly staff served coffee 
  and cakes and an alarming volume of milk shakes to business suited adults. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was determined to search 
  out at least one of the many flea markets mentioned in the guidebook and we 
  eventually tracked one down in a temple compound just a street back from the 
  large department stores in Shinjinku. The stalls offered the usual eclectic 
  flea market mix with broken china, old toys, coins etc but also piles of old 
  kimonos and traditional Japanese prints. After much rummaging I came away with 
  a beautiful Kimono and Obi and instructions on how to tie it. Just round the 
  corner the electronics shops brought us racing forward a couple of centuries. 
  In Japan all mobile phones have mini TV screens and digital cameras so you can 
  send your friends photos as you chat. A new digital camera to replace the one 
  stolen off the boat in St Lucia would have been a good buy financially but sadly 
  there were no export versions and it took little time to realise that an entire 
  software package in Japanese might render the whole thing and expensive mistake. 
  The rest of the day was spent browsing antique shops, admiring racks of unbelievably 
  expensive but exquisite kimonos that I later learnt were wedding gowns, and 
  looking at the shops in the expensive Harajuka area. It is like Sloane street, 
  except that it stretches an equivalent distance to the entire length of the 
  Kings Road! After more window shopping than I could bear we stopped for a beer 
  in a pavement caf&eacute; and people watched: schoolgirls with their big hair, 
  women in kimonos; punks and oh so fashionable dahlings in truly ridiculous platform 
  shoes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We ate in a BBQ restaurant 
  close to the hotel, having been misled by it's French sounding name and red, 
  white and blue colouring. It was tasty and typically Japanese even if it was 
  not quite what we expected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Monday 18th June</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After another quick coffee 
  and cake breakfast we caught a bullet train to Kyoto, the old imperial capital 
  of Japan and now heralded as its cultural capital. I had bought us lunch boxes 
  at the station. Jon's was a club sandwich, as requested and mine a seaweed wrapped 
  sushi roll complete with chop sticks and small container of soy sauce. Certainly 
  beat soggy BR sandwiches! It rained on and off throughout the journey and any 
  view of Mount Fuji was masked behind a thick layer of cloud and fog. All along 
  the railway though were paddy fields, the bright green of some contrasting with 
  the flooded fields next to them, ready to be planted with then next crop. Most 
  of the houses visible from the train were modern concrete to start with but 
  as we reached more open countryside there were more and more traditional style 
  compounds surrounding old buildings with traditional roofs. Temple complexes 
  are easily identifiable by the trees that grow round them in an otherwise baron 
  landscape and in towns most of the greenery comes from the 5 or 6 storey nets 
  around the golf driving ranges. Golf is incredibly popular in Japan and even 
  the smallest town boasted several &quot;clubs&quot; with improbable names such 
  as Gleneagles and California Golf. Most were rows upon rows of open shoe box 
  style buildings with one side totally open. Any time of day or night you could 
  see the golfers calmly practicing their stroke and balls flying out from each 
  of the 5 levels simultaneously. Even from the train Kyoto promised more of the 
  Japan I had been looking for and our Ryokan was no exception. A few moments 
  walk from one of the large temples, it was another place where exchange your 
  shoes for house slippers the minute you pass through the sliding doors. The 
  lady who runs it is wonderful and has a whole lot more English than many. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our room was upstairs and 
  once again had sliding doors, tatami mat floors and bedding neatly folded to 
  one side for us to unroll at night. A second set of sliding doors opened onto 
  cup boards to hide our clothes and rucksacks and a third pair onto a small closed 
  balcony overlooking a green courtyard. In one corner was the traditional alcove 
  complete with framed Japanese text and a low table with tea things ready. Once 
  we had changed into our Yukata (cotton robes that are de rigeur for walking 
  to and from the communal showering and hot tub areas and your room) we made 
  ourselves a pot of green tea with as much ceremony as we could muster.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/jptearyokan.jpg" width="350" height="235">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/jpryokan.jpg" width="158" height="235"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Determined to see as much 
  as possible in our short visit, we caught the free Japan Rail Bus to one of 
  the temples to the North West of Kyoto to see one of the most famous <b>raked 
  gravel Zen Gardens</b>.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/jprakedgarden.jpg" width="276" height="184">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/jpwater.jpg" width="274" height="183"><img src="../photos/japan/jpgong.jpg" width="271" height="181">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/japgolden.jpg" width="315" height="180"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The temple that housed 
  it was much like many others, except that in one section of the main building 
  the corridor became a balcony that surrounded a tranquil traditional walled 
  garden. Apart from a lone tree and several strategically placed dark boulders 
  the garden was completely bare. The ground was covered with a layer of immaculately 
  raked pale gray gravel. Totally straight rake lines are clearly visible, always 
  in the same, perfect parallel lines, or a circle round the boulders and tree 
  stumps. It was definitely a place for silent contemplation and many of the visitors 
  we sitting silently on the covered walkway staring at it, mesmerised.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As it grew dark we wondered 
  up towards Gion and pontocho, the two most famous areas for traditional teahouses 
  and geisha spotting. We ate in a trendy little hot rock restaurant where the 
  waitress spoke pretty good English and took the time to explain what went with 
  what. As the evening wore on crowds passed outside in the street, often businessmen 
  in dark suits accompanied by one or two traditionally dressed young women shuffling 
  along on their wooden sandals on the narrow cobbles.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../photos/japan/restaurant.jpg" width="308" height="205"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tuesday 19th June</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After breakfast of toast 
  at least 2&quot; thick and the parents of the baby who's screams we heard through 
  the paper thin walls all night we headed off on our next bullet train ride, 
  this time to <b>Hiroshima</b> about 2 hours away.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/CNV00016.jpg" width="298" height="200">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/CNV00015.jpg" width="298" height="200"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Japanese trains are fast, 
  immaculately clean and always on time. If a train leaves at 10:05 it will arrive 
  at 3 minutes past and the doors open. At 10:04 you are warned, the doors close 
  and as the digital clock changes to 10:05 you are off. Amazing. Once again we 
  had our sushi lunch boxes and ate as the train sped past the beautiful tiered 
  temples of Fukuyama and the same small villages, rice fields and golf driving 
  ranges as on the way down from Tokyo. It did not help that it was pouring. We 
  got off the train in Hiroshima in the midst of a torrential downpour and spent 
  most of the day soaked. Initially with one umbrella and then with a second in 
  an attempt to keep dryer we waded through ankle deep torrents to get to the<b> 
  Hiroshima Castle</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the bleak weather 
  the sight of the castle across the moat was still really impressive. Once inside, 
  we had to wade through a muddy quagmire to reach the main building. Completely 
  destroyed, along with the rest of the city in 1945 it has been carefully rebuilt 
  so that from the outside it looks just as it would have been in its heyday. 
  The galleries inside house a museum with interactive displays (great given the 
  weather) and a collection of original samauri swords ete. Right at the top a 
  balcony runs all around the outside but forced inside by the driving rain, we 
  joined a group of school kids, intent on printing their names on commemorative 
  gold coins (we have one too) and then headed once again through the driving 
  rain to find somewhere dry for lunch. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/CNV00006.jpg" width="159" height="235">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/CNV00003.jpg" width="352" height="236">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/japdownpoor.jpg" width="136" height="236"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the basement of a huge 
  shopping complex I ate some strange octopus dumplings while Jon tucked into 
  some hideous American fast food. As the octopus stand woman spoke no English 
  at all it was a bit of a risk but I was relived to find that the dumplings themselves 
  were delicious. What I was not so sure about was the layer of red sprinkled 
  on top which turned out to be miniature prawns, the size and shape of a scarlet 
  nail clipping and about as appetising! For a while after lunch we took refuge 
  in a huge covered shopping mall and internet caf&eacute; until we were mentally 
  ready to brave the rain again and emotionally ready for the sights Hiroshima 
  is best known for, the<b> A-bomb dome and memorials</b>.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="../photos/japan/CNV00009.jpg" width="298" height="200"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The A-bomb Dome was one 
  of the few buildings not totally destroyed when the Atomic bomb hit. It was 
  the Japanese industrial exhibition hall and had a large bronze domed roof. The 
  bare framework of this dome now stands as reminder of what happened. Across 
  the river is the memorial proper and museum. </font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../photos/japan/CNV00010.jpg" width="298" height="200">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/CNV00011.jpg" width="298" height="200"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The memorial stands surrounded 
  by thousands of brightly coloured origami paper cranes made by children and 
  adults all over the world in sympathy for those who suffered and continue to 
  do so because of the atomic bomb and as a plea for Peace for the future. It 
  is impossible not to be moved by the scale of it all. Beyond the eternal flame 
  and cenotaph is the modern museum. Very well done, and equally harrowing. We 
  spent about an hour and a half in there and although there was more to see we 
  really could not cope with much more. Everything is written without blame but 
  I could only imagine what it would feel like to be a young American walking 
  around that museum, to be confronted at every turn with guilt for the suffering 
  so clearly portrayed, not just at the time, but continuing right to the present 
  day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leaving the museum in a 
  hurry to catch the train we had booked seats on, we first braved the downpour 
  then gave up and hailed a taxi. It is the first time I have been chauffeured 
  by a driver in white gloves but he got us to the station in time and drier than 
  we would have otherwise have been. Almost unheard of in Japan, the train was 
  delayed on our return journey but otherwise passed without incident.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Back in town, we headed 
  out to eat, but having left it until 9pm which is very late by Japanese standards, 
  settled for a huge bowl of noodles and beers in a noodle bar around the corner 
  from the Ryokan. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Wednesday 20th June</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By default, today became 
  our day to overdose on temples. There are thousands in Kyoto and the surrounding 
  areas and every guidebook warns that one can see too many. We started off with 
  the massive one opposite the Ryokan.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="../photos/japan/CNV00018.jpg" width="298" height="200">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/CNV00020.jpg" width="298" height="200"><img src="../photos/japan/CNV00024.jpg" width="298" height="200">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/CNV00023.jpg" width="298" height="200">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It was relatively quiet, 
  in contrast to the time when I had seen 7 coaches parked outside. Once inside 
  the complex I realised just how large it was. Often, the huge ornate gateway 
  is as large as the main temple. This time, there was plenty more to see inside 
  the compound from a washing well protected by a bronze dragon, to a huge temple 
  bell, housed in its own building with a horizontal log suspended on a sturdy 
  chain to sound it with. The main buildings were all similar, with huge pillared 
  interiors, the floors covered with Tatami mats and small sacred areas around 
  the statues at the front of each hall. All the pillars are made from huge tree 
  trunks a meter in diameter and decorated with bronze dragons and lions and the 
  corners of the roofs are decorated too so that the overall feel is majestic 
  and ancient.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside, however, and typical 
  of Japan are the modern touches: as you leave each building there is a desk 
  with a large rubber stamp so that you can print souvenir images of the temple 
  and its founder in your diary or a specially provided souvenir sheet (I now 
  have quite a collection of these!).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next it was a similar aged 
  temple just outside the centre, affording great view over the roofs of Kyoto 
  and nestled amongst typical Japanese pine trees. A really pretty site where 
  you can take part in a much abridged &quot;tea ceremony&quot; (i.e. have a cup 
  of green tea) kneeling in a small room looking out into a mossy garden with 
  a waterfall tinkling into it. The place was pretty but the tea bitter and the 
  ceremony minimal to say the least.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/CNV00029.jpg" width="298" height="200">&nbsp;<img src="../photos/japan/japteacerem.jpg" width="116" height="199"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the next place, the <b>Golden 
  Temple</b>, we saw a proper tea ceremony taking place. A large group of business 
  men and their wives, dressed either in Kimonos or smart western dress, were 
  filing into a tea room and staff were preparing the tea outside then carrying 
  it in, kneeling in front of each person in turn and swiveling the bowl in their 
  hands three times and bowing before backing out and returning to serve the next 
  guest. The golden pagoda itself is small, put positioned so that if appears 
  to float on a small lake full of carp and terrapins and dotted with water lillies 
  it is quite beautiful. An ancient official stands guard at the most pituresque 
  photo spot and insists that he take your picture in the correct spot with your 
  camera. On the pagoda roof, a golden phoenix points out the wind direction and 
  in the grounds of a nearby building a team are busy training a pine tree over 
  a bamboo frame so that it grows in a arc like a crashing wave. The art of Japanese 
  Gardens can only be marveled at.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tonight, the 
  last night of our trip we were determined to enjoy our last meal and understand 
  what it was. Jon carefully researched the English speaking restaurants in the 
  old Pontocho and Gion districts and we set off. Totally confused by the endless 
  small streets without names and restaurants without a word anywhere in English 
  we were ready to give up. Taking our cue from an English-speaking couple leaving 
  a small almost unmarked restaurant we headed in. The staff was lovely and led 
  us to a terrace at the back overlooking the river. We left our shoes inside 
  and took our places on the floor at a low table outside. A waitress explained 
  the menu in English and we ordered tempura, sake and beer. The tempura pot, 
  like a black cast iron tea pot arrived, followed by a jug of batter and the 
  most fantastic selection of skewered foods. It was delicious and we ate for 
  hours, the initial sake and beer followed by more to wash down the amazing tastes 
  of a wide array of oriental vegetables, meats and huge king prawns, all cooked 
  in batter then dipped in horseradish, soy or other sauces, accompanied by rice 
  (chopsticks of course) and followed eventually by miso soup. It was wonderful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Thursday 21st</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As it was our last travelling 
  breakfast (discounting tomorrow morning on a plane) we had preordered a &quot;Japanese 
  breakfast&quot; for this morning. Instead of toast and ham huge trays were placed 
  in front of each of us, once again with dozens of small dishes each crying out 
  to be tasted first. There was plain boiled rice, sea weed, tofu, various vegetables, 
  fish and lots more, including something garnished with the same miniature prawns 
  I had on the octopus dumplings the other day. It would take a long time to get 
  used to this sort of thing first thing in the morning on a regular basis but 
  as a one off it was definitely worth it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We had booked ourselves 
  an English speaking student to take us on a tour of the a traditional Merchant's 
  house. In imperial times, the house was often used by high-ranking officials 
  and Shoguns who had come to visit the Emperor. Such high profile guests obviously 
  affected the security of the house and so it was designed with a myriad of trapdoors, 
  spy holes, creaking floorboards etc so that soldiers could lie in hiding and 
  jump out before any aggressors could harm the lords staying in the house and 
  if need be lead them to safety through the trap doors and corridors. We shared 
  our guide with a Canadian who worked at The Royal Free in Hampstead a couple 
  of years ago and a student how will be here at the end of the summer. It made 
  for an interesting morning culturally as we will all be in London again in a 
  short while!</font></p>

      the afternoon looking around the shops before heading off to the airport 
      for our flight home. Once again we had train station lunch boxes, this time 
      a full meal and extra sushi rolls. The sushi was better than the meal but 
      then it was all interesting. At Osaka there are no duty free shops and apart 
      from a hefty airport tax, we were unable to spend anything. Publicity for 
      their Olympic bid for 2008 was plastered everywhere and if they win, competitors 
      and visitors alike will certainly have a very different experience in Osaka 
      than they did in Sydney at the last games. </font></td>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our flight 
  back was long. It really felt like we were returning from the other side of 
  the world. Our first stop was back to Hong Kong and then, after a couple of 
  hours wait, spent mostly on the free internet terminals (Jon) and reading (me) 
  we were really on the last leg home. Once again we had the individual TV screens 
  the food was pretty good. I managed to sleep for a good part of the journey, 
  trying not to think of this as the very last flight for the foreseeable future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We landed at about 7 am 
  this morning and London feels as if we never left it, the same traffic on a 
  Friday morning heading in on the M4, the same traffic crawling through the West 
  End and back up to North London and our flat. Its good to be home again but 
  it would also have been very good to keep travelling.</font></p>
