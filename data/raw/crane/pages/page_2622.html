	 		<br><p align=justify><font size=2><b>Florida - Wild wetlands in a sea of development</b><br>Here in the heart of central Florida, a place better known for Disney and Daytona, sandhill cranes live in divergent worlds.  On a given day in spring, you can drive 30 minutes in one direction and see cranes in a truly wild Florida setting, nesting in secluded emergent wetlands or foraging in upland prairies.  Drive 30 minutes in the other direction and find sandhills walking city streets, foraging in people's backyards, and eeking out a living in city parks and golf courses.  Today, rapid population growth, uncontrolled development, water problems and greed threaten Florida's non-migratory sandhill cranes, their wetlands and what is left of a truly beautiful and diverse wild Florida.  Many biologists and conservation-minded citizens hope to turn the tide before it is too late.</font></p><br>
