      <p>For the Aransas/Wood Buffalo flock, another migration is history. And
         we can ALMOST celebrate the end of a historic and successful migration
        
        for the tiny Eastern flock! All but one (chick #14-02 is still out there
         someplace) of the 16 young whooping cranes who survived their 1204-mile,
        
        ultralight-led migration south and their first winter in Florida have
         completed their first journey north. And all five of the Hatch Year
        2001 
        &quot;ultra-cranes&quot; are home in Wisconsin, too. These 21 birds are
         the founding members of a new flock that will migrate once again over
        
        eastern North America after more than a century of absence. Without human
         assistance, they will depart in the fall and return each spring for
        the 
        rest of their lives. When old enough, they'll lay eggs and raise chicks
         to help the flock grow. Imagine! You may look upward during future migrations
        
        and see these cranes or their children or grandchildren flying majestically
         overhead. Our final report of the season brings the latest crane migration
        
        news (including a surprise capture and free ride home for #9-02!) and
         tells you what's next. But first. . .</p>

      <p>Tom Stehn gives this great news:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> &quot;The 2002-2003 whooping crane season at Aransas is over! Our 
          refuge staff did not see the remaining two cranes on April 27th, and 
          I did not find them from the airplane on April 29th. These last two 
          cranes are believed to have started the migration between April 24-27.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Tom has reported to us all season on the Aransas/Wood Buffalo (Western) 
        flock--the world's only naturally occurring migratory breeding flock of 
        wild whooping cranes. (Reminder: the new Eastern flock is migratory, but 
        have been reintroduced and are not yet old enough to breed.) The Western 
        flock spends each winter under Tom's watchful eyes at Aransas National 
        Wildlife Refuge, where they've come since long before it became a wildlife 
        refuge in 1937.</p>
      <HR> <FONT SIZE="4"><B>Tom: A New Story That's Old</B></FONT><BR> &quot;I 
      have one story to tell you,&quot; writes Tom. &quot;About three weeks ago, 
      an elderly gentleman came in to the Refuge Visitor Center and asked to speak 
      to me. He must have gotten my name from the Internet, because I had no idea 
      who he was, nor did he tell me. He simply asked me: 'Do you know what you 
      have here?' referring to the whooping cranes. 'Yes,' I said, 'we have 184 
      birds in the flock.' I felt very smug, figuring that if I didn't know something 
      about whooping cranes, who would? 'No,' this man said, 'you don't realize 
      how special these whooping cranes are. Based on the fossil record, they've 
      been in North America for millions of years.' Then he asked me how long 
      the whooping cranes had been coming to Aransas. 'I don't know,' I replied, 
      'but you'd have to look at the geologic history of Aransas and figure out 
      how long the salt marshes along the Texas coast have been present and where 
      the coastline was located thousands of years ago. I think the whooping cranes 
      have been coming to Aransas at least dating back to the end of the ice ages 
      and last glacial period.'<BR> <BR> &quot;This man wanted a more exact answer, 
      but I didn't know any more. However, he made me think once again just how 
      very special these whooping cranes are. It is people like this who help 
      me appreciate the whooping cranes over and over again. I hope some of you 
      will follow whooping cranes the rest of your lives, and years from now remember 
      back to your youth when you first heard about whooping cranes when there 
      were less than 200 whooping cranes that migrated north every year: 184 to 
      be exact.<BR> <BR> &quot;Have a great spring and summer.&quot;<BR> <BR>

      <FONT SIZE="4"><B>Brian: Cranes Reach Home at Record Pace</B></FONT> <BR> 
      &quot;This spring, with increased southerly winds and clear skis, the cranes 
      flew through Saskatchewan in record pace,&quot; says Canadian Wildlife Service 
      biologist Brian Johns. Brian monitors the flock on their Canadian nesting 
      grounds, a vast wilderness half the size of Indiana. Wood Buffalo National 
      Park (WBNP) is located in Alberta and the Northwest Territories. <BR> <BR> 
      &quot;There were few sightings of cranes on the ground for any length of 
      time,&quot; says Brian. &quot;Usually the cranes only stop for a day or 
      two anyway; however, this spring there were fewer calls than usual from 
      observers. The first birds seen near the nesting grounds was a pair flying 
      over the Peace River on April 26 about 130 km southeast of the nesting area. 
      The mild temperatures of late April may have moved the cranes into the breeding 
      area ahead of schedule--only to be greeted by snow showers and cool temperatures 
      from May 2-6. I begin my breeding pair surveys next week, so here's hoping 
      that the cranes have a good season.&quot; We hope so too, Brian!<BR> <BR>
      The whole reason for migration is to reach a favorable area for nesting 
      and raising the next generation. Cranes build new nests soon after they 
      arrive at Wood Buffalo National Park. Brian describes what he'll be looking 
      for on his surveys from the air: &quot;The nests are built in water and 
      are about 1 metre across. Some nests are built from the bottom of the pond 
      up while others are floating. The top of the nest is usually about 10 cm 
      above the surface of the water. Preferred locations are ones that contain 
      suitable nesting material, such as bulrush, sedge or cattails in about 15-30 
      cm of water.&quot;<BR> <BR> <HR> <A NAME="Try"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Try

      Brian's comment about the first-sighted cranes flying over the Peace River 
      is a good reminder that in mythology, whooping cranes represent long lives, 
      peace and tranqility. That is our wish for ALL species--human and nonhuman--in 
      these times. Celebrate the cranes' return to their nesting grounds by folding 
      your own origami cranes to display or give as gifts with good wishes. You'll

      What a week! After a hide-and-seek game from ground and air in 3 states, 
      Chick #9 was captured, crated, and flown home from Ohio in a plane on May 
      4. Sara writes: &quot;Before we could say or do anything, she started flying 
      towards us! She landed right next to us and seemed very excited to see us. 
      I picked her up, carried her to the box and put her inside.&quot; Why would 
      such an unusual procedure be necessary? We talk more about that later in 
      the report, but first, read Sara's whole suspenseful story and see more 
      not-to-be-missed photos of the capture:

        about--last seen in Mason County, Illinois on April 13. &quot;Cranes #1, 
        #11 and #12 OFFICIALLY completed their spring migration when they returned 
        to Necedah NWR in Juneau County, WI on April 28 after spending almost 
        two weeks in Oconto County, WI,&quot; reports Sara. &quot;Crane #1-02 
        has since split off and all three have moved off the refuge.&quot; Meanwhile, 
        all five 2001 whoopers are in home territory in Wisconsin. For the scoop

      Consider the comments of Operation Migration's Heather Ray and aviculturalist 
      Sara Zimorski as you think about the capture of #9 and our question: What 
      would YOU have decided?<BR> <BR>
      Heather: &quot;Yes, capture and transport are always stressful on cranes; 
      however, the stress that she must have experienced since April 1 must also 
      be considered. She had spent the entire last summer, fall and winter in 
      the company of 16 others of her kind, and then suddenly found herself alone 
      AND in unfamiliar territory. Both these factors have been taken into consideration 
      by the WCEP Bird Team, who got endorsement from the Whooping Crane Recovery 
      Team to pick up and transport her. Joe and I did some checking last week. 
      Looking back over each day's flight south, we discovered that #9 had been 
      the one that missed the most of the fall route. She missed a total of 6 
      migration legs, totaling 391 miles. That's over 30% of the entire route! 
      And perhaps most importantly, she missed the entire distance between Meigs 
      Co. TN and Pike Co. GA, a distance of just over 160 miles. If you look at 
      the route she had been taking up to that point, she had been doing pretty 
      well.&quot;<BR> <BR>
      Sara: &quot; We had planned on capturing #9 and bringing her back if we 
      found her again and she hadn't made significant progress in her migration 
      from the last stop in North Carolina. Little did we know she would decide 
      to move again after sitting in one place for two weeks and after we had 
      a plan to catch her. Anyway, once she got out of the mountains she was headed 
      in the right direction, but from her position in Ohio we believed it would 
      still be very difficult for her to get back to Wisconsin. She still wasn't 
      in an area she knew, and she would hit Lake Michigan and most likely have 
      no idea what to do or might have trouble navigating around the big lake. 
      Additionally, we don't really have enough manpower and resources to continue 
      following her with all the other birds already back and moving around so 
      much. It would have been interesting--and some of us were sort of torn about 
      what to do--but in the end we were heavily invested in the plan to catch 
      her, so we stayed with that plan.&quot; <BR> <BR> <HR> <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#AA0000"><B>Try

      Ultralight pilot and Project Leader Joe Duff says, &quot;Around 35 to 40 
      Whooping crane chicks are expected to hatch this year at the six captive 
      breeding centres around North America. The Whooping Crane Recovery Team 
      has allocated 18 to 20 of these birds to our project. We will begin moving 
      them from the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland to Necedah in 
      late June. They will be conditioned to follow our aircraft at the same sites 
      we used to train the last two generations and it should be interesting to 
      see how many of the wild cranes [the 2001 and 2002 ultralight-led chicks] 
      will want to claim that territory as their own.&quot;<BR> <BR>
      Of course, Joe and the other OM pilots don't want to be flying birds to 
      Florida forever. With two successful ultralight whooper migrations behind 
      them, they hope to teach this same migration route to a new generation of 
      captive-bred birds (that means no adult wild parents) each fall for three 
      more years. That means you can watch the story unfold with ultralight migrations 
      each fall for three more years! They estimate that within that time, they 
      will phase out the ultralight planes and see if veteran cranes--like the 
      HY2001 and 2002 birds you've been following--will lead any newly-introduced 
      birds on the Wisconsin-to-Florida migration. They'll know they are successful 
      when the next generation starts to learn from this group how to migrate. 
      The goal of WCEP's reintroduction project is to build a flock of 125 birds 
      by 2020. With 21 birds so far, they're on the way!<BR> <BR>

      new WCEP whooping crane chicks hatched at the Patuxent Wildlife Research 
      Center,&quot; reports Sara Zimorski. &quot;The first chick hatched on April 
      21 and #11-03, the most recent chick, hatched the morning of May 6. Two 
      of these chicks were sent as eggs from the San Antonio Zoo, which is one 
      of five captive breeding facilities for whooping cranes. The other eggs 
      have all come from whoopers at Patuxent. ICF will most likely be sending 
      several fertile eggs to Patuxent next week to round out the group of 18-20 
      chicks we hope to have for the project this year. According to Dan Sprague 
      and the crane crew at Patuxent, all the chicks are doing well and the oldest 
      four have been going outside for training with the ultralight. You'll meet

      You might recall that the HY02 chicks (hatch year 2002 chicks) didn't migrate 
      with a bird #6. Sara reminds us: &quot;Crane #6-02 was held back and not 
      shipped to Necedah last June with the other 2002 chicks, due to a minor 
      wing injury. She is being used as a role model for the new 2003 chicks. 
      She was raised by costumed people and with the ultralight, so #6 is very 
      used to the surroundings and noises that accompany the training, and she 
      also seems to like the chicks!&quot;<BR> <BR>
      Ask the Expert received a question that involves this chick. The question, 
      which is about the reintroduced Eastern flock of birds, is: &quot;I believe 
      that the goal is to produce 25 nesting pairs by 2015. Must there be further 
      human intervention or assistance to achieve the mating, or is there evidence 
      that the birds will know to do this part okay on their own?<BR> <BR>
      Our crane expert Laura Erickson begins her answer this way: &quot;Mating 
      behaviors are instinctive. The trick in the case of these introduced Whooping 
      Cranes isn't teaching them how to mate--it will be making sure they know 
      WHO to mate with.&quot; For the rest of Laura's answer, and why crane #6-02 
      is so important, see:

      least, they're not yet interested in &quot;dating.&quot; We DO know that 
      during the next few months they will break their bond with humans, fine-tune 
      their survival skills, and become as free and wild as nature intended. The 
      cranes we've watched so closely may live 20 to 30 years; they will be the 
      ancestors of what we hope will be a thriving Eastern flock, like that which 
      existed decades ago before it was wiped out. During their lifetime, we hope 
      the Western, or Aransas/Wood Buffalo flock (now 184 whooping cranes) will 
      keep adding to its numbers. But the two flocks will never meet. Their separation 
      is necessary to prevent the spread of any diseases among them, and to protect

      <A NAME="Slow-growing"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Slow-growing Population: Discussion 
      of Challenge Question #13</B></FONT> <BR>
      We asked: &quot;Since most adult cranes nest every year, why do you think 
      the whooping crane population has grown so slowly and the species is still 
      endangered?&quot;<BR> <BR>
      Nilay, Gurveer, Jennifer, and Nicole from Iselin (New Jersey) Middle School/grade 
      7A gave this superb answer: &quot;The Whooping Crane population has grown 
      slowly because they nest only once every year and hatch only one egg. Migration 
      is a dangerous venture and cranes get hurt or killed during the trip. Some 
      dangers to the cranes are power lines and fences, hungry predators, disease, 
      and hunters. Since they hatch so few per year, any death makes it hard to 
      increase their numbers quickly and they are therefore still endangered.&quot;<BR> 
      <BR>
      Tom Stehn gives his answer next. As you read Tom's words, notice how his 
      comments reinforce what the Iselin students wrote. Also take note of any 
      additional information. Then use what you learned to explain to family or 
      friends why whooping cranes are still endangered and likely to remain so 
      for a long time.<BR> <BR> &quot;Whooping cranes are a species that have 
      a very slow potential for growth,&quot; writes biologist Tom Stehn, who 
      leads the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team along with Canada's 
      Brian Johns. &quot;First, a whooping crane is at least 3 years of age before 
      it nests and tries to raise young. Nesting and caring for young chicks seems 
      to be a learning process, since whooping cranes on average are 5 years of 
      age before they actually successfully raise young and migrate with offspring 
      to Texas.<BR> <BR> &quot;Whooping cranes lay two eggs just about every year, 
      but usually only one chick survives. The parents usually take good care 
      of one of the chicks, feeding it more and protecting it from predators. 
      They sometimes ignore the second chick, which usually doesn't survive. There 
      are many hazards to young chicks, including disease when first hatched. 
      Also, predators take young chicks in their first 80 days of life before 
      they learn how to fly to be able to escape predators. Predators young whooping 
      crane chicks have to watch out for are wolves, bears, and even ravens or 
      eagles that will fly down and take a very young chick off a nest.<BR> <BR> 
      &quot;Whooping crane pairs that bring a youngster with them to Texas every 
      other year are doing well. Compare this to a mallard duck that might raise 
      6 or 8 ducklings in a good year. Since whooping cranes don't bring many 
      young to Aransas, they make up for this slow growth rate by living a long 
      time. Whereas a duck may live only 5 years, whooping cranes can live up 
      to 30 years in the wild. I know of one female whooping crane that lived 
      16 years before being killed by hitting a power line in the spring migration, 
      2002. In her lifetime, she had nested 12 times and hatched at least 8 chicks, 
      but only brought 3 chicks to Aransas. However, these 3 chicks represent 
      a positive rate of growth since each pair needs to produce 2 chicks in their 
      lifetime to replace themselves. Still, it represents a slow growth rate.<BR> 
      <BR> &quot;It has taken 63 years for the whooping crane population to grow 
      from a low of 15 birds in 1941 to the present population of 184, an annual 
      growth rate of 3.4 percent. As long as that growth rate remains above zero, 
      the population will survive.&quot;<BR> <BR> <HR> <A NAME="Congratulations"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Congratulations 
      to Operation Migration!</B></FONT><BR>
      You recall that the ongoing reintroduction of whooping cranes to the eastern 
      part of North America is being carried out by a group of public and non-profit 
      organizations known as the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP). <A HREF="http://www.operationmigration.org/">Operation 
      Migration</A> (OM)is one of the nine founding members. Their work over the 
      past decade to perfect the ultralight aircraft migration technique has, 
      after only two years (2001 and 2002), resulted in 21 wild whooping cranes 
      being included in the overall population total. We aren't alone in singing 
      their praises!<BR> <BR>
      On May 1, Operation Migration was named a finalist in Canadian Geographic 
      Enterprises' Canadian Environment Awards: A Celebration of Community Achievement. 
      <A HREF="/jnorth/tm/crane/MeetTeam02.html">The team that trains and leads 
      our ultralight chicks</A> on migration was nominated in the category of
