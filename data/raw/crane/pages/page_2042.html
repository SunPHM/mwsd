CONTENT="The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has held a        leading international position in wildlife research and management since its                                         founding in 1936 as America's first wildlife experiment station and research refuge.
In 1940 there were less than 20 whooping cranes alive in the world. Changes in habitat, egg collecting, and hunting almost led to its extinction. There are now 188 whoopers in that wild flock, another 100 in captivity, and over 60 in an experimental flock in Florida. This recovery was directly due to conservation efforts, scientific research, and changes in land management.
	Unique to North America, the whooping crane stands 5 feet tall with a long neck and long legs. Its pure white body feathers are accented by jet black wing-tips and a red-and-black head with a long, pointed beak. The wings measure about 8 feet across.
	Breeding whooping cranes in captivity at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center began in 1967 with 12 eggs collected from the wild flock.  The Patuxent flock currently has 44 adults, with 9 experienced breeding pairs who generally lay around 50 eggs a year in total. From these eggs last year, we raised 26 chicks most of which were released in Florida.  ">

      suit.)&nbsp; <a name="The brail">The brail </a> is a clear plastic
      strap, fastened by rivets, which will be used to restrain his wing.
      Brailing the birds helps prevent injuries during shipment, and insures
      that should Tux get out of his crate, he won't be able to fly away. Tux's

      so voluntarily, a wonderful donation to the crane program. The crane's
      crates are secured in the plane and the flight is direct from Baltimore to
      Florida. Much better than first class! The crew started working with the
      birds around 8 AM. The plane left Baltimore around 10:30 AM.&nbsp;</font></p>

      handle the eight birds. Most of them are staff and volunteers of the
      Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission. These are the people
      who monitor and care for all the whoopers in Florida. Here Tux is
      carefully brought out of his shipping crate. The veterinarian in Florida,
      Dr. Marilyn Spaulding, (on the right, wearing the stethoscope) stands by
      in case any of the birds has suffered an injury or has any other problem
      from shipping. All the birds are fine. It's now around 7 pm.</font></b></p>

      <p align="left"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">Dr.
      Spaulding examines Tux for any health problems. All the birds were
      examined prior to shipment, but this exam on-site ensures nothing was
      missed, or that nothing has changed in the birds' health because of
      shipping. The blue band around Tux passively restrains his wings and
      protects his feathers from damage.</font></b></p>

      to reduce his stress while she continues the exam. It will take a while
      before all eight birds are examined and ready for the release pen. The
      environment and the people are all new to them. The hoods limit what they
      can see and help calm them during the process.</font></b></p>

      <p align="left"><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">Finally,
      the exams are over and Tux and the other birds are carried to the release
      pen. The pen is made of a flexible but tough plastic material which
      reduces the chances of injury while the birds are in it. The birds will
      continue to wear the brails while they are in the uncovered pen. They can
      see their new environment and get used to it before the brails are
      removed. The pen is located near a wetland on this private farm.</font></b></p>

      is brailed and he can't extend it completely. When it's time to release
      the cohort, the birds will be caught, examined quickly, and then the
      plastic brail will be removed. This happens two weeks after the birds
      arrive. The birds can see all around them so they can get familiar with
      their new home. They are fed by an automatic feeding system, which will
      remain in place for as long as the birds continue to use it. It is nearly
      dark now, and after the long, traumatic day the cranes have had, the
      oncoming night will encourage them to rest before they begin to explore
      the pen and learn about their surroundings.</font></b></p>

      <p>On January 17, we shipped Patuxent (Tux), the crane chick we've featured on
      these pages since April, to Florida for release into the wild. Along with
      Tux went Chesapeake (Chessie), his sibling, and six other young-of-the-year

      <p>Because the birds are still in quarantine, anyone handling them must
      wear Tyvek®<a href="#Trade Name">*</a> coveralls. <a name="Since"> Since</a> the crew handles cranes in the breeding
      flock in the course of their work, the Tyvek® suits prevent them from
      passing anything to the quarantine birds on their clothing. When they
      enter the pen they use disinfecting footbaths to dip their feet and then
      cover their shoes with Tyvek® boots to prevent passing pathogens that
      might have collected on their boots.</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000"></p>

      <p>Two weeks after the birds were put into the release pen in Florida,
      their <a href="#The brail"> brails</a> were removed, freeing their wings. By the next day, all the
      birds had flown out of the pen and were free in the wild. This year,
      Patuxent has sent 15 young cranes to Florida, and the International Crane
      Foundation has sent 6. Of the 21 birds released, 20 are surviving and
      doing well, including Tux, Chessie, and their entire cohort. What happens
      to the chicks after this depends on their survival skills. All of us at
      Patuxent hope for the best for these birds, as we do for all the release
      whoopers. We know you do, too. It's a wonderful feeling for all of us here
      to know we've had a chance to put something <u>back</u> into the wild!</font></b><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000000"></p>

            there are 86 whooping cranes living wild in central Florida. The
            release effort has been hampered by the drought in Florida that is
            now in its third year. Low water levels threaten the birds' survival
            by reducing habitat, food choices, and roosting sites. Cranes roost
            in water at night to protect themselves from predators. This drought
            is the longest Florida has experienced in 100 years.</font></b></o:p>

            serious problem for the Florida whoopers is the over-population of
            bobcats. This predator no longer has predators who prey on it, so
            its numbers have escalated. The endangered Florida Panther and
            native wolves both preyed on bobcats, but are no longer a viable
            part of the Florida ecosystem, so the bobcat population is
            unchecked. The great majority of whooping crane mortalities in
            Florida have been to bobcats. There have only been a few mortalities
            caused by alligators. A few mortalities have also been caused by car
