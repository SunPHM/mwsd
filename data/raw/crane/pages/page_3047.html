<font size=+3>The Legend of the Origami Cranes</font>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><font size=+1>In the Summer of 1945, Sadako was only two years old.&nbsp;
Clearly too young to understand the war-time turmoil surrounding her life
in Hiroshima, she was destined to become one of the most famous victims
of the Atomic Bomb attack.&nbsp; On August 6, 1945 at 8:15 in the morning,
a 50 kiloton Atomic Bomb detonated 1500 feet above the city of Hiroshima.&nbsp;
Sadako survived the bombing of Hiroshima that morning, though her life
and that of her family, friends and everyone in Hiroshima was abruptly
and irrevocably changed.&nbsp; None of us can imagine what it must be like
to survive such a disaster.&nbsp; The enormity of that single event and
that of the bombing of Nagasaki is beyond description.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Sadako lived on, though, and grew.&nbsp; She was taken
from Hiroshima to an outlying city and must have begun what passed as a
normal childhood in post-War Japan.&nbsp; Ten years after the bombing,
however, Sadako became seriously ill and was diagnosed with a virulent
form of Leukemia, attributed to exposure to high levels of radiation from
the bomb.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The course of the illness was inevitable and Sadako became
progressively worse.&nbsp; She began folding Origami cranes out of small
pieces of paper that she scavenged from her meager surroundings in a hospital
in Hiroshima.&nbsp; One crane was folded from the label of one of her medicine
bottles.&nbsp; An old Japanese legend claims that if you fold 1000 paper
cranes you will be granted a wish.&nbsp; Sadako's wish was, of course,
to be cured of her Leukemia.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Sadako died after folding her 644th crane.&nbsp; Her classmates
folded the remaining 356 cranes and Sadako was buried with all 1000 paper
cranes.&nbsp; The story of Sadako's effort circulated quickly and thousands
upon thousands of paper cranes began appearing at her gravesite and at
monuments that had only recently been erected around the city.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The bombing of Hiroshima is now commemorated by the beautiful
Peace Park located at the site of most of the destruction.&nbsp; There
are many monuments in Peace Park, but none so poignant as the <a href="cranes2.jpg">Children's
Memorial</a> surrounded by not thousands, but millions of brightly colored
chains of paper cranes.&nbsp; The top of the monument shows a young girl
holding up a large wire-frame crane as a sign of peace and as a promise
to rid the world forever of nuclear weapons and all forms of mass destruction.</font>
