<b>With so many wetlands and miles of coastline, </b> Florida is a bird watcher's paradise. Most 
of these wild birds aren't hunted, so many of them have grown accustomed to being around
people.  Indeed, some have adapted enough to survive and even prosper in some local areas,
while living among 16 million Floridians.  People from around the world, <a
href="ecotouri.html">ecotourist birdwatchers</a>,  come to spot our birds, each year spending
more than $1 billion to do so.

During the day, most water birds search for food, usually fish, but also snails, crayfish and
other small aquatic animals. Many birds also look for certain plants, dining on leaves, stems and
seeds.  The <b>waders</b> stalk the shallows, constantly stabbing into the
mud with their long beaks. The <b>divers</b> prowl underwater for many seconds at a time. 
The <b>paddlers</b> move about on the surface, sticking their heads into the water to spot food. 
The <b>aquatic birds of the air</b> soar overhead,  sometimes fighting over fish, their huge  nests
encumbering many waterside trees.

<b><font size=4>A</font>QUATIC PLANTS AND BIRDS</b><br>
Aquatic plants,  as well as aquatic plant management,  are essential  to the survival  of Florida's
water birds.  In their work, aquatic plant managers attempt  to take into consideration the needs
of water birds and other aquatic animals.
<p>
<b>Aquatic plants are used by birds</b> directly as food, for hunting grounds, for nest building,
and for protection.  Some birds are adapted to submersed vegetation habitats: their legs are just
long enough, their beaks are shaped just so,  their very eyesight and calculated movements all
contribute to the feeding strategies certain birds have developed to take advantage of submersed
vegetation and to catch the fish, shrimp and other small animals living amongst the plants.  

<p>
Some bird species are adapted to tallish emersed plant habitats where they pick small animals from
the sides of the plants.  Other bird species stand on floating vegetation in deeper water while they
hunt for the small fish, insects and other animals beneath.  
<p>
Some birds eat the plants themselves. It has long been known that certain aquatic plants are
excellent food for ducks and other water birds. And some birds use aquatic and wetland plants for
nest building and nursery areas.

<b>It isn't easy to manage large areas of plants</b> without accidentally harming native plants
and
animals.  However,  plant managers try to do no harm.  For example, aquatic plant
management agencies that work in the Lake Okeechobee and Kissimmee chain of lakes areas
consider the needs of the
endangered Everglades snail kite by curtailing plant management operations on plants and in areas
where the snail kite forages and lives.  The plants not controlled in these areas include water lilies
(<i>Nymphaea</i> spp.) and spikerushes (<i>Eleocharis</i> spp.) that are home to the apple
snail, the primary food of the snail kite.  Managers also leave certain areas of cattail
(<i>Typha</i>) and bulrushes (<i>Scirpus</i>) unmanaged because, though the snail kite prefers
small trees  such as the southern willow, pond apple and buttonbush for nest building, the birds do
also make nests in cattails and bulrushes. 

<p>
Another example of how managers must consider how their actions will affect wildlife: cattail
control will have negative impacts on least bitterns, red-winged blackbirds and boat-tailed
grackles, but positive impacts on wading birds, ducks and rails.

<b>Florida has a colorful and uneasy history</b> with its water birds. Back in the early 1900s, the
fashion industry began using bird feather plumes in ladies' hats and accessories. An ounce of bird
feather plumes was soon worth twice its weight in gold. Nesting rookeries packed with these
birds made the easiest targets and were plundered by the plume hunters. Even
when laws were passed and protective measures taken, the black market persisted. One Audubon
game warden was killed by bird poachers in the Everglades. This drew public outrage, increased
awareness, and ultimately, more protection. When hat fashions changed and demand dropped off,
the carnage was finally over.

Water birds made a comeback because much of Florida was still undeveloped in those
early years. However, bird populations dipped again with increased human population and
development. Human encroachment on marshes, lakes, and rivers is now the number one threat to
Florida's water birds.


<p>
Today, all of Florida's wading water birds <b>are protected by law.</b>

<p>
<b>Water birds are dependent upon wild wetlands,</b> which continue 
to dwindle. Though Florida has more than 7,800 lakes, many are now shared by people - whose
numbers increase daily. Vegetation and shorelines are altered in many ways, as is the natural food
chain. 
<p>




Some water birds adapt to people, while others retreat. Some birds, like the snowy egret, sandhill
crane, blue heron, and  wood stork work the marinas and boatslips for their daily meals and
become quite used to being around people.

<b>The endangered wood stork</b>, the only stork in North America,  is a large wader which
grows to more than 4 feet tall, with
a wingspan of more than 5 feet.  In the 1930s there were about 60,000 wood storks; by 1988
there were about 10,000 remaining.  The wood stork eats fish, baby gators, snakes, and crayfish. 
It feeds in shallow water by slowly wading along sweeping its opened bill from side to side in the
water; when a fish is touched, the bill snaps shut (in about 25 milliseconds), raises its head and
swallows its food with a backward jerk.  Wood storks nest in the tops of cypress and mangrove
trees.  To learn more about wood storks, <a href="http://endangered.fws.gov/i/b/sab5z.html"> go

<b>Sandhill cranes and whooping cranes</b> are among the largest birds in the world, and they
are Florida residents for at least part of the year.  Sandhill cranes are listed as endangered in the
U.S., but the Florida sandhill crane is listed as threatened.  The sandhill crane makes its nest from
aquatic plants 
(in order of preference):  maidencane, beakrushes, pickerelweed, spikerushes, yellow-eyed
grasses,
swamp lily, sawgrass, water lily, and pipeworts.  The cranes pick the plants and carry them to the
site,
evenually making a mat nest that is up to a foot-and-a-half above the water, and up to five feet
across.  For an  unknown reason, sandhill cranes make several nests during the season, eventually
choosing one for egg-laying.  Usually between February and mid-March, an average of two eggs
are layed on top of the open nest.

<b>Whooping cranes</b> are the tallest North American bird, to 4.5 feet in height.  The

In 1994 only 146 individuals were known to exist.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has
captive-reared and released whooping cranes in Florida with the goal of establishing a
non-migratory population.  In the mid-1990s there were 15 whooping cranes in the state.  See
more about the whooping crane rescue efforts <a

The <b>cattle egret</b>, native to Africa, was first seen in South America in the 1930s and in
Florida in the 1950s, and now is a very common bird here and in the rest of the eastern U.S.  The
cattle egret wades in the water like other egrets, and breeds in aquatic rookeries with other egrets,
herons and ibises.  (Actually, all egrets are herons.)  The cattle egret, though, prefers feeding with
the ruminants, and is often found following in the footsteps of cattle and horses, pouncing on
disturbed insects and other animals.  (In Africa, it follows hippos and rhinos...) It sometimes is
seen perching on the backs of cattle.

Non-duck divers in Florida include the <b>anhinga</b>, the <b>doubled-crested cormorant</b>,
the <b>pied-billed grebe</b> and the <b>common loon</b> (which winters in Florida). All four
swimmers feed during the day by
prowling around underwater, grabbing fish. All four birds swim more gracefully than they fly.
The <b>anhinga</b>  has no oil in its feathers, and thus no waterproofing so it must dry off
several times
each day. Likewise, the <b>cormorant</b> can be seen stretching its wings on occasion too,
though it is
certainly more waterproof. The cormorant is a fine fisher and has increased its numbers to a
dramatic degree. As a result, it has depleted many ponds (including hatchery ponds) of stocked
fish -  and now faces predation control in some areas. The <b>grebe</b> can submerge vertically,
not having to plunge forward. The grebe has a vertically compressed beak, rather than a duck's
flattened beak; the grebe's toes are not webbed, but scalloped.  The grebe makes its floating nest
from aquatic plants such as maidencane.   As for the <b>loon</b>, its haunting cry
carries far across the bigger Florida lakes, an echo of lakes far to the north in Canada.

The <b>American coot</b> is a rather comical, blackish bird with a white bill.  It is often found in
large social groups on many Florida lakes during winter. The coot has lobed feet which enable it
to run across the water to reach takeoff speed.  Like the gallinule, the coot feeds among aquatic
plants such as cattail, bulrush, spatterdock and water lilies, looking for aquatic beetles and other
morsels. Coots, like ducks, consume aquatic plants directly, including pondweeds
(<i>Potamogeton</i>), water lilies (<i>Nymphaea</i>), naiads (<i>Najas</i>), bladderworts
(<i>Utricularia</i>), coontail (<i>Ceratophyllum</i>), duckweeds (<i>Lemna</i> and
<i>Spirodela</i>), and hydrilla (<i>Hydrilla verticillata</i>). The <b>common gallinule</b>, also
called the "moorhen",  has a red forhead
and beak.  The plentiful common gallinule is often seen swimming with coots.  The <b>puple
gallinule</b> is as colorfully beautiful as it is very rare.  Coots and gallinules are easy prey for
alligators and bald eagles. Alligators are slow (or hibernating) during winter, unless the weather is
warm. But the eagles are swift and deadly year-round.

Migrating <b>geese and swans</b>  are a rarity in Florida, but a number of <b>ducks</b>
migrate into the state with the advent of winter, or pass through on the way to Cuba or Central
America. Among the first to arrive each September are the bluewing and greenwing. Then, in
autumn, the
usual ducks arrive for the winter -  the  pintail, widgeon, ringneck, scaup  and a
scattering of other species. Ducks may be recognized from other birds seen on the water by their
flattened beaks.  As noted above about coots, ducks feed on many kinds of aquatic plants in
Florida.  For more about ducks, <a href="duckhunt.html">go to this page</a> of this web site.

wingspan is to 7.5 feet.  Eagles eat fish, coots, snakes and other animals, which it may grab from
the water or may boldly steal from the osprey.  Most eagles leave Florida during the summer,
flying as far north as Alaska, returning to our lakes and rivers during the fall.

<b>The osprey, </b>also known as the fish hawk, is found throughout the U.S., and all over
Florida.  This large bird has a white head with a black area from the back of the head to the eye. 
Seen flying, the osprey's wings are bowed in the middle area; the tail has a black band.  Osprey
dive for fish from varying heights. 
<p>
The endangered <b>Everglade snail kite</b> is a hawk with a wingspan of almost four feet. In
1988 there were an estimated 500 individuals.  The snail kite lives in Florida's open freshwater
marshes of sawgrass (<i>Cladium jamaicense</i>) and spikerushes (<i>Eleocharis</i>).  It spends
much of its time searching for apple snails, the bird's exclusive diet, that have climbed up the
stems of emersed plants such as spikerushes.  With its very hooked beak the snail kite grabs and is
able to extract the freshwater apple snail.  Aquatic plant management is essential to the recovery
of the snail kite: infestations of water hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) prevent the bird from
spotting apple snails.  The snail kite usually makes its nest in small trees such as southern willow
and pond apple, but sometimes makes its nest among cattail and bulrushes.  To learn more about
the Everglade snail kite and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plan, <a

<p>
The <b>barred owl</b>, a large night hunter, is found throughout Florida.  It too depends on
swamps and forested streams as  its preferred habitat and hunting grounds.  This two-foot tall bird
takes mice, rabbits, fish, crayfish and frogs.  In Florida, it chooses the hollow of a tree and nests
starting in late January.

An interesting search continues for a bird that is (or most likely, was) dependent on lowland
forests and river bottom timber for survival. This was the huge  <b>ivory-billed woodpecker</b>,
of which the last confirmed bird was shot in a north Florida swamp by taxidermists back in 1924.
The hunt for this bird has lately resumed in Louisiana's Pearl River Swamp after one was allegedly
heard. This particular woodpecker species was likely doomed because of man's encroachment,
logging practices, and the bird's inability to adapt. Each nesting pair of ivory bills required six
square miles (or 3,800 acres) of prime forest, often in swamp land, for their food supply.

<b><font size=4>W</font>ATER BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS</b>
<br>According to research, bird abundance and species richness tend to increase on eutrophic and
hypereutrophic lakes, because these lakes have greater natural food resources. However, wild bird
populations under normal situations do not  significantly impact the <a
href="trophstate.html">trophic status</a> of lakes.

<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Research has shown that aquatic vegetation</b>  is vitally important to bird populations
using lakes.  The removal of submersed aquatic weeds from lakes may have no real effect on
average bird abundance. Instead of reduced numbers of birds, the bird
species composition changes. For example, when submersed aquatic plants are removed it was
found that the ringneck duck may be replaced by an open water bird species such as the
double-crested cormorant. 
<p>
As for shoreline vegetation, research shows that shoreline alteration can be detrimental to
wading bird populations. It seems that as shorelines are developed for homes and parks, much
vegetation is (unfortunately for the birds) removed so people can view the lake.
Removing that vegetation can affect not only how many birds are present on
the lake, but also which species leave and which stay.

<b><font size=4>W</font>ATER BIRD DISEASES</b>
<br> Crowded bird populations on a water body can result in an increased chance of diseases
spreading among the birds, such as avian cholera or duck plague. This problem is more prevalent
in other parts of the country, in regions with less water, which invites bird crowding. In a watery
state like Florida, a lake crowded with wading birds is often a sign of dropping water levels,
which concentrates water birds' natural food, such as fish. However, a crowd of birds will
add bird droppings (guano) and resulting bacteria to the water, which can lead to bird epidemics. 
<p> 
One finds aggressive muscovy ducks and domesticated mallards on many water 
bodies where people live in close proximity. These birds live all year in Florida, unlike their wild
cousins. The muscovy and tame mallards are not recommended on Florida lakes and ponds
because they carry avian diseases that can foul smaller water bodies and ultimately spread to wild
duck populations.
<p> 
<blockquote>
<b>It is illegal to release tame mallards onto state waterways.</b> Aside from the health risks
to wild waterfowl, they breed with wild Florida mottled ducks, hybridizing the species. For more
about mallards in Florida, and the new mallard possession rule, go to the <a 
href="http://www.myFWC.com/duck">Florida's Waterfowl page</a> of the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission web site.  Click on "new mallard rule".

<b><font size=4>W</font>ATER BIRDS AND WEST NILE VIRUS</b> 
<br> One disease of special concern is West Nile virus, which has been spreading through the
bird population down the eastern seaboard into Florida. The disease is carried by mosquitoes and
kills birds. It then spreads, again by mosquitoes, to people. In Florida,  it has been detected in
great blue herons, least bitterns, double-breasted cormorants, and green herons. West Nile virus is
expected to spread to additional bird species. See <a
href="http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/whats_new/wha/wha0102.html">USGS Health Alert
#01-02</a>.

<hr width=70% color=green>
<p>
<b><font size=4>W</font>ATER BIRDS AND POLLUTION</b>
<br> Water birds are susceptible to a variety of pollutants in 
water. A constant diet of fish can build up various toxins or heavy metals (such as mercury) in
these  birds, a process called bioaccumulation. One problem was solved years ago, by banning
DDT. Before that happened, a build-up of DDT in water birds sometimes meant that their egg
shells became too thin to survive in the nest. That made for poor hatching success. This was
especially prevalent in pelicans and eagles.
