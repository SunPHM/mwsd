			ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="8" VSPACE="8"></A>The progress of whooping crane migration slowed down for a couple
			of days last week. Throughout the migration corridor in Saskatchewan there were north winds mixed with rain showers
			on April 27-29. Since the cranes usually migrate with either a tail wind or no wind they certainly were not going
			to waste their energy flying into a headwind. These north winds kept the cranes on the ground long enough in a
			few areas that they were seen and reported by crane observers. To date there have been 17 confirmed sightings of
			cranes in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, totaling 44 different birds. <BR>
			<BR>
			On April 29 I observed a pair of unbanded whoopers about 25 kilometres from my house here in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
			This pair was first seen on April 27 feeding on waste grain in one of last year's wheat fields. When the birds
			weren't feeding in the field they were in a large wetland next to the field.  While at the wetland they usually
			stood in about 25 centimetres of water. Here they mostly rested but they also fed along the shoreline, drank water
			and cleaned and adjusted their feathers in preparation for continuing their migration. <BR>
			<BR>
			Wood Buffalo National Park Warden Doug Bergeson reports that the snow melted fast this spring and there is not
			much snow left in the nesting area. All of the nesting ponds are free of ice and only the very large deep wetlands
			still have ice on them. Water levels over most of the nesting area are very low for this time of year. About 17
			pairs have already arrived in the park and 4 of those pairs have nested and are now sitting on eggs.  <BR>

			BORDER="0" HSPACE="8" VSPACE="8"></A>Since I last contacted you I have traveled to Fort Smith, Northwest Territories.
			This is the closest town to the Whooping Crane nesting area. As of May 13 I have seen 42 Whooping Crane nests.
			Five other pairs were seen that may nest and 3 pairs have not been found yet. <BR>
			<BR>
			Remember GwG-YbY? She and her mate are nesting about 3 kilometres southwest of where they usually nest. Their traditional
			territory is drier than normal and that may have caused the birds to move to the new spot. The area that they are
			in now has deeper water and is close to some deeper wetlands that should not go dry by the end of the summer. GwG-YbY
			and her mate were first seen on their territory on April 23. They moved around for 1 week before finally settling
			on the right location for their nest. On May 3 one of the birds was seen sitting on the nest.  <BR>
			<BR>
			The nest is in about 25 centimeters of water and contains 2 eggs which is the normal number that cranes lay. Both
			the male and female share incubation duties and they will incubate the eggs for about 30 days before the eggs hatch.
			These eggs should hatch during the first few days of June. The wetland that the pair is nesting in is a mix of
			open water and a grassy wetland plant called sedge. The pair's nest is constructed out of this sedge and is about
			1 metre across. <BR>
			<BR>
			This past year the amount of precipitation that fell in Fort Smith was the lowest of the last 20 years. During
			years with high water levels the survival of young Whooping Crane chicks is greater than during years with low
			water levels in  the breeding area. We suspect that chick survival is lower during these dry years because; the
			entire area is more accessible to land based predators; family groups have to travel over greater distances to
			find food in the remaining wetlands and may encounter these predators; and food resources available to the cranes
			may also be limited thus putting added stress on the young while they are growing.<BR>
