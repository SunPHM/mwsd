			The spring migration of Whooping Cranes in the U.S. appears to be just about over.
			Tom Stehn and Wally Jobman both report that Whooping Cranes are well on  their way
			to the nesting grounds in Canada! Tom also brings us up-to-date on the latest news
			from the Ultralight crane migrations. <BR>
			<BR>
			Plus, we know that the Whooping Cranes migrate 2,500 miles each spring to their nesting
			grounds in Canada, but did you know that for almost 30 years the location of the
			nesting grounds was a mystery? In today's report, we learn how this mystery was solved,
			thanks to Canadian Biologist Brian Johns.</P>

			Dear Journey North,<BR>
			It is just about time for the earliest whooping cranes to be starting to build nests
			in Wood Buffalo National Park, in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Now that these
			Aransas/Wood Buffalo cranes are well on their way, I wanted to bring you up-to-date
			about the two Ultralight crane migrations I discussed in my earlier reports. <BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Clegg's Ultralight Cranes Successfully Fly North With The Spring</B></FONT><BR>
			Two of the whooping cranes which flew behind <A HREF="http://www.gemstar.net/kclegg/">Kent
			Clegg's Ultralight</A><A HREF="http://www.clegg.org/"> </A>last fall between Idaho
			and New Mexico have survived the winter at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge
			in New Mexico. And, in fact, they started the migration north on March 5. This was
			a major success, having shown that cranes led south in the fall have the internal
			urge to migrate north in the spring.<BR>
			<BR>
			They did not follow the same route they had used travelling south, but headed along
			the major crane flyway towards Colorado. The two ultralight whoopers staged in the
			San Luis Valley of Colorado, and then apparently split up. One ended up near Craig,
			Colorado, and the other about 60 miles away near Baggs, Wyoming.<BR>
			<BR>
			They were not in good habitat and one was staying right near a large powerline. Concerned
			about the safety of the birds, Kent Clegg captured the birds on April 25. They are
			currently in a pen back on Kent's ranch in southeastern Idaho, awaiting a decision
			on where they can be released. <BR>

			In the saga of the ultralight sandhill cranes led south between Ontario and Virginia
			by Bill Lishman and Joe Duff of <A HREF="http://fathergoose.durham.net/today.htm">Operation
			Migration</A> (&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; fame), after a brief 140-mile exploratory
			trip to the eastern shore of Maryland, the sandhills left Airlie, Virginia on March
			28, this time headed in the right direction. They were sighted in Youngstown, New
			York the next day, and were in St. Catharines, Ontario on March 30. They ended up
			less than 50 miles from where they were fledged. <BR>
			<BR>
			As the sandhills wandered in Ontario and kept getting into trouble, Bill and Joe
			rounded the flock up on April 11, and actually flew them behind the ultralight again,
			returning back to where they were raised. In this last leg of their return home,
			the sandhills took advantage of thermal currents, spiraling up as high as 5,000 feet,
			and then gliding downwards to keep with the plane. In their migration north, they
			had learned to fly like the wild cranes. <BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT SIZE="4"><B>It's A Real Success Story!</B></FONT><BR>
			These Ultralight migration results were spectacular, proving that even without the
			stimulus of wild cranes present to show them a migration, cranes will migrate north
			in the spring. Yes, the birds were too tame, ending up in a schoolyard, a soccer
			field with a game going on, a farmer's barnyard, etc. But now the experiment can
			be repeated with more effort put into keeping the birds wild and afraid of humans.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Already it is time to start planning and raising birds for the next round of experiments
			this fall.<BR>
			<BR>
			Until next time,<BR>

			<BR>
			The satellite images showed that winds on April 21 and 22 were from the north, which

			Dear Students,<BR>
			Whooping Crane migration is progressing and many of the adult breeding birds have
			already moved through Saskatchewan and are now on the nesting grounds at Wood Buffalo.
			The cranes that will be arriving here in the next couple of weeks are mostly the
			subadults. A subadult crane is a 1 to 3 year old bird that hasn't begun to nest yet.<BR>
			 <BR>
			<FONT SIZE="4"><B>A Long-Unsolved Mystery--Where Did The Cranes Nest?</B></FONT><BR>
			In case you didn't know, the wetlands of southern Saskatchewan that the cranes now
			use during migration, once provided nesting areas for Whooping Cranes. The last documented
			nests of these cranes in Saskatchewan date way back to 1927. This is around the same
			time that some of your grandparents or even great grandparents were being born. <BR>
			<BR>
			After that time, however, and up until 1954, the whereabouts of the Whooping Crane
			nesting area remained a unsolved mystery! It was known that the Whooping Cranes wintered
			in southern Texas along the Gulf of Mexico, and that they migrated north through
			Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and into Saskatchewan. But,
			then they disappeared! Extensive searches for the nesting grounds were carried out
			by the National Audubon Society and the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History, but
			to no avail. <BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Mystery Solved!</B></FONT><BR>
			<A HREF="/jnorth/images/graphics/c/crane37cd834.jpg"><IMG SRC="/jnorth/images/graphics/tnail/c/crane37cd834.jpg"
			ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="2"></A>Then in 1954 a forestry officer and a helicopter pilot,
			flying over a remote corner of Wood Buffalo National Park, discovered two adult Whooping
			Cranes and a flightless young. The mystery had been solved! When the nesting area
			was discovered in Wood Buffalo in 1954 the Whooping Crane population was only 21
			birds. As you know this small population has grown to 182 this past winter.<BR>
			 <BR>
			<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Looking For Tiny White Spots</B></FONT><BR>
			When I begin my surveys in early May I will be flying in a small single engine aircraft
			out over the Whooping Crane nesting marshes. These marshes are very large and extend
			for several kilometres in every direction. What I will be looking for are tiny white
			spots. When I see a white spot I will fly closer to see if these spots will turn
			out to be snow banks or whooping cranes. If they turn out to be Whooping Cranes I
			will fly lower to see if they have begun to build their nests. Once the nest is finished,
			which usually takes a couple of days, the birds will lay 2 eggs. <BR>
			<BR>
			Stay tuned for my next update.<BR>
