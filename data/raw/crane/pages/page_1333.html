<p>The group arrived in Rome Friday morning.&nbsp; Once we passed through
immigration and customs, our Italian guide (mama Rita) joined us.&nbsp; We then
went to get our luggage and to change some dollars into lira.&nbsp; After this,
it was to the tour bus for the ride to the hotel.&nbsp; The tour bus was across
the street from the airport.&nbsp; The driver packed the luggage under the bus
and then we were off to the hotel.&nbsp; The drive was interesting.&nbsp; I
could tell that we were in a different country/continent.&nbsp; There were
different kinds of trees, cars and buildings (not to mention that most of the
signs were in Italian - a significant portion though were in English).&nbsp; Our
hotel was a first class hotel called the Hotel Pineta Palace.&nbsp; Our tour guide
(mama Rita) checked us into the hotel and gave us our keys.&nbsp; We went to our
room to await our luggage.&nbsp; The room was on the fourth floor.&nbsp; The room was furnished with a wardrobe, a
dresser, 2 night stands and 2 twin beds.&nbsp; The bathroom had a shower,
toilet, sink, and a bidet.&nbsp; I had never seen a bidet before.&nbsp; The
shower was at most 30 inches by 30 inches.&nbsp; Turning around in the shower was
tricky as the shower curtain tended to stick to your body and open.&nbsp; I also
had never seen a shower head that pointed straight down and would not change
position.&nbsp; A plus was that the room had a large balcony that looked upon
downtown Rome.&nbsp; The joys of an European first class hotel.&nbsp; As I
understand it, the definition of a first class hotel in Europe is that it has
its own bathroom.&nbsp; After two hours
to get acclimated, it was off to tour Rome!&nbsp; We got back on the bus and
drove into Rome where we meat our local Rome tour guide. (Mama Rita coordinated
all the local guides in each of the locals were we went.)&nbsp; When we arrived
at our destination (an illegal drop off point), we were encouraged to get off
the bus quickly.&nbsp; After our walking tour (see the pictures below), we got
back on the bus and went back to the hotel for dinner and a nights rest.&nbsp;
For dinner we had pasta, salad, vegetable, unknown meat
(chicken/turkey/veal/pork???) and dessert.&nbsp; And lots of wine.&nbsp; Pat
mentioned that it was my birthday so I got serenaded.&nbsp; The Japanese tour
group having dinner at the same time as us also wished me well.&nbsp; It was
time for bed and I slept very well!!</p>

<p>These 2 pictures below were taken at the Rome Airport.&nbsp; Everyone from
the group was in line to change dollars into lira.&nbsp; The second picture
shows some of the ladies waiting with Father Thomas as their husbands make
&quot;change&quot;.</p>

<p>These 4 pictures immediately below were taken out of our first class hotel
window.&nbsp; The first 3 are of what appears to be a church.&nbsp; I still do
not know which one.&nbsp; The fourth one is of rooftops outside our hotel
room.&nbsp; Close to the center of this picture you can see laundry drying on a
line.&nbsp; We saw a lot of laundry drying on a line in Italy.</p>

<p>The 5 pictures below were taken at the beginning of our walking tour.&nbsp;
The first 2 are of the Roman Coliseum as we walked the streets of Rome.&nbsp;
The 3rd is of a small balcony with planters.&nbsp; It seemed like most balconies
I saw in Italy had plants and flowers growing.&nbsp; The 4th picture is of a plaque
that I thought was neat and the last 3 are of street scenes.

<p>The 6 pictures below were taken at the Roman Coliseum.&nbsp; The first two
are of the arch (Arch of Constantine) that victorious Roman generals and their army's walked through
on their way into the Coliseum.&nbsp; The third one is of a tree on a hill
beside the Coliseum (no other significance that I know of).&nbsp; The 4th
picture shows 2 &quot;gladiators&quot; and a &quot;Roman Senator&quot;.&nbsp;
For a fee you could get your picture taken with them.&nbsp; And the last 2 show
the Coliseum itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I gazed on these monuments, I could not help
but have a feeling of awe.&nbsp; They are massive structures.&nbsp; The
engineering that went into building these structures must have been
amazing.&nbsp; The Romans did not have trucks, cranes, or any of the
construction tools we take for granted.&nbsp; They had horses, mules and
people.&nbsp; This is a feeling that I had many times during this week in Italy.

<p>The pictures below were taken at and in the Basilica of St. Cosmos and
Damian.&nbsp; Evidently, the Franciscans (of which Father Thomas is a member)
care for this Basilica.&nbsp; The 4th and 5th pictures are of the &quot;Chains
of Moses&quot;.&nbsp; The inside pictures do not do the Basilica justice.&nbsp;
It is a beautiful old structure with sacred relics inside.&nbsp; The paintings
and statues are very nice.
