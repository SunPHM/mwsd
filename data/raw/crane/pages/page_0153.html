<P>Lazarus' overhead crane consists of 4 separate entities plus 1
optional entity - crane_beam is the supporting mechanism that
spans across a room. It typically moves along the length of a
warehouse, supported by a beam/column system. crane_hoist does
the lifting (in the real world), and moves back and forth along
crane_beam. crane_hook is the lifting device; it moves vertically
with horizontal movement relative to crane_hoist. crane_control
provides the controls for the crane. It may be located in a
separate area, or may move along with crane_beam. A crane can
have multiple crane_controls. The optional crane_reset, if used,
calls a crane to the crane_beam extent closest to the
crane_reset. Before moving the crane, it checks to ensure that
the crane_control is enabled.

<P>For all but crane_control, each entity must have a pathtarget
(NOTE: NOT target) path_corner. There should be 2 and only 2
path_corners in the sequence. These path_corners are only used to
describe the direction of travel for the entity and the extents
of the entity's movement&#133; they are <b>not</b> used as
waypoints. The crane orientation is limited to N-S or E-W, and
the direction is determined by the relative magnitudes of the
deltas between path_corners for crane_beam.

<P>Target keys: Crane_control must target crane_beam, crane_beam
targets crane_hoist, and crane_hoist targets crane_hook.

<P>The entity will start in the same position it is drawn in the
game. To move crane_control along with crane_beam, use the
&quot;team&quot; key for these two entities. No other entity
should use this team name. You can have multiple crane_controls
for the same crane, but only one crane_control that moves along
with the crane.

<P>Sounds: Crane_hook plays a sound constantly if the associated
crane_control is on (an electromagnet hum is nice). Use the noise
field of the crane_hook to set the sound. The crane_beam noise
moves along with crane_control (assuming it moves). The
crane_hoist noise moves with crane_hoist.

<P>Crane_control starts off unless spawnflags=1. If targeted,
crane_control toggles on/off. If the player attempts to use
crane_control while off, a message &quot;No power&quot; (or the
message specified by crane_control's message key) is displayed.

<P>Lights: Set the &quot;spotlight&quot; (=1) spawnflag for
crane_hook to include a simulated spotlight that shines as the
crane moves. The spotlight will help the player line the
crane_hook up with the desired target. This isn't realistic, but
the loss of perspective with a PC monitor (as opposed to the real
world) makes this feature a practical necessity.

<P>Crane_control controls all movement of the crane. Crane_control
should use a single brush with one face that uses the
crane/panel.wal texture or similar texture. The style key tells
the game which direction is faced when looking out over the top
of the control (0=east, 1=north, 2=west, 3=south)&#133; and yeah
we know there's an angle key, but it doesn't work properly in this
case&#133;. trust us on this. Controls are activated by looking
at one of the pseudo-buttons and pressing the +use key. These
controls then target the appropriate crane entity, <b>if</b> the 
crane_control is 1) in front of the player, 2) visible to the
player, 3) within 64 units of the player. Whether the panel.wal 
texture is used or not, the face of the control panel that faces 
the player is divided up (in the game's brain) into a matrix of 2 
rows by 4 columns of pseudo buttons.

<P><b>NOTE:</b> Once a crane_control button is activated, the
associated action continues as long as the player presses the
+use key, <b>regardless of what the player is looking at</b>.
This helps quite a bit when trying to move the crane hook to a
desired location, when the hook would be out of the player's view
if he were forced to look at the control panel.

<P>When the pickup button is activated, the code checks underneath
crane_hook for a <a href="func_pushable.htm">func_pushable</a>. If the distance to
the func_pushable is less than X units (X is currently 64), the
object &quot;falls up&quot; and will then move along with the
crane until dropped.

<P><h3>Limitations:</h3>

<blockquote>
    <P>The crane will only pick up one func_pushable at a time,
    and will not pick up a func_pushable with one or more other
    func_pushables stacked on top.
