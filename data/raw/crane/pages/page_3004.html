<P>What fun it has been during the past several days watching
many families of barn swallows lined up on the electric power
lines as though they were discussing and planning in detail their
long migratory flight that lay ahead.

<P>A particular migration flight of these sleek birds attests to
their strength on the wing.  Barn swallows that nest in Alaska
accomplish what is thought to be the most stupendous transoceanic
migratory flight of any native passerine (perching birds and
songbirds), 7,000 miles one way to Argentina, their wintering
grounds.

<P>Can you imagine another bird that appears so at home on a farm
as the barn swallow?  Even its scientific species name,
<I>rustica</I>, reflects this peaceful bird’s favorite habitat,
the country.  Experts say that it’s the only true swallow having
a forked tail in North America.  Don’t tell that to the purple
martin, the tree, bank, cliff and rough-winged swallows.

<P>Modern farming does not appear to provide nearly as many nest
sites for barn swallows as did the old-fashioned open-door type
of farming.  There is however a good way of attracting them to
the outsides of your closed buildings in case you are interested
in having birds that work all day, free of charge, catching
thousands of insects, many of them harmful.

<P>Nail two-by-fours, flat side against the buildings about six
inches under the eaves.  Surely the wood could be screwed to the
sides of metal buildings.  Barn swallows as well as cliff
swallows will readily accept these sites.

<P>A number of years ago I observed over 2,000 cliff swallow
nests constructed on the sides of two barns on a farm near
Deerfield, Wis.  This was said to be the largest colony of its
kind in the world.  The farmer nailed many long two-by-fours onto
the sides of his buildings.  In addition to this he aided the
birds by forming huge mud puddles in his yard in order to provide
them with nesting material.

<P>Barn swallows are also quite social but because their nest
site requirements are more demanding.  They rarely nest in large
concentrations as do the cliff and the bank swallows.  The
rough-winged is a more solitary breeder while the tree swallow,
being a cavity nester, will tolerate fairly close neighbors of
its own kind.

<P>Before the arrival of white people to North America, barn
swallows are thought to have built their nests in caves, along
coastline cliffs and canyons, and in tree hollows.  It wasn’t
until the plains were settled and buildings constructed that
these fleet-winged pursuit specialists also came to inhabit that
region.  Today their range includes much of North America where
three basic requirements exist; buildings, open spaces and plenty
of flying insects.

<P>The six-to-seven-inch barn swallow is noted for its short
neck, short legs and weak feet.  Facial bristles aid the bird in
capturing its flying prey.  Long pointed outer tail feathers give
it quite an elegant formal appearance while perching as well as
in flight.  A steely-blue back and creamy-buff underparts, darker
on the adult male, along with the deeply-forked tail are good
field marks.

<P>Few other birds are as dexterously maneuverable as barn
 swallows.  A pair of them proved this point quite admirably one
 summer as I set about trying to capture them in a mist net so I
 could band them.  They had taken up nesting in an old brooder
 house in which the glass windows on one end were missing.  I
 thought it would be a simple matter of stretching the net in
 front of the open windows and about one foot to the front of the
 small building, sit in the shade of a nearby apple tree and wait
 for them to be harmlessly captured.

<P>These &quot;nimble wings&quot; soon taught me a thing or two
about their aerial skills as they very effortlessly twisted and
swooped around the side of the net, between the nearly invisible
mist net and the building.  Not once did they so much as touch a
strand of the fine-mesh net with one of their wing feathers even
though they had only about a one-foot space in which to fly.

<P>These fork-tailed masons construct what amounts to a shallow
half-cup-shaped nest of solid mud always reinforced with straw or
dried grass.  The birds’ flat, short, wide bills are their
trowels.  About 100 hours are required for the male and female to
complete the nest.  Professor Joseph Hickey, ornithology
specialist at UW-Madison for many years, discovered a barn
swallow nest 107 feet above the ground built in a Minnesota
observation tower.

<P>Insects, including flies, beetles, wasps, bugs and bees
constitute nearly all of their food.  One pair of barn swallows
may travel as many as 600 miles every day in June chasing after
their food including that to be fed to their young in the nest.

<P>If only more people realized the great value of these and
other swallows they would do all within their power to attract
them to their yards.  Surely they must be considered among the
world’s finest organically pure, non-polluting insect population
regulators in the whole wide world.
