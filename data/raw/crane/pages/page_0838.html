<p><font size="4">This story board documents the chronology of events that occurred during a flight of the NASA Observations of the Middle Stratosphere
(OMS) remote sensing payload on 8 July 1997 from Ft. Wainwright Army Base, Fairbanks, Alaska.  Our goal is to deliver the payload to 90,000
ft (about 17 miles) altitude so that the spectrometers can acquire data during sunrise of the following morning.  These spectral measurements
are used to infer the concentration vs. height of nearly two dozen stratospheric gases, including ozone.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, we must return the instruments safely to the ground since they are "one of a kind" research tools.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The balloon launch and landing are carried out by personnel from the <a href="http://master.nsbf.nasa.gov/"> National Scientific Balloon
Facility</a>, based in Palestine, Texas.<br>
<br>
The total elapsed time between the first photograph and the landing shots was about 16 hours.</font></p>

football field) in the sparse air of the stratosphere. The &quot;reconnaissance

          at night. The high altitude balloon has an eerie appearance at
          midnight over Fairbanks. At mid-latitudes, the curvature of the Earth
          leads to a few minute time difference between sunset at the ground and
          sunset at 90,000 ft. At high latitudes during summer, the sun shines
          directly on objects at 90,000 ft throughout the night because the Sun
          only drops a few degrees below the horizon (in other words, the
          balloon is high enough to &quot;see the Sun&quot; over the curvature
          of the Earth). The balloon was clearly visible to the naked eye, as an
          object larger than a planet but smaller than the&nbsp; moon. This
          photograph was taken using a 200 mm lens and is comparable to the view

          The balloon flight is terminated once scientific data have been
          obtained, or if the payload drifts towards either populated regions,
          large bodies of water, or in this case a mountain range. Although
          electronic means are used to track the payload, a reconnaissance plane
          is used for visual confirmation of the location. The flight is
          terminated by a command that initiates a small detonation, causing a
          cord to rip the mylar skin of the balloon. This rare photograph ,
          taken from the airplane at about 15,000 ft altitude, shows the balloon
          just after the termination command was issued. The helium leaks out of
          the balloon rather slowly because the surrounding stratospheric air is
          at low pressure, about a factor of 50 less than the pressure at the
          ground (e.g., the surrounding air is doing little to &quot;push&quot;
          the helium out of the balloon).</font></p>
