    Spots</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Bird diversity is highest where several habitat
    types are found together. One of the best birding spots on the Refuge is the Upper Red
    Rock Lake Campground. This site has large open water, mudflats, aspens, willows, grass,
    sagebrush uplands, and stands of evergreen trees all nearby. Other popular places to
    birdwatch include the Lower Structure, Idlewild, Odell Creek to Sparrow Pond, between
    Shambo Pond and the Upper Lake Campground, along Elk Lake Road, and Pintail Ditch West.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><strong>Rare Birds</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Of the 232 bird species recorded here, 53 are
    considered rare or accidental. This means they are observed very infrequently in
    restricted habitat or are outside of their normal range here. In the past two years rare
    birds such as great egret, whooping crane, wood duck, turkey vulture, dunlin, northern
    mockingbird, northern parula, black-and-white warbler, northern oriole, rose-breasted
    grosbeak, and grasshopper sparrow have been seen. Another bird considered rare here that
    does not&#146;t normally get many ooh&#146;s and aah&#146;s elsewhere is the rock dove!</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><strong>Winter Birds</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Because our winters are harsh, only a small
    percentage of species found on the Refuge stay through the winter. Our year-round
    residents include belted kingfisher, American dipper, northern goshawk, golden and bald
    eagles, blue and ruffed grouse, great gray and great horned owls, hairy and downy
    woodpeckers, Stellar&#146;s jay, black-billed magpie, Clark&#146;s nutcracker, common
    raven, black-capped and mountain chickadees, white-breasted and red-breasted nuthatches,
    pine grosbeak, red crossbill, and pine siskin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Some birds winter here but leave in the spring
    to breed in the north. Our winter birds include northern shrike, rough-legged hawk, snow
    bunting, American tree sparrow, common redpoll, and rosy finch.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Several waterfowl species stay here in the
    winter on small ponds fed by warm springs. This includes waterfowl such as the trumpeter

    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">The Refuge&#146;s grasslands have low bird
    diversity, which is typical of most grasslands. Only seven bird species are seen regularly
    in our grasslands. The most common grassland birds are the long-billed curlew, willet,
    sandhill crane, western meadowlark, horned lark, Savannah sparrow, and vesper sparrow. In
    areas of sagebrush, particularly on the northern side of the Refuge, watch for sage
    grouse, sage thrasher, vesper sparrow, and Brewer&#146;s sparrow. Also using the
    grasslands are raptors such as short-eared owl, red-tailed hawk, Swainson&#146;s hawk,
    American kestrel, prairie falcon, and northern harrier.</font></p>

    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Riparian habitats, along creeks and rivers, and

    sandpiper, common snipe, willow flycatcher, house wren, yellow warbler, common
    yellowthroat, Wilson&#146;s warbler, Lincoln's sparrow, and song sparrow.</font></p>

    Townsend&#146;s solitaire, kinglets, warbling vireo, yellow-rumped warbler, western

    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Many people ask about the bird boxes on the
    fence posts along the road. These are bluebird boxes donated, installed, and maintained by
    a private landowner in the valley. Birds using these boxes are primarily mountain
    bluebirds and tree swallows, birds which normally nest in cavities in trees. Our mountain
    bluebird population, unlike other bluebird species, has been thriving. There is abundant
    natural nesting habitat for them in the old aspen stands along the base of the Centennial
    Mountains. The mountain bluebirds do sometimes have to compete with European starlings and
    tree swallows for nest sites. Our starling population is relatively small but has been
    increasing the past few years. We do not have western bluebirds nesting on the Refuge. Our
    elevation is higher than what western bluebirds normally prefer.</font></p>

    alt="imature perigrine falcon photo" align="right" border="0" width="177" height="259"></b>The American peregrine
    falcon <em>(Falco peregrinus anatum)</em> was present in the United States at least 30,000
    years ago. It bred in nearly every state in the Union. Threats to the peregrine were
    vastly increased after human population expansion in the last century. This adaptable
    species thrived for many decades despite extensive persecution by man. But in the early
    1950s, the breeding population began an unprecedented and precipitous decline.&nbsp; In
    1970, the peregrine falcon was listed as an endangered species. By the mid-1970s, only 20
    percent of the breeding pairs remained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">There is evidence of a gradual decline of the
    peregrine in some regions prior to the DDT era, due perhaps to higher mean temperatures
    and lower precipitation. However, this decline was minor compared to the effects of DDT.
    DDT (dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane), a chlorinated organic insecticide used in
    agriculture, caused eggshell thinning which led to poor reproductivity. Peregrines
    ingested DDT mainly from preying on migrant insectivorous birds. DDE, a metabolite of DDT,
    was present in amounts sufficient to account for pronounced shell thinning in peregrine
    eggs as early as 1948.</font><b></p>
    <b><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Montana</font></b></p>
    <p></b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Prior to 1975, 23 peregrine nesting
    territories were known in Montana. By 1980, there were no known breeding peregrines in
    Montana. At this time, efforts were initiated to re-establish peregrines in Montana
    through the release of young birds produced in captivity. For Montana, these efforts
    started in the Centennial Valley, an ideal location because of its abundant cliffs and
    nearby bird populations.</font><b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><img src="images/img0098.jpg"
    alt="peregrine falcon photo" align="right" border="0" width="150" height="181">Management</font></p>
    <p></b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">When it was realized that the peregrine
    population was in grave danger, a plan was developed that called for the direct protection
    of peregrines and their habitat, action to increase natural reproductivity, and
    continuation of captive breeding and release. These three measures had emergency priority.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Advances made by <font color="#000000">The
    Peregrine Fund</font> in the technology of artificial insemination and incubation made
    large-scale captive propagation of peregrines feasible. Natural reproduction was enhanced
    by artificial incubation of eggs and the return of those young to the wild. Young were
    raised in captivity until just before they could fly. They then were placed at a <i>hack
    site</i> or <i>hack tower</i> in the wild. They were fed by hack site attendants while
    they learned to fly and hunt for themselves, eventually becoming independent. This process
    is called &quot;hacking out&quot;.</font><b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Red Rock Lakes and the Centennial Valley</font></p>
    <p></b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">In the late 1970s, peregrines were only
    sighted occasionally in the Centennial Valley. From 1981 to 1988, captive-reared birds
    were hacked out by The Peregrine Fund at up to three sites. In 1984, the first wild pair
    to return to Montana nested on a cliff in the Centennial Valley. These were birds released
    into the wild by The Peregrine Fund several years earlier. This pair has produced young
    every year since. In 1986, a second pair returned to a hack tower in the valley. One of
    these was hacked out in Colorado. In 1987, a third pair returned to another hack tower,
    and in 1988, a fourth pair returned to the valley. By 1989, all hack sites were being used
    by wild pairs, in addition to one natural site. Efforts to hack-out captive-reared birds
    were discontinued. Peregrine falcons are sited regularly, and there are now four confirmed
    breeding pairs in the Centennial Valley.</font><b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Life History</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><img src="images/img0023.jpg"
    alt="mountain cliffs photo" align="right" border="0" width="250" height="157"></b>Peregrines formerly nested on
    cliffs, usually in mountainous areas or near rivers or lakes. In the Rocky Mountains, they
    now persist mainly on mountain cliffs and river gorges. Remaining aeries exist on dominant
    cliffs which generally exceed 200 feet in height. Nests are situated on open ledges or
    potholes. A preference for a southern exposure increases with latitude. Peregrines nested
    from the lowest elevations to above 9,000 feet. However, nesting above 8,500 feet is rare.
    In the Rockies, the majority of known remaining pairs are near ponderosa pine forest or
    pinyon-juniper woodland. Nest sites are often adjacent to water courses and impoundments
    because of the abundance of avian prey which frequent such areas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">In the Centennial Valley, pairs are usually
    present on the nesting site by late March. A clutch of three or four eggs are laid in late
    April. Incubation lasts 33 days. The young remain in the area several weeks after fledging
    in mid-July. During this time they are fed and defended by both adults.</font><b></p>
    <p></b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Peregrines may travel up to 17 miles from
    nesting cliffs to hunting areas. Flight speed in excess of 60 miles an hour allow this
    falcon to hunt large areas with little effort. Preferred hunting habitats such as
    cropland, meadows, river bottoms, marshes, and lakes attract abundant bird life.
    Peregrines appear to capture a wide variety of birds, including blackbirds, jays, doves,
    shorebirds, and smaller songbirds. Most prey species are struck from above at great speed,
    but they often evade the falcon&#146;s attack by aerobatics or diving to cover.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Annual juvenile mortality is estimated at
    approximately 55 to 70 percent and adult mortality at 20 to 30 percent. The mean life
    expectancy for those young that fledge is probably near four years. The recorded maximum
    life span is in excess of 13 years, though it is not unreasonable to assume that a few
    individuals may live to 20 years since several peregrines reached that age in captivity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Human-caused mortalities that have been
    documented include shooting, poisoning, pole-trapping, destruction of nestlings, egg
    collecting, and interference at the nest causing abandonment or fatal interruption of
    parental care. A variety of predators have been known to prey on peregrines or their eggs,
    including great horned owls, prairie falcons, raccoons, coyotes, foxes, golden eagles,
    ravens, crows, striped skunks, bobcats, and possibly ospreys. Accidents account for some
    peregrine mortalities. These include collisions with powerlines, fences, automobiles, and
    airplanes, falling and being blown from nests, rock slides, aerie sloughing,
    electrocution, and drowning. At least ten diseases and parasites are known from wild
    peregrines. Peregrine deaths from botulism, herpes virus, pericarditis, leucocytozoonsis,
    and pneumonia have been reported.</font><b></p>
    <p></b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Peregrines do not normally breed until at
    least two years old. They must fledge approximately 1.25 young per pair in order to
    sustain the population. Due to long average life expectancy and the peregrine&#146;s
    population dynamics, successful management operations do not provide quick population
    recovery.</font><b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Epilogue</font></p>
    <p></b><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">On August 25, 1999, the U.S. Fish and
    Wildlife Service officially removed the American peregrine falcon from the Federal List of
    Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, recognizing the subspecies' recovery following
    restrictions on organochlorine pesticides in the United States and Canada, and following
    the implementation of successful management activities.&nbsp; Although delisting the
    peregrine removes it from the ESA's protection, it still will be protected by the
    Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
    Wild Fauna and Flora, and state laws and regulations; and its status will be monitored for
    a minimum of five years.&nbsp; If during this period it is determined that the peregrine
    again needs the Endangered Species Act's protection, the Fish and Wildlife Service would
    relist the species.&nbsp; In response to the successful recovery of the peregrine falcon,
    the Peregrine Fund's last release of captive-bred peregrine falcons was in 1997.&nbsp; For
    information on recent peregrine falcon production in the Centennial Valley and Montana,

    face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Sandhill cranes can be seen on the Refuge from April to
    September. These stately birds stand at a height of three feet, have a bald red crown, and
    range in color from light grey to a rusty brown. The rusty coloration is acquired from
    iron in the soil which gets on their bills and stains their feathers when they preen.
    Cranes can generally be observed throughout the Refuge along creeks, near wetlands, and in
    open grassy areas. Around 400 sandhill cranes regularly summer in the Centennial Valley.
    Hunting of sandhills is not allowed on the Refuge, although there is a special permit hunt
    in Beaverhead County.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">There are six subspecies of sandhill cranes.
    Greater sandhill cranes, which nest on the Refuge, can be distinguished from the other
    subspecies only by geographic distribution. There is considerable overlap in coloration
    and size between the subspecies.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Natural History</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Sandhill cranes pair for life. Courtship occurs
    in April and May. The cranes are famous for their elaborate courtship dances which consist
    of bows, jumps, and pirouettes. There can be from two to a hundred dancers involved in
    this ritual. Although the dance is considered mainly a courtship ritual, it is sometimes
    seen at other times of the year. Sandhills have a loud trumpeting call which can be heard
    for over a mile. Sandhill cranes are omnivorous. They eat small rodents, grain, frogs,
    snakes, insects, worms, and birds. Young cranes eat mostly insects.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Nesting</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Sandhill cranes typically nest near water. The
    nest is usually a mound of dead reeds, grasses, or sedges. Nests can be found along
    streams, on islands, in marshes, and along the shorelines of ponds and lakes. The clutch
    usually consists of two eggs. They hatch after about 30 days of incubation. The young
    cranes, called colts, are active about 24 hours after hatching. Juveniles can be
    distinguished from adults because they lack the bald red crown. Instead their heads and
    necks are covered with brownish feathers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Sandhill cranes are very sensitive to
    disturbance when nesting and may abandon their eggs if they are approached too closely.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Migration</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Normally, sandhill cranes begin returning from
    their wintering areas in southwest U.S. and northern Mexico in early April. They remain on
    the breeding grounds throughout the summer. Fall migration begins in late August. By the
    end of September, most all of the cranes have departed for southern climes. Cranes which
    breed in the Red Rock Lakes area often winter at Bosque del Apache NWR in New Mexico.</font></p>

    and other Refuge animals contact the staff at Refuge headquarters.</font></p>
