<p><b><font size="4"><font color="#006600">This length of canal was the subject
of a major flood relief scheme shortly after the canal was abandoned and
is now classed as "main river" by the Environment Agency. The water level
is far lower than the original operating level and can be shallow in places.
It can be navigated by canoes with care when prevailing circumstances provide
sufficient but not excessive water. Those choosing to navigate this section
do so entirely at their own risk and the Company cannot be held responsible 
for users misjudging the suitability of this length for use. </font></font><br>

At present, the available length commences just east of Ebley Mill at Fromebridge 
Gardens where the water passing down the canal is discharged into the River
Frome. Works are underway to excavate the canal past Ebley Mill and beyond
where tipping resulted in the canal being infilled some 30 years ago. <font color="#ff0000">
 Ongoing work either side of Ebley Mill means that these new sections are
not available for navigation by any craft yet; please return to this page
to check availability.</font>  Eventually, the whole length to Ryeford Double
Lock will be cleared and the water level increased to permit full navigation 
again.</b></p>

A little upstream of Ebley, an area is reached where there has been major
redevelopment on both sides of the canal. The canal is crossed by temporary
foot bridge then a pipe at the location of Hilly Orchard Bridge which is
in the process of being rebuilt. <br>

The canal continues eastwards towards Dudbridge where a new bridge carries
the A419 dual carriageway over the canal with full navigation clearance.
Immediately beyond the bridge is Dudbridge Lower Lock and <font color="#ff0000">
it is necessary to portage round this and the nearby Dudbridge Upper Lock</font>

Adjacent to this section of canal is a unique survivor - the Dudbridge Crane 
stands on what was once Dudbridge Wharf. It is complete. and dates back to
the mid 19th century. It is the only crane left on the whole Cotswold Canals
network.</b><br>

<b>The two locks at Dudbridge have had their top gates replaced with concrete
dams about 1m below the original water level. This work was carried out when
the canal was modified to become a  flood relief channel. <br>
<br>
The canal carries the flows from Slad Brook and the Painswick Stream with
Ruscombe brook joining the canal between the two Dudbridge locks,<br>
<br>
In times of flood, the flows down the canal can be considerable and most
winters see periods of high flows making navigation unwise.<br>
<br>
When the canal is restored, a large bywash weir will be needed to carry the
surplus water around these locks.</b><br>

The canal presses on towards Stroud and the next road crossing is at Chestnut
Lane where a former swing bridge has been fixed. Most small craft should
be able to pass underneath but <font color="#ff0000">particular care is needed
in times of higher flow</font>.</b><br>

Lodgemoor Bridge is another former swing bridge and is unusual in that it
is also a skew bridge. It is also the last bridge over the Stroudwater before
its terminus is reached at Wallbridge.</b><br>
<br>
<b>As Stroud is approached, the Painswick Stream enters on the north bank.
This used to be navigable for a short distance at one time. Immediately upstream
of this confluence is a low weir across the canal.</b><br>

The Thames &amp; Severn Canal leaves the Stroudwater Canal at Wallbridge on
the north bank. The Stroudwater Navigation used to terminate in a basin just
beyond this point but it has been filled in and is now occupied by various
businesses. The original redbrick warehouse still stands on the north side
as does the former headquarters building of the Company of Proprietors of
the Stroudwater Navigation just beyond it - this is best viewed from either
the T&amp;S Canal towpath or the main road.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Some of the western sections of the T&amp;S Canal between Stroud and Chalford
are suitable for navigation by small craft. These sections are mostly in
the ownership of Gloucestershire County Council but are likely to be transferred
to British Waterways in due course.</b><br>
