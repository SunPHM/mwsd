<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cummins India Limited 
  (CIL) is a 51 per cent subsidiary of Cummins Inc. USA, the world's largest independent 
  diesel engine designer and manufacturer from 18 HP to 3,500 HP. Cummins Engine 
  Co. (CECO) set up CIL in 1962 as KCL, jointly promoted with Kirloskar Oil Engines 
  Limited to manufacture diesel engines. In 1997, CECO increased its stake making 
  it a 51 per cent subsidiary of the parent company in Columbus, Indiana. Today, 
  CIL is India's largest manufacturer of diesel engine value packages ranging 
  from 60 HP to 2700 HP serving the power generation, industrial and automotive 
  markets. The Cummins Industrial Business Unit manufactures and markets diesel 
  and gas engines which are available on a variety of mobile and stationary equipment. 
  In the construction market, Cummins engines are used for excavators, tippers, 
  backhoe loaders, front end loaders, graders, pavers, portable compressors, finishers, 
  compactors, dozers, skid steer loaders, cranes, forklifts, reach stackers, etc. 
  For mining, they are used in dumpers, dozers, graders, excavators, loaders, 
  blast hole rigs, coal haulers, surface miners, tyre handlers, etc. Cummins engines

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>On the company's 
  products…<br>
  </b>We are in partnership with OEMs with an aim to providie the latest products 
  for construction and mining. We distinguish the two fields by the power of the 
  machine. Generally, construction machines are under 500 HP while for mining 
  they are more than 350 HP. We are also bringing in new generation engines for 
  modern construction equipment like skid steers, pavers, compactors, loaders, 
  excavators and cranes to be used in infrastructure development like roads, irrigation, 
  dams, ports, etc.</font></p>

  On operations…</b><br>
  The base engines are made at the Pune factory. <br>
  Our engines are customised to the demands of the application and are offered 
  with cooling, exhaust and air intake systems fully integrated with equipment 
  design for optimum performance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the C series 
  engine was introduced on Telcon excavators, the first 60 to 80 engines were 
  imported, and now we are developing the engines indigenously. Our engines are 
  supported by a competent service network Over a 1,00,000 engines installed base 
  is serviced by 90 dealers and 215 service outlets. Of the 90 dealers, half of 
  them have their own service centres.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>On meeting emission 
  norms …</b><br>
  The year 2004-05 will see the adoption of stringent emission norms and only 
  those companies which have the latest technology will be able to meet them. 
  At Cummins, our corporate mission dictates that everything we do leads to a 
  cleaner, healthier and safer environment. Cummins Inc. has always been a pioneer 
  in offering latest technology products to meet stringent world-wide norms. Cummins 
  India is well positioned to offer products for all markets meeting emission 
  norms applicable in India. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>On the future…</b><br>
  Currently, the equipment market is growing at the rate of 5-7 per cent and is 
  headed to rise sharply ahead. I foresee a major boost in mining projects which 
  are coming up. State highways, roads to important links like ports and mines 
  are the other growth drivers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Railway maintenance 
  too is going to require equipment for safety and track maintenance. Overall, 
  road construction growth will be fuelled by state highway projects and Cummins 
  is well positioned to take on the market demand with new alliances and projects. 
  It would be mandated as a preferred supplier due to the upcoming emission norms 
  and its capacity to upgrade its products backed by service. This will ensure 
  the company's dominant position in the sector. </font></p>
