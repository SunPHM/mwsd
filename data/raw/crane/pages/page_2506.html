  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1">A SURF SCOTER seemed very out-of-place
  just north of the concrete bridge at<BR>
  Lake Merced. Eric found an AMERICAN GOLDFINCH and a CEDAR WAXWING
  at the<BR>
  Boathouse. There were only four AMERICAN WIGEON left at South
  Lake, but<BR>
  there was a LESSER GOLDFINCH at the north end of Middle Lake.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Lots of activity at North Lake with large
  numbers of YELLOW-RUMPED and<BR>
  TOWNSEND'S WARBLERs in partial to full song, seemingly staging
  to push<BR>
  north. CEDAR WAXWINGs were plentiful as well.<BR>
<BR>
  North Lake also had the best bird by far, a briefly-seen sparrow
  with a<BR>
  bright rufous cap, black eye line, and an otherwise apparently
  unmarked gray<BR>
  face and an unmarked pale belly. The bird was in the dense vegetation
  at<BR>
  the southeast end of the lake. My field identification was CHIPPING<BR>
  SPARROW, but I'm not so sure now, particularly since the habitat
  seems<BR>
  better for SWAMP SPARROW than for CHSP. Don't find something
  unexpected<BR>
  after a big night. :-|</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The East Wash also had AMERCIAN GOLDFINCHES
  and 23 SURFBIRDS at the Cliff<BR>

  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">4.8 [SFBirds] SF Big Day, April 8<BR>
  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1">First, a little background. In 1999,
  Alan Hopkins, Hugh Cotter, Mark Eaton and<BR>
  I did the first known &quot;official&quot; spring Big Day in
  San Francisco. Despite<BR>
  intermittent rain and 20-30 mph wind all day, we managed 127
  species on the<BR>
  day. The previous &quot;official&quot; record, of 113, had been
  from a fall effort by<BR>
  Harry Fuller, Josiah Clark, Ivan Samuels and myself. (For those
  of you who<BR>
  have been on Alan's Bird Blitz and seen more than 113 in a day,
  as I have, the<BR>
  Bird Blitz does not count as an official big day under ABA rules.)
  Last year,<BR>
  an intrepid team went out and saw 134 species on a spring big
  day, wiping our<BR>
  names off the record books (and off Joe Morlan's SF birding web
  page).</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Having had our crown stolen from us by an
  upstart group of Young Turks (Jay<BR>
  Withgott, Kevin McKeregan, Paul Saraceni and Rich Ferrick), we
  felt we had to<BR>
  redeem our honor and wrest back the now-coveted Maltese Falcon
  trophy (an<BR>
  impressive piece of plaster now residing at Jay's house, perhaps
  to his wife's<BR>
  chagrin). We had to do a Big Day, in fact a Bigger Day than they
  had. We<BR>
  needed 135. Alan was not able to make it, so we slotted in Eric
  Preston in his<BR>
  stead.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We started out at 4:30 with high hopes, decent
  weather, a cooler full of Dr.<BR>
  Pepper, and a singing Mockingbird in Hugh's driveway. Off to
  the Presidio<BR>
  where Great Horned Owl hooted obligingly. Lake Merced yielded
  rails and ducks<BR>
  at first light, and by 6:50 we were headed to Mt Davidson with
  more than 30<BR>
  birds under our belt. An excellent start! Mt D (expertly scouted
  for us by<BR>
  the magnanimous Mr. Saraceni) added another 20 birds, including
  the Hermit<BR>
  Warbler which was heard by all except Mark who was &quot;taking
  care of business.&quot; <BR>
  Winter Wren, Orange-crowned warbler, Hermit thrush, Allen's hummer,
  pygmy<BR>
  nuthatch were all there, but we could not find a Band-tailed
  pigeon.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Off to Pine Lake Park, where Mark had scouted
  a Bullocks Oriole and<BR>
  White-throated Sparrow the day before. We had siskin and waxwing,
  but the two<BR>
  staked out birds did not materialize. Back to the north end of
  Lake Merced,<BR>
  where Bewicks Wren and Black-throated Gray Warbler warmed us
  up and took us to<BR>
  60 -- by 8:40 am. We were on a roll. Fort Funston gave us two
  loons and two<BR>
  scoters, but no Pacific and no white-winged. No snowys visible
  on our quick<BR>
  dip into Ocean Beach. The Cliff House gave us the expected Surfbird,<BR>
  Oystercatcher, black turnstone (no ruddy!) and a nice flock of
  Bonies migrating<BR>
  far offshore. We left with 80 birds, heading to the Presidio.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Hugh picked out the Hooded Oriole's distinctive
  call at Kobbe and Upton. He<BR>
  had had flicker, Hairy WP and RB nuthatch in the Presidio the
  day before, but<BR>
  we did not turn them up, and our morale flagged briefly. A quick
  stop at the<BR>
  Palace of Fine ARts turned up nothing, and our spirits took another
  slight dip.<BR>
  Crissy added a few, including an unexpected Lesser Scaup. On
  to Golden Gate<BR>
  Park!</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">On to dullsville! The park was over-run with
  tourists, the birds were very<BR>
  quiet if they were even there at all. All the good birds in the
  arboretum<BR>
  seemed to have gone to sleep or to Oregon, one or the other.
  We pushed through<BR>
  90 birds just after noon, but we were losing steam. Hugh spotted
  the Tropical<BR>
  Kingbird at the Buffalo Paddock to revive us, and the Dr. Pepper
  helped too.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Off to the eastern part of the city to add
  to our list -- we had 100 as we<BR>
  headed to Herons Head, and 135 was looking distant. A quick 10
  birds bolstered<BR>
  our effort, and our morale, considerably -- white-winged scoter
  and pelagic<BR>
  cormorant were treats we earned. As we left the eastern side
  of the city at<BR>
  3:45, we had 114, and 135 felt completely out of reach.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As we drove to McLaren, Hugh announced that
  I had miscounted, that we actually<BR>
  had 119 -- we only needed 16 birds, and there was 4 hours of
  light left! We<BR>
  were back in the game! We could easily do it -- and we came up
  with several<BR>
  different lists of the 16 that would bring us the prize. We were
  going to do<BR>
  it!</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">45 minutes at McLaren without a single new
  bird later, we werent so sure. At<BR>
  Lake Merced, I pulled out a Bank Swallow, and then a woody, to
  pick us back up.<BR>
  Back at Pine Lake Park, Mark and Hugh found the white-throated
  sparrow for us.<BR>
  123 by 5:20, we were in the hunt. Only 12 birds to glory...</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">But which 12? Back to the Presidio, where
  we picked up Flicker (124). <BR>
  Everything was quiet. Our scouted birds werent there. We went
  to our trusty<BR>
  spots -- the wrentit overlook, Lobos Creek, you name it. We couldnt
  buy a<BR>
  bird. At ten of 7 we scoped Mile Rock, hoping for Peregrine.
  No dice. Hugh<BR>
  spotted a Heerman's Gull for us (125), but even that goodie wasn't
  enough to<BR>
  overcome the pall that had fallen over the team. Another Dr.
  Pepper didnt<BR>
  help, either. The sun was starting to go down, and we still needed
  10 birds.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Our last push was back to Mt Davidson -- surely
  those Band-tails were<BR>
  somewhere, and maybe a sharpie? A swift? Something? Anything?
  Nope.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">As we watched a glorious sunset (&quot;Jesus
  rays,&quot; I've heard them called recently)<BR>
  from the top of Mt Davidson, we admitted to ourselves that the
  Young Turks<BR>
  would keep the crown, for now. Our attention turned to dinner.
  Another great<BR>
  day of birding in the City -- no glory, but a lot of great birds,
  with great<BR>
  birders and friends, on a beautiful day to be outside in Northern
  California.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">We finished up with 125, drove 101 miles (name
  another county in CA where you<BR>
  can do a big day and only go 101 miles!), and vowed to retake
  the trophy next<BR>
  year. Young Turks, beware!</FONT></P>

  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">4.10 [SFBirds] I knew this would happen...<BR>
  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1">I was driving home this evening when
  I realized there was still enough light<BR>
  to bird. I headed over to Pine Lake not really expecting to find
  the Black-throated Green Warbler. <BR>
  I didn't of course, but I did have killer looks at the WHITE-THROATED<BR>
  SPARROW, resplendent in alternate plumage, which was the only
  zonotrichia<BR>
  sp. which I saw. A quick trip around the lake a dusk had a very
  retiring<BR>
  SORA barely vocalizing near the southeast corner of the lake.</FONT></P>

  <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1">4.21 [SFBirds] More SF birds<BR>
  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1">Hugh and I gout for a couple of hours
  this morning. There are still BLACK<BR>
  TURNSTONES and a single SURFBIRD at the Cliff House, but little
  else of<BR>
  interest moving about other than some indications of migration
  activity<BR>
  including 5 MARBLED GODWITS moving south and three small sandpipers
  moving<BR>
  north.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the East Wash, we had slightly different
  birds than Brian. We had at<BR>
  least four and possibly as many as six HOODED ORIOLES in the
  East Wash, with<BR>
  a memorable three in one bush at once. There were also at least
  two<BR>
  BULLOCK'S ORIOLES present. We had eight to ten ORANGE-CROWNED
  WARBLERS in<BR>
  both washes and at least two WILSON'S WARBLERS and a flock of
  nine CEDAR<BR>
  WAXWINGS flew out of a flowering eucalyptus.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">In the west wash, there were at least two
  TOWNSEND'S WARBLERS and a stunning<BR>
  full alternate HERMIT WARBLER at eye level for a five warbler
  morning. A<BR>
  HUTTON'S VIREO was also calling in the west wash.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1">At the plateau on Fort Miley, we had a fly-over
  LESSER GOLDFINCH and along<BR>
  El Camino del Mar there was an unseen bird sp. that was either
  an<BR>
  OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER or perfect mimid thereof.</FONT></P>

  Hugh and I arrived promptly at Miami International and were greeted
  by the unmistakable odor of mold in the decaying and overcrowded
  airport. Our bags arrived promptly and we promptly got our rental
  car shuttle, but it took 45 minutes to get a car and get out
  of the airport through the rush hour traffic. Fortunately, the
  birding was much better than the traffic.<BR>
<BR>
  The first stop was the Baptist Hospital in Kendall. It wasn't
  hard to find the parrots, but it took awhile to make sure we
  had seen MONK PARAKEET, YELLOW-CHEVRONED PARAKEET and CANARY-WINGED
  PARAKEET. Hugh also found a RED-WHISKERED BULBUL. Onto the Kendall
  Tennis Courts and there was a COMMON MYNA there easy to see.<BR>
<BR>
  It was getting late, so we started our trip to the Everglades.
  Smooth-billed Ani is nearly extirpated in South Florida, so we
  had staked out a spot in Homestead. However, the anis were not
  cooperating. We did pick up EASTERN KINGBIRD en route, however.
  Also, we had a fine meal at the <A HREF="http://www.mutineer.com/">Mutineer
  Restaurant </A>in Florida City. We sack out dog tired in our
  room in the Flamingo Lodge in the Everglades.<BR>
<BR>
  <I>4.25</I><BR>
  Hugh arises early and fetches coffee. I arise more leisurely,
  using the excuse that it's still too dark to bird. Only after
  Hugh returns do I realize that the windows are tinted dark! Nonetheless,
  we head over to Eco Pond where the pond is covered in a humid
  haze. WHITE-EYED VIREOs are everywhere and we pull a BROWN THRASHER
  out of the thicket. WHITE IBISes are everywhere with a few <A
  HREF="../../Images/GlossyIbis.jpg">GLOSSY IBISes </A>as well
  and we hear a LEAST BITTERN calling. WHITE-CROWNED PIGEON is
  first elusive, but then several flush on the back side of the
  pond. GRAY CATBIRD is easy to find too. It takes a little while,
  but finally our ears tune into the call note of GREAT CRESTED
  FLYCATCHER. COMMON GROUND-DOVEs are fairly easy to spot and an
  INDIGO BUNTING obliges on a subsequent loop around the pond.<BR>
<BR>
  We return to Flamingo and check the mudflats. The light isn't
  good, but we can pick out CAPSIAN, ROYAL and LEAST TERNS. However,
  it's getting hot and the tropical species are warming to the
  heat. <A HREF="../../Images/BlackWhiskeredVireo.jpg">BLACK-WHISKERED
  VIREOs</A> are calling in several spots and we finally track
  one down near the mudflats. On the way back to the car, we have
  a GRAY KINGBIRD in the parking lot that affords fine views. A
  quick return back to Eco Pond nets <A HREF="../../Images/SwallowTailedKite.jpg">SWALLOW-TAILED
  KITE</A>, but the Mangrove Cuckoo that had been reported earlier
  this week eludes us.<BR>
<BR>
  In a bit of questionable logic, we decide to hike Snake Bight
  in the heat of the day. We have a few warblers including <A 
  HREF="../../Images/AmericanRedstart.jpg">AMERICAN REDSTART</A>,
  BLACK-THROATED BLUE and <A HREF="../../Images/CapeMayWarbler.jpg">CAPE
  MAY WARBLERs</A>, but the best view is of a very obliging BLACK-WHISKERED
  VIREO. However most of the trail is an unmitigated horror of
  debilitating heat and humidity and mosquitoes of stunning ferocity.
  In particular, there's only a ROSEATE SPOONBILL at the end of
  the boardwalk; no sign of any flamingos, which made the hike
  seem even more absurd.<BR>
<BR>
  On the way out of the park, WOOD STORKs are easy to find near
  Paurotis Pond. We return to the junction of 187th street/avenue
  with 296th street/avenue where the anis had been reported. I
  tape with gusto, but there is little shaking in the early afternoon.
  Hugh urges me to return to the car and I start walking back,
  taping as I go. Hugh's back at the car when I look at a small
  mound I've scanned several times before. Sure enough, there's
  two SMOOTH-BILLED ANIs on the mound. Hugh's amazed at how we
  pulled that one out of our ass.<BR>
<BR>
  We head north then east on the Tamiani Trail to the abandoned
  airboat concession just west of the Miccosukee restaurant. Two
  or three <A HREF="../../Images/Limpkin.jpg">LIMPKIN</A> are lolling
  about in the mid-afternoon heat along with a ridiculously cooperative
  <A HREF="../../Images/Anhinga.jpg">ANHINGA</A>, and with a little
  scope work, we pull out at least two distant SNAIL KITEs due
  north of the concession. We immediately head south towards the
  keys, using Card Sound Road rather than Hwy. 1 which was still
  closed by a nasty wildfire. Hugh spots the first of many <A 
  HREF="../../Images/MagnificentFrigatebird.jpg">MAGNIFICENT FRIGATEBIRD</A>s
  on Key Largo; we won't tire of looking at these guys throughout
  the trip.<BR>
<BR>
  We arrive around 10:00 and cart our gear onto the boat. Paul
  Lehman introduces himself and Gary Rosenberg and shows us to
  our berths.<BR>
<BR>
  <I>4.26</I><BR>
  The trip to the Dry Tortugas starts as advertised. <A HREF="../../Images/Common%20Tern.jpg">COMMON
  TERN</A> is quite accommodating on a couple of buoys allowing
  relatively close looks. It's a banner day for <A HREF="../../Images/NorthernGannet.jpg">NORTHERN
  GANNET</A>s and several small groups pass us by on the trip.
  As we start approaching the Fort, a <A HREF="../../Images/BrownBooby.jpg">BROWN
  BOOBY</A> sits obligingly on a large buoy and several BRIDLED
  TERNs pass us by. I stepped inside for a moment and the first
  AUDUBON'S SHEARWATER zips by and is gone. I am mortified until
  a second passes by shortly thereafter. Near the fort, the first
  <A HREF="../../Images/BrownNoddy.jpg">BROWN NODDYs </A>and <A
  HREF="../../Images/SootyTern.jpg">SOOTY TERNs</A> appear, which
  will be welcome friends for the duration of the trip. <BR>
<BR>
  When we get to Fort Jefferson, Paul announces that there's been
  quite a few good birds around and he's correct. In short order,
  we pick up our first MERLIN, a BANK SWALLOW and both <A HREF="../../Images/GrayCheekedThrush.jpg">GRAY-CHEEKED
  THRUSH</A> and <A HREF="../../Images/Veery.jpg">VEERY</A>. As
  expected, the looks are quite good due to the paucity of vegetation
  and the general condition of the birds. Warblers include BLACK
  AND WHITE, AMERICAN REDSTART, PRAIRIE, CAPE MAY, <A HREF="../../Images/BlackThroatedBlueWarbler.jpg">BLACK-THROATED
  BLUE</A>, <A HREF="../../Images/PrairieWarbler.jpg">PRAIRIE</A>
  and <A HREF="../../Images/PalmWarbler.jpg">PALM</A> and <A HREF="../../Images/YellowBilledCuckoo.jpg">YELLOW-BILLED
  CUCKOOs</A> are easy to find. With a little work, CAVE SWALLOWs
  can be picked out from the swallows circling above. Outside the
  fort, a <A HREF="../../Images/ChuckWillsWidow.jpg">CHUCK-WILL'S
  WIDOW</A> has been located roosting in a thicket, affording fine
  views and photos and a female <A HREF="../../Images/PaintedBunting.jpg">PAINTED
  BUNTING </A>is hanging around the spring.<BR>
<BR>
  However, the best birds are yet to be found at Loggerhead Key.
  A lovely YELLOW-THROATED WARBLER greets us as we get off the
  skiff, followed by TENNESSEE WARBLER, BOBOLINK, <A HREF="../../Images/IndigoBunting.jpg">INDIGO
  BUNTING</A> and more great looks at <A HREF="../../Images/GrayKingbird.jpg">GRAY
  KINGBIRD</A>. Could it get better? Paul refinds the <A HREF="../../Images/ShinyCowbird.jpg">SHINY
  COWBIRD</A> that's been present for some time. We work the other
  side of the key and have <A HREF="../../Images/BlackpollWarbler.jpg">BLACKPOLL</A>,
  WORM-EATING, <A HREF="../../Images/MagnoliaWarbler.jpg">MAGNOLIA</A>,
  BLACK-THROATED GREEN and <A HREF="../../Images/NorthernWaterthrush.jpg">NORTHERN
  WATERTHRUSH</A> to add to the list. What a day!<BR>
<BR>
  But's it not over yet. Back at Fort Jefferson, there's even more
  to be seen. A RED-EYED VIREO is in the same tree as a BLACK-WHISKERED
  VIREO, often right next to each other. We add <A HREF="../../Images/LouisianaWaterthrush.jpg">LOUISIANA
  WATERTHRUSH</A>, <A HREF="../../Images/Ovenbird.jpg">OVENBIRD</A>,
  <A HREF="../../Images/RoseBreastedGrosbeak.jpg">ROSE-BREASTED
  GROSBEAK</A>, NORTHERN PARULA, a <A HREF="../../Images/SummerTanager.jpg">SUMMER
  TANAGER</A> and <A HREF="../../Images/HoodedWarbler.jpg">HOODED
  WARBLER</A> to the bounty. A GREATER BLACK-BACKED GULL is hanging
  around on the beach and an ORCHARD ORIOLE is a nice find late
  in the day. We end the day with a whopping 20 warbler species;
  a nice day by just about any measure!<BR>
<BR>
  <I>4.27</I><BR>
  The morning at the Fort begins with much the same birds as before.
  New arrivals include a male RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD and a bizarre
  PURPLE GALLINULE hanging out in a tree. We take a skiff out to
  Hospital Key and the <A HREF="../../Images/MaskedBooby.jpg">MASKED
  BOOBY</A> colony does not disappoint. I again take the skiff
  over to the frigratebird colony later in the afternoon and get
  nice shots of the Frigatebirds and have my binoculars trained
  on a struggling warbler trying to make land as it is taken out
  of the air by a MERLIN. However, hot on the Merlin's heels is
  a PEREGRINE FALCON! Back at the Fort, a <A HREF="../../Images/RuddyTurnstone.jpg">RUDDY
  TURNSTONE</A> puts on a nice show.<BR>
<BR>
  <I>4.28</I><BR>
  The morning begins with the usual suspects at the Fort, though
  the lack of food at the Fort is clearly taking its toll. We lose
  a BANK SWALLOW and many of the BARN SWALLOWs are soon for the
  grave or fodder for a CATTLE EGRET. There's also a corpse of
  a CATTLE EGRET lying around as well. However, one of the leaders
  manages to find an <A HREF="../../Images/AntilleanNighthawk.jpg">ANTILLEAN
  NIGHTHAWK</A> perched on the ground. Everyone gets killer looks
  at the bird and I get killer photos of the bird. A BROWN NODDY
  is not doing well either and also affords fine photos.<BR>
<BR>
  It's soon time to depart for Key West and the trip back is horribly
  rough. The seas aren't bad by west coast standards, but the boat
  moves an amazing amount for relatively calm seas. Birding is
  nonexistent. Back on dry land, Paul obligingly makes a few phone
  calls and locates a few rarities for us. After we book a very
  overpriced room in Key West, we head out to Boca Chica. On the
  way into the pond, we run into Paul and Gary again and they had
  just seen a beautiful alternate-plumaged CURLEW SANDPIPER on
  the pond. We hurried in and got brief looks of the bird before
  it left the pond to feed with the rest of the peeps. While we
  were there, we got nice looks at WHITE-RUMPED SANDPIPER and very
  close looks at <A HREF="../../Images/WilsonsPlover.jpg">WILSON'S
  PLOVER.</A></FONT><BR>
<BR>
  <I><FONT SIZE="-1">4.29</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR>
  This would be the day that we would chase Mangrove Cuckoo. We
  head over to Sugarloaf Key and the weather is cool, gray and
  drizzly. We start taping and walking the road and, finally, we
  get a single response note from a cuckoo. It's probably our bird,
  but I'm not convinced and neither is anyone else. Finally, after
  repeating this exercise three or four times, not two seconds
  after stopping the tape, I hear a single note immediately opposite
  of me that is convincingly MANGROVE CUCKOO. Hugh is further down
  the road and remains unconvinced. Were I further down the road,
  I wouldn't have been convinced either. Such is birding. The rest
  of the day is chewed up driving back up to Miami. In the one
  of the urban parks there, a Bahama Mockingbird had been reported.
  I have no tape of this, but we try to tape it in with Northern
  Mockingbird songs and succeed only in (you guessed it) taping
  in NORTHERN MOCKINGBIRDs. Had we access to the Internet, we would
  have known that the bird had moved and had been seen earlier
  in the day in an area we didn't search much. However, the South
  Florida RBA is transcribed and basically useless for up-to-date
  information. I dump Hugh at the airport and head towards Central
  Florida.<BR>
<BR>
  <I>4.30</I><BR>
  I find lodging near Sebring and head up to the Avon Park AFB
  and Bombing Range. I get there around 7:00 but &quot;recreation&quot;
  doesn't start until 7:30. Actually, I'm lucky it's Monday; on
  Tuesday they would have been closed entirely! The day is again
  cool and rainy and I spent a fruitless hour or so trying to locate
  both Red-cockaded Woodpecker and Short-tailed Hawk, but do get
  nice looks at PINE WARBLER. After that, I drive several &quot;roads&quot;
  trying to not to bottom out too badly looking for Florida Scrub-Jay.
  Finally, I'm driving on one road and I drive past a sparrow sitting
  on the barbed wire. I realize there aren't many sparrows in Central
  Florida at this time of year and stop. Sure enough, it's a <A
  HREF="../../Images/BachmansSparrow.jpg">BACHMAN'S SPARROW</A>.
  I look around at the habitat and it's perfect for Bachman's Sparrow;
  palmetto scrub with isolated pine trees. It turns out there were
  at least three singing as well! Too bad the local recreation
  office didn't list this spot as being good for Bachman's Sparrow.<BR>
<BR>
  I head further on onto even rougher roads; at one point I surely
  would have become trapped in sand had I not negotiated a parallel
  track with some grass on it. I keep finding EASTERN TOWHEEs and
  other birds, but finally get a nice look at a <A HREF="../../Images/FloridaScrubJay.jpg">FLORIDA
  SCRUB-JAY</A> in a very remote corner of the park. So much for
  having the bird &quot;easy&quot; to find here! On the way out,
  <A HREF="../../Images/SandhillCrane.jpg">SANDHILL CRANEs</A>
  were tamely walking around the grounds. The return to Miami is
  uneventful and frankly boring with only a BALD EAGLE breaking
  the monotony on FL 710. To use up some idle time, I photographed
  some obliging <A HREF="../../Images/BoatTailedGrackle.jpg">BOAT-TAILED
