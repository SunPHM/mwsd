<h3>Potsdamer Platz, Berlin</h3>

This reminds me of home! I live in the middle of a big construction zone that will look really great when it's finished. Whenever that will be. And this is a big construction zone, and it will look really great when it's finished. Everything from past the Brandenburg Gate all the way past Potsdamer Platz is under construction. It's truly stunning.<p><p>

The next picture is taken from the "Info-Box" - a 6-story-high observation/exhibit space near the S-Bahn/U-Bahn station.<p><p>

Since I can use the S-Bahn for free with my Eurail pass, I've tended to stay away from the U-Bahn, which is a pity, since it seems to cover more of Berlin.

DaimlerChrysler is moving into their new world headquarters here, Sony is working on an absolutely enormous entertainment/office/residential complex, there's new libraries, galleries, theatres, and lots and lots of cranes. It's quite a sight to see, how quickly the city heals itself.<p><p>
