        one has been a better friend to Florida's natural resources than Diana 
        Sawaya-Crane. As Cabinet Aide and legislative lobbyist for Attorney General 
        Bob Butterworth, Diana has provided invaluable assistance to the Florida 
        Wildlife Federation and others to protect Florida's natural resources 
        involved in sovereign land lease applications, support for key conservation 
        and recreation lands purchases, fighting off proposed legislative changes 
        to the definition of sovereign lands, including the Fisheating Creek sovereign 
        lands controversy, strengthening manatee protection, strengthening local 
        government comprehensive land use plans, reviewing applications for Developments 
        of Regional Impact, enforcing electrical power plant siting laws, strengthening 
        DER's underground storage tank rules, preparing a report on SLAPPS (Strategic 
        Litigation Against Public Participation) and seeking legislative protection 
        of citizens from SLAPPS, and fighting legislative changes to citizen standing. 
      </p>
      <p>Diana started her work as a biologist with the Hillsborough County Environmental 
        Protection Commission in 1979. In 1983 she transferred to the Department 
        of Environmental Regulation. She moved to the Department of Community 
        Affairs where she reviewed Developments of Regional Impact. In 1986 she 
        became a Cabinet Aide and Legislative lobbyist for the Attorney General's 
        Office.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has attended the bi-weekly Cabinet Aides meetings over the 
        past fifteen years knows that Diana is a tenacious protector and defender 
        of Florida's environment. Her questioning of persons appearing before 
        the Cabinet Aides has made it impossible for unscrupulous advocates to 
        deceive the Cabinet with incorrect facts and erroneous interpretations 
        of statutes and rules. </p>
      <p>For her friendship to the Florida Wildlife Federation, and dedication 
        to the natural resources of Florida, the Federation is proud to name Diana 
        Sawaya-Crane as the Public Servant of the Year for 2002.</p>
