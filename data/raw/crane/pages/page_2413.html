      and dazzle and I went along for the ride.&nbsp; She educated many children 
      and adults in those nine years and I was honored to be a part of her life.&nbsp; 
      Anny never had a mate, so although she laid several eggs and we received no 
      young red tails in need of foster care in her lifetime,&nbsp; Anny never had 
      the chance to care for a baby hawk.&nbsp; We will never know if she would 
      have been a good parent.&nbsp; Anny died on December 11, 1997.&nbsp; I will
