Here's the latest news from Tom Stehn at the wintering grounds. More surprises!<BR>
			<BR>
			Dear Journey North,<BR>
			On my last weekly aerial census flight March 8 on which I tried to find all 176 wintering
			whooping cranes, I came up WAY SHORT. I only counted 154! I did find all 7 family
			groups (two adults with their chick hatched last summer), and found about 40 other
			territorial pairs.<BR>
			<BR>
			I felt fairly confident that one territorial pair was definitely missing and may
			have started the migration. In all, an estimated 10 whooping cranes may have departed
			the wintering area and headed north. <BR>
			<BR>
			Whooping cranes normally don't start the migration until the last week in March or
			first two weeks in April. It would be unusual if 10 whooping cranes have started
			north this early. However, food continues to be short here at Aransas. The blue crabs
			just aren't available for the cranes to eat, so they are forced to eat clams. Imagine
			swallowing clams whole and relying on your gizzard to grind up all that shell and
			salvage a little bit of nutrition from the little piece of meat inside a clam!<BR>
			<BR>
			Are you ready for a Challenge Question?


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Challenge Question #4:</B><BR>
			&quot;If foods are short on the wintering grounds and the whooping cranes are not
			getting enough nutrition (as is the case this year), in what way will the migration
			be affected?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			a) The birds will leave early hoping to find more food during the migration.<BR>
			b) The birds will leave late since their energy reserves are not sufficient for the
			trip.<BR>
			c) The birds will leave on time since the migration is governed by daylength and
			not food.<BR>
			d) Some of the birds won't migrate at all due to illness.

			Why are there fewer cranes this year? Last week's report got us all thinking about
			this question. (See Discussion of Challenge Question #1, below.) With today's report,
			the plot thickens. Brian Johns, Wildlife Biologist, said low rainfall last summer
			at Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada led to parts of the nesting area being very
			dry by mid August. Brian had this to say about last year's low numbers in the breeding
			season:<BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;The total known nesting attempts in 2000 was a record 51. By mid June many
			of the wetlands in the Klewi River area were dry, making the young cranes more vulnerable
			to predation as the crane families searched for aquatic foods. With 51 nesting pairs
			it was anticipated that 40-50 young would hatch. However, only 30 young cranes were
			accounted for. Surveys began about 10 days after the first chicks hatched so there
			were likely additional chicks hatched that were not seen. Two pairs hatched two young
			(twins). Losses of young continued over the summer so that by mid August only about
			13 young were still alive. The families with twins had each lost one of their chicks
			by mid August as well. The number of nesting pairs that successfully bring a young
			to Texas has varied from a low of 12% to a high of 75%, with the average of about
			46%. 


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Challenge Question #5: </B><BR>
			&quot;What percentage of this year's nesting attempts produced a young whooping crane
			that safely arrived on the wintering grounds? How does this percentage compare with
			the average?&quot; (HINT: See Tom Stehn's first report, February 27, for the number
			of young that safely arrived on the wintering grounds.)

How does migration relate to survival? This season's first two reports are full of
			food for thought. The following lesson is an ongoing activity you can introduce now,
			before the migration begins. Students should be encouraged to revisit these questions
			regularly while migration is underway. At the end of the season they can re-examine
			their initial theories and predictions. The illustrations you see on this page show
			what <A HREF="http://members.home.net/rmurray69/Journey%20North%20Projects.htm">Rod
			Murray's</A> students did with this lesson!

			<P>Food supply has been a big part of the cranes' story this year. Perhaps your students
			will now stop to think about how the food chain changes with the seasons. This lesson
			will help your students see the central role that sunlight plays in living systems.

			Question #1</B></FONT><BR>
			&quot;Why are there FEWER whooping cranes in the population this year? What different
			reasons can you find that explain why the number is so low?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			Tom Stehn's full report described the effect of the drought Texas had last spring
			and summer. The drought caused a shortage of blue crabs, the cranes' most nutritious
			and favorite food. A shortage of fresh water flowing into the bogs changed the salinity,
			cutting down blue crab reproduction. Not having enough of the highest quality food
			in their diets may have affected the cranes' winter health, as well as their abilities
			to successfully nest. To make the natural drought even worse, human uses took much
			of the water from the rivers, reducing the water that reached the bogs. It's a situation
			that threatens to get worse as more people move to Texas and place more demands on
			the water supplies. <BR>

&quot;Why are crane voiceprints a good way to keep track of endangered whooping cranes?
			Give at least two reasons.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Voiceprints are a valuable discovery for safe, non-invasive monitoring of cranes.
			Thanks to the work of Dr. Bernhard Wessling, we now know that individual voices can
			tell us which crane is which. Voiceprints are reliable ways to identify cranes without
			expensive banding, stressful capturing, or risk of losing ID bands. This photo shows
			Dr. Bernhard Wessling with a wind-proof microphone. The shaggy mane over the microphone
			eliminates wind buffeting and provides for excellent quality recordings of the crane
			calls.<BR>
