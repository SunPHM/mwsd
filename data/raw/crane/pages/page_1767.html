        <br>
        Since its inception, Operation Migration (OM) has endeavored to improve 
        a technique it first developed in 1988, designed to teach a migratory 
        route to endangered, precocial birds. To date, the OM team has conducted 
        or participated in ten migration studies with three species. Operation 
        Migration and USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center with assistance from 
        the International Crane Foundation, the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
        Recourses, The US Fish and Wildlife Service and other members of the Bird 
        Team offer the following to the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP) 
        as a protocol for costume-rearing, aircraft conditioning, translocation, 
        flight conditioning, migration and subsequent release of Whooping cranes 
        as required in Phase II of the reintroduction program. Extensive records 
        will be kept on the treatment and response of the birds and the results 
        will be evaluated so that this protocol may be revised as appropriate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This protocol 
        will guide activities for the initial release of Whooping cranes into 
        eastern North America, however it is not feasible to use ultralight aircraft 
        to introduce a flock large enough to be considered self-sustaining. It 
        is expected that after enough birds have been shown a route south to establish 
        a core group of migratory whooping cranes, other methods will be employed 
        to augment the population.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Wildness"></a>Wildness:</b> 
        Whooping cranes introduced into Wisconsin will not have the benefit of 
        wild birds of the same species to teach them wild behaviour; particularly 
        human avoidance. Without this advantage it becomes more difficult to produce 
        birds that will follow the aircraft, yet behave like wild birds once released. 
        Past studies indicate that to rear birds that are not tame we must minimize 
        human influence and provide as natural an experience as possible. We must 
        replicate the natural rearing process by providing them with proper sexual 
        imprint models and raising them in small groups. The birds we raise are 
        neither tame nor wild. Like any creature they have a natural fear of the 
        unknown but the rest is a learned response and our ability to teach them 
        is severely limited. Just when to take to the air to avoid a threat or 
        how large a buffer zone is needed is learned from the actions of the adult. 
        Acting as surrogates, we are unable to take-off immediately at the first 
        sign of trouble or even to properly convey the message that there is reason 
        for concern. If, while caring for the birds, we were approached by a curious 
        farmer or hunter we have no option but to accept the intrusion, where 
        a wild parent would fly off to a safer distance. The actions of the wild 
        bird teach its young to maintain a distance, while ours encourages tolerance. 
        Because we can only teach the bare minimum in human avoidance, we need 
        to rely on their natural fear of the unknown and ensure that all things 
        human remain foreign. Ideally, the birds should be released on the wintering 
        grounds without having encountered un-costumed people and/or human voices. 
        Efforts should be made to improve the efficiency of the flight conditioning 
        and to reduce even costumed human contact during the training period. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Human contact 
        is defined as the presence of the human form, including costumed handlers; 
        the sounds of human activity, including voices and the presence of man-made 
        environments and equipage.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Facilities"></a>Facilities 
        and Caretaking: </b>Isolation rearing will be performed in accordance 
        to the USGS Patuxent WRC Protocol for Hand-rearing Crane Chicks. Specific 
        details relevant to ultralight conditioned cranes are included in this 
        document. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Conspecific 
        (conspecific means &quot;of the same species&quot;) adults will be penned 
        in the aviary and will have access to the sand runs that are perpendicular 
        to the aviary runs used by the chicks. These adults will act as imprinting 
        models. While the chicks are being exposed to the running aircraft, these 
        adults will be locked inside and observed for tolerance to the disturbance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Costumes, 
        designed to disguise the human form, will be supplied by OM and used in 
        conjunction with hand held puppets of adult cranes and recordings of crane 
        calls. Sleeve cuffs or gloves will cover the handler's hands when working 
        with the cranes. When necessary, the medical staff may remove their gloves 
        and work barehanded in order to properly treat or examine the chicks. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Absolutely 
        NO TALKING will be tolerated within earshot of the birds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* No human 
        avoidance conditioning (HAC) will be attempted prior to the release of 
        these birds. The birds will be handled and examined in costume. If medical 
        or other procedures require the removal of the facemask, the chicks will 
        be hooded or protected from seeing the handlers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Absolutely 
        no feeding will be done from hand. All food used as an incentive will 
        be dispensed by methods other than hand tossing. Mealworms or other treats 
        will be pointed out using a puppet to encourage foraging. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The colts 
        will be shielded from observing caretaking activities such as pen cleaning 
        and food/water changes as much as practical. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* As much 
        as practical the birds will be visually shielded from manmade structures 
        and equipment. Efforts will be made to disguise the propagation building 
        and surrounding areas in order to provide a more natural environment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The number 
        of handlers will be kept to a minimum during conditioning to reduce the 
        amount of human contact, improve handler safety and to minimize distractions. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Recorded 
        wetland sounds will be played inside the aviary to create a natural environment 
        and mask outside human noise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The colts 
        will be moved from the propagation building to the large pond pens known 
        as the &quot;White Series&quot; when the caretaking staff agrees that 
        weather conditions, socialization and ages are appropriate. Heat lamps 
        and additional shelter may be provided as needed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The birds 
        will be socialized in small cohorts based on age and compatibility. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The duration 
        and frequency of aircraft training will be based on the response of the 
        chicks. Each training session will be evaluated for success and if the 
        chicks are responding positively, additional training will be curtailed 
        temporarily to limit unnecessary human contact.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* To reinforce 
        the &quot;follow the aircraft&quot; response, efforts will be made to 
        minimize the number of times a chick is led by a walking handler. However, 
        during early conditioning, it may be safer to lead chicks to the aircraft 
        rather than to carry them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The aircraft 
        used for this training are registered in Canada but are too large to be 
        considered ultralights in the U.S. Through a cooperative agreement between 
        Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration; we are allowed 
        to operate these aircraft within the U.S. providing we abide by Canadian 
        regulations. With the wing removed to conduct this training they are not 
        capable of flight but still must be operated properly and only by qualified 
        persons. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Dr. Bernhard 
        Wessling has provided the project with digital crane call vocalizers. 
        Each unit is capable of reproducing up to six adult crane calls that handlers 
        can use to communicate with the colts. Only pilots and qualified handlers 
        will use the vocalizers to broadcast any calls other than the brood/contact 
        call. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* As a precaution, 
        the primary handlers will familiarize the cranes to the sound of their 
        human imitations of brood calls. This will be done sparingly to afford 
        some control over the birds in the event of equipment failure in the field. 
        Only the handlers that will accompany the birds after they leave Patuxent 
        should conduct this exercise and it should be done from a distance so 
        as to not attract the chick's attention to the handler's head. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Conditioning"></a>Conditioning 
        Colts to Follow Aircraft:<br>
        </b>Phase 1<br>
        Tape recordings of the aircraft engine sounds and recorded brood calls 
        will be played several times daily to pre-hatching eggs and newly hatched 
        chicks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phase 2<br>
        When chicks are old enough to go outdoors, they will be introduced to 
        the real aircraft for the first time. The wing will be removed, allowing 
        the trike to be parked outside their sand runs and the engine will be 
        revved periodically during the day. The duration of the exercise and the 
        chick's response to the aircraft will be recorded on data forms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phase 3<br>
        A small portable pen (ca 2-3 ft. in diameter and 2 ft. high) will be used 
        to provide the chicks with their next level of exposure to the aircraft. 
        This enclosure will be placed beside the trike and the chicks will be 
        encouraged to forage for mealworms, pointed out using the puppet head, 
        while the engine is revved. Time and responses will be recorded on data 
        forms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: Phase 
        2 and Phase 3 procedures may be combined, used in reverse orders or one 
        or the other may be eliminated based on the development of the chick, 
        at the discretion of the handlers. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phase 4<br>
        When the chicks show little anxiety at the sound of the engine or the 
        movement of the aircraft, they will advance to this level of conditioning, 
        which will be conducted in a circular pen (ca 30 ft. in diameter and 2 
        ft. high). The colts will be carried or led to and placed in the pen. 
        One handler will taxi the wingless aircraft around the outside perimeter, 
        stopping periodically to point out mealworms using the puppet head mounted 
        to an extension arm. The pilot will extend the puppet head over the chick 
        fencing from the cockpit to interact with the colts. A few colts may be 
        worked together if they will tolerate each other and the trainer can safely 
        handle them. Multiple colts need close observation for possible anxiety. 
        e.g. a colt may not follow because it is afraid of another colt, rather 
        than the trike. A smaller circle pen, in which to temporarily place problem 
        colts during training, will be constructed in the center of the 30 ft. 
        pen. This may function as a &quot;jealousy pen&quot; allowing reluctant 
        colts the opportunity to observe others foraging for treats with the aircraft 
        parent. The duration of confinement is discretionary and based on behaviour. 
        Observations and times will be recorded on data forms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phase 5<br>
        As the cranes grow tall enough to be protected by the propeller guard 
        fitted to the aircraft, they will begin to follow the trike directly from 
        the aviary or from the White Series pen to the adjacent field. Birds who 
        tolerate each other may be worked together in small groups. The trips 
        will progress in length and include rewards such as mealworms, crickets 
        or pond exposure to reinforce a positive response. During the advanced 
        ground training if weather permits, the chicks may be exposed to the aircraft 
        with the wing refitted to familiarize them to the final shape. The duration 
        of each exposure and the chicks' response to the aircraft will be recorded 
        on data sheets.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Shipping"></a>Shipping:</b> 
        <br>
        Prior to fledging, the birds will be transported to the introduction site 
        in Wisconsin. They will be shipped in accordance with Patuxent Wildlife 
        Research Center's Protocol For Transporting Cranes, in individual containers 
        supplied by OM. These containers will be modified to prevent the birds 
        from viewing un-costumed handlers through the ventilation holes. The shipment 
        will be conducted by private aircraft from Suburban Airport in Laurel, 
        Maryland to the Necedah Airport in Necedah, Wisconsin to reduce the amount 
        of ground travel needed.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Examination"></a>Medical 
        Examination:</b><br>
        The birds will be transported, in two air-conditioned vans from the Necedah 
        Airport to the Annex facility of the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge. 
        The vehicles will be parked in the shade and the birds will be off-loaded, 
        two at a time. A costumed technician will open the containers and check 
        the birds' eyes and mouths before they are hooded. The chicks will then 
        be moved into an adjoining room where the Medical Team will conduct an 
        examination of each bird. This will be performed without talking and as 
        quickly as is practical. Once completed the birds will be returned to 
        their containers and replaced in the vans. As soon as possible, the birds 
        will be released into the appropriate cohort pens and monitored for signs 
        of stress. The Medical Team will develop the protocol for the examination. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Pens"></a>Pens 
        and Enclosures:</b><br>
        Two isolated pens and training areas exist at Necedah NWR and both will 
        be used to house the Whooping crane chicks. Site #1 will be modified to 
        accommodate a larger number of birds, giving us more options when it is 
        time to socialize the two cohorts. Additional trees will be planted in 
        and around the pens to enhance the natural look and the training area 
        at Site #1 will be widened and lengthened. Electric fencer units will 
        be used to protect both pens. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="Fledglings"></a>Conditioning 
        Fledglings to Follow Aircraft:</b><br>
        Flight conditioning will begin once the birds have had a day or two to 
        recover from shipping. Initially, the training will continue using the 
        trike only. Later the wing will be attached to the aircraft and several 
        days will be spent familiarizing the birds to the new shape. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Similar 
        to the procedures at Patuxent, the duration and frequency of aircraft 
        training will be based on the response of the chicks. Each training session 
        will be evaluated for success and if the chicks are responding positively, 
        additional training will be curtailed temporarily to limit unnecessary 
        human contact.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The number 
        of handlers will be kept to a minimum during conditioning to reduce the 
        human contact, improve handler safety, and to minimize distractions. Only 
        authorized handlers will have access to the birds and training area. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The birds 
        will be released, as much as possible to forage on their own, which will 
        allow them time away from human contact and give them a chance to establish 
        their natural dominance structure. (It can be difficult to return the 
        birds to the holding pen in the evening. The handlers will determine proper 
        feeding levels to strike a balance between providing adequate nourishment 
        and controlled food withholding so the birds will move into the pen on 
        their own to gain access to their feeders. This method avoids unnecessary 
        handling of the birds). Observations will be made by remote monitoring 
        from a blind or by video camera to determine the dominance order. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Once each 
        group is able to follow the aircraft in the air as a cohesive unit, the 
        two cohorts will be introduced. This will likely occur at Site #1 where 
        the birds will be monitored for aggression, which will be prevented if 
        necessary. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The duration 
        of each exercise, and the birds' response, will be recorded on data forms. 
        Data will also be collected on flight order and weather conditions including 
        temperature, barometric pressure, dew point, winds and density altitude.</font></p>

        Examination<a name="Medical"></a>:</b><br>
        Prior to departing the introduction site, the Medical Team will again 
        examine the birds. This procedure is unavoidably disruptive to the birds 
        and temporarily affects their relationship with the handlers and aircraft. 
        For this reason the Medical Team will conduct this examination well before 
        the expected migration departure date to allow the handlers to regain 
        the confidence of the birds. The Medical Team will provide the protocol 
        for this examination and will conduct all work in silence with the birds 
        hooded.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Radio<a name="Radio"></a> 
        Tracking: </b><br>
        While the birds are being handled for the medical examination, they will 
        also be fitted with tracking devices and marked bands. This procedure 
        will comply with the guidelines of the North American Bird Banding Manual 
        and Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. (see Monitoring Protocol)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Migration<a name="Migration"></a>:</b><br>
        * The start of the migration will be dictated by the endurance of the 
        birds, their social compatibility and the readiness of the crew. The field 
        team will allow as much lead-time as possible before setting a target 
        departure date. Thereafter, the team will be prepared and the start date 
        will be dependant on the weather. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* We will 
        use the same route that was identified last year (2000) with some modifications 
        to the list of stopovers. Replacement areas have been found for those 
        that did not provide adequate isolation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A new travel 
        pen and travel pen trailer will be constructed to improve efficiency and 
        bird safety. The improvements include a modified shade shelter, which 
        will allow the removal of some of the hard structure within the pen. Additionally, 
        an improved electric fencer system has been designed. All changes will 
        be presented for approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* There are 
        times when it is not possible to find isolated areas that allow for an 
        adequate distance between the bird pen and the migration crew camp. In 
        this situation the field team will determine if it is necessary to move 
        the majority of the camp to another location. Most of the landing sites 
        are privately owned and the migration crew is large. We must make every 
        effort to reduce the impact we have on the landowners so as to not abuse 
        their hospitality. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Proposed<a name="Staging"></a> 
        Staging Area:</b><br>
        Due to impending cold weather of the central Wisconsin autumn, our departure 
        cannot be delayed too late in the season. However, as we head south we 
        are soon into warmer air that erodes the birds' flight endurance. As well, 
        our arrival in some of the southern states coincides with the beginning 
        of deer hunting season, meaning that hunters occupy many of the areas 
        we hope to use as landing sites. Most of the private landowners are very 
        willing to accommodate us, with the exception of the opening days of the 
        season. For these reasons, and also to provide a break for the migration 
        crew, we are proposing to stage the birds at a refuge along the route 
        for a period of one or two weeks. The Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge, 
        Indiana and Hiwassee Wildlife Refuge, Tennessee have been considered and 
        appropriate areas are available at both locations, however, the Tennessee 
        site is farther south and more suitable for our purposes. The Whooping 
        Crane Recovery Team will make the final decision. Under the guidance of 
        the Refuge Manager a predator safe holding pen will be constructed in 
        an isolated area on the refuge. The birds will be monitored and exercised 
        daily by a minimal crew, provided by the International Crane Foundation 
        and/or USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in the absence of the field 
        team. Although the facilities will be in place, it is possible that the 
        migration will continue without a prolonged stop at the staging area. 
        This decision will be based on the progress to date, the weather forecast 
        for the remainder of the trip, the condition of the birds and other factors.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Wintering<a name="Wintering"></a> 
        Site:</b><br>
        At this writing, a shortlist of appropriate release pen sites has been 
        identified at the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge. The Refuge 
        Manager will make the final selection, with input from the selection committee. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Proposed 
        Pen Design<a name="Design"></a>:</b><br>
        The following is a description of a release pen, similar to the ones used 
        in earlier studies. (Material list diagrams and photos available).<br>
        This structure measures 250 X 150 ft. and is not top-netted. It is protected 
        by three strands of electric fencer wire and erected entirely in water 
        3 to 18 inches deep. The fencing material is eight ft. high - plastic 
        web fence (a natural colour would be preferable). One foot will be bent 
        out at the bottom and held in place with earth staples. It is important 
        that this pen be large enough so the birds can forage, unaware that they 
        are contained. Because of the electric fencer and the water, ground predators 
        cannot crawl under the barrier and are forced to jump over it. The resulting 
        &quot;splash&quot; as they land, acts as a warning to the birds inside. 
        A permanent shade shelter will be erected in the pen, on evaluated ground, 
        to provide a feed station.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Release<a name="Release"></a> 
        Methods</b><br>
        * When the birds arrive they will be housed in their travel pen at an 
        isolated &quot;last landfall site.&quot; During this time, the migration 
        crew will build a temporary holding pen in the center of the release pen 
        over the shade shelter and feeding station. It will be constructed of 
        top netting, using one of the door panels from the travel pen with which 
        the birds are familiar. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Once this 
        holding pen is complete, the birds will be led by aircraft to the release 
        pen area and encouraged to land next to the costumed handlers that will 
        be waiting for them. They will be kept in the holding pen at night and 
        released during the day to forage. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The Medical 
        Team will conduct the arrival examination at the release pen. This procedure 
        could be difficult to perform due to the isolation of the area and a separate 
        protocol will be established once the release site has been identified. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Several 
        early morning flights will be made over the refuge to familiarize the 
        birds with their immediate surroundings. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* When appropriate, 
        the temporary holding pen will be removed, leaving only the release pen 
        and the feeding station and the birds will be free to fly. The birds will 
        be led to another foraging location while the pen is removed. They will 
        be encouraged to stay in the area of the release pen by means of a costumed 
        dummy; regular visits by a costumed handler and an ample food supply. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A costumed 
        handler will visit, twice daily for the first two weeks and then, once 
        each day for another two weeks. This will be reduced to once every third 
        day for a further week and thereafter the handler will try to replace 
        the feed only when the birds are elsewhere or by using an automatic feeder. 
        From this point on, observations should be made from a blind, by video 
        camera or by radio tracking. This release schedule is discretionary and 
        based on the flock behaviour. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A supply 
        of food will be made available at all times up to and past the expected 
        time of return migration.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A video 
        monitoring system will be used to for observation of the birds. (see Monitoring 
        Protocol) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Behaviour<a name="Behaviour"></a> 
        Options:</b> We have several options to adjust the behaviour of the birds, 
        should they become sedentary or will not leave the area of the release 
        pen. These methods can be used to encourage the birds to seek new foraging 
        area or find fresh water.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The aircraft 
        could be used to lead the birds to other areas where costumed handlers 
        on the ground would encourage them to land</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The crane 
        recordings can be used to call the birds to other foraging areas. In this 
        scenario, a costumed handler would operate the loudspeaker system in the 
        early morning, when the sound would carry over a longer distance. The 
        handler would spend several hours showing them how to forage for blue 
        crab and other foods. Later, the handler would return to the release pen 
        to call the birds back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* If the 
        birds will only move out of the pen when accompanied by a handler then 
        we could consider removing the costumed dummy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Temporary 
        or permanent food withholding could be considered. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Another 
        option would be to remove the pen entirely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Human 
        <a name="Human"></a>Avoidance:</b> Based on the behaviour of the birds, 
        it may be necessary to perform Human Avoidance Conditioning to finally 
        sever the association with people. This practice should be conducted just 
        after the final release of the birds. It is important that this procedure 
        be carried out with enthusiasm and caution. A less than ardent application 
        could result in complacency in the birds. We believe human avoidance should 
        only be attempted once and that it should involve enough energy to seriously 
        frighten the birds. Possibilities for human avoidance could include shotguns, 
        umbrellas, dogs and many human participants. This exercise should take 
        place in an area away from their release pen. The costume could be used 
        to lead the birds into a danger area such as a tree line that we would 
        like them to learn to avoid and where the human avoidance participants 
        would be hiding. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The procedures 
        outlined above, combined with those from the Whooping Crane Recovery Team 
        and Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership, should afford maximum control 
        over all aspects of an attempted introduction of Whooping cranes. </font></p>
