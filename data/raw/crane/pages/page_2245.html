            <p>Around April of each year, the world's single surviving flock of 
              migrating whooping cranes trickles out of Aransas National Wildlife 
              Refuge on the Gulf of Mexico and heads north on a 2,500-mile journey 
              to its summer nesting grounds in northern Canada.</p>
            <p>At the juncture of Alberta and the Northwest Territories in remote 
              Wood Buffalo National Park, 40 to 50 breeding pairs of whoopers 
              perform an annual dance of renewal that typically produces two eggs 
              per nest. However, predation, drought, brutal sibling rivalry and, 
              until recently, human intervention meant the flock was fortunate 
              to return to its wintering grounds with perhaps 20, rust-colored 
              fledglings.</p>
            <p>While more than 100 whoopers exist in captivity at several locations 
              around North America, this small, wild flock is the last remaining 
              example of migrating whooping cranes in their traditional habitat. 
              It's a blessing the mortality rate of older birds tends to be lower 
              than the survival rate of new ones. From a population of only 15 
              birds in 1941, the flock in late 1997 registered 182 members during 
              the annual count at its wintering grounds in Aransas, Texas. It 
              would seem the whooping crane, majestic icon of North American conservationists, 
              is gaining a toehold on perpetuity.</p>
            <p>"Last year was a record year," Brian Johns, a Canadian Wildlife 
              Service biologist and Canadian coordinator of the Canada/US whooping 
              crane recovery team, said in a June 1998 interview. "There were 
              51 nests -- a new record -- and about 58 young that hatched in June. 
              Thirty of those survived the summer and arrived on the wintering 
              grounds.</p>
            <p>"There were only 10 adults and sub-adults that died last year. 
              So the population went up by 20."</p>
            <p>But Johns and his whooper colleagues aren't reaching for the champagne 
              yet. There remain several thresholds to cross before the international 
              recovery team sees the whooping crane downlisted to "threatened' 
              from "endangered'. The first is stability.</p>
            <p>"The recovery plan says we need to have a minimum of 40 breeding 
              pairs. But to make sure the population is stable, we'd like to have 
              40 breeding pairs for a minimum of 10 years."</p>
            <p>The number of breeding pairs in Wood Buffalo sank to 28 in 1994, 
              after reaching 45 in the previous year. The pairs were there, Johns 
              explains, it's just that many of them didn't nest.</p>

            <p>Whoopers are omnivores, but they have strong preferences. In the 
              coastal marshlands of Aransas, their favorite food is the blue crab. 
              During the winter of 1993-94, the crabs didn't move into the marshes 
              until the flock began its northern migration.</p>
            <p>"We suspect some of the birds just weren't in very good shape when 
              they got here," Johns said from his seasonal office in Fort Smith, 
              Northwest Territories, located adjacent to Wood Buffalo National 
              Park. "Some of them just decided not to nest."</p>
            <p>In the four years from 1995 to 1998, nesting pairs numbered 49, 
              45, 51 and 47, respectively. But the 1994 glitch aptly demonstrates 
              why Canadian and American biologists remain cautious about the long-term 
              viability of the migratory flock: any number of potential natural 
              and man-made disasters continue to threaten it.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt recognized this back in 
              1937, when he decreed Aransas a national wildlife refuge for the 
              flock of whooping cranes that traditionally wintered in the marshlands 
              and shallow bay areas of the Texas gulf. In 1940, the non-migratory 
              remnant of a flock that once nested in Manitoba was reduced to six 
              from 13 birds by a hurricane that hit its home in Louisiana. The 
              last remaining member of that flock, a bird that came to be known 
              as "Mac", was taken into captivity in 1950 and died six months later.</p>
            <p>In spite of its protected status and the dedicated work of conservationists, 
              however, Aransas poses a host of threats to its wintering residents: 
              hurricanes are no less common in southern Texas than in neighboring 
              Louisiana; marine food resources can be scarce, contaminated or 
              simply unavailable when storms raise water levels in tidal marshes; 
              and traffic on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway that cuts through 
              the southern portion of Aransas is among the heaviest on any waterway 
              in the world. Much of that shipping is petrochemical barges that 
              not only threaten spills but erode precious shoreline in their wake.</p>
            <p>The Wood Buffalo nesting grounds are much more remote. In fact, 
              they were weren't even discovered until 1954. It's only by fortunate 
              coincidence the region where the whoopers breed is within an area 
              set aside as a national park in 1922 in order to protect the wood 
              bison who inhabit the area.</p>
            <p>Wood Buffalo's remote location reduces human threats to the flock 
              -- permits are required to visit the nesting area. But water levels 
              vary from year to year, and drier years bring reduced chick survival. 
              And there's always disease and predators lurking in the wings.</p>

            <p>"There was a set of twins we saw two days ago, and the next day 
              both of them were gone," Johns said. "We don't know whether it was 
              bear or wolf, but something picked them off."</p>
            <p>Given the threats facing the Wood Buffalo/Aransas flock, the whooping 
              crane recovery plan also calls for the establishment of two additional 
              breeding flocks with 25 breeding pairs in each. And here, efforts 
              to date have brought disappointing results.</p>
            <p>In 1975, Canadian and America biologists began collecting one of 
              two eggs from many Wood Buffalo nests and placing them in sandhill 
              crane nests at Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho. They 
              hoped the sandhills would hatch the eggs, rear the young whoopers 
              and teach them the migration route to the sandhills' wintering ground 
              in New Mexico. This worked fairly well.</p>
            <p>But the whoopers, who don't reach sexual maturity until three to 
              five years of age, imprinted upon the sandhills and never formed 
              breeding pairs. The initially-promising experiment was scuppered 
              in 1996 (thereby contributing to the bumper crop of chicks at Wood 
              Buffalo the next year) and there's now ('98) only two whoopers in the 
              so-called "Rocky Mountain" flock.</p>
            <p>At Kissimmee Prairie, Florida, a group of 14 cranes reared in captivity 
              was released early in 1993 in an attempt to establish a wild, non-migratory 
              and self-sustaining flock in the south-central portion of the state. 
              More young birds were released in following years. But bobcats have 
              ravaged the youngsters, who are fending for themselves without benefit 
              of parental guidance. And so far, no breeding has occurred.</p>
            <p>"We had high hopes they were going to start breeding two years 
              ago. . . and last year. . . and this year," says Johns. "Some pairs 
              have built nests, but none have laid any eggs yet. There's still 
              hope there."</p>
            <p>There's hope, as well, in two 1997 studies involving the use of 
              ultra-light aircraft to teach birds born in captivity the migratory 
              routes appropriate to their species. This "Fly Away Home" method 
              delivered promising results in an experiment involving a group of 
              sandhill cranes raised in the Ontario wilderness and later led by 
              plane to Virginia. Another study employed an ultra-light to lead 
              a mixed flock of sandhills and whoopers from Idaho to New Mexico.</p>

            <p>In both cases, says Johns, the birds followed the ultra-lights 
              to the wintering grounds, wintered well among their wild counterparts, 
              and then migrated in the spring to within 80 kms (50 miles) of where 
              they were raised.</p>
            <p>On the down side, the effects of human intervention continue to 
              nag these reintroduction experiments. Imprinting problems occurred 
              even in the Ontario study, where the young sandhills were handled 
              by people wearing crane costumes.</p>
            <p>"(Some sandhills) ended up in several school yards, a soccer field. 
              . . where there were kids and voices and human activity," Johns 
              said. "Now, they've got a much stricter protocol around the cranes. 
              There's no talking at all, so they don't get use to human voices.</p>
            <p>"They want them to be wild. But they don't want them to be so wild 
              they won't follow the ultra-light."</p>
            <p>The grand scheme behind the ultra-light experiments is the creation 
              of a second, wild, breeding, migratory flock of whooping cranes 
              in North America. Studies are underway to find suitable nesting 
              and wintering grounds for this proposed new flock which, with the 
              non-migratory Kissimmee flock, could meet the downlisting criterion 
              of two additional, self-sustaining communities of whooping cranes.</p>
            <p>Wintering grounds will be on the gulf coast, either Louisiana or 
              Florida. Saskatchewan, in the middle of the migration corridor for 
              the Wood Buffalo flock and an important staging area during southern 
              migration, was an early contender as the northern nesting grounds 
              of this proposed flock. But biologists now think that would be a 
              mistake.</p>
            <p>"We'd want to keep the flocks separate so that if something happened 
              to one of them, the other wouldn't be affected," says Johns. "If 
              we did want some genetic material to be mixed, we could move eggs 
              at some time in the future."</p>
            <p>The inter-lake region of Manitoba, located north of Winnipeg between 
              lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba, is now being studied as the proposed 
              northern nesting grounds for this would-be flock, although some 
              would like to see the nesting grounds located in the north-eastern 
              U.S. Both areas fall within the former nesting range of the whooping 
              crane.</p>

            <p>But all former habitats have changed to one degree or another. 
              That's much the reason why whooping cranes came to the brink of 
              extinction in first place. Human intervention remains their best 
              hope for survival, and their biggest obstacle.</p>
