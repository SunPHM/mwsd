<meta NAME="abstract"
CONTENT="The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has held a        leading international position in wildlife research and management since its                                         founding in 1936 as America's first wildlife experiment station and research refuge.
In 1940 there were less than 20 whooping cranes alive in the world. Changes in habitat, egg collecting, and hunting almost led to its extinction. There are now 188 whoopers in that wild flock, another 100 in captivity, and over 60 in an experimental flock in Florida. This recovery was directly due to conservation efforts, scientific research, and changes in land management.
	Unique to North America, the whooping crane stands 5 feet tall with a long neck and long legs. Its pure white body feathers are accented by jet black wing-tips and a red-and-black head with a long, pointed beak. The wings measure about 8 feet across.
	Breeding whooping cranes in captivity at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center began in 1967 with 12 eggs collected from the wild flock.  The Patuxent flock currently has 44 adults, with 9 experienced breeding pairs who generally lay around 50 eggs a year in total. From these eggs last year, we raised 26 chicks most of which were released in Florida.  ">

      <p align="center">The Breeding Pairs:<br>
      Spike and Shelly</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080"></p>
      <p>Since we wouldn't have a breeding season without our breeding pairs, we
      wanted to feature some of them on our whooping crane reports. We are in
      full production now, with cranes still laying, and chicks hatching
      already. See our <a href="#Cool Facts">Cool Facts</a>, below, for
      information about this year's breeding season.</p>
      <p>Spike and Shelly are one of the best producing pairs at Patuxent.
      Spike's Patuxent ID number is 02-84003 and Shelly's is 02-85001. The
      &quot;02&quot; number stands for their species, whooping crane. The next
      two digits stand for the year they were hatched. Spike was hatched in 1984
      and Shelly in 1985. The last three digits signify the order they hatched
      of all the chicks hatched in that year. Spike was the third chick hatched
      in 1984, and Shelly was the first chick hatched in 1985. Both birds
      originated at Patuxent. Spike is the son of Canus and Mrs. C.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      Canus is the oldest whooper at Patuxent, and came from the wild. He was
      featured in a previous report last spring (<a href="chick6.HTM">Day 06</a>
      of the chick reports). Shelly is the daughter of Hal and Ursula. Hal and
      Ursula are both from the wild, and were brought, as eggs, to Patuxent from
      Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada.</p>
      <p>Spike and Shelly have been together since the late '80's. Their first
      egg hatched in 1992. For awhile it didn't seem as if they would be good
      producers since they didn't like their eggs very much. Shelly got her name
      from the bad habit she had of breaking egg &quot;shells&quot; when she was
      young. She and Spike both broke eggs. Fortunately, we were able to
      discourage them from the habit by giving them unbreakable artificial crane
      eggs made of wood. Once they were convinced they couldn't break the eggs,
      they started taking care of them. They're excellent parents and last year
      raised a healthy chick to fledging age (70 days). They have offspring at
      Patuxent, and in Florida in the wild, and also in Yellowstone Park. Two of
      their chicks were part of an experiment using ultra-flight aircraft to
      teach whoopers a migratory route.</p>
      <p>Spike got his name because of a &quot;spike&quot; of feathers he had on
      his head when he was young. It's gone now, but his name remains.</p>
      <p>2000 Production report for Spike and Shelly: Eggs Produced: 9. Eggs
      Fertile: 8, 1 unknown.&nbsp;<br>
      Eggs Hatched: 8. Chicks survived to fledging: 6. Chicks sent to Florida,
      4.&nbsp;<br>
      Chicks remaining at Patuxent: 2</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4" COLOR="#000080">.</p>
      </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">
      <p>For this year, Spike and Shelly have already produced 7 eggs.</p>

            5 whooper chicks on the ground, two of them hatched on Easter day.
            So far, we have 32 whooper eggs from our breeding flock. It takes a
            while to determine how many of the eggs are fertile, but they each
            hold the promise of another whooper to bolster the numbers of this
            rare species.</font></b></p>

            Not all the chicks will be raised for the Florida release program.
            This year we plan to raise some of the chicks for a new migratory
            release program. Those chicks will be trained to fly behind an
            ultralight aircraft, and to migrate from Central Wisconsin to
            Florida. Along with our partners, <a href="http://www.operationmigration.org/">Operation
            Migration</a>, we have successfully done this with non-endangered
            greater sandhill cranes. We hope that this year will be the
            beginning of the establishment a new, migratory whooper flock.</font></b></td>
