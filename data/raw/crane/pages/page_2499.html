<p><font face="Times New Roman">An understanding of the biology, ecology, and status of
cranes is fundamental to the success of efforts to conserve them and the ecosystems within
which they exist. Fortunately, cranes have drawn sustained attention from scientists and
conservationists around the world. Walkinshaw (1973) and Johnsgard (1983) provide detailed
reviews of crane biology and ecology. The species accounts in Section 2 provide summaries
of recent research and conservation activities for each species, as well as additional
literature sources for those seeking further information. This section focuses on the
cranes at the family level, highlights contrasts among the species, and reviews the status
of and threats to the family as a whole. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This section is adapted from text prepared for the <i>Handbook
of the Birds of the World: Volume 3</i> (del Hoyo, J. and Elliot, A., eds. In prep. Lynx
Editions and the ICBP, Barcelona). Section 1.5, &#147;Conservation Status,&#148; was
prepared based on the new categories and criteria as delineated in the <i>IUCN Red List
Categories</i> (IUCN 1994). Section 1.8, &#147;Captive Propagation and
Reintroduction,&#148; was prepared by Claire Mirande of the International Crane Foundation
in consultation with members of the Crane Specialist Group. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="gruevolu"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Evolution and
Classification</i></font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Within the order Gruiformes, cranes are closely related to
the limpkins (which have similar flight patterns and loud calls), the trumpeters (which
resemble Crowned Cranes in their dances and plumage), and the bustards (which are also
large, long-legged, long-necked birds found in open lands). Recent studies of morphology,
ethology, and DNA have shown similar patterns in the systematic relationships within this
order of birds (see Archibald 1976a, 1976b; Wood 1979; Krajewski 1989; Krajewski and
Fetzner 1994; Krajewski and Archibald in prep.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The crane family (Gruidae) is divided into two
subfamilies, the Crowned Cranes (Balearicinae) and the Typical Cranes (Gruinae) (Figure
1.1). Crowned Cranes date back in the fossil record to the Eocene, 37-54 million years
before present. Eleven species of Crowned Cranes are known to have existed in Europe and
North America over the last 50 million years. The two species of Crowned Cranes that
survive are found exclusively in Africa (Urban 1987). Modern Crowned Cranes cannot
withstand extreme cold, and it is conjectured that as the earth cooled these cranes died
out on the northern continents and held on only in Africa, where tropical conditions
persisted through the Pleistocene. The Typical Cranes, by contrast, are more cold hardy.
They first appear in the fossil record in the Miocene, 5-24 million years ago. It was
during this period that the thirteen surviving species of Gruinae evolved. Seven other
species of Gruinae cranes are known to have gone extinct during this period (Brodkorb
1967). </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><a name="fig01-1"></a> <img src="images/phylo.gif" alt="DNA Phylogeny of Cranes by C. Krajewski" WIDTH="352" HEIGHT="334"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Crowned Cranes are distinguished from the Typical Cranes
by their lack of a coiled trachea, their loose body plumage, and their inability to
withstand severe cold. They retain the ability to roost in trees, and are the only cranes
able to do so. Their calls are also simpler than those of the Typical Cranes (Archibald
1976a, 1976b). There are two species: the Black Crowned Crane (<i>Balearica pavonina</i>)
of the African Sahel Savannah from Senegal to Ethiopia, and the Grey Crowned Crane (<i>B.
regulorum</i>) of the East African savannahs from Kenya to South Africa. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Typical Cranes are divided into three genera: <i>Anthropoides</i>,
<i>Bugeranus</i>, and <i>Grus</i>. The Demoiselle Crane (<i>Anthropoides virgo</i>) and
Blue Crane (<i>Anthropoides paradisea</i>) have bustard-like short toes and bills, and
like the bustards live in grasslands. Although the morphological features of the
Anthropoides species and the larger Wattled Crane (<i>Bugeranus carunculatus</i>) are
dramatically different, studies of their behavior and DNA indicate a close relationship
between them (Archibald 1976a, 1976b; Krajewski 1989; Krajewski and Fetzner 1994). The
Wattled Crane is a much more aquatic species, and undoubtedly its large size is an
evolutionarily convergent feature that it shares with the <i>Grus</i> species that are
primarily aquatic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The species in the genus <i>Grus</i> are placed in four
groups (Archibald 1976a, 1976b; Krajewski 1989; Krajewski and Archibald in prep.). The
Sandhill Crane (<i>Grus canadensis</i>) stands alone, as does the Siberian Crane (<i>Grus
leucogeranus</i>). The &#147;Group of Three&#148; includes the Sarus Crane (<i>Grus
antigone</i>), the Brolga (<i>Grus rubicundus</i>), and the White-naped Crane (<i>Grus
vipio</i>). The &#147;Group of Five&#148; consists of the Eurasian Crane (<i>Grus grus</i>),
Whooping Crane (<i>Grus americana</i>), Hooded Crane (<i>Grus monachus</i>), Black-necked
Crane (<i>Grus nigricollis</i>), and Red-crowned Crane (<i>Grus japonensis</i>). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The differences between the Siberian Crane and the other <i>Grus</i>
species are greater than those that separate the remaining eight species. There are some
morphological and ethological similarities between the Siberian and Wattled Crane,
although DNA evidence suggests that these are due to convergent evolution. Many scientists
hold that the Siberian Crane should be placed within its own distinct genus, <i>Sarcogeranus</i>.
The Sandhill Crane has features in common with both the Group of Three and the Group of
Five, which suggests that it might be (or might resemble) the common ancestor of the two
groups. Although the Sarus Crane and Brolga are similar morphologically, DNA analysis
suggests that the Brolga and White-naped Crane are actually more closely related. The
Common Crane is closest to the Whooping Crane, and the Hooded Crane closest to the
Black-necked Crane. Within the Group of Five, the Red-crowned Crane is the most distantly
related to the other four species (Krajewski and Fetzner 1994). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Each of the two Crowned Crane species has two subspecies.
The Grey Crowned Crane is divided into the South African Crowned Crane (<i>B. r. regulorum</i>)
and the East African Crowned Crane (<i>B. r. gibbericeps</i>). The Black Crowned Crane is
divided into the West African Crowned Crane (<i>B. p. pavonina</i>) and the Sudan Crowned
Crane (<i>B. p. ceciliae</i>). The Sarus Crane has three subspecies: the Indian (<i>G. a.
antigone</i>), Eastern (<i>G. a. sharpii</i>), and Australian (<i>G. a. gilli</i>). The
Philippine Sarus Crane (<i>G. a. luzonica</i>), which is presumed to be extinct, may have
been a discrete subspecies. Six subspecies of Sandhill Cranes are currently recognized:
the Lesser (<i>G. c. canadensis</i>), Canadian (<i>G. c. rowani</i>), Greater (<i>G. c.
tabida</i>), Mississippi (<i>G. c. pulla</i>), Florida (<i>G. c. pratensis</i>), and Cuban
(<i>G. c. nesiotes</i>) Sandhill Cranes. In the past, the Eurasian Crane was split into
two subspecies&#151;the western (<i>G. g. grus</i>) and eastern (<i>G. g. lilfordi</i>)&#151;and
the Brolga into Northern (<i>G. r. argentea</i>) and Southern (<i>G. r. rubicundus</i>)
subspecies, but these divisions have not been validated and are not widely accepted. (See
the species accounts in Section 2 for further discussion of the taxonomic status and
characteristics of subspecies). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes are large to very large birds with long necks and
legs, streamlined bodies, and long rounded wings. In the field, they are readily
recognized by their imposing size and graceful proportions. Cranes are among the
world&#146;s tallest birds, ranging in length from 90 to more than 150 cm. The smallest is
the Demoiselle Crane. The Sarus Crane is the tallest. The Indian subspecies of the Sarus,
which can stand as high as 175 cm, is the world&#146;s tallest flying bird. The
Red-crowned Crane is the heaviest crane, weighing up to 11 kg when fat deposits peak in
the autumn. Male and female cranes of all species are identical in their external
features, although males are usually somewhat larger than females (Johnsgard 1983).
Compared to the other tall wetland birds, cranes generally have longer legs and hold their
necks straighter than day-herons; larger bodies than egrets; and longer legs, lighter
bodies, and proportionately smaller bills than storks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Distinctive features within the family reflect the varied
evolutionary history and ecological niches of the different species. The long, prehensile
hind toe (hallux) of Crowned Cranes allows them to roost in trees. Demoiselle Cranes and
Blue Cranes have short, bustard-like toes adapted for rapid running in their grassland
habitats. The relatively short bills of these cranes allow them to forage more efficiently
for seeds, insects, and other food items in upland habitats. All the other cranes display
adaptations to more aquatic conditions: elongated necks and bills, long bare legs, and
broader feet. Siberian Cranes, the most aquatic of all cranes, have the longest bill and
toes&#151;adaptations for probing and walking in mud. Brolgas, which use salt marshes and
other saline wetlands more extensively than the other species, have specialized salt
glands near their eyes, through which they are able to secrete concentrated salts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The length and position of the trachea are critical
features of crane anatomy, and shape the distinctive voices of the various cranes
(Niemeier 1983). The non-Gruinae cranes have shorter tracheas that are impressed slightly
against the sternum. In the Gruinae cranes, the trachea actually penetrates the sternum to
varying degrees. In Siberian and Wattled Cranes the trachea makes a slight indentation on
the sternum, an indentation twice as deep as that found in the Anthropoides cranes. With
the exception of the Siberian Crane, the trachea of all Grus species coils on the vertical
plane within the sternum. In the Brolga, Sandhill, and Sarus Cranes, the coiled trachea
fills most of the anterior half of the sternum, while in the White-naped, Eurasian,
Whooping, Hooded, Black-necked, and Red-crowned Cranes the trachea penetrates the entire
sternum. The bony rings of the trachea fuse with the sternum to create thin plates. When
cranes vocalize, the plates vibrate. This amplifies the cranes&#146; calls, which can
carry several kilometers (Gaunt et al. 1987). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Crane eggs are ovule-pointed and in most species heavily
pigmented. Cranes inhabiting tropical and subtropical areas lay either light bluish eggs
(Crowned Cranes) or white eggs (Sarus, Brolga). Species inhabiting the coldest
regions&#151;Siberian, Black-necked, and Lesser Sandhill Cranes&#151;produce darker eggs.
This tendency for eggs to be light-colored in warmer climates and dark in colder climates
is probably an adaptation to environmental conditions, allowing eggs to reflect heat in
the former case and to absorb heat in the latter. Red-crowned Cranes lay both white and
pigmented eggs, an indication that the species may have evolved under warmer climatic
circumstances (G. Archibald pers. obs.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The chicks of most crane species are predominantly brown.
The exceptions are the Demoiselle, Blue, and Brolga Cranes, whose chicks are silver-grey.
Chicks lose their egg tooth within a few days of hatching. The initial down is replaced by
a second down that is in turn replaced by feathers (Kashentseva 1988, 1995; Kashentseva
and Tsvetkova 1995). The rate of chick growth is astonishing, especially among chicks of
the northernmost species. Legs grow rapidly during the first six weeks, followed by more
rapid development of the wings. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Juvenile Demoiselle, Blue, Wattled, and Brolga Cranes are
predominantly grey at the time of fledging (possibly affording camouflage in upland
habitats). Juveniles of all the other species are russet brown, providing cryptic
coloration as a defense against predation. This is of particular importance to Siberian,
Whooping, and Red-crowned Crane chicks, which are destined to be primarily white as
adults. During the second year of growth, adult plumage gradually replaces the juvenile
plumage. By the end of their second year, many juvenile cranes are difficult to
distinguish from adults. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The varied features of the heads of the fifteen species
are distinctive and diagnostic (see Figure 1.2). Crowned Cranes have elaborate tawny
crests, bare cheeks, and a gular wattle. Unlike any of the Typical Cranes, mated Crowned
Cranes preen one another&#146;s head plumage. Demoiselle Cranes and Blue Cranes have
completely feathered heads, and during display can elongate the plumes on the sides of the
head. This is especially pronounced in the Blue Crane, and gives this species its unusual
&#147;cobra-like&#148; appearance. Wattled and Black-necked Cranes are similarly able to
raise the feathers on the sides of their heads. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">All cranes except for the Blue and Demoiselle have bare
red skin patches on their heads. Wattled and Siberian Cranes have the red skin on the
front of the face. The red skin extends down the upper mandible to the nares, and in the
Wattled Crane extends further down the front of the two fleshy dewlaps suspended from its
cheeks. The Siberian Crane can expand the dorsal portion of its comb backward when
displaying, and the Wattled Crane can extend its wattles downward. The red comb of the
White-naped Crane covers the face to a point behind the ear. In the Brolga the red skin
surrounds the back of the head, and in the Sarus Crane it covers the side and back of the
head and continues down the neck several centimeters. In sharp contrast, the red comb in
the remaining species is on the top of the head and expands down the back of the head
during display. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The cranes that dwell in vast open wetlands, where the
pressure from terrestrial predators is relatively low, are either entirely white
(Siberian, Whooping, Red-crowned) or partially white (White-naped, Wattled), and are
generally larger in size. Their size and bright white plumage makes these cranes
conspicuous to conspecifics, and presumably facilitates defense of the breeding territory.
The cranes that nest in smaller and/or forested wetlands are generally smaller and colored
various shades of grey. Their size and plumage color may help these cranes to hide on
their nests. At the onset of the breeding season, Sandhill Cranes and Eurasian Cranes
paint their feathers with mud, staining them russet brown. Cranes painted in this way are
much more difficult to see on their nests than unpainted cranes. At the onset of its
breeding period, the Siberian Crane paints dark mud on the base of its neck, but this
behavior is part of the species&#146; sexual display rather than a camouflaging exercise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes have ten functional primary feathers (most species
have a vestigial eleventh) and from eighteen to twenty-five secondaries. With the
exception of the Red-crowned Cranes, which has white primary flight feathers, the
primaries of all the cranes&#151;including the mostly white Siberian and Whooping
Cranes&#151;are black or dark grey. The dark pigment apparently strengthens the structure
of the feathers, thereby improving their effectiveness on long migrations. Red-crowned
Cranes may once have been predominantly non-migratory (as they are today in northern
Japan) and could &#147;afford&#148; to sacrifice durability for display. The inner
secondaries of many species are elongated, and when the wings are folded produce the
impression of a prominent &#147;tail&#148; or &#147;bustle.&#148; This is especially
pronounced in the Blue, Demoiselle, and Wattled Cranes. In most species, adults molt
annually during the postbreeding period. The main flight feathers are lost at this time,
rendering the birds flightless. Molting patterns, however, vary among and within species.
The wing molt in Brolgas, Demoiselle, and Crowned Cranes occurs gradually, so that these
species do not actually experience an extended flightless period. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes take flight with a running start, usually into the
wind, quickly gaining speed before lifting into the air with a push of the wings. When
flap-flying, cranes flick their wings with a distinctive rhythm, pushing deliberately on
the downstroke and rising rapidly on the upstroke. This rhythm is especially apparent when
cranes are disturbed or otherwise eager to gain altitude quickly. Cranes, like storks,
flamingos, geese, and swans (and unlike the large herons) fly with their necks extended
straight forward. With their long legs trailing directly behind them along a single axis
with their bills, necks, and bodies, cranes in flight present an elegant silhouette,
resembling perhaps most closely that of the flamingos. In cold weather, cranes sometimes
pull their legs in against their bodies. When landing, cranes approach the ground with
their head semi-erect, wings extended, and legs dangling. They descend with wings and tail
spread out and down, and with a final flapping of the wings alight in a normal standing
stance. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="grudistr"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Distribution and
Habitat</i></font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes are cosmopolitan in their distribution, occurring
from the North American and Asian tundra to the Asian, Australian, and African tropics.
East Asia, with seven species occurring on a regular basis, has the highest level of
species diversity. Five species occur during the year in the Indian subcontinent. Africa
has four species year-round, resident and wintering populations of a fifth (the
Demoiselle), and wintering populations of a sixth (the Eurasian)<sup align="1">1</sup>.
Why cranes never colonized South America remains a biogeographic mystery. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most of the cranes prefer relatively open spaces and
require territories with a wide range of visibility. Space and solitude are especially
important requirements during the breeding season. Most species nest in shallow wetlands,
where the cranes meet both their feeding and nest-building needs. The Crowned Cranes roost
in trees, nest in wetlands, and forage predominantly in grasslands. The two Anthropoides
species usually nest, and almost invariably feed, in open grasslands and roost in
wetlands. In central Asia, the Demoiselle Crane will nest in arid grasslands, and even
true deserts, as long as water is available. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The degree to which cranes use and require wetlands varies
widely among, and within, species. The Cuban Sandhill Crane lives in pine-palmetto
savannas and nests and rears its young on dry ground. Other Sandhill Cranes and the Sarus,
Brolga, White-naped, Eurasian and Black-necked Cranes nest in wetlands; however, soon
after the chicks hatch they are led to neighboring uplands to forage, returning to
wetlands for the night. Wattled Cranes in the enormous floodplains of south-central Africa
nest when water levels peak during the annual floods, but remain in the wetlands
throughout much of the year. Wattled Cranes in the montane wetlands of South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia nest at the end of the dry season on small wetlands bordered by
grasslands. The large white cranes (Siberian, Whooping, and Red-crowned), and perhaps also
the Hooded Crane (which nests in isolated tamarack swamps), remain in wetlands throughout
the nesting and rearing period. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the migratory species, family groups join together into
flocks at premigration staging areas soon after the chicks fledge. A staging area usually
contains safe roosting sites as well as a dependable source of food. The number of cranes
using a staging area continues to increase until inclement weather forces the cranes to
move south to join even larger prestaging congregations. The major portion of the
migration flight then commences. Along the way there may be several stopover points. Most
species of migratory cranes remain in large flocks throughout the winter non-breeding
period, roosting at night in shallow wetlands and foraging during the day in wetlands and
upland areas, including agricultural fields. Species that feed primarily on sedge tubers
and other aquatic vegetation (Siberian, Sandhill, White-naped, Brolga) forage in flocks,
while those that feed more on animals (Whooping, Red-crowned) are more territorial and
often forage in family groups. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Non-migratory cranes also gather in groups during the
non-breeding season. They are somewhat opportunistic and nomadic in choosing habitats,
moving from area to area in search of food and security. Although the availability of food
is always of paramount importance during these times, social needs such as pairing and the
introduction of juveniles to flocks also contribute to habitat choice and flocking
behavior in the non-migratory cranes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes generally try to maintain a distance of at least
several kilometers between themselves and areas of human activity. If, however, they are
not harmed or disturbed, cranes can acclimate to the presence of people. Thus, Sarus
Cranes in India have adapted to the high human population density in that country, and
commonly nest and roost in small village ponds and jheels (Gole 1989b, 1991b, 1993a). In
recent decades recovering populations of Sandhill Cranes in North America and Eurasian
Cranes in Europe have taken to using smaller, less isolated, and lower quality wetlands
closer to human settlements (Gluesing 1974, Mewes 1994). In parts of Kazakhstan and
Ukraine, the Demoiselle Crane has been able to continue breeding in steppes that have been
converted to agriculture as long as farming operations are timed so as to minimize
disturbance (Winter 1991, Kovshar et al. 1995). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Agricultural development has had varying impacts on cranes
and their habitats. The drainage of wetlands for agriculture has deprived most cranes of
habitat to one degree or another, with the more wetland-dependent species&#151;the
Wattled, Siberian, Whooping, and Red-crowned&#151;being most profoundly affected. Other
species have adapted to and even benefitted from agriculture. For some cranes, wetlands
bordered by agricultural fields often provide more favorable breeding habitat than do
pristine regions where wetlands are surrounded by forests or other wetland types. In
general, the species that can subsist on gleanings of waste grain in agricultural fields
during migration and on their wintering grounds are faring better than those that depend
exclusively upon wetlands throughout the year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><sup align="1">1</sup>In this document,
&quot;population&quot; refers to a group of interbreeding cranes of the same species that
occupies a distinct geographic area or region. In most cases this area or region is within
the species' breeding range (the term &quot;breeding population&quot; is also sometimes
used). If the area is within the species' winter range, the term &quot;wintering
sub-population&quot; is used (since birds from different wintering areas may breed in the
same area). When used in reference to the species as a whole or to subspecies,
&quot;population&quot; refers to the total number of individuals in the taxon. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="grubehav"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Behavior</i></font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes are isolated on their territories during the
breeding season and gregarious during the non-breeding period. All cranes are basically
diurnal in their habits. During the day they forage, rest, and preen, attend to their
young (during the breeding season), and socialize within flocks (in the non-breeding
season). At night during the breeding season, cranes stay on or near their nests, brooding
their chicks and standing guard against predators and other dangers. In the non-breeding
season, cranes roost at night in more or less large flocks at traditional roosting sites. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The non-breeding season pattern of feeding by day and
roosting by night is universal. Roosting provides security for the flock and offers
juvenile and &#147;single&#148; birds opportunities for pair formation. Crowned Cranes
roost in trees. The other species usually roost in shallow water, but occasionally use dry
ground, mudflats, or sandbars. Within roosting flocks, each crane stands about a
&#147;peck distance&#148; away from its neighbors. Cranes rest on one leg during the
night, with the head and neck tucked on or under a shoulder. They defecate at regular
intervals, and may switch from one leg to the other several times during the course of a
night. One unfamiliar sound or alarm call from a flock member is all that is required for
the birds to become alert and prepared to fly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">At dawn the cranes awaken, stretch, preen, and drink, then
begin the day&#146;s activity. They fly off in small groups to an open upland area near
the evening&#146;s roost&#151;the post-roosting staging area. There they land and continue
to preen. Cranes from several roosting sites might join together at the staging area. From
there, initially in small groups but then in larger congregations, they will move to the
day&#146;s feeding areas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Depending on the availability of food, cranes feed for
extended periods in the early morning, then move to loafing areas. There they drink,
preen, and engage in social displays to facilitate the pairing of unmated birds and to
establish a pecking order among families. If temperatures are unusually hot, the cranes
may escape the heat by spiraling skyward on rising thermals, eventually disappearing from
view. Later in the day they return to watering and/or feeding areas, where they again
feed, before moving to pre-roosting staging areas. Here they may again engage in social
displays before flying to the evening&#146;s roost, where they remain silent and still
through the night unless disturbed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The behavior of individual cranes can be divided into
those activities that are self-directed and those that are undertaken in response to other
cranes and other external stimuli. In addition to such fundamental activities as eating,
drinking, sleeping, walking, and flying, self-directed activities include preening,
bathing, shaking, stretching, ruffling, scratching, and feather painting. Behavioral
studies of cranes have revealed some 90 or more specific behavioral patterns within these
categories (Ellis et al. 1991). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The social behaviors of cranes include a wide array of
visual displays. These ritualized displays serve many intra- and interspecific functions,
and are often accompanied by vocal displays (see Section 1.3.4 below). Thirteen species
have bare red skin patches on their heads, this too plays an important communication role.
Cranes can vary the extent of skin displayed by contracting or relaxing the subcutaneous
muscles, and can change the intensity of the skin&#146;s color by engorging it. The color
and exposure of the skin changes in response to various stimuli, and often accompanies
other behavioral displays. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When cranes are aggressive, they assume an upright posture
with their body feathers sleeked, thighs protruding, and the head features expanded. They
walk in a stilted manner that has been likened to the goose-step of parading soldiers.
They will follow this threatening posture with a variety of flaps, ruffles, bows, false
preenings, stomps, nasal snorts, and growls. If a crane takes to the air in this emotional
state, it will fly with rigid flaps with narrow arcs, with its feet and neck arched
upward. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/6.jpg" alt="Ruffle threat of Sandhill Crane by International Crane Foundation" WIDTH="311" HEIGHT="467"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes also engage in a variety of more circumscribed
threat gestures. In the &#147;crouch threat,&#148; the crane bends its legs, lowers itself
to the ground, folds its wings loosely against the ground and body, and places its head
forward with the red patch prominent. In the &#147;ruffle threat,&#148; the crane raises
the feathers of its neck, wings, and back, partially opens and lowers its wings, ruffles
them alternately, and then lowers its bill to its lower breast or leg in a preening
movement, often concluding this sequence with a low growl. In a &#147;charge,&#148; the
crane points its neck and head straight down and lifts the feathers along its neck and
back, holding this stance for several seconds. In all such threat displays, the red skin
patch is bright and conspicuous (Voss 1976, Nesbitt and Archibald 1981). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A crane that is filled with fear (when, for example,
confronting a predator) spreads its wings, arches forward as if ready to strike, and
approaches the feared animal. A submissive crane, by contrast, lowers its neck, elevates
it body feathers, and diminishes the threatening display of its head features by lowering
the feathers and reducing the size of its comb. In this state of accommodation, the crane
walks loosely and warily. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Of all the behaviors of cranes, none is as spectacular or
as well known as their elaborate and enthusiastic dancing. Cranes are not the only birds
known to dance; trumpeters and egrets, for example, engage in somewhat similar displays,
although not so habitually. All species of cranes dance. It is apparently an ancient and
complex behavior within the family, and serves a variety of functions (Masatomi 1994).
Dancing is undertaken by even very young birds as a part of their behavioral and physical
development. Unpaired subadult birds probably dance more than other age groups. For these
birds, dancing facilitates the processes of socialization and pair formation. Among
adults, dancing can be a form of displacement activity when cranes are nervous. Among
pairs, it may serve to maintain pair bonds and synchronize sexual response prior to
breeding. New pairs dance during courtship. Well established pairs, on the other hand,
have less need to synchronize their behavior or to ward off rivals, and hence dance less
often. Cranes do not always dance in response to apparent stimuli. Within flocks, it is
often a contagious activity that spreads readily among the excited birds. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/7.jpg" alt="Red-crowned Cranes dancing by Ts. Hayashida" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="277"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The pattern and intensity of dancing vary somewhat among
the crane species, but the dances of all cranes consist of long and intricate sequences of
coordinated bows, leaps, runs, and short flights. In the course of dancing, cranes often
pick up with their bills whatever small objects&#151;sticks, moss, grass,
feathers&#151;happen to be in the area, randomly tossing them into the air. Dancing in the
smaller species, such as the Crowned and Demoiselle, tends to be the most energetic.
Crowned Cranes perhaps dance most distinctively, bobbing their heads up and down prior to
bowing, spreading their wings, leaping and flapping their wings, then often landing and
circling one another. The sequence of courtship dancing among Blue Cranes has been
observed to last from half an hour to as long as four hours (Van Ee 1966). The dance of
the Demoiselle Crane has been described as &#147;more balletlike&#148; than those of the
Gruinae species, with fewer, less theatrical jumps (Johnsgard 1983). Among the Gruinae
cranes, dancing is slightly more deliberate, and punctuated often with high, flapping
leaps. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="gruvocal"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Vocalizations</i></font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes have evolved elaborate vocal displays to help them
communicate with one another (see Archibald 1976a, 1976b; Johnsgard 1983). From barely
audible contact calls to trumpet-like notes that can carry out across their extensive
territories, cranes employ a variety of calls with different meanings. The typical volume
and tone likewise varies widely from species to species. The Crowned Cranes have soft
honks. The voices of the Anthropoides cranes are low and raspy, and those of the Grus
species high-pitched and extremely loud. The Sandhill Cranes have a distinctive
low-pitched rattle. The Siberian Crane&#146;s voice is noted for its clear, flute-like
quality. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The &#147;languages&#148; of the various cranes develop
differently, depending on the nature of the adult voice, but in all cases the
&#147;vocabulary&#148; begins to emerge early in life. Hatching chicks emit high-pitched
peeps that persist through the first year of life. Newly hatched chicks quickly acquire a
low, purring &#147;contact call&#148; to maintain regular contact with their parents and a
louder, more insistent &#147;stress call&#148; to draw their more immediate attention.
Within a day or so of hatching, chicks develop a &#147;food-begging call,&#148; a soft
peeping that signals the parents to provide food. Within its first year of life, the young
bird also learns the &#147;flight-intention call&#148; and &#147;alarm call.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">By the end of the bird&#146;s first year, the voice
deepens and gains in strength and volume. The contact, flight-intention, and alarm calls
are retained, while others develop. A &#147;guard call&#148; is generally given as an
intraspecific threat. The &#147;location call&#148; allows the newly mobile bird to gain
its bearings if visual contact is lost. The &#147;precopulatory call&#148; begins to be
heard at about the age of 24 months. Fully adult cranes augment these calls with an
assortment of other specialized vocalizations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The most penetrating of all the calls in the vocal
repertoire of cranes, and among the most spectacular of all avian sounds, are the special
duets of mated pairs. The duets, known as &#147;unison calls,&#148; can last from a few
seconds to as long as one minute and may be repeated regularly through the course of a
day, though it is most commonly heard prior to the breeding season. Unison calling begins
to develop in the second or third year of a bird&#146;s life. The call serves a variety of
important functions in the individual and social lives of cranes. It plays a critical role
in the initiation, development, and maintenance of pair bonds. Unison calls of very young
pairs are typically loosely coordinated compared to the highly synchronous calls of well
established pairs. Unison calling allows the partners to come into breeding condition at
the same time, and seems to be especially important in the ovarian development of females
(Archibald 1976a, 1976b). The call is also used more generally to demarcate territories,
to ward off potential intruders, and to respond to other threats. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/8.jpg" alt="Red-crowned Cranes unison-calling by International Crane Foundation" WIDTH="292" HEIGHT="387"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Unison calls vary among the species. During sexual
displays, Crowned Cranes lower their heads to shoulder level, inflate their gular sacs,
and emit a long sequence of low booming calls. The Gruinae unison calls can be used to
determine the sex of the individual cranes: the female usually has the higher-pitched
voice. In the case of the Siberian Crane, the pitch of the call is the only outward
diagnostic feature that allows one to distinguish males from females. In the Anthropoides
and Wattled Cranes, the male and female assume distinct postures during the unison call.
The female Demoiselle Cranes calls with her bill pointed upward, while the male calls with
the bill held horizontal. Male Blue and Wattled Cranes elevate their wings at the
conclusion of the unison call. All the Grus species except the Siberian Cranes have
sexually distinct voices during the unison call, with the female emitting two or three
calls for every call produced by the male. Male Sarus, Brolga, and White-naped Cranes
always elevate their wings over their back and droop their primaries during the unison
call. In the Eurasian, Whooping, Hooded, Black-necked, and Red-crowned Cranes, the amount
of wing-posturing depends on the intensity of the aggression associated with the display. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="grudiet"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Diet and Foraging
Behavior</i></font></a></h2>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/9.jpg" alt="White-naped Cranes typically probe for food in shallow wetlands by Y. Akao" WIDTH="438" HEIGHT="331"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Although some species are more specialized than others,
most cranes are generalists and opportunists, feeding on a remarkably wide variety of
plant and animal foods. Among cranes that use upland areas, the diet includes seeds,
leaves, acorns, nuts, berries, fruits, waste grains, worms, snails, grasshoppers, beetles,
other insects, snakes, lizards, rodents and other small mammals, and even small birds.
Wetland food items include the roots, bulbs, rhizomes, tubers, sprouts, stems, and seeds
of submergent and emergent plants, and mollusks, aquatic insects, crustaceans, small fish,
and frogs. Cranes readily shift their feeding strategies on a daily or seasonal basis to
take advantage of available food items. For example, Eurasian Cranes wintering on the
Iberian Peninsula subsist primarily on cereal grains in the early part of the winter,
switch to acorns of the holm oak in mid-winter, and may turn again to germinating cereals
and legumes in the late winter (Alonso et al. 1987, Sànchez et al. 1993). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The anatomy of cranes reveals much about their feeding
preferences. Cranes with shorter bills usually feed in the dry uplands, while those with
longer bills usually feed in wetlands. Crowned Cranes stamp the ground to scare up
insects, which they then grasp in their short bills. These species, together with the two
Anthropoides species, the Sandhill Cranes, and the Eurasian, Hooded, and Black-necked
Cranes, also use their shorter bills for grazing in a goose-like manner. The taller cranes
with the largest and longest bills (Wattled, Siberian, Sarus, Brolga, White-naped) are
diggers, and use their powerful mandibles to excavate tubers and roots from the muddy
soils of wetlands. The long-billed Whooping Cranes and Red-crowned Cranes use their bills
to gently probe the bottom of shallow wetlands for crustaceans and other small aquatic
animals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The foraging behavior of cranes reflects their varied
strategies, niches, and diets. The diggers usually stay in the same area for extended
periods of time, excavating holes that are continually enlarged to expose the tubers that
proliferate in certain types of wetland soils. Unlike herons, which stand motionless and
wait to strike for prey, the hunting cranes walk slowly through the water searching and
probing for prey to grab. Upland feeders usually walk with their heads lowered, hunting
and pecking at the ground for insects, seeds, and other morsels. Generalist feeders use
different strategies under different circumstances. Sarus Cranes, for example, often dig
for tubers and other subsurface plant materials, but are effective upland foragers and
hunters, and have also been observed stripping grains of rice from their stalks (Gole
1989b, 1991b). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Crane parents begin to feed their chicks almost
immediately after hatching occurs. Both parents contribute to the feeding of young. Adults
carry small food items to the chicks and either present the food directly to them by
holding it at the tip of their bills or by dropping it before them. Chicks eventually
begin to follow their parents to nearby food sources, although in some cases adults will
continue to bring food until the chicks are several months old. Demoiselle Crane chicks
are unusually mobile at an early age (G. Archibald pers. obs.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Where several species of cranes occur together, the varied
feeding strategies and adaptations tend to minimize the degree of niche overlap. This
occurs most noticeably in wintering areas in China, where four species may coexist in the
same area. Thus, at Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, Siberian Cranes have been observed
feeding in the shallow water and mud flats, White-naped Cranes along the wetland borders,
Hooded Cranes in adjacent croplands, and Eurasian Cranes in the available
&#147;spaces&#148; in between (Zhou and Ding 1987, Chen and Wang 1991). When Sarus and
Siberian Cranes have occurred together at Keoladeo National Park in India, the Siberians
have foraged for sedge tubers in deeper waters while the Sarus have fed on a broader
variety of plants and animals in shallower waters (Sauey 1985). A somewhat analogous
situation has been observed in parts of Australia where Brolgas and Sarus Cranes are
sympatric. The former tend to use larger, more open sedge marshes in the lowlands; the
latter to use smaller wetlands in more forested areas as well as drier habitats (Archibald
and Swengel 1987; A. Haffenden pers. comm.). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Many species of cranes benefit from the food provided by
agricultural fields during the breeding and/or non-breeding phase of their annual cycle.
At one time or another, most cranes forage in crop lands and pastures that border the
wetlands where they nest or roost. At migration stopovers and on the wintering grounds,
those species that feed on gleanings from agricultural fields usually find an abundance of
food, and interfere minimally with farming operations. For example, the great
congregations of migrating Sandhill Cranes that stop along the Platte River in the central
United States in the spring subsist largely on waste corn gleaned from nearby fields. Crop
damage can occasionally be a serious problem (e.g., Mizoguchi 1985, Parasharya 1986,
McIvor and Conover 1994, Bouffard in press). This usually occurs during the fall migration
or early in the winter, when crops are being harvested, or in the early spring, when new
crops are germinating. During these times, not only are the field foods available, but the
cranes are usually in large flocks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">For several species, artificial feeding has come to play
an important role not only in their annual cycle, but in their survival and recovery as
species. Some three-fourths of the world&#146;s population of Hooded Cranes, and about 40%
of the White-naped Crane, are sustained by artificial feeding on the Japanese island of
Izumi, a program that was initiated in the 1950s (Goto 1986; Ohsako 1987, 1994; Matano
1995). The Hokkaido population of Red-crowned Cranes, about one-third of the total
population, has used feeding stations since 1952 (Archibald 1978). In both cases,
artificial feeding has contributed to the rapid growth of small remnant populations.
However, the success of such programs now presents its own conservation challenges. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="grubreed"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Breeding</i></font></a></h2>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Eurasian Crane on nest by S. Traneving" WIDTH="297" HEIGHT="456"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes are generally monogamous. Mated birds stay together
throughout the year, and typically remain paired until one bird dies. The age of sexual
maturity has seldom been studied in wild cranes, but individuals in most species probably
begin to establish pairs in their second or third years. Pair bonds form within flocks of
non-breeding birds, or outside of the breeding season within mixed flocks. Many, if not
most, pairs fail to breed successfully in their initial attempts. Among Sandhill Cranes,
whose breeding biology has been most extensively studied, it has been shown that pairs
that are unsuccessful in their first attempts to breed often dissolve, while successful
pairs remain together (Nesbitt 1989). A strong pair bond is maintained as long as the pair
successfully reproduces. However, if breeding efforts continually fail, the pair bond
weakens and new mates are eventually taken. Most studies indicate that individuals do not
successfully reproduce until they are between four and eight years old (Drewien 1973, Kuyt
and Goossen 1987). Other species may share this general pattern. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Securing a breeding territory is a prerequisite of
reproduction, and in areas where all available territories are occupied, young birds may
need to wait to breed. Cranes of the northern temperate and arctic zones begin to
establish breeding territories soon after their arrival from the wintering grounds,
usually between mid-April and mid-June. The breeding seasons of cranes in the tropical and
subtropical zones are much more variable, but generally coincide (and vary) with local
rainy seasons. The breeding seasons of the Brolga and Sarus Cranes are closely associated
with the distinct monsoons of southeast Asia and Australia. By contrast, Sarus Cranes in
India and Wattled and Grey Crowned Cranes in southern Africa may breed throughout the
year, although breeding usually peaks in response to localized conditions. Such
variability is evident even within species. Sandhill Cranes breeding in Alaska produce
almost all of their eggs in June. The breeding season for Florida Sandhill Cranes extends
from December to June, with most eggs produced from February to April (Johnsgard 1983). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Breeding densities and territory sizes are poorly known
for most cranes, but in some species are apparently quite variable in response to local
conditions. In India, for example, nesting territories as small as one hectare are
sufficient for Sarus Cranes if the quality of the water and vegetation is adequate and
human disturbance is minimized (Gole 1989b, 1991b). In Cambodia, by contrast, Eastern
Sarus Cranes establish extensive nesting territories in remote and isolated wetlands
(Barzen 1994). Similarly, Eurasian and Sandhill Cranes have both adapted to the
intensification of human settlement by establishing breeding territories in smaller, less
natural wetlands. Once territories are established, pairs defend them through unison
calls, threat postures, and attacks. The male is primarily responsible for defense, while
the female is more involved in domestic affairs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">New pairs engage in long bouts of dancing before
attempting copulation, whereas established pairs copulate with facility and without
tension. The copulatory sequence can be initiated by either sex. One member of the pair
will elevate its bill, arch slightly forward, and emit a low purr-like call. If the mate
reciprocates with similar behavior, one (usually the male) will circle the other with
exaggerated steps. The female then spreads her wings and the male approaches. With wings
flapping he jumps on her back, and crouches. The female elevates her tail as the males
lowers his, and their cloaca meet. The male then jumps forward over his mate&#146;s head
and performs threat displays for a few seconds. Both members of the pair then engage in a
long sequence of preening. Cranes copulate for several weeks in advance of laying, usually
before sunrise, although copulation can occur at any time during the daylight hours. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Both sexes participate in nest building. They select a
secluded spot within their territory and unison call from that spot. Walking away from
that selected spot, they toss nesting materials (mainly the stems and leaves of sedges,
cattails, and other wetland plants) behind them over their shoulders. They return to the
nest site and pull in the materials within their reach before walking slowly away from the
nest and throwing additional materials behind them. As they repeat this sequence many
times, large quantities of nesting material accumulate at the low platform nest, while a
&#147;moat&#148; of water forms around the platform. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This nest-building behavior holds for those species that
nest within wetlands. Two species&#151;the Blue and Demoiselle Cranes&#151;nest on dry
ground. In both cases, eggs are usually laid directly on the ground. The pair may gather
together some small stones or vegetation to provide protection and camouflage, but
otherwise the nests show little if any preparation. In some portions of their range,
Sandhill Cranes also nest on dry sites. On rare occasion, Grey Crowned Cranes will nest in
trees (and have even been observed using the abandoned nests of other large tree-nesting
species). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes almost invariably lay two eggs. Exceptions are the
Crowned Cranes, which regularly lay three and sometimes four eggs, and the Wattled Crane,
which usually lays only one egg. In the Crowned Cranes, incubation begins after the clutch
is complete. In the Gruinae species, incubation begins after the first egg is laid.
Incubation in cranes averages between 28 and 32 days in most species (Johnsgard 1983).
Wattled Cranes, at 33-36 days, have the longest incubation period. Species breeding in
higher latitudes and at higher elevations tend to have the shortest incubation periods (</font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">&lt;30 days). The female usually incubates
at night; during the day the sexes exchange incubation duties several times. The
non-incubating member of the pair usually flies to a favorite feeding area far from the
nest. Crowned Crane chicks hatch synchronously, while Gruinae chicks hatch asynchronously.
Wattled and Siberian Cranes have been observed to leave the nest after only the first egg
has hatched, and typically only a single chick is raised in these species. In other
species, the parents frequently rear two chicks, but one of these soon becomes dominant.
If food is scarce, the weaker chick often dies. </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman">T</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">he extent to which multiple clutching can or does occur in cranes is
little known. Repeat</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="3">
clutches have, however, been reported for Grey Crowned, Blue, Wattled, Sandhill, Eurasian,
White-naped, and Red-crowned Cranes. Florida Sandhill Cranes have been observed laying
third, and in one case fourth, clutches (Mirande et al. in press b). Cranes of the
northern latitudes, including the Whooping and Siberian Cranes, experience such short
growing seasons that even if they did produce second clutches, it would be difficult to
fledge the young in time to undertake migration. In captivity, however, females of these
and other species have been induced to lay repeatedly through the removal of the eggs,
either one at a time or as clutches. In this manner, females have regularly produced up to
ten or more eggs in a single breeding season. </font><font face="Times New Roman">Adults
care for their chicks continuously through the pre-fledging period. The length of the
fledging periods varies widely among the cranes (Johnsgard 1983). Fledging periods are
shortest in species that inhabit upland areas (Grey Crowned, Black Crowned, Demoiselle,
Blue) and that nest in the high arctic (Siberian and Lesser Sandhills). In general, chicks
of these species fledge at between 50 and 90 days. On average, the Demoiselle Crane has
the shortest fledging period, usually between 55 and 60 days. Cranes that inhabit
permanent wetlands in warmer climates (Wattled, Sarus, Brolga) have the longest
prefledging periods. Chicks of these species usually fledge at between 85 and 100 or more
days. The Wattled Crane has the longest fledging period at about 90-130 days. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The productivity of a given crane population can be
measured in several ways, but is most easily determined by counting the number of
juveniles in the flocks during the non-breeding period. In general, about 10-15% of a
healthy population will consist of non-breeding juveniles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Juvenile cranes remain with their parents throughout the
non-breeding period. At the conclusion of the non-breeding period, juveniles either
voluntarily leave their parents or are driven off by the adults after the family returns
to the breeding territory. Unpaired juvenile birds gather in non-breeding flocks and are
often nomadic throughout the breeding period. By the end of their second year, juvenile
birds have usually initiated their own attempts to form pair bonds. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/12.jpg" alt="Eurasian Cranes in v-formation by International Crane Foundation" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="285"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Cranes can be divided into two groups: migratory and
non-migratory. Non-migratory cranes move relatively short distances between breeding and
non-breeding areas, and gather in large flocks prior to the onset of the breeding period.
Local and seasonal movements of varying lengths are typical of the lower latitude
species&#151;the Crowned Cranes, the Blue, Wattled, Brolga, and Sarus Cranes. In most
cases, their breeding seasons and hence their movements are tied to, and vary with, the
duration and intensity of the local rainy seasons. Local and seasonal movements are also
characteristic of southern, non-migratory populations of some of the northern migratory
species. This may be seen among populations of the Demoiselle Crane in northern Africa and
Sandhill Cranes in Cuba, Florida, and Mississippi. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Such limited and seasonal movements are modest in
comparison with the epic migrations of the northern cranes. Some of the migration routes
stretch thousands of kilometers, during which the cranes must confront broad deserts, high
mountain ranges, and other formidable obstacles. This achievement is even more remarkable
for the northernmost species, the Siberian and Sandhill Cranes breeding in the arctic
latitudes of Eurasia and North America. Among these populations, the young of the year
must in one short growing season gain the size, strength, and endurance to join their
adult companions on the long journey south. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Migratory cranes spend several days or weeks at
premigration staging areas building up their fat reserves and integrating into life as a
flock. Then they commence migration. After feeding for several hours in the early morning
(often on a clear day with northwest breezes gusting) they rise into the sky, flap-flying
in wide circles, lifted by thermals. After climbing as high as 2000 meters, they stop
flapping, extend their wings, assume a &#147;V&#148; formation, and glide southward
propelled by gravity and wind. After losing altitude, they repeat the cycle, again
spiralling skyward and gliding south. While flying over land, they follow this pattern
throughout the day. However, when forced to fly over water, where there are no thermals,
they flap-fly in &#147;V&#148; formation. Crane chicks fly close to their parents and
during their first migration south learn the migration route. While migrating, cranes call
constantly. Their voices can often be heard even before the birds are spotted as tiny
spots against the blue sky. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Migration has been studied closely in several species.
Whooping Cranes, for example, have been shown to migrate as much as 800 km in a single
day, although 300 km is more typical (Howe 1989). A review of Sandhill Crane migration
data showed average flight lengths of 267 km/day, with individual flights of up to 740 km
(Melvin 1982, Melvin and Temple 1982). Estimated flight speeds in Sandhill Cranes average
between 23 and 83 km/h depending on wind speed and direction (Melvin 1982). This range is
probably similar to that of most migratory cranes. Several crane migrations stand out as
especially impressive. Eurasian Cranes from central Eurasia fly over the Himalayas at
altitudes approaching 10,000 meters, while Demoiselle Cranes negotiate the passes in these
highest mountains on earth. Other Demoiselles migrate across the wide deserts of the
Middle East and northern Africa to wintering grounds in the upper reaches of the Nile
basin. Siberian Cranes in the remnant Central population in Eurasia and Lesser Sandhill
Cranes breeding in eastern Siberia undertake the longest of all crane migrations, in
excess of 5000 km. The Siberian Sandhills move east across the Bering Sea into North
America and continue south as far as northern Mexico. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">An understanding of crane migratory patterns and behaviors
is critically important in assessing the conservation status and needs of the different
species. The problems cranes face during migration often constitute the &#147;weak
links&#148; in the chain of conservation actions. Even if the cranes are secure in their
breeding and wintering areas, they may be vulnerable to habitat changes at traditional
staging and resting areas, and often face other dangers associated with human activity
along the migration routes. Historically, for example, collisions with utility lines and
accidental shooting have been important mortality factors along the Whooping Crane&#146;s
narrow migration corridor (Faanes and Johnson 1992, Lewis et al. 1992b). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Because migration is such a critical phase in the annual
cycle of cranes, crane biologists have in recent years devoted much time and effort to the
study of migration through banding, radio telemetry, and satellite tracking programs. Such
studies have been especially important in developing recovery and reintroduction plans for
the Siberian and Whooping Cranes. Because knowledge of migration routes is passed along to
new generations of cranes by experienced older birds, conservation programs for these most
endangered species emphasize the maintenance of existing routes and the development of new
techniques for teaching migration. Perhaps most significant, the conservation needs of
cranes during migration have necessitated extensive cooperation across national
boundaries, sometimes among countries otherwise in conflict with one another (Lewis 1991,
Shibaev 1995). </font></p>
