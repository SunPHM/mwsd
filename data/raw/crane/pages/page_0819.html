<br><i>Diana and Endymion</i> by Walter Crane (1883)</center>

<p><font size=+1>Classical writers didn't have trouble accepting that knowledge
of the heavens came from humble people. In the story alluded to by Pliny
the Elder, the Greek Moon goddess Selene (or in the above Pre-Raphaelite
painting,&nbsp; Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt and of the Moon--symbolized
by the crescent shape of the bow) was taken with Endymion, a beautiful
youth who tended his flocks on Mount Latmos. She asked Zeus to give Endymion
immortal life. Zeus complied, but in doing so put the youth into perpetual
sleep. The Moon goddess saw to it that her lover's flocks were protected.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Perhaps there is recognition here that, rather than later
Chaldean astronomers,&nbsp; an ancient shepherd would be naturally well
situated to be the first person to sort out the motions of the moon. As
Pliny said, "Which several constitutions and motions in her, the first
man that observed, was Endymion: and thereupon the voice went, that he
was enamored with the moon."</font>
<p><font size=+1>Selene's love for Endymion was out of character for her,
being known for her chasteness and disinterest in men, perhaps an allusion
to the difficulty men had in predicting her heavenly travels. She was so
aloof, in fact, that one unfortunate youth, Actaeon--a hunter--by accident
happened upon Selene one day while she was bathing, becoming the first
man to see her unclothed. Angered by this, Selene turned Actaeon into a
deer, at which point his own dogs killed him. Even Endymion, with whom
she did bear children, paid for the honor of being her husband with perpetual
sleep. His immortality, in contrast with the mass of men who mark their
days, in the words of Oscar Wilde, by a "rosary of suns," is an indication
that the intervals marked by the Moon were seen as beyond ordinary, mundane
time.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Besides Selene and Diana, the Moon goddess was sometimes
identified as Hecate, the latter often depicted as a three-headed goddess,
reflecting three aspects: Selene (heaven), Diana (Earth) and Hecate (underworld),
further attesting to the complexity of the subject.</font><font size=+1></font>

<p><font size=+1>Ptolemy wrote in his classic textbook of 150 A.D. that
"It is plausible to suppose that the ancients got their first notions on
these topics from the following kind of observations. They saw that the
sun, moon and other stars were carried from east to west along circles
which were always parallel to each other, that they began to rise up from
below the earth itself, as it were, gradually got up high, then kept going
around in similar fashion and getting lower, until, falling to earth, so
to speak, they vanished completely, then, after remaining invisible for
some time, again rose afresh and set; and [they saw] the periods of these
[motions], and also the places of rising and setting were, on the whole,
fixed and the same. What chiefly led them to the concept of the sphere
was the revolution of the ever-visible stars, which was observed to be
circular, and always taking place about one centre, the same [for all].
For by necessity that point became [for them] the pole of the heavenly
sphere..."</font>

<p><font size=+1>=============================================</font>
<p><font size=+1>from <b><i>The Garden of Eros</i></b> by Oscar Wilde:</font>
<p><font size=+1>Methinks these new Actaeons boast too soon</font>
<br><font size=+1>That they have spied on beauty; what if we</font>
<br><font size=+1>Have analysed the rainbow, robbed the moon</font>
<br><font size=+1>Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,</font>
<br><font size=+1>Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope</font>
<br><font size=+1>Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!</font>
<p><font size=+1>What profit if this scientific age</font>
<br><font size=+1>Burst through our gates with all its retinue</font>
<br><font size=+1>Of modern miracles!&nbsp; Can it assuage</font>
<br><font size=+1>One lover's breaking heart? what can it do</font>
<br><font size=+1>To make one life more beautiful, one day</font>
<br><font size=+1>More godlike in its period? but now the Age of Clay</font>
<p><font size=+1>Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth</font>
<br><font size=+1>Hath borne again a noisy progeny</font>
<br><font size=+1>Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth</font>
<br><font size=+1>Hurls them against the august hierarchy</font>
<br><font size=+1>Which sat upon Olympus; to the Dust</font>
<br><font size=+1>They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must</font>
<p><font size=+1>Repair for judgment; let them, if they can,</font>
<br><font size=+1>From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,</font>
<br><font size=+1>Create the new Ideal rule for man!</font>
<br><font size=+1>Methinks that was not my inheritance;</font>
<br><font size=+1>For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul</font>
<br><font size=+1>Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme
goal.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away</font>
<br><font size=+1>Her visage from the God, and Hecate's boat</font>
<br><font size=+1>Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day</font>
<br><font size=+1>Blew all its torches out:&nbsp; I did not note</font>
<br><font size=+1>The waning hours, to young Endymions</font>
<br><font size=+1>Time's palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!</font>
