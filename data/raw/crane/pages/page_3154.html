<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Art/Decoration:</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Origami is widely used for art and decoration.
For example the Dunn Mehler Art Gallery located in Half Moon Bay, California
used these hanging cranes as part of an overall art exhibit to compliment
another one of the art pieces on display. The cranes also made a timely
statement of peace after the events of September 11th, 2001, in addition
to festive ornaments during the Christmas and New Year holidays.</font>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mathematics:</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Origami is a unique way to teach mathematics
or to provide a 3-D visual approach to learning geometric shapes in mathematics.
In the Web site links provided below there are some pictures with examples
of the 3-D shapes. You can also find information about Kawasaki's Theorem
and directions on how to make your own geometric origami shapes from square
pieces of paper or rectangular pieces of paper. Be sure to check it out.</font>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Reading:</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are many, many books written about
origami. There are books that give you instructions on how to make origami
and there are stories about characters and their relation to origami. Here
are a couple of examples of books you may want to read.</font>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Communication:</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Since origami is popular almost all over
the world it would be a great topic to discuss when meeting new people
from other countries.&nbsp; Would you like to become an electronic pen
pal with someone in Japan? A great way to open your discussion with your
new pen pal might be to talk about your hobbies and perhaps even origami.
Many people in Japan enjoy origami. If you would like to have an internet
e-mail pen pal from Japan, let Ms. Waltke know. If enough students are
interested in having pen pals, the class can be signed up for that opportunity.
Be sure to speak up soon though.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Fashion:</font></b>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know that a folded paper fan can
be considered origami by definition? Fans are popular fashion items in
Asia during the summer when the weather is very hot and humid. They are
also popular as decorations for the home. Patterns of oragami cranes are
also very popular in fabrics used for the traditional clothing fashions
of Japanese <i>kimono</i> and <i>yukata, </i>as well as in scarves, on
handbags, on shirts, dresses and skirts. Below are examples of a fan, a
<i>kimono
</i>and
an <i>obi</i> (or belt) for a <i>yukata</i>:</font>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Many people enjoy origami, and the more
that they practice, the better their paper folding skills become. This

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">The story of Sadako Sasaki is world renoun
and over time has become associated with the origami cranes as a symbol
of world peace. Every year in Hiroshima, Japan people gather in Hiroshima
Peace Park on the anniversary of the day the atom bomb was dropped on the
city during World War II (August 6, 1945). They gather to mourn the losses
of those who died and pray for the world to achieve peace. But how to the
origami cranes fit into this tradition? It has to do with Sadako. Click
