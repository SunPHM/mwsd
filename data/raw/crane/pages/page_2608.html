	<META name="description" value="The Lewis and Clark Rediscovery Project: Life-Long Learning Online (L3) invites you to interactively experience the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the 200 years of change since the Expedition, and the Mars mission that expands upon the foundation created by the explorers of the past. Multiple perspectives are contained within the site, including Native American, historical, and scientific. We encourage you to review the philosophical foundations of these perspectives, and engage in one or more of the four main journeys. ">

of corn. The corn was called by the name of the water 
bird which represented it, and a prayer was made to 
the Old Woman Who Never Dies through these birds. The 
birds going south were supposed to carry these prayers 
to their mistress, and in this dance each old woman 
made a sacrifice of some valuable article&quot; (Will and 
Spinden, 1906:145).</p>

<blockquote>
<p> &quot;The hunters usually went to the Bad Lands 
to hunt them. There a pit was dug in some likely place. 
Bait of small pieces of meat was scattered about, after 
which the hunter concealed himself in the pit, dragging 
over the top a covering of branches with bait upon them. 
Then he waited patiently, often for a day or more 'till 
a bird should alight on the branches; as soon as this 
happened the bird was grasped and pulled down into the 
pit where it was dispatched and the hunter waited for 
another&quot; (Will and Spinden, 1906:121-22).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first snows signaled the time for hunting buffalo, 
antelope, elk, deer, and bighorns. Small groups of hunters, 
under the leadership of the Soldier Band (Mandan), would 
go out until they had meat to bring back to the village, 
where it was distributed throughout the community. The 
Mandans stayed close to home on these hunting expeditions, 
whereas their Hidatsa neighbors traveled far and wide 
in search of meat. Sometimes they joined their Crow 
cousins on the Yellowstone for bison hunts.</p>
<p>A winter chief was chosen from the successful warriors 
to lead the move to a winter settlement before snow 
covered the ground. Firewood was the most important 
factor in choosing a site, although protection from 
winter winds was also important, as was potable water. 
Where the terraces provided ideal summer village locations, 
winter camps were placed in protected, wooded bottomlands, 
several miles from the summer village.<br>

season began and lasted during the long months of &quot;the 
moon of the seven cold days,&quot; &quot;the moon of 
the rut of wolves,&quot; and &quot;the moon of the sore 
eyes.&quot; Long nights in the lodges were the time

to the success of winter hunting. Calling the Buffalo 
began on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the 
year. Bundle holders and women who were members of the 
Buffalo Cow Society fasted and made sacrifices for the 
successful call. They continued until an adequate supply 
of buffalo gathered near the camp.</p>
<p>The Winter chief was a source of advice and help 
for the whole village, and the successes and failures 
of the winter village were his responsibility. The main 
work of the men during this time of year was hunting 
while the women gathered firewood. The men also restored 
their toolkits and the women prepared clothing and did 
other household chores.</p></td>

<p>The first task for the women when they returned to 
the summer village was to restore the lodges to good 
condition. During &quot;the moon of sowing,&quot; as 
soon as the earth was ready and the Goose Society had 
welcomed the waterbirds home, the old women of the Mandan 
villages danced the second annual Corn Dance, each holding 
an ear of corn on a stick, while old men accompanied 
them with music. The ceremony gave honor to the &quot;Woman 
Who Never Dies,&quot; and through her the corn was blessed 
for planting. The &quot;Woman Who Never Dies&quot; protects 
the plants in winter, and in the spring she helps them 
back to life. The Arikara still honor Mother Corn with 
a bundle opening and prayers for the health of the plants. 
Once the ceremonies had been properly conducted, the 
adult women began tending their gardens, with the help 
of their children.</p>
<p>For centuries, until the construction of <strong><a href="Javascript:openWin('/Sites/ShowOneContent.asp?ContentID=1318','640','480', 'Content')">Garrison 
Dam</a></strong>, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara people 
have planted their gardens along this mighty river. 
The Mandans and Arikara were more dependent upon their 
gardens than the Hidatsa, who planted but also spent 
much of their time on the hunt. All three tribes planted 
corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers in the rich loam 
of the Missouri floodplain, while singing songs passed 
down through the generations. Tobacco, a ritual plant, 
was also planted and harvested, but the women took no 
part in this activity; the sacred tobacco gardens were 
tended only by men.</p>
<p>Prince Maximilian, who, with Karl Bodmer, spent many 
months with the Mandan and Hidatsa in 1833-34, records 
that each family cultivated 12 to 15 acres, divided 
into three fields. They practiced crop rotation when 
the nutrients had been spent. They used digging sticks 
and hoes made of buffalo scapulae to work the soil.</p>
