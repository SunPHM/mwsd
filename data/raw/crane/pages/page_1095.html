<b>What's Doing In San Diego</b>
<br>January 5, 2003, By BARBARA WHITAKER, in New York Times
<p>San Diego, which just a few years ago was best known for its zoo and
its proximity to the Mexican border, keeps growing, offering travelers
an increasingly<img SRC="05diego.2.jpg" BORDER=0 height=250 width=184 align=RIGHT>
<br>diverse mix of things to do and see. Construction cranes dot the skyline,
a new baseball park for the Padres is just over a year from completion
and
<br>revitalization of the historic Gaslamp Quarter continues as restaurants,
hotels and night spots are either opening or being built.
<p>In fact, the only project the city can't seem to get off the ground
these days is a new home for its pro football team, the San Diego Chargers.
So while all eyes are on Qualcomm Stadium for Super Bowl XXXVII on Jan.
26, one of the hot topics around town is the future of the team, because
it has threatened to leave if there is no new stadium.
<p>But for now the city is focused on playing host to its third Super Bowl.
Ten days of special events have been planned around the game, but those
who want to skip
<br>the hubbub have plenty of other choices. They range from San Diego's
70 miles of beaches to Coronado Island, with its small-town feel and its
historic Hotel del
<br>Coronado, to a walk along El Prado in Balboa Park, home to several
museums and the celebrated zoo.
<p>Events
<p>Tickets are of course long gone for the Super Bowl, but there are plenty
of related events (a listing is at www.superbowlxxxvii.org). Because traffic
is always a
<br>problem around San Diego, visitors should use the San Diego Trolley,
www.sdcommute.com, when possible. It serves Qualcomm Stadium and communities
like
<br>Mission Valley and Old Town.
<p>On Jan. 25, the night before kickoff, fireworks will illuminate the
sky over San Diego Bay from 8:30 to 9. Suggested viewing locations include
Harbor Island,
<br>Embarcadero Park North and the Ferry Landing Marketplace in Coronado.
<p>Legoland, (760) 918-5346 or www.legolandca.com, is featuring Family
Huddle at its theme park in nearby Carlsbad, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
Jan. 23. The event,
<br>with appearances by National Football League players, includes a football-themed
Lego Building Event with master model builders, music by Jessica Simpson,
and a
<br>fashion show with entertainers and athletes and their children. The
park is about 30 minutes from downtown on Interstate 5 north to the Cannon
Road exit. Head east and follow the signs. Admission, $41.95.
<p>The Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade starts at 10 a.m. on Jan. 18 at
the County Administration Building and runs south on Harbor Drive to Seaport
Village on the
<br>bay; www.seaportvillage.com. It coincides with the Downtown San Diego
Multicultural Festival 2003, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., on Martin Luther King Jr.
Promenade (north side of Harbor Drive between Market and Fourth Avenue),
a street fair with entertainment, food and merchandise.
<p>The NFL Experience, an interactive theme park with 50 games and attractions,
where fans can try out their passing skills with games like Quarterback
Challenge,
<br>will be open Jan. 18 and 19 and Jan. 23 to 26 in South Embarcadero
Marina Park, next to the San Diego Convention Center. General admission,
$15.
<p>The museums in Balboa Park, just minutes from downtown, are host to
several events. "Silk and Silver: Festival Adornment of Guizhou, China,"
which features
<br>clothing and body decorations from city festivals, is at the Mingei
International Museum through spring 2003; (619) 239-0003, www.mingei.org.
An IMAX film at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, (619) 238-1233, www.rhfleet.org,
"Jane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees," covers more than 40 years of fieldwork
in Africa. Admission $6.75, extra for IMAX shows. A $55 package (a discount
of nearly 50 percent) includes the zoo, 13 of the park's museums and the
Japanese Friendship Garden; available at (619) 232-2054 or www.balboapark.org.
<p>Sightseeing
<p>As big as some of the Super Bowl participants will be, they still risk
being upstaged by the annual migration of the gray whales, which reaches
a peak this month
<br>through much of March. A number of cruises are offered from the harbor,
1050 North Harbor Drive, among them San Diego Harbor Excursion, (619) 234-4111,
<br>www.sdhe.com, which features naturalists from the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography in La Jolla. The three-hour cruise is $25, ages 4 to 12,
$15. Or you can
<br>watch the whales free from a sheltered point in Cabrillo National Park
on Point Loma, southwest of downtown.&nbsp;<img SRC="05diego.3.jpg" height=277 width=184 align=LEFT>
<p>The Birch Aquarium at Scripps, 2300 Expedition Way in La Jolla, (858)
534-3474, www.aquarium.ucsd.edu, about a 15-minute drive north of downtown
off Interstate 5, is also offering special exhibits and lectures at its
Whalefest, which is included in the general admission, $9.50. Open daily
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
<p>For those who prefer to watch whales in an amphitheater, SeaWorld, (619)
226-3901, www.seaworld.com, in Mission Bay has plenty of marine life, including
10 killer whales that perform daily, and activities like behind-the-scenes
tours ($10, children $8) to see firsthand the care, feeding and training
of the animals. General
<br>admission, $45.
<p>The real beauty of a stay in San Diego is exploring its many neighborhoods.
The city's birthplace, Old Town, which runs along San Diego Avenue north
of downtown, provides an array of Latin American goods at Bazaar del Mundo
(2754 Calhoun). Presidio Park is where Father Junípero Serra established
his first mission here in 1769. To eat or drink your way through history,
visit the downtown Gaslamp Quarter (they say Wyatt Earp once operated three
gambling halls here), which has an increasing number of restaurants and
bars in Victorian buildings. For more about the city's beginnings, Cabrillo
National Monument at the tip of Point Loma, (619) 557-5450, www.nps.gov/cabr,
has "Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo and the Age of Exploration" in its museum
to commemorate the 460th anniversary of an expedition from Mexico up the
coast to what is now California. Open daily; admission $5 a vehicle.
<p>There are free beaches for all tastes in and around the city. They range
from funky Ocean Beach to La Jolla Shores, 8200 Camino del Oro, a picture-perfect
<br>milelong stretch in one of San Diego's most affluent areas. Parking
is at the foot of Calle Frescota next to the lifeguard tower.
<p>Where to Stay
<p>People with Super Bowl tickets but no room reservations should look
north: with more than 100,000 hotel rooms in Los Angeles County, finding
one should not be a
<br>problem.
<p>If hipness is the goal, W San Diego, 421 West B Street, (619) 231-8220,
fax (619) 231-5779, opened downtown last month, with 261 rooms including
16 spacious Cool Corner rooms, where corner windows offer expansive views
of the city. The décor is sleek and contemporary, with 16 one- or two-bedroom
suites. The rooftop bar has a heated sand floor, fire pit and private tented
cabanas, as well as an open-air fitness area. Doubles start at $205, and
go up to $949 for a suite.
<p>A world away on a narrow spit of land on Coronado, the Loews Coronado
Bay Resort, 4000 Coronado Bay Road, (619) 424-4000, fax (619) 424-4400,
<br>www.loewscoronadobay.com, has stylish, comfortable rooms that offer
at least a partial view of the bay or one of three pools. There are two
whirlpools and an
<br>80-slip private marina where visitors can rent everything from Wave
Runners to bicycles. Pets are welcome. Doubles range from $265 to $440.
<p>Budget: Rooms are small at La Pensione Hotel, 606 West Date Street,
(619) 236-8000, fax (619) 236-8088, www.lapensionehotel.com, but the hotel,
halfway through a renovation, is conveniently placed near downtown in Little
Italy. Some rooms have views of San Diego Bay and others overlook downtown.
All rooms have refrigerators, color television with cable, and private
bath. Doubles: $75.
<p>Luxury: Built in 1970, the stately Westgate Hotel, 1055 Second Avenue,
(800) 221-3802, fax (619) 557-3737, www.westgatehotel.com, feels more like
an
<br>18th-century palace, with a lobby that is a re-creation of an anteroom
at Versailles, including Baccarat crystal chandeliers, Aubusson tapestries
and period antiques.
<br>The hotel has 223 rooms, and suites with more than 400 square feet.
They are elegantly decorated, with antique chairs and fine linens. Doubles
range from $239 to
<br>$339.
<p>La Valencia Hotel, 1132 Prospect Street, La Jolla, (800) 451-0772, fax
(858) 456-3921, www.lavalencia.com, perched dramatically over La Jolla
Cove, has built on
<br>its Mediterranean charm, adding 16 villas with 400 to 1,200 square
feet in 2000. Many of the 100 rooms and suites have ocean views (although
some visitors call
<br>them small for the price), but the villas take center stage these days.
Most have fireplaces and ocean views; the overall décor of villas and hotel
combines casual
<br>elegance with oversize furniture, Italian marble floors and Mexican
tile accents. Room rates start at $275, suites at $750, villas from $775
to $3,500.
<p>Where to Eat
<p>For harbor views and a casual atmosphere (child friendly, although crowded),
the Fish Market, 750 North Harbor Drive, (619) 232-3474, is a good choice.
It serves a wide range of fresh seafood (there is a fish market at the
front of the restaurant). The lunch menu ranges from a cup of clam chowder
for $3.50 to oysters on the
<br>half shell starting at $7.95 to cioppino ($19.75) to entrees like Pacific
red snapper ($8.95). Lunch for two with wine, under $50. Open daily for
lunch and dinner.
<p>El Agave Tequileria, 2304 San Diego Avenue in Old Town, (619) 220-0692,
claims that it stocks more than 800 tequilas. The cozy, wood-beamed restaurant
has a
<br>variety of Mexican selections. Starters range from three quesadillas
del pueblo ($6.75) to an ancient Aztec dish, canneloni huitlacoche ($13.25),
made with Mexico's
<br>renowned corn fungus. Seafood specialties include shrimp in a chili
oil served on a bed of beans, rice and nopal ($24.75). The menu includes
a variety of mole dishes
<br>for around $16. With wine two can easily spend $100. Lunch and dinner
daily.
<p>Sammy's Woodfired Pizza, 770 Fourth Avenue in the Gaslamp Quarter, (619)
230-8888, is a local favorite that built its reputation on such offerings
as smoked duck
<br>sausage pizza ($9.75). Besides pies, the menu includes grilled shrimp
salad ($12.50) to entrees like grilled bratwurst ($9.95). Two can eat for
about $40 with wine.
<br>There are six branches in the San Diego area, including ones in La
Jolla and Del Mar. Lunch and dinner daily.
<p>The Third Corner Restaurant, 2265 Bacon Street, (619) 223-2700, is a
new favorite, a romantic haunt that takes its name from the fact that it
is the third restaurant
<br>that the owner, Ed Moore, has opened on a corner. This one is on West
Point Loma Boulevard and Bacon Street in Ocean Beach, northwest of downtown.
Starters
<br>include a goat cheese salad ($7) and a wild mushroom strudel for $10.
Paella is a standard; another derivative is a swordfish filet with braised
fennel, haricots verts,
<br>scallions, oven-dried tomatoes and capers in a rich wine sauce ($24).
Dinner for two with a bottle of wine is just over $100. Open daily for
dinner only.
<p>For inexpensive fare, there is Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill with its
Baja fish tacos. What started as a simple stand at 4504 East Mission Bay
Drive, (858) 272-2801,
<br>has grown into a chain with 142 locations in six states. An original
fish taco costs $1.89, but there is a variety of other offerings from grilled
chicken tacos ($2.35) to
<br>the lobster combo, a lobster burrito that includes a fish taco, beans
and chips ($6.50). Beer is available. Open daily for lunch and dinner.
