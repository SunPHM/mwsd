        was awakened around 5:00 a.m. by the soft groan of the stair steps of 
        the century old prairie farm house turned lodge. Ted Mertz, the owner 
        and primary guide, had come up to rap on each bedroom door and speak 
        softly of the need to rise and greet the new day. I dug a little deeper 
        into my quilt covered bed as footsteps and voices of my partners picked 
        up cadence. After the necessary duties of rising were taken care of, I 
        layered on my water fowling gear. I saved the boots and last layer for a 
        wrestling match after coffee and one of those homemade cinnamon rolls 
        Patty Mertz, Ted's mom, had just pulled from the oven. I could see that 
        the guides had the trucks running and were outside scraping the frost 
        from the truck's windows. They made sure everyone had shells and cased 
        guns. They gave quiet guidance to those in our group who had never 
        experienced field goose hunting, North Dakota style. </font> </p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm sure the questions 
          were common to them, but they were glad to answer them in full every 
          time. We were prepared to hunt in full camouflage with the gear we brought. 
          The guides handed out white ponchos and all white knit pullover toboggans 
          with fleece face masks. There was no snow on the ground. This was definitely 
          going to be different than the fully heated pit blinds along the Mississippi 
          River or in Maryland. Walking outside and feeling the chilly air got 
          everyone real excited and the banter turned to friendly kidding and 
          inside jokes.</font></p>
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
        <img border="0" src="images/hunt_for_cranes.jpg" align="right" width="221" height="180">Ted 
        led the progression in his Suburban pulling a goose decoy laden trailer. 
        All eyes focused on the gravel road ahead as Ted casually drove into the 
        complete darkness. I was stricken by how small our world seemed in the 
        darkness compared to our awe of the great expanse we experienced upon 
        arrival yesterday afternoon. We rattled along for about 10 minutes when 
        Ted slowed and began studying the side of the road. It all looked the 
        same to us, but Ted and his partner had scouted a field where thousands 
        of geese were feeding just the evening before. We were going to setup 
        in that very spot this morning. </font> </div>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      We pulled out into 
        a barley field that had been worked earlier in the fall. The barley that 
        was missed by the combine, reseeded and sprouted. This turned the entire 
        field into a green carpet. Perfect for the grazing abilities of the snow 
        and Canadian geese in the area. It was strange to head the truck out onto, what 
        appeared in the head lights, as a yard or golf course. The beams reached 
        out across the field. It was huge. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      <img border="0" src="images/duck_hunter_bag_limit.jpg" align="left" width="198" height="284">The guides spoke of 
        a draw here, a rise there, and the positioning of the evening flock. I 
        was still amazed by their ability to navigate on the gravel roads in the 
        inky darkness, let alone picking out subtle features in this field. The 
        trailing truck began to swing wide and the Suburban stopped. The spot 
        was cross lit by headlights of the trucks forty-five degrees to each other. 
        We clambered out and stood waiting for orders. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      Ted grabbed the first big bag of decoy heads and others followed suit. 
      Soon, we had all the decoy bodies piled high in the headlights. Some of us 
      built the decoys by mounting the heads with a quarter turn, while others 
      followed the guides to the perimeters of the spread, carrying as many 
      decoys as arms and layers of clothes would allow. The decoy shells weren't 
      heavy, just awkward. We put them out quickly with everyone pitching in. 
      The early morning exercise was welcome, as the air was chilly to any 
      exposed skin. We unloaded our gunning gear and thermoses from the trucks. 
      The guides issued a thick close cell pad for each of us to rest on. They 
      gave last minute assistance to position each hunter, reminding everyone of 
      the safety issues involved with
      <img border="0" src="images/sandhill_crane.jpg" align="right" width="162" height="229">five 
      to six hunters sitting a few yards from each other with birds swirling all 
      about. We donned on our white ponchos and head coverings. They said they 
      would take the trucks out of the field and be back in time for the first 
      flights. After the trucks were out of sight I was amazed by the total 
      silence that fell over us. Like a flock of birds in the dark, everyone 
      quieted down to listen to it. It was the first time during our trip that 
      the prairie had such an effect on us. It would not be the last. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      The basic order of 
        events would have ducks buzz the decoys, right at the onset of shooting 
        light. They may pour in by the hundreds. Some of them may even land in 
        the decoys, wondering why all the goose calls and sightings seemed somehow 
        not quite right. The geese being late risers, would come off their roosting 
        water in small numbers and build the confidence of the flock by swirling 
        up and then landing back on the water. This would repeat until the whole 
        flock would rise and spread out over the land to feed. If they found the 
        setup to be located in the right spot, without any hunters being spotted 
        from movement or shape, they would offer up some world class shooting 
        opportunities. Then we'd pack up and go back to the lodge for a huge breakfast 
        and all sorts of true stories of the hunt. For the entire time of our 
        stay, it happened pretty close to this script. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was impressed with 
        the variety of the hunting. We setup in different fields as the birds 
        moved from our pressure or changes in weather. When a new flock moved 
        into the area, the guides would find out what fields they were working 
        and we'd get a chance at them. There was no doubt that it was goose hunting 
        and not goose shooting. The birds were still wary of hunter movement and 
        sounds that didn't belong in the decoy spread. There was one day of our 
        four day hunt where the weather got down right nasty, with high winds 
        and frozen rain. The ducks and geese came to our setup with reckless abandon. 
        It was world class hunting. Every day we saw migrating birds by the thousands. 
        All the hype of the waterfowl come back in North America was substantiated 
        beyond comprehension. Even the guides would make commentary of the sheer 
        quantities of birds in flight. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The breakfast after 
        the morning hunt was literally  all-you-can-eat and &quot;no one 
        ever even remotely went hungry.&quot;&nbsp; We were served heaping plates of pancakes, 
      French toast, eggs over easy; and omelets loaded 
        with fresh veggies. The venison sausage was a favorite with our group. 
        We had one individual who requested in advance that his special diet be 
        honored. It was, and he ate like a king during his stay. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next order of 
        the day was to let the food hit bottom and relax for a couple of hours. 
        Some cleaned guns and gear, while I caught a well deserved nap. After 
        all, I was on vacation. The guides prepared for the afternoon 
        hunt and took care of the morning take. </font></p>
