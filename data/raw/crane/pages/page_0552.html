He and I had corresponded now and then, butI'd never met him in person.&nbsp; Bill grew up in Ames and visits herein Iowa a couple of times a year.&nbsp; His stay just happened to overlapby one day the UP steam loco's trip across his home state.<p>I left Indianola around 7:45.&nbsp; We had a warm, overcast morning,75 degrees with a dew point to match.&nbsp; Since I was to meet Bill atthe Ames depot at 10:00, I had time to do a little scouting first.&nbsp;I got to the elevators at Jordan in one hour.&nbsp; An empty autorack trainwas parked at the highway crossing with UP 4855 and 4150 on the point.&nbsp;In the Boone yard, I spotted three coal loads and a manifest, the latterled by 4652 and 6745.<p>I next drove out under the high bridge.&nbsp; A friend had commenteda few days ago that "You'll probably have to be there at dawn to get aseat.", but there was no one around but but the people who've been workingon the center span.&nbsp; From the scanner I learned that maintenance peoplehad the bridge until 11:00 and that once opened, it would be under a 20mph speed restriction.&nbsp; I circled back for another look at the yard.&nbsp;The UP had barricaded off the entrances and set up a generous parking areawhere the yard office used to be.&nbsp; There was a long line of porta-pottiesready, and people were busy setting up concessions - looked like this wasgoing to be a real circus!<p>I got back to Ames with about 15 minutes to spare and worked on thecrossword puzzle until I spotted a car with a Texas plate circling thelot.&nbsp; After introducing ourselves, Bill grabbed his camera and wegot in the Jeep.&nbsp; We went back to Boone, drove around for a whileand discussed whether we wanted to go west and try to chase the train backto the Kate Shelley Bridge.&nbsp; By now there was one other vehicle parkedon the hill southwest of the bridge, so we pulled in behind.&nbsp; Around10:45 we heard someone on the radio say that the steam train was "15 minutesout of Dennison", and concluded that they were running well ahead of schedule.&nbsp;The UP's published version called for a 1:30 arrival in Boone, but it appearedthat they could easily beat that time, so we decided to just stay on thehill.<p>While we waited, I just took pictures of the rail traffic across thebridge.&nbsp; At 11:00 there was an eastbound stack train powered by UP<a href="Challenger061002/UP4096.jpeg">4096and 4728</a>.&nbsp; As you can see in the picture, there was quite a bitof moisture in the air. <a href="Challenger061002/buffs2.jpeg">Anotherstacker</a> followed just a few minutes later with <a href="Challenger061002/UP4679.jpeg">UP4679, 9200 and 9244</a> (note the bridgeworkers getting into position towatch the steamer).&nbsp; By now there were <a href="Challenger061002/buffs1.jpeg">vehiclesand people</a> starting to <a href="Challenger061002/buffs3.jpeg">accumulatealong the gravel</a> as well as lots of traffic on the road beside us.&nbsp;In spite of the humid weather, the road was quite dry, and we endured greatclouds of dust with every passing car.<p>About this time, some wag came on the radio and said, "Did you hearthat they've decided to park that steam train in Carroll overnight?"&nbsp;The reply was, "No, I didn't hear that..."&nbsp; I'm sure he expected tosee gravel flying, but it didn't work.&nbsp; Actually, the great majorityof the people watching for the train were not hard-core train buffs anddidn't have scanners or other such gear.&nbsp; We were even asked whichway the train would be going.&nbsp; The turnout of "lay persons" was largelydue to publicity on WHO AM radio by "Van and Bonnie".&nbsp; These two hadmanaged to get a cab ride on the steam loco in exchange for the publicityand the trade worked very well.<p>At 11:25 we had our first <a href="Challenger061002/train1.jpeg">westbound</a>,<a href="Challenger061002/UP4245.jpeg">UP4245</a>, 9226 and 7506 with containers.&nbsp; Currently, even though thebridge has two tracks, it is operated only one direction at a time.&nbsp;The <a href="Challenger061002/bridgework.jpeg">work on the center section</a>is to strengthen that span so that the rails can be operated simultaneously.&nbsp;A second <a href="Challenger061002/train2.jpeg">westbound</a> followedat 11:40, covered hoppers behind <a href="Challenger061002/UP9723.jpeg">UP9723</a> and 2376.<p>The <a href="Challenger061002/buffs4.jpeg">crowd</a> and the dust thickenedas we approached noon.&nbsp; <a href="Challenger061002/RichnBill.jpeg">Bill(on the right)</a> and I were joined by Rich Ketcham, an Ames railfan thatI'd met back in March while covering the Story City derailment.&nbsp; At11:56 a third westbound stack train, with <a href="Challenger061002/UP8528.jpeg">UP8528</a> and 8551, took the bridge.&nbsp; The last train ahead of the steamerwas next, eastbound <a href="Challenger061002/UPY711.jpeg">UPY 711</a>and UP 404 with <a href="Challenger061002/UPY711going.jpeg">six coveredhoppers</a>.<p>12:05 - the bridgework people have used their <a href="Challenger061002/crane.jpeg">crane</a>to raise a gondola with three persons up over the bridge.&nbsp; Otherssimply stand on the south main (left-handed running is the standard here).<p>12:07 - a <a href="Challenger061002/buffs5.jpeg">horde of buffs</a>on foot comes over the hill behind us with their tripods and cameras, presumablythose who've been chasing the Challenger in from the west.&nbsp; I disconnectmy scanner's external speaker as a courtesy to those taping.&nbsp; Notthat anyone's trying to be quiet anyway - in the Durango in front of us,the woman in the driver's seat does something to set off her car alarmand can't get it shut off.&nbsp; She eventually opens the door and getsout of the car.&nbsp; That seems to do the trick and the Dodge stops honkingat us.<p>12:11 - <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985a.jpeg">there she is</a>!&nbsp;Rolling out <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985b.jpeg">over the haze</a> inthe Des Moines River valley.&nbsp; I attempt to make some video with thedigital camera, but the results are not pretty.&nbsp; Wait for it, I gotsome good stuff later!&nbsp; After watching the <a href="Challenger061002/wholetrain.jpeg">wholetrain</a> cross the bridge, Bill and I join the parade going down underthe bridge, across the river and uphill on the gravel into Boone.<p>I didn't expect to see the train again until we reached the yard, butwhen the dust cleared at the top of the hill, there they were, barely moving.&nbsp;The parade turned south and most stopped to watch the train pass at a gradecrossing.&nbsp; Two of us grabbed the empty (and blocked by the train)left lane and turned onto a road that parallels the rails down to DivisionStreet.&nbsp; In front, trying to pace the loco and take pictures out ofhis passenger window at the same time, is railroad artist Stewart Buck.&nbsp;Just in case he's making video, I give him a little Jeep horn to recordand go around.<p>I instruct Bill, "I'm going to stop right behind that van - get yourcamera ready...&nbsp; Okay, bail!"&nbsp; Stu returns the honks, pointingout that I've left my door open.&nbsp; We're on what should be the shadyside of the rails, but there's a good overcast and the <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985c.jpeg">shotsof 3985</a> turn out <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985d.jpeg">just fine</a>.&nbsp;We benefit from there being lots of strangers in town - most of the crowdturns north toward the Boone and Scenic Valley depot.&nbsp; We wait forthe special to pass and then head east on the first street south of therails.<p>Soon we were ahead of the train again.&nbsp; I drove into the companylot east of the new yard office and we got a few <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985e.jpeg">morepictures</a> as the <a href="Challenger061002/cabpersonnel.jpeg">head end</a>moved slowly <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985f.jpeg">toward the yard</a>.&nbsp;Each side of the loco apparently had a sun-glasses-equipped, designatedstarer.&nbsp; I recognized one on the <a href="Challenger061002/jsmith.jpeg">fireman'sside</a>, John Smith, UP MOP out of Marshalltown.&nbsp; The man on the<a href="Challenger061002/eyeball.jpeg">engineer'sside</a> did an especially thorough job on us as the cab passed.<p>We moved next to the yard where the <a href="Challenger061002/UP3985g.jpeg">bigloco</a> and its train were pulled slowly around a curve to the southeast.&nbsp;Here's the consist:<blockquote>UP 3985<br><a href="Challenger061002/tender1.jpeg">Oil tender</a><br>Two <a href="Challenger061002/tender2.jpeg">water tender</a>s<br><a href="Challenger061002/artlockman.jpeg">Art Lockman</a> (baggage)<br>Howard Fogg 209 (Generator car)<br>Sherman Hill (baggage)<br>Portland Rose 5473<br>City of Salina 5486<br><a href="Challenger061002/columbine.jpeg">Columbine</a> 7001 (domecar)<br>Sunshine Special 5480<br>Council Bluffs 5769 (baggage)<br>Texas Eagle 5483<br><a href="Challenger061002/challengercar.jpeg">Challenger</a> 7015 (domecar)<br>Katy Flyer 5468<br>Generator car 207<br><a href="Challenger061002/UP104car.jpeg">North Platte</a> 104 (observationcar)</blockquote>Here and there one could spot <a href="Challenger061002/passengers.jpeg">passengers</a>on the train, but for the most part the cars appeared to be unoccupied.&nbsp;A cut was made in the consist and the front portion pulled down.&nbsp;The front half of train did not quite clear a switch, so it was recoupledand cut again, with two additional cars left behind.&nbsp; Eventually adiesel was used to set the rear portion to another track.&nbsp; <a href="Challenger061002/MrLee1.jpeg">Pullingpins</a>, throwing switches and going into the <a href="Challenger061002/redzone.jpeg">"RedZone"</a> today was <a href="Challenger061002/MrLee3.jpeg">Mr. Steve Lee</a>,director of the <a href="Challenger061002/shield.jpeg">steam program</a>for the Union Pacific.&nbsp; Steve was carrying his <a href="Challenger061002/cigar.jpeg">trademarkcigar</a> and was happy to talk to some of the <a href="Challenger061002/MrLee2.jpeg">senior"foamers"</a> and even have his picture taken.<p>Here are a couple of video clips of the Challenger pulling into theyard.&nbsp; Now and then you can hear the rails creaking and popping underthe weight of the 4-6-6-4.&nbsp; <a href="ChallengerMovies/yard1.mov">Video1</a> (3.7 Meg .MOV file), <a href="ChallengerMovies/yard2.mov">Video 2</a>(4.3 Meg .MOV file)<p>They tied up just after 1:00.&nbsp; Almost before the <a href="Challenger061002/plate.jpeg">bigloco</a> had stopped, a line of people had formed to have a <a href="Challenger061002/stairs.jpeg">lookin the cab</a> and marvel at the size of this amazing piece of <a href="Challenger061002/cylinder.jpeg">machinery</a>.&nbsp;Bill and I hung around for a while to get more pictures and then went outto have some lunch and head back to Ames.<br><hr WIDTH="100%"><h3>Tuesday, June 11</h3>Tuesday opened early with a light shower, still pretty warm but betterthan Monday.&nbsp; I was on the road at 5:45 a.m. in order to pick up DaveHarvey in Urbandale.&nbsp; Dave handles the O Gauge stuff at work and heand I have visited many times over the hobby shop counter.&nbsp; When wewere talking about the Challenger visit to Iowa he asked if we could gettogether for some steam chasing and I happily agreed.&nbsp; I picked upDave at 6:30 and we drove northwest out of Urbandale, taking Hwy. 17 toBoone.<p>Even at 7:00 in the morning, there was already a <a href="Challenger061102/buffs1.jpeg">largecrowd</a> at the yard to see the <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985a.jpeg">locomotive</a>and watch it leave town.&nbsp; 3985 was parked on a curve and this morningI was able to get a good shot of the articulated loco's <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985b.jpeg">boileroverhang</a>.&nbsp; WHO's "Van and Bonnie" were on hand, with <a href="Challenger061102/bonnie.jpeg">Bonnie</a>creating screams from the audience as she tried out <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985.wav">thewhistle</a>.&nbsp; Dave was recognized by the radio talent, Hobby Havenbeing one of their advertisers, and got called over for a short on-airinterview.<p>Scheduled departure was 8:00, and when we saw the rear end of the trainbeing pulled back into position we moved out east of Boone to get picturesas they left the yard.&nbsp; We found a parking spot near Jordan amidsthundreds of others who also wanted to see and hear the engine pass by.&nbsp;It turned out to be over an hour before the steamer left the yard.&nbsp;In the meantime, we had West Central Elevator's <a href="Challenger061102/WestCentral.jpeg">GeeP</a>and <a href="Challenger061102/critter.jpeg">critter</a>, knocking aroundcovered hoppers for entertainment.<p>Dave and I both failed to correctly interpret a flashing icon on hiscamera and concluded that it wasn't working.&nbsp; I loaned him my olderOlympus 2500 while I used the 2100.&nbsp; Below you will find picturestaken by both of us.&nbsp; His will be marked with the credit, "DH" whereit's not obvious from the text that he took them.&nbsp; The video clips,by the way, are from the 2100.&nbsp; I set up the external speaker on theJeep again so that we could keep track of the dispatcher's radio conversationswhile we <a href="Challenger061102/dick.jpeg">watched for 3895</a> (DH)to start moving our way.<p>The dispatcher brought plenty of traffic by as <a href="Challenger061102/buffsdave1.jpeg">weall waited</a> (DH).&nbsp; At 8:00 we had a westbound stack train, a two-flaggerwith new SD-70's <a href="Challenger061102/UP4948.jpeg">UP 4948</a> and<a href="Challenger061102/UP4908.jpeg">4908</a>.&nbsp;Next up was light power hustling eastward, two CNW patches, <a href="Challenger061102/UP408.jpeg">UP408</a> and <a href="Challenger061102/UP405.jpeg">405</a>.<p>At 8:15 we had a CWEX coal load pulled by <a href="Challenger061102/UP8067.jpeg">UP8067</a> and 7093.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later there were empty autoracksbehind <a href="Challenger061102/UP4546.jpeg">UP 4546</a> and <a href="Challenger061102/UP2908.jpeg">2908</a>,with <a href="Challenger061102/UP4864.jpeg">UP 4864</a>, 4061 and 4358right on their taillight pulling more containers.<p>We'd enjoyed a short shot of sunshine, but by 9:00, it was getting verydark in the west and we could see some lightning on the horizon.&nbsp;The last train ahead of the steamer was another intermodal, pulled by <a href="Challenger061102/UP4942.jpeg">UP4942</a>, 4468 and 8852 (SP patch).&nbsp; The dark western sky is prettynoticeable in both <a href="Challenger061102/UP4942dave.jpeg">Dave's</a>and my shots of this train.<p>Just after 9:00 we finally spotted <a href="Challenger061102/smoke.jpeg">smokeover the yard</a> and knew that 3985 was headed our way.&nbsp; I got onestill image as the <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985c.jpeg">Challenger approached</a>and then switched the Oly 2100 to video.&nbsp; Dave got several shots asthe train <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave1.jpeg">approached</a>, <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave2.jpeg">passedin front</a> of us and blasted <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave3.jpeg">bythe elevators</a> at Jordan.&nbsp; Here's the <a href="ChallengerMovies/boone.mov">video</a>:(7.5 Meg .MOV file).<p>We'd planned ahead to try to beat the train to another spot somewheredown the line to the east, so we joined the long parade of vehicles headingfor Hwy. 30, where we could all run at least 65 mph.&nbsp; From the radiowe knew that 3985 would be stopping in Ames to "drop two passengers", Vanand Bonnie, I assume.&nbsp; The chasers were in luck this morning as trafficon Main 1 (eastbound here) started encountering signal problems and hadto slow to restricted speed.<p>We had no problem beating several of the trains we'd seen outside ofBoone to our next stop, "Devil's Hollow".&nbsp; The Hollow is a point onthe UP where the old CNW mainlines pass over the former Rock Island route,today known as the "Spine Line".&nbsp; This railroad bridge is mixed inwith two highway bridges where old Hwy. 30 (today E-41) goes over the Spineand then under the CNW.&nbsp; Oh, and there's a creek flowing through here,too, just to add visual variety.<p>At 9:45 we caught a westbound piggyback train passing over the highwaybridge.&nbsp; On the point were <a href="Challenger061102/UP9485.jpeg">UP9485</a> and <a href="Challenger061102/hollow1.jpeg">4429</a>.&nbsp; Justa couple of minutes later we saw <a href="Challenger061102/hollow2.jpeg">8067</a>again.&nbsp; By this time the <a href="Challenger061102/skydave.jpeg">sky</a>(DH) was starting to look very "interesting" out here.&nbsp; Just after10:00, we had a <a href="Challenger061102/rain.jpeg">downpour</a>.&nbsp;Fortunately, it didn't last very long.&nbsp; By 10:25 all the <a href="Challenger061102/buffs2.jpeg">buffs</a>were out on the road again and watching the <a href="Challenger061102/norain.jpeg">railtraffic</a>.<p>Westbounds were coming through at normal speed while the eastbounderswere still apparently experiencing signal problems.&nbsp; At 10:41 we hada WEPX coal empty behind <a href="Challenger061102/UP7226.jpeg">UP 7226</a>and <a href="Challenger061102/SP228.jpeg">SP 228</a>.&nbsp; Just nine minutesbehind was a CWEX empty led by <a href="Challenger061102/UP6803.jpeg">UP6803</a> and 8091 (one of these was DP, but I didn't catch the rear unitor which train).&nbsp; While waiting, we discussed the probability thatthere would be a westbound on the bridges when 3985 passed.&nbsp; Therehad been a brief discussion on the radio of moving 3985 over to Main 2,but it was now obvious that we were seeing a rerun of the Boone trafficand that the steamer was on the north track.&nbsp; All we could do is hopethat there wouldn't be a train on the south rail at the same time.<p>The <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985d.jpeg">Challenger</a> got to theHollow right at 11:00 - on the original schedule this was the time fortheir service stop in Cedar Rapids, and they were still moving at restrictedspeed behind several other trains.&nbsp; I got two quick shots of the <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985e.jpeg">engineon the railroad overpass</a> and then switched to <a href="ChallengerMovies/hollow.mov">video</a>(4.8 Meg .MOV file) again for the highway bridge.&nbsp; Dave got stillimages, including this nice one <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave4.jpeg">onthe highway bridge</a>.<p>Challenger's entourage of fans was off and running again, this timein a sort of "low speed chase" mode.&nbsp; We ended up near the rear ofseveral dozen cars, but the head of the line gradually out-paced the steamloco and after a while we found ourselves in position to get a <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave5.jpeg">fewshots</a> (DH) as the engine rolled <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave6.jpeg">slowlythrough the fields</a> (DH) west of Colo.&nbsp; I love this one of the<a href="Challenger061102/horsesdave.jpeg">horses</a>(DH).<p>I decided to go for a spot on the gravel just east of State Center forour next photo stop.&nbsp; The rest of the crowd in front of us seemedto have thinned out, either going for grade crossings or perhaps hurryingahead to Marshalltown.&nbsp; The last vehicle remaining in front of us,a Firebird that had made a 5-point turnaround back at the Hollow, abruptlyturned south onto&nbsp; a "Level B" road, with the recent deluge quitemuddy, and nearly failed to stop before sliding into the ditch.<p>We pulled away from 3985 and passed the 4942, still moving at restrictedspeed, just east of Clear Creek.&nbsp; When we got to the gravel crossingI'd picked out east of State Center, there were just a few locals and theirimpatient children waiting for the train.&nbsp; One other load of fansin one of those little toy SUV's showed up after us but parked in frontof the Jeep (Bad Buff etiquette, but it was that kind of day).<p><a href="Challenger061102/UP4942b.jpeg">4942</a> came by just before11:30, <a href="Challenger061102/UP4942dave2.jpeg">accelerating</a> (DH)as it went by us.&nbsp; This gave me a chance to get some shots of the<a href="Challenger061102/UP8852a.jpeg">SPunit</a> as it <a href="Challenger061102/UP8852b.jpeg">passed the gradecrossing</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently the signal trouble had cleared up,so we knew we'd have to really move it if we were to catch the steam trainagain.&nbsp; At 11:42 we could see the <a href="Challenger061102/smoke2.jpeg">smoke</a>as the <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave7.jpeg">articulated loco</a>(DH) came through State Center.&nbsp; They'd very obviously gotten a <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985f.jpeg">highball</a>on the ATC cab display and were <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave8.jpeg">readyto make up time</a> (DH).&nbsp; They <a href="Challenger061102/waving.jpeg">waved</a>at the kids and crashed <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985g.jpeg">over thegrade crossing</a>.<p>We jumped in the Jeep and tailgated the lead vehicle out of there.&nbsp;In about a mile, we both caught up to a slowly-moving utility truck.&nbsp;The&nbsp; road makes two right angle turns, and as we reached the secondone, the fellow in the truck realized why he was being followed so closelyand waved us around.&nbsp; I picked out a spot at the bottom of the hill,just the right distance from a grade crossing, and parked facing east onthe north side of the road.&nbsp; We had a few seconds to line up our shotsbefore the Challenger arrived.<p>Dave got a couple of <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave9.jpeg">nicestills</a> here as the <a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave10.jpeg">engineapproached</a>.&nbsp; We had it all at this point, the sky, the smoke,the sunshine, a south breeze - it was great!&nbsp; I made <a href="ChallengerMovies/fastpass.mov">video</a>(7.5 Meg, but worth the wait, .MOV file) and got what I came for - a reallynice run-by with a full whistle sequence for the grade crossing.<p>Time to roll again!&nbsp; This part of the chase was the most intense,and I figured it was probably hopeless, but we (again) got lucky.&nbsp;They had a malfunctioning crossing gate, requiring the train to slow brieflyto 15 mph.&nbsp; We were behind a fellow in a blue pickup who was doingjust fine until he reached a moment of indecision at an intersection andstopped to think in the middle of the road.&nbsp; I expressed my concernwith the horn and some gestures and he got moving again.&nbsp; We stayedright in the cloud of mud and gravel from the pickup all the way to thepaving that went into Lamoille.&nbsp; Dave covered his eyes now and then,but thanked me later.<p>The pickup went south and we joined a group of fans at the Lamoillegrade crossing for today's last look at 3985.&nbsp; It was just beforenoon when they came around the curve and headed over the E-35 grade crossing.&nbsp;Here are our last few shots:<p><a href="Challenger061102/UP3985h.jpeg">UP 3985 approaching</a><br><a href="Challenger061102/UP3985i.jpeg">UP 3985</a><br><a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave11.jpeg">UP 3985</a> (DH)<br><a href="Challenger061102/MrLee.jpeg">Mr. Lee at the throttle</a><br><a href="Challenger061102/UP3985j.jpeg">UP 3985 going</a><br><a href="Challenger061102/UP3985dave12.jpeg">UP 3985</a> (DH)<p>After this pass, Dave and I loaded back up and drove back to Nevadafor lunch.&nbsp; We both felt we'd had a good day and a great chase.&nbsp;I was back in Indianola around 3:30 to start going through the images,altogether 250 files from the two days.<p>That's It!<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
