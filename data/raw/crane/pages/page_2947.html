<P>Shortly after we started our garden at our new home, in the
spring of 1983, we obtained an old cast iron bathtub with a white
porcelain interior that was put to use as a watering
&quot;tank.&quot;  The old tub is located outside of the garden
fence on the north side, has a wooden cover, and is kept full of
water that warms nicely by the power of the sun.  This is the
water we use to water especially the new seedbeds and the young
plants in our spring and early summer garden.

<P>You might guess that many people, upon seeing the tub for the
first time, ask us what it’s doing there.  Charlotte’s usual
answer is: &quot;Oh, that’s where Roy has to bathe when he’s in
the dog house!&quot;

<P>Actually what I have come to enjoy watching develop every year
is the large patch of tall goldenrods, <I>Solidago altissima</I>,
located right next to the back of the cast iron tank.  Here is
where one can observe, from the time they are initiated, the
development of dozens of the so-called ball galls located on the
stems of the goldenrods.

<P>These spherical swellings, around three-fourths of an inch or
slightly wider, are especially noticeable now and capture the
attention of many hikers during this early winter season.  Here
is their story.

<P>The perennial goldenrods, in this case the tall goldenrods,
began to push out of the ground and had attained a height of
around 12 to 15 inches when their small terminal flower buds
gradually began to form.  It was during this stage of their
growth that a small female fruit fly, <I>Eurosta solidaginis</I>
(you-ROE-sta sah-li-DAY-gi-nis), which we can call either the
goldenrod or the ball gall fly, begins laying eggs on the very
top of the goldenrod flower buds, one to a bud (at first).

<P>An egg hatches in several days and the tiny white larva,
called a maggot, slowly eats its way down into the middle of the
very top of the stem below the flower bud.  All the maggot
consumes is the soft pith of the stem which, in turn, does
nothing to injure the critical water-conducting tissues of the
outer stem.  This area is left entirely undamaged.

<P>Apparently the chemical reaction produced by the maggot
triggers the formation of a gall around the maggot’s inner
chamber inside the goldenrod stem.  Search in patches of tall
goldenrods in later June for the first developing galls.
Frequently the tiny ball gall fly will lay another egg in the
developing bud above a gall that has already formed.  In fact it
is not uncommon to find three nicely spaced galls on a single
stem.   At least that’s the most I have ever found on one stem.

<P>By the way, the experts seem to feel that the great majority
 of ball galls are formed on tall goldenrods, which are quite
 similar to Canada goldenrods and a few other species, and that
 the female Eurosta fly actually uses the taste buds on her feet
 to distinguish species of goldenrods.  Another point that I can
 clear up for you relates to the term &quot;fruit fly.&quot;  I
 referred to the ball gall fly as a form of fruit fly.  What most
 people call a fruit fly is actually a pomace or vinegar fly.
 Pomace is the residue left after fruits have been pressed for
 juice, and this attracts and is eaten by the incredibly tiny
 pomace flies.

<P>We return to the ball gall maggot inside its very secure
 little &quot;house&quot; in the stem of a tall goldenrod.  All
 summer this little white creature eats and slowly gains in size.
 By mid-September the maggot begins to excavate its escape tunnel
 for next spring.  This is usually done in the upper half of the
 gall.  By late October the tunnel is completed to, but not
 through, the gall’s paper-thin outer coating or epidermis.  This
 escape tunnel is absolutely vital because the adult ball gall
 fly that will emerge next spring has no way of eating its way
 out of its chamber to the outer world.

<P>Its escape tunnel completed, the larva crawls back to the
center chamber and decreases the water content in its body,
thereby shrinking in size.  Now ice crystals will not be able to
form in its body which, in turn, would destroy it.  Incidentally
it is common for downy woodpeckers and black-capped chickadees to
peck into these galls during winter months to obtain and eat the
tiny maggots.  The holes made by the woodpeckers will be quite
narrow while those made by the chickadees will be less refined
and more conical in shape.

<P>Come spring, the larvae in these ball galls will pupate and by
April or early May the adult Eurosta flies will be ready to
emerge.  Each of the adult flies has a tiny inflatable
&quot;battering ram&quot; on the front of their head that is used
to force its way out of the &quot;house&quot; in which it has
lived for the past 50 weeks.

<P>By this time the new tall goldenrod plants have begun to
emerge.  The adult goldenrod &quot;Eurosta&quot; flies will mate,
the females will lay eggs in the newly-forming flower buds and
begin this amazing cycle all over.  Isn’t nature downright
amazing?
