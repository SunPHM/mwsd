      eat a wide variety of foods, from frogs, snakes, and an occasional fish 
      to seeds, fruits, and tubers from plants. But even though they eat many 
      things, every winter they need to eat mostly one special thing: <B>blue 
      crabs</B>. When there are enough blue crabs, cranes may eat 80 every day! 
      In the best winters, 80-90% of the Whooping Crane diet is blue crabs. These 
      crabs have so much protein and other nutrients that they get crane bodies 
      in top condition. When cranes have to switch to other foods in winter, they 
      sometimes get less energy than their bodies need for their daily activities. 
      Some of them even die. The cranes that do survive are less healthy than 
      they should be; they'r often in too poor condition to reproduce that year. </P>

      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Blue crabs live 
      in tidal <B>estuaries</B>. Estuaries are where the land meets the sea, and 
      the water in them comes partly from rivers emptying into the ocean and bays. 
      So estuary water is salty, but not nearly as salty as in the ocean. We call 
      this kind of water <B>brackish</B>.<br>
      <BR>
      The rivers that run into Aransas National Wildlife Reserve are the San Antonio 
      and the Guadalupe Rivers. They provide the main source of fresh water in 
      the estuary, which keeps the salinity (saltiness) low for enough for blue 
      crab survival. And these rivers also carry nutrients and sediments that 
      the crabs need to stay alive. Some years the river levels are high, other 
      years low, and these natural cycles affect the crab population.<br>
      <BR>
      Natural cycles of the ocean, too little or too much rainfall on land, and 
      all kinds of other things can make the blue crab population fall or rise 
      in one place or another. Drops in blue crab numbers in one place wouldn't 
      matter if there were thousands of Whooping Cranes spending the winter in 
      many different places. But Whooping Cranes are extremely rare, belonging 
      to a badly endangered species. The entire surviving wild-breeding population 
      spends the winter in Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. If anything bad happens 
      to the blue crabs at Aransas, it hurts EVERY wild whooping crane!<BR>
      <BR>
      If virtually no Whooping Cranes breed in a year, it hurts their population, 
      but isn't a disaster. If they can't breed two years in a row, it becomes 
      very serious. Three years in a row, and the population could fall so dangerously 
      that it might never recover. And if this is happening when cranes are dying 
      in Aransas because of poor feeding conditions, it can be disastrous. </P>

      We humans have mastered so many wonderful methods for providing ourselves 
      and our children with food, shelter, and protection from natural disasters 
      that our population is steadily increasing. The human population in Texas

      <BR>
      Think about all the uses people have for clean water, which we get from 
      rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and underground wells. We all need fresh water! 
      But the more people there are in Texas, the more water will be taken out 
      of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers before they reach the estuary. If 
      we don't figure out a solution, Aransas will become more salty. Blue crabs 
      will become much more scarce. And the Aransas Whooping Crane population 
      may become extinct.<br>
      <BR>
      Many concerned Texans including Tom Stehn are working on this problem. Tom 
      writes, &quot;Human consumption of river water in Texas is a growing resource 
      issue as the State's population continues to expand. This is a very worrisome 
      trend since Texas water law reserves water for people but has few provisions 
      for wildlife.&quot; Should our use of fresh water be regulated to ensure 
      that there will be fresh water enough for wildlife as well as humans? </P>
