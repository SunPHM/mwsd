Just received the little cranes; they look awesome!

I have 3-foot cranes that I am using as centerpieces for my father-in-laws 80th birthday and I have suncatchers as favors with the same theme on them.
<P>
So, these little birds hopefully will tie everything together!!!

Infact I thought they were so nice I could not leave them in the box, so gave them to my wife yesterday. She was very much taken aback and thought they were beautiful.

So thank you once again.

<B>The Thousand Crane Project for September 11, 2001</B>
<P>I have many ties to New York City and after the events of September 11th, I decided to fold 1,000 cranes in memory of those who lost their lives on that tragic day. I soon reached my goal, folding each crane with love and care. May we all live in a world of peace and harmony.
