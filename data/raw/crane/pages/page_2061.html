      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The whooping 
        crane is one of the best known endangered species. They symbolize the 
        struggle to maintain the vanishing creatures of our world. The Whooping 
        Crane Eastern Partnership, a group of federal, state and private agencies, 
        is taking steps to reintroduce a migratory population of whooping cranes 
        east of the Mississippi River.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><img src="../images/updates/depart-110301-2ba.jpg" width="322" height="263" align="left">Why 
        Is Reintroduction Being Conducted?</b><br>
        About 1,400 whooping cranes existed in 1860. Their population declined 
        because of hunting and habitat loss until 1941 when the last migrating 
        flock dwindled to an all-time low of 15 birds. The wild flock has slowly 
        increased to over 180 in late 1999. This flock winters in and around Aransas 
        National Wildlife Refuge on the Gulf coast of Texas. In spring, they migrate 
        north, nesting in Wood Buffalo National Park, which straddles the border 
        of Alberta and Northwest Territories in Canada. This flock of whooping 
        cranes is the only naturally occurring wild population in the world. Scientists 
        have long recognized the risk of having all of the wild whooping cranes 
        using one wintering and breeding location. With all the wild birds concentrated 
        in one small area, the population could be wiped out by disease, bad weather, 
        or human impacts. Whooping crane survival depends on additional, separated 
        populations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who Decides 
        How Many Additional Populations Are Needed?</b><br>
        After a species is listed as threatened or endangered, the Endangered 
        Species Act requires that a recovery plan be designed. A recovery plan 
        is a blueprint that describes and ranks actions that are needed to improve 
        population health of threatened and endangered species. The recovery plan 
        for whooping cranes was developed by the International Whooping Crane 
        Recovery Team, consisting of 5 specialists from Canada and 5 from the 
        United States. Two additional flocks of 25 breeding pairs each will be 
        needed to improve population health to the point that the status of the 
        species could be down-listed from endangered to threatened under the Endangered 
        Species Act. The Recovery Team has also decided that any new flocks should 
        be established in areas where there is a very low chance of contacting 
        the existing wild flock. This separation will minimize the possibility 
        of disease transmission between newly established flocks and the existing 
        whooping cranes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How Were 
        the Eastern Sites Selected?</b><br>
        A non-migratory flock has been reintroduced in the Kissimmee Prairie region 
        of central Florida. Started in 1993, the flock has grown to over 80 birds. 
        Most of those birds are young, but in the spring of 2000, wild whooping 
        crane chicks hatched in Florida for the first time in 60 years. These 
        chicks were lost to predation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wisconsin 
        was considered for a new population for several reasons. Most importantly, 
        the Wisconsin flock will be separated from other wild flocks. Additionally, 
        suitable habitat on federal, state, and private lands is available. Wisconsin's 
        long tradition of environmental commitment and public support, increases 
        the chances for success within the state. Release site ivestigations were 
        held in 1999 and selection was based on habitat analysis, local community 
        support, and protection potential. In September 1999, the Whooping Crane 
        Recovery Team selected Necedah National Wildlife Refuge for a test release 
        using sandhill cranes in 2000. Deemed a success in the early spring of 
        2001, the project paved the way for whooping crane releases beginning 
        in the summer of 2001.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Where 
        do the Cranes for the Project Come From?</b><br>
        Three captive flocks produce cranes for reintroduction to the wild. These 
        captive flocks are located at the International Crane Foundation (WI), 
        Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (MD), and the Calgary Zoo (Canada).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How Will 
        the Birds be Reintroduced?</b><br>
        This reintroduction project will require an estimated 10 to 15 year effort. 
        The cranes will be hatched from eggs in laid captivity, then taken to 
        the release site at the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge for acclimation 
        to the wild. A costumed parent will teach them to forage, roost safely, 
        and avoid humans, as well as other things crucial to their survival once 
        they are released. The birds will be taught to follow costumed trainer 
        in an ultralight aircraft. They will migrate using routes similar to wild 
        sandhill cranes and eventually reach Chassahowitzka National Wildlife 
        Refuge in Florida, where they will spend the winter. The cranes will be 
        monitored using radio and satellite telemetry equipment during the winter 
        and as they migrate north unassisted the following spring. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What is 
        the Goal?<br>
        </b> The goal of this recovery project is a flock of 125 birds in Wisconsin 
        by 2020, including 25 nesting pairs. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Sandhill 
        Crane Test Project</b><br>
        Before trying to reintroduce the rare whooping cranes with this method, 
        the proposed techniques were tested using sandhill cranes. The successful 
        techniques developed during the sandhill study helped determine the methods 
        that will be used for whooping crane releases. During the first week of 
        May 2000, eggs were collected from wild sandhill crane nests in Central 
        Wisconsin. They eggs were shipped to Patuxent Wildlife Research Center 
        in Maryland, where they were incubated and hatched. The chicks heard the 
        sound of ultralight aircraft while still in their eggs. When they were 
        less than two weeks old, they began to exercise by following the ultralight 
        aircraft. Their exposure to the plane continued daily until they were 
        shipped back to the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge on June 30 for acclimation 
        to the Wisconsin release site. Flight training continued on refuge grasslands 
        and wetlands until they were old enough to migrate south. On October 3, 
        after mastering the art of flying and following an ultralight, the cranes 
        made their way along the 1,250 mile migratory pathway. Eleven cranes reached 
        their wintering location at Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge on 
        the Florida Gulf Coast on November 11. The sandhills were monitored during 
        the winter using field observations and electronic tracking equipment. 
        On February 25, the flock began the return trip unassisted, successfully 
        reaching the Necedah Refuge the end of April.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This phase 
        of the project allowed biologists to refine a vital link in the reintroduction 
        effort. In wild populations of cranes, chicks follow their parents south 
        on the fall migration, then are able to return north the next spring on 
        their own. When re-creating a population of whooping cranes, there are 
        no adults available to lead the next generation on a migration. Humans 
        have taken on the role of &quot;surrogate parents,&quot; carefully selecting 
        a migratory route and safely leading the cranes between chosen locations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Whooping 
        Cranes in the eastern United States!</b><br>
        The International Whooping Crane Recovery Team met in January 2001, and 
        evaluated the sandhill crane test project. A decision was reached to proceed 
        with a similar release of whooping cranes in 2001. Ten whooping crane 
        chicks arrived at the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge on July 10. The 
        rare whooping crane chicks were shipped via private aircraft from the 
        Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. Before their release into 
        pens on a secluded refuge marsh, the chicks underwent a rigorous medical 
        examination. The young whooping cranes continued flight training behind 
        an ultralight aircraft. As their wing muscles developed, they followed 
        the small aircraft over central Wisconsin on progressively longer flights. 
        On October 17, the unique flock began their fall migration. High winds, 
        combined with fog and warm southern temperatures slowed their progress, 
        but the first flock of 7 cranes arrived at Chassahowitzka NWR on December 
        3. They had been on the road 48 days and traveled 1,218 miles. They will 
        spend their winter on a secluded marsh. Biologists will monitor them during 
        the winter and on their unassisted trip back north in the spring.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Eastern 
        Population Designation<br>
        </b> Migratory whooping cranes reintroduced east of the Mississippi River 
        are designated as &quot;experimental&quot; because they are isolated from 
        other whooping crane populations. They are also &quot;nonessential&quot; 
        because the survival of the species is not dependant on these individuals 
        at this time. These designations relax the restrictions of the Endangered 
        Species Act and lessen possible conflicts between people and whooping 
        crane conservation. Whooping cranes are still fully covered under the 
        Migratory Bird Treaty Act. A public comment period was held to allow input 
        on the proposed federal rule designating the flock as an &quot;experimental, 
        nonessential&quot; population. The comments were incorporated into a final 
        document that was sent to Washington, D.C.. Final approval to proceed 
        with the reintroduction project was granted upon publication of the final 
        rule on June 26, 2001. Prior to advancing with the project, two flyway 
        councils, seven states directly on the flight path, and 13 adjacent states 
        approved easements for the crane project. </font></p>
