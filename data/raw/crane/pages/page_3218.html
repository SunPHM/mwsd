<P ALIGN="CENTER"><b>The drumbeat is associated with the utterance of primordial sound, with the beginning of manifestation and the
rhythm of the universe.</b><br><br> It is a vehicle for the Word, for tradition and magic. The drum frame is considered to be
made of the wood of the 'Tree of Life.' When a Shaman uses his/her drum he/she makes contact with the Cosmic
Axis and is allowed to enter the world of the gods. The drum's beat associates it with the heart. Sarasvati, the
Hindu goddess of music and arts, has the drum as an emblem. Siva's drum gives the primordial sound of
creation. The drum is an attribute of the Great Mother and is associated with the symbolism of the cave and the
womb</p>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><IMG SRC="images/cliffheidi1.jpg" width="126" height="200" align=left>Drums are handmade by Grey Wolf and are available in 15" octagonal wood frames (oak, cedar or pine)
with elk hide on one side and decorative lacing on the back. Larger sizes are available by special request. These drums have a
beautiful resonant quality with harmonic overtones. Note that drum hides absorb atmospheric moisture and can
sound dull. To restore pure tone, place drum in sun or near heated air vent for half an hour. Conversely, elk hide
is tougher than deer hide (out of which so many commercial drums are made) and can withstand drier climates
without cracking. Decorations were painted on the drum by SpiritWorks artist Heidi Rupp.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT  SIZE="+2"><b>The Drum Anahata</b></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="images/anahatadrum.jpg" width="175" height="177" align=bottom ></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><i>Anahata</i> is the name of the fourth, or heart, chakra. Anahata is symbolized by the black antelope, representing
the element of air. The hexagram is the yantra associated with Anahata, and represents the union of opposites
(the male and female). The word 'Anahata' means "unbeaten" or "unbroken." It is the primordial sound of the
universe which is unmanifest yet ever-present and all-encompassing.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Although Anahata is typically symbolized with a twelve-petalled crimson lotus, an eight-petalled lotus was
depicted to fit the octagon shape of the drum. The lotus is related to the mandala, and the eight-petalled lotus is
considered in India to be a symbol of cosmic harmony and as the Center where Brahma dwells and is the visible
manifestation of his activity. The lotus is akin to the potential of every individual whose heart is like a lotus bud
waiting to unfold. It is further identified with the first appearance of life upon the undifferentiated vastness of
the primeval waters.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The green triangles form the traditional Vedic Sri Yantra mandala - the visual representation of the form that the
sound AUM creates when it manifests and condenses into matter. Mandalas are based on 8 x 8 squares, the
order of the celestial world establishing on earth. Yantras are visual equivalent of mantras. The Sri Yantra is
formed of interlocking inverted triangles, which are symbols of the heart chakra and of Shiva and Shakti, the
union of male and female. AUM is the all-pervading sound emanating form the Invisible Cosmic Vibration; God
in the aspect as creator. It has been said, that if one has to see the form of the Formless, the auspicious body of
the Divine, the light has to be marshaled in a set pattern of rays.<BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="images/cranedrum.jpg" width="175" height="172" align=bottom ><BR>
<BR>
Two cranes in the dance of giving and receiving. Cranes are a symbol of longevity, happiness and peace. This
drum was designed for a wonderful lady who has a passion for origami cranes. It was fortuitous that the drum
hide had patterning on it that looked like mountains and water - a perfect backdrop for the cranes.<BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT  SIZE="+2"><b>Rainbow Snake Drum</b></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><img src="images/snakedrum2.jpg" width="200" height="207" align=bottom ><BR>
</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The design for this drum went through many permutations. The owner had been coming across a lot of snake
images (and actual snakes) and felt drawn to this symbol. We finally decided on a ring of colored snakes shaped
like the Great Serpent Mound in Ohio. A ring of serpents is a symbol of cyclic manifestation and reabsorption. A
serpent biting its own tail is related to the alchemical ouroboros, the unformed <EM>materia</EM>. Snakes traditionally
accompany female deities and the Great Mother. They are mediators between heaven and earth, and symbolize
the all-pervading spirit. Coiled around the egg, the serpent depicts the incubation of the vital spirit. Undulating
serpents symbolize cosmic rhythm or the power of the waters. The serpent as a rainbow which quenches its
thirst in the sea occurs in African, Indian and Amerindian cultures. This celestial serpent serves as a bridge
between one world and the other.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Celts associated the snake with healing waters and wells. The Greeks attributed wisdom and healing to
snakes. The Hindus saw serpents denoting the potentiality of fire and related them to the kundalini energy. The
Minoans had a snake cult devoted to the Great Goddess. The Hopi see the snake as a thunder creature bringing
life-giving rain. Their sacred "Snake Dance" was performed by members of the Snake and Antelope societies
during sacred kiva rites. The Hopi also see the Great Plumed Serpent as a sky god, prominent in sun ceremonies.<BR>
