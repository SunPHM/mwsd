Most people know I'm some sort of engineer and I am over hereworking on "the Chornobyl thing". That's a good start. My specialtyis an arcane part of the business called "licensing". Every nuclearfacility in the world needs to get their national government to givethem permission to build a new facility or to significantly change anold one. That permission process is called licensing. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>As you can imagine, it's agovernment process filled with paper and meetings and more paper andmore meetings. The most significant part of the paper is the partthat describes the safety of the new or changed facility. Designersof new plants or of new pieces of old plants must perform a widerange of calculations to show what will happen day to day and whatmight happen as rarely as once in a million years. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>It's a sophisticated science whichI admit I do not do. But I've spent a lot of time listening to verygood practioners of the art and I recognize good art - and bad art -when I hear it. So 99% of the time I read or listen to others andoccasionally throw in some question I probably learned from someother licensing type or safety professional. All in all, not tooexciting even though I can assure you I take this business veryseriously. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Every once in awhile, I break awayfrom the paper and go in the field. And every once in a great while,I am reminded that this indeed serious work. Last Thursday was such aday. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>My office mate Peter and I got inthe company van and headed north. But today, instead of going northand east to Slavutych (near Chernihiv on </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_01Map%20North.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>themap</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>), we went straightnorth. It's Spring now and it was a bright sunny day with farmersplowing for spring planting. Some farms had huge John Deere tractors,some had small tractors and some had horse-drawn plows. But is wasnice to see farms of all sizes spring (bad pun) back into production.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>About an hour out, we came to acrossing gate that meant there would be no more farms for theremaining 15 miles or so of our trip. We were entering the ChornobylZone. After getting our permission papers checked, we continued onroads that looked the same as the earlier ones but the fields andvillages were empty. We passed through the town of Chornobyl whichdoes have some residents but they are all workers at the ChornobylNuclear Power Plant - ChNPP in English shorthand. They rotate outevery few weeks. The only permanent residents of the Zone are a fewelderly people who are allowed to spend their last years in oldfamily cottages. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>We go through another gate on theoutside of the town and ten minutes later, the first of the powerplant buildings comes into view. </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_02%20Old%20Picture.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>ChNPPis a very large industrial site</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>.We pass power plants 5 and 6 which were under construction at thetime of the accident. The dozen construction cranes shown around thered brick of units 5 and 6 still stand guard around thenever-to-be-finshed buildings. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Finally, we come up to the powerstructures for ChNPP Units 1 through 4. Units 1 and 2 (blackbuildings in picture) are the oldest nuclear plants in Ukraine. Bothwere restarted after the Unit 4 accident. Both were later shutdown byequipment failures and are now being decommissioned. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Units 3 and 4 are back to back,under that large ventilation stack in the center of the picture. Unit3 is normally still operating although Ukraine promises to "soon"shut it down permanently. Meanwhile, it is temporarily shutdown formaintenance. Unit 3 is the last of the RBMK-type reactors operatingin Ukraine. Personally, I agree with most Western safety engineersand would prefer the shutdown to be permanent. Soon indeed.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Unit 4 is now covered by the blacksteel </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_03ChNPP.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>"Shelter"</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>that was built over the debris of the 1986 accident. The word iscapitalized like the name of a deity. It is an intimidating sight. Itis also the reason Peter and I and a few dozen other engineers fromthe U.S. and Western Europe now live in Ukraine. You see, the shelterleaks and may fall down. The U.S., Canada and several Europeancountries have committed a few hundred million dollars to strengthenand stabilize the Shelter so it won't. The project goes by theacronym "SIP" for Shelter Implementation Project. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>It seems like so far, all weWestern experts have done is write reports and have meetings. Mynormal kind of work. But this summer, support structures called "Beam1/Beam 2" will be extended and strengthened in the first "real work"under SIP. Today's field trip for Peter and me is so we can look atthe beams and get a sense for the work involved. Look at a couplesteel beams - no problem right? We'll see. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>After the mandatory meeting withShelter management, we went to the visitors center and walk throughyet another gate. By now we have two escorts and have been joined byDick, one of our counterparts from SIP. Our party also includedAndreas, a co-worker of Peter's and our driver Yurii. Yurii hadworked here during Shelter construction and Andreas had been a Germanexchange-student engineer here two years before the accident. We'reall volunteers for this excursion. Andre our translator on the otherhand showed better judgment and agreed to stay outside in the van.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>After the gate house, our firststop was the building where we got new clothes. We got socks, boots,pants, two shirts, two hats (one hard and one soft) and two pairs ofgloves. We also got little surgical masks. Freshly outfitted, westart our </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_04TourGroup.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>strollup to the black Shelter</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>.After passing through yet another guardhouse, we stood at the</B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_05GoHere_NoGoThere.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>endof the building</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>looking at the place where a new crane and a new elevator will beplaced to facilitate work on Beam 1/Beam 2.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Notice the staircase on the leftside of the Shelter wall. These stairs have been there since thebuilding was finished. They are very vertical and a bit rusty. Theyare also the only way up to our goal. I don't have pictures of theascent because I was too busy huffing and puffing and holding on. Mylegs have still not recovered. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>But we did all make it up thosestairs. And then we had to go up another set of stairs but they wereonly another 20 or 30 feet. Did I mention that Peter's and Andreas'radiation dosimeters are going off during much of this climb? Theircompany issues them continuous read-out dosimeters but doesn't expectthem to be climbing around the most contaminated spot on earth.Anyway, we made sure we didn't spend any extra time going up thesestairs. Now we see why the project makes such a big deal aboutgetting a good, quick elevator. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>On top, we looked into the Shelterat </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_06RoofAndBeams.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>oneset of beams</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>. Noticethat the Shelter is not sealed. Rain and snow come in and air goes inand out. Another goal of SIP is to determine the best way to stopthis but it's a surprisingly difficult task. A major part of thedifficulty is the radiation field. Just inside where we are standing,we could receive in one or two minutes the equivalent exposure of ayear's normal background radiation. (3 to 5 Rem/hour for thetechnically interested.) This will be very difficult work.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>I stuck my camera inside the holeto get a better view. The picture shows </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_07Beam1_2.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>thepair of beams </B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>comingin from the right. They rest on a steel frame that is on top of thewall that runs from the bottom of the picture. They are held in placeby the weight of the roof. The problem is simply that the wall wasfractured during the accident and appears to be moving to the left.It's easy to see that the beams and roof will fall if the wall movesanother foot and a half. That's why people will take on this verydifficult job to strengthen the wall and extend the beams. .</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Turning the other way, I snapped aview of </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_08View.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Pripiyatin the distance</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>. Thiswas the town where the workers and their families lived before - andfor two days after - the accident. Reportedly, the flames at Unit 4were visible from some of the apartment blocks. The contaminationplume went right over the town. After thirty years in this business,what happened 13 years ago - and what did not happen - isinconceivable to me. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>After this we descended the stairsand went inside the building. We went to the old control room. Wewent to one of the rooms that held the pumps that provided coolingfor the reactor. We walked past </B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_09in%20the%20bowels.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>roomswith sealed metal doors</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>.It was like touring the Titanic or, more closely, like walkingthrough the ruins of a long-dead civilization. Frankly, I was gladwhen the tour ended and we went back outside. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>We walked the a hundred yards inthe sunshine over to the control building. We reversed the dressingprocess, took very cold showers and put back on our normal clothes.The technician surveyed my camera and said it was clean. I also got a</B></FONT><A HREF="images1999/D990424_10ChNPPCert.JPG"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>certificate</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>that said I had received "0.12 Rem". That's not a lot by anyobjective health standards but it's more than I had received in allthe time I have worked in nuclear power plants. </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B>Back at the van, we picked upAndre and said good bye to our hosts and escorts. We drove past theunfarmed fields and, later, the newly plowed ground. A couple hoursafter leaving ChNPP, I was home looking out the window at theneighboring thousand-year-old church. Will the Shelter last as long?It might have to.</B></FONT></P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B><TABLE>   <TR>      <TD>         <P>&nbsp;</P>                  <CENTER><A HREF="images1999/D990424_01Map%20North.JPG" TARGET="_blank"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><B><IMG SRC="images1999/D990424_01Map%20North-tb.JPG" ALT="Loading..."
