			Great news! There are two more Whoopers in the World! The first whooping crane chicks
			to hatch in the United States in 100 years popped through their eggshells March 16-18.
			When you're trying to save an endangered species from extinction, success sometimes
			comes in baby steps, or at least one baby bird at a timeñ-and wildlife biologists
			are ecstatic. <BR>
			<BR>
			The chicks are not part of the Aransas/Wood Buffalo migratory flock, but were born
			into the world's second whooping crane flock. Surprised? This flock's home is in
			Florida and is the result of the reintroduction of non-migratory whooping cranes
			that started in 1993. Read more about the world's second flock of whooping cranes,
			and find out why the hatching of the chicks is a milestone worth celebrating. See:

Tom Stehn lets us in on the Crane Countdown. Today's letter says:<BR>
			<BR>
			Dear Journey North, <BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;Well, April has arrived and the whooping crane migration is underway. I did
			a census flight on March 30 and found 169 cranes. Figuring that I overlooked some,
			I'm estimating that about 12 cranes have started the migration since my last flight
			on March 25. Two cranes had migrated about a month ago and were found in Nebraska
			March 2 - 8. Thus, 14 total whooping cranes have migrated. Departures should pick
			up rapidly this week and especially next week. Looks like things are about on schedule.&quot;


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Challenge Question #13: <BR>
			</B>&quot;This is only ______ % of the flock.&quot; (Calculate and fill in the blank.)

			</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<BR>
			<A NAME="Lonely"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Lonely Chick?</B></FONT><BR>
			&quot;The most interesting thing about the census fights was finding a chick all
			by itself on the refuge. Apparently its parents started the migration and left the
			chick behind. This happens occasionally. Normally the parents will migrate with their
			chick back to the nesting grounds in Canada. Sometimes the chick splits off on its
			own in Saskatchewan. This separation of the chick from the parents seems to occur
			primarily because the youngster is growing more independent. Late in the winter,
			the chicks are sometimes feeding quite a distance away from their parents rather
			than remaining underfoot and begging for food as they do when they first get to Aransas
			in the fall. We've never observed adults driving off their chick. It just seems like
			the chick realizes it is time to be on its own.&quot;


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Challenge Question #14:<BR>
			</B>&quot;What do you think will happen to the chick left behind at Aransas?&quot;

			</BLOCKQUOTE>

			<P><A HREF="/jnorth/spring2000/species/crane/Update040400.html#How">(To respond to
			this question, please follow the instructions below.)</A><BR>
			<BR>
			&quot;So why would the parents want to migrate and the chick not be ready? It's kind
			of like your parents packing for a trip and the kids watching TV instead of getting
			their things together. With the cranes, it all has to do with hormones and the urge
			to breed. The adults are going through hormonal cycles that get them interested in
			making the migration and returning to Canada to nest. Since the chick is too young
			to be undergoing these changes, it does not have the same desire to head north so
			soon. Imagine the conversation between parents and chicks as the parents spiral up
			in to the sky, whooping to all the other cranes as they depart. And the chick responds
			back: &quot;Hey! Where are you going?&quot; <BR>
			<BR>
			I'm looking forward to my next flight on April 7 to see how much the migration has
			advanced.<BR>

			Usually family groups travel by themselves. Sometimes they happen to arrive at the
			same staging or resting area as other cranes. When this happens more than one family
			group may be seen together. When the family groups migrate from these staging areas
			they either do it as single family units (most often) or as larger flocks that may
			include another family (less often). Most often these larger flocks contain only
			one family group and two or three other cranes. Which leads us to:

			How distinctive are voices for identifying other people? Check it out by blindfolding

			Volunteer crane researcher Dr. Bernhard Wessling, who lives in Germany, recorded
			about 20 crane unison calls and an equal number of guard calls at Aransas during
			ten days in December 1999. About 15 crane pairs gave both vocalizations. Dr. Wessling
			wants to see if the two calls are related. He will need to analyze sonograms to make
			certain they are unique. This technique has great potential for &quot;marking&quot;
			pairs, but you can imagine how difficult it is to get the recordings! What do whooping
			cranes sound like? Listen to the cranes' call courtesy of the <A HREF="www.savingcranes.org">International

			<P>The whooping crane's name was inspired by its loud, distinctive call, audible
			up to two miles away. Wally Jobman says, &quot;It has been my experience that whooping
			cranes do very little calling during migration. They will often call when they take
			flight, but do little calling during migration flights.&quot; This makes us wonder:


			<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<P><B>Challenge Question #16:<BR>
			</B>&quot;What feature of a crane's anatomy enables the call to be so loud? And what

			Question #9</B></FONT><BR>
			Last time we asked if families migrate together. You read part of the answer above
			(See Up, Up and Away). Here's more: <BR>
			<BR>
			The young usually depart the wintering grounds with their parents. The subadult birds
			(2 to 3-year-olds that are to young to breed) usually migrate after the breeding
			birds. The breeding pairs are the first birds to migrate north in the spring, the
			subadults linger on the wintering grounds longer and generally have a more leisurely
			northward migration. During fall migration the opposite happens, with the subadults
			leaving the breeding grounds before the breeding birds.<BR>

We asked, &quot;What are some of the hazards that whooping cranes face on their long
			flight between Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and Wood Buffalo National Park?&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			Power lines, storms, tornadoes, Peregrine Falcons, Bald and Golden Eagles, foxes,
			raccoons, wolves, coyotes, and steel leg traps are all potential hazards to cranes.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			Between September 1999 and February 2000, seven deaths were recorded among the non-migratory
			flock of whooping cranes being established in Florida (see more about this flock
			above). Bobcats took five of those cranes, and alligators took two. <BR>

<A NAME="Oil"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Oil Spoils: Response to Challenge Question #11
			</B></FONT><BR>
			&quot;What aspects of cranes' normal behavior could cause problems if an oil spill
			occurred at Aransas?&quot; Tom Stehn explains: &quot;Whoopers are territorial so
			it would be practically impossible to try to haze them and keep them out of a contaminated
			area.&quot; Because of cranes' feeding habits, their diet and health would also be
			affected by an oil spill.<BR>
