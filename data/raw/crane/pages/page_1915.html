<h2>The Long Flight Back</h2>
<h3>The return of the whooping crane</h3>

<P>

<b>By Cheryl Laird</b>
<P>

<P>

Nightfall has transformed the dull gray pasture into an inky sea of black, rimmed by the gold of the sun's afterburn and a
distant fire that a rancher lighted to usher in a flush of green on this flat Kissimmee, Fla., prairie near Walt Disney World.<B></B>
<P>

Early winter temperatures drop quickly in the darkness, numbing the toes of the handful of people who sit stiffly on folding
chairs under spotlights powered by a rumbling generator. In each of their laps, they hold something rare and beautiful -- a whooping
crane.
<P>

The big white birds are eerily still, except for one. Despite the hood placed over his eyes to keep him calm, he snakes his long
beak around and pecks furiously at the woman holding him. The cranes are gawky juveniles, 6 months old, covered with the patchwork
white and cinnamon feathers of adolescence.
<P>

It will be another six months before they sport the glowing white plumage, black-tipped wings and brazen red foreheads of adults.
Then they will stand 5 feet tall -- the tallest native birds in North America -- and bugle so powerfully that people will be able to
hear them two miles away.
<P>

Most likely, though, not all of them will survive that long. They have lived their pampered lives so far in safe pens, most in
Baraboo, Wis., and a few in Canada at the Calgary Zoo. Each arrived in Florida by airplane two weeks ago in a big box marked with
red lettering: "This End Up," and, on the other side, "Endangered Species." The birds were outfitted with radio transmitters and had
their wings strapped close so they couldn't fly from their open pens.
<P>

The whooping cranes have been brought here to be released in the wild. The procedure will be relatively simple, but the implications
are grand. These young cranes represent the successful culmination of one of the most intense, expensive and dedicated projects ever
launched by humans to save a species different from their own.<B></B>
<P>

The leader of tonight's release, Florida state biologist Marty Folk, watches as each crane is examined by a veterinarian. A
couple have broken and bleeding toenails, suffered in an attempt to escape their captors. One begins to overheat from nervousness, so someone squirts alcohol on the bottom of its rubbery feet to cool it off.
<P>

The cranes aren't the only ones who are anxious. This is one of the most exciting days of the year for Folk, a wiry, bespectacled
man with a gentle manner whose job of caring for Florida's cranes normally is a lonely pursuit.
<P>

"Cranes are the ultimate thing for me," he admits. "I can't imagine studying any other bird. Maybe it's because they're so big and
gaudy and easy to watch. I don't even think of them as birds. I think of them as cranes. And the sounds they make  ...  It's like
getting a horn blasted at you, they're so powerful."
<P>

The veterinarian finishes her routine exam by drawing blood and probing the sullen-looking whooper's posterior with a cotton-tipped
fecal swab. Then she clips the plastic band that has held its wings tight for the past two weeks and stretches a wing to its full
length. The crane seems to relax.
<P>

Ahh.
<P>

This one, named Pecos Bill, was brought here from the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis. The captive-breeding staff was
into the mythology theme this year, so there's also a Zeus, Cyclops, Persephone, Nike and Artemis.
<P>

Unlike youngsters in wild flocks, these captive birds have never flown at liberty. Most have been raised by humans imitating
whoopers. Dressed in ghostlike sheets, people feed the young birds by hand with<B> </B>puppets that look like adult cranes. The
only time the birds see undisguised humans is when they do something unpleasant to them, such as taking blood. That's the point.
They are supposed to be afraid of people and all other predators so they can survive in the wild and produce offspring.
<P>

Thirteen cranes are being released tonight, the first in a series of releases that will total 30 cranes by the end of winter. If all
goes well, they will join the 49 whooping cranes released in the past five years that make their homes nearby. If things don't go
well, they will join the ranks of the 51 that have died.
<P>

Most have been killed by bobcats, which hide the gnawed bodies under brush to preserve their meal. That threat has
declined through the years, however, as the release strategy has been refined. Now the young birds are held for a
couple of weeks in pens that are half-flooded, so they learn to roost in water, which discourages predators. They also are released
at night, when they're calmer and less likely to panic and hurt themselves.
<P>

After being suspended in a sling from a scale to be weighed, the first crane in this group finally is ready for release. Folk
carries the bird awkwardly back to the open pen in the darkness. The lanky crane is almost as big as he is.
<P>

He lets it go and steps back. The crane immediately stands up tall and beats its wings in triumph, or perhaps just with relief, and
trots away toward the darkest corner of the pen.
<P>

"Looking good," Folk murmurs proudly. "Nice and strong."
<P>

The big bird doesn't know yet that it can fly. Not until the next day will one of its buddies figure out how to flap over the fence.
In another week, all of them will be out. They'll huddle together under the eye of curious adult cranes who visit. They'll take
short practice flights the length of a football field, sometimes crashing awkwardly on landing, until they learn to handle tail
winds and side breezes.
<P>


<P>

Three weeks later, on Jan. 2, one of the newly released cranes is found dead on a roadside, apparently hit by a car on a
foggy morning. The young whooper may have flown into a power line before falling in front of a car. It's hard to be sure.
<P>

The death isn't unexpected, but it's felt keenly, as are the recent unexplained deaths of two adult cranes nearby. Every whooping
crane's death is a cause for mourning among conservationists working to save them. There are so few whoopers -- only 337 throughout
the world, all in North America. Two-thirds of those are wild, most migrating between Canada and Texas.
<P>

That's why it's so important that this new Florida flock succeed. If something should happen to the Texas-Canada flock -- a natural
disaster, a disease outbreak, an oil spill -- the species could teeter again on the brink of extinction, as it did in 1941 when only
15 or 16 birds remained in Texas after a century of being hunted and losing their habitat to farming.
<P>

All the whooping cranes in the world today come from those Texas birds. Actually, there were a total of 22 birds then, but the
others were part of a nonmigrating flock in Louisiana that died out, most in a hurricane, their genes lost forever.
<P>

The humans responsible for the whoopers' plight became their only hope. But no species had ever come back from numbers so small. "It
was a species that everybody said was going to disappear, that couldn't be saved,"says George Gee, head of whooping crane efforts at
the government-run Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland.
<P>

Today, the whooping crane -- which, along with other cranes, is a symbol of long life, fidelity and happiness in many cultures --  is
also a symbol of what can go right in the effort to rescue endangered species. Last year, there were a record-setting 158 birds in
the Texas-Canada flock. If all goes well, whoopers may be downgraded from "endangered"to the less-frightening "threatened"status by
2020.
<P>

Success has come despite setbacks such as the cross-fostering experiment. From 1975 to 1988, 289 whooping crane eggs were placed in
sandhill cranes' nests in Idaho in hopes the sandhills would teach the chicks to migrate to their wintering grounds in New Mexico.
They did, but the whooping cranes grew up thinking they were sandhills and refused to mate with their own kind. As a result (and
also because of a long-running drought), the flock dwindled to just a handful.
<P>

An imposing amount of labor and money -- an estimated $40 million-plus, probably the most ever spent to save a species in North
America -- has gone toward such intensive efforts as collecting eggs from wild nests and raising the young in captivity to be
released in new flocks. But the most important gains have come simply from protecting the habitat. That has allowed the birds to
pull themselves up by their bootstraps, particularly along the Texas coast.
<P>

"It's a tremendous success story, better than what anybody could have hoped for," says Tom Stehn, a federal biologist at the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge, who has been watching over the birds in Texas since 1982. "Once it got down to 15 birds, it's just a
miracle that they came back."
<P>

The whoopers' story is one that, perhaps more than any other endangered-species tale in America, has unfolded in the public eye. For
many, publicity about the whooping cranes' plight was the first unpleasant wake-up call that a species actually could become extinct
in their lifetime. The whooper also was an animal that inspired emotion.
<P>

"Cranes have almost a spiritual impact on people," says engineer-turned-crane conservationist Gordon Dietzman. "The very first time
I ever saw a crane, I just about ran off the road. I had never seen a bird with such a graceful gait and such a regal beauty,
something robins and songbirds just don't have. They're cute and chirpy, but with a crane, it's like a monarch walking among
peasants.
<P>

"Cranes have kind of this primitive sound that takes me back to my roots. It's like listening to a bull elk bugling on a frosty
morning in Yellowstone. Or like a wolf howling in the cold of a Minnesota night."
<P>

Florida state biological administrator Steve Nesbitt, a sardonic sort who's fond of Mahler and Beethoven, sees the whooping crane's
comeback as nothing short of saving humanity's soul.
<P>

"The sad part is we can survive just fine without whooping cranes. We can survive without California condors," he says. "But
eventually, it'll just be us and rats, roaches, English sparrows, starlings and pigeons."
<P>

Because we accelerated the birds' path to extinction, he says, we have a moral responsibility to save them. But there's another
reason we should, he adds, and it's selfish.
<P>

People crave unique experiences, and places like Walt Disney World -- with the same sights seen by millions -- can't deliver them,
Nesbitt says. When people are bored by the mundane, they begin inventing experiences, from UFOs to designer drugs, he says.
<P>

"But nature is unpredictable. Each person's experience is unique and can't be replicated. No matter how hard we try, there will
never be 500,000 whooping cranes. They will always be rare. To me, that's really what it's all about, keeping us -- the human species
-- sane."
<P>


<P>

"I hate to disappoint you, but I've lived here 45 years, and I've never seen them," says Shorty Kline, holding a brown
coffee mug over the Formica table in his Kline Cafe in Rockport, Texas.
<P>

"I've been here 30 years, and I've never been up to see them," says fishing guide Wayne Lindsey.
<P>

"Once you've seen a bird, you've seen a bird," nods builder Wayne Taylor, the third in the trio of white-haired friends lingering at
their usual table in this cozy diner.
<P>

People from all over the world come to their<B> </B>coastal town of Rockport for a chance to see endangered whooping cranes in and
around the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. The chamber of commerce estimates that the big birds pump $5 million into the local
economy each year.
<P>

But these guys aren't impressed. Neither is the teen-age waitress, who doesn't know what a whooping crane looks like.
<P>

The men say most birders come in on buses and go directly out on tour boats, without even eating in town. They don't contribute
anything permanent. "Except they slam on their brakes in the middle of the street," Taylor says, "and get out their binoculars, and
you can't get around them."
<P>

For the most part, the men say, the whooping cranes are trouble. You can't put up a tower because the support wires will be in the
cranes' flight path, they say. You have to be afraid if a crane decides to live on your property. Who knows? one of them says. The
government may come and take your land away.
<P>

The men remember back in 1989 when a Houston lawyer accidentally shot and killed a whooping crane near Aransas while hunting snow
geese. He had to pay the feds $15,000 and another $6,480 to the state. "Just for a mistake!" Taylor says in amazement. (Two years
later, two young men were fined $20,100, and one was given jail time for shooting a whooping crane near Bend, Texas.)
<P>

"When you figure the government spending per bird per year, it's almost ridiculous," Taylor says. "They're spending millions
watching over these birds, and you got people dying of AIDS. If the dinosaurs weren't extinct, we wouldn't have any oil 'cause it's
all fossil fuel," he adds, laughing good-naturedly. "Things got to come and go."
<P>

On Captain Ted's boat, in a nearby shallow bay protected by the barrier islands of San Jose and Matagorda, the mood is decidedly
different. The passengers, a mix of old and young who have paid $28 each for a morning tour, slide down the eight rows of cushioned
bench seats so they can peer out the windows. Others scramble to the breezy upper deck for the best view of an endangered whooping
crane.
<P>

The glass-smooth water looks soft and gray, framed by
foot-high marsh grasses in greens and browns. Everywhere looks the same. It's not glamorous, but it's undeniably relaxing.
<P>

"OK, let's watch this marsh now. Never know what we're going to see,"guide Ted Appell says dramatically over the loudspeaker. His
customers whip their binoculars around.
<P>

Despite the Intracoastal Waterway, with its petrochemical barges chugging along in all their industrial splendor, this is one of the
best natural birding spots in the country. Today is no disappointment. Appell, who has ruddy skin and an unruly brown beard streaked
with gray, points out Mexican eagles, reddish egrets and roseate spoonbills.
<P>

"We got two whooping cranes up here at 11 o'clock," he says softly. "You'll be able to see them in a minute. That other bird with
them is a white pelican. Don't be trying to make a crane out of it." The birds are so far away they look like sheep, but the crowd
still peers at them faithfully. "OK now, there's your two cranes over there," says Appell. "They're feeding on clams."
<P>

Two cranes stretch their necks, take a few running steps and heave their surprisingly hefty bodies into the air. Only then are their
black wingtips visible. Unlike herons and egrets, whooping cranes -- which may look similar superficially but vary in most every
other way -- snap their wings up sharply when they fly instead of using an evenly rhythmic flapping. They also stretch their necks
straight before them and their legs straight behind them. When they migrate, their most deadly foes are nearly invisible power
lines.
<P>

Appell explains that whooping cranes mate for life, which can mean 25 years in the wild or 40-plus years in captivity. The pair
carve out large territories for themselves and their chick, and<B> </B>chase away other cranes. They perform elaborate dances,
bouncing up and down like pogo sticks, flapping wings and bobbing heads, to attract and keep each other.
<P>

If threatened, the couple responds with an ear-splitting unison call. It's like a duet. Each flings its head dramatically forward
and backward, throwing the call back and forth between them with musical precision. The female honks twice for every single honk of
the male. The devoted couples do it best.
<P>

This year, though, Appell announces with mock sadness, one of the male cranes forgot that he was joined for life with his five-year
mate. "He jumped up and got a divorce. He ran off and got him another cutie." Appell pauses dramatically, pointing toward a bend in
the marsh. "Now you're looking at them out there. Those are the no-gooders."
<P>

The male crane has a new female, who keeps chasing the old mate away. "It's a terrible sight. She keeps her head down real low. Her
feathers are messed up," Appell says. "Whooping cranes having a divorce! I don't know what's happening to this world. She still
loves him, dadgummit."
<P>

The tourists laugh, enjoying Appell's milking of the story, which happens to be true. They listen intently again when he
tells how a whooping crane's beak is strong enough to kill a coyote with one peck to the head, and they giggle when he tells of
cranes punching holes in duck decoys.
<P>

"Poor hunter out there freezing to death," he says. "Been out there since 4 a.m. to shoot one duck, and here's a 5-foot-tall crane
beating up his decoy. He gets to laughing so hard he can't shoot, anyway."
<P>

Appell answers one of the most common questions about whooping cranes: how to pronounce their name. He insists that the "w" should
be pronounced and is disdainful of people who say it the other way, with an "h" sound, like basketball "hoop." (It turns out that
many experts use the "h" pronunciation, instead. Either is considered OK.)
<P>

Business is good these days for Appell and other tour-boat operators. "Every year my business has gone up," says John Howell, guide
of the Pisces boat. "This is the best place in the country for birding, anyway. The whooping cranes are just icing on the
cake."
<P>

That icing is getting thicker each year. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service computer model<B> </B>predicts that by the year 2033
there could be 1,000 whooping cranes wintering along the Texas coast.
<P>

Stehn, the Aransas refuge biologist, says the Aransas area fortunately has a lot of marsh available, despite the 11 percent of crane
habitat that was lost in the 1940s with the construction of the Intracoastal Waterway. Since then, the Army Corps of Engineers and
Mitchell Energy have used dredging spoil to create new marshes. With the help of volunteers, concrete slabs have
been placed along the waterway to control erosion caused by the wake of boats.
<P>

There are other problems, though, chief among them the lack of fresh water flowing into the bay. The more people who move to the
Texas Hill Country, the more water they use, Stehn says, leaving less for the rivers to carry to the coast.
<P>

As a result, the blue crabs -- whooping cranes' primary food source in Aransas -- aren't doing as well as they used to, he says. Stehn
expects an 8 percent decrease in blue crabs in the next 50 years; at the same time, the whooping crane population is expected to
quadruple and more. The problem is made worse because it's legal to trap blue crabs in waters inside the crane habitat, so many end
up on restaurant tables.
<P>


<P>

Whooping cranes (<I>Grus americana</I>) are an ancient species, dating back to the Pleistocene ice age. The birds were
widespread in North America, though never common, until the mid-1800s, when estimates of their numbers range from 500-700 to
1,200-1,400.
<P>

As people moved in, the birds were pushed out. Breeding grounds were destroyed as settlers plowed prairies and drained marshes for
farming and grazing. Because of the whoopers' elusiveness, the birds and their eggs became prized targets of hunters and collectors.
The federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 technically protected the cranes, but there were too few field agents to enforce the
law.
<P>

By 1941, only 15 or 16 whoopers could be found wintering on the Texas coast in the 47,215-acre "Aransas migratory waterfowl refuge"
that President Franklin Roosevelt had established a few years earlier. The presidential decree most likely saved the whooping crane
from extinction, though at the time, many feared it was too late.
<P>

Because whooper pairs usually raise only one chick per year, the rate of recovery was painstakingly slow. The flock increased by a
few birds some years, then dropped, as deaths from natural and human causes took their toll. Over time, the birds tentatively built
up their numbers.
<P>

In the late 1940s, National Audubon Society ornithologist Robert Porter Allen devoted himself to whoopers, studying them at Aransas
and traveling more than 25,000 miles by plane and Jeep in search of their secret summer nesting grounds in Canada. His writings
stirred public sentiment for the cause.
<P>

In 1955, with only 28 birds alive, came good news. The summer home had been found. A firefighter had spotted a crane family in the
remote Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada's Northwest Territories. The United States and Canada vowed to work together to save the
birds. Six years later, volunteers in both countries formed the nonprofit Whooping Crane Conservation Association to
promote conservation and educate the public.
<P>

Still, the Texas-Canada flock was not growing quickly enough to suit government conservationists. They worried that one catastrophic
event could mean the end for all whoopers. Beginning in 1967, the conservationists removed one egg from each nest of whooper pairs
that laid two eggs. Because only one chick per nest normally survives, it didn't reduce the wild population for one of the eggs to
be taken. The eggs were sent to the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland so the chicks could be<B> </B>raised as the first
captive flock.
<P>

Since then, 448 eggs have been taken and farmed out to captive breeding programs in Maryland, Wisconsin and Calgary. Canadian
biologist Ernie Kuyt and others searched for the nests in a helicopter, which scared away the parents when the craft landed nearby.
The collectors slogged through the swamp to the nest, where they floated the eggs in a bucket of water. If the chick inside were
alive, it would move and rock the egg. If both eggs were bad, a good one was left in their place. If both were alive, one was
slipped into a wool sock and taken back to the helicopter, where it would be labeled and placed in a padded suitcase for transport.
<P>

(Nesting whooper couples no longer have to put up with such intrusions. As of this year, it is expected that no more eggs need to be
collected because the captive population finally is considered to be genetically diverse.)
<P>

In 1984, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service named endangered species biologist Jim Lewis to the new post of whooping crane
coordinator, with the job of overseeing the country's increasingly widespread efforts to save the cranes. Five years later, 22
whoopers were shipped from Patuxent to the nonprofit International Crane Foundation in Wisconsin to start a second major captive
breeding flock as insurance against disease or any calamity that might befall the first one.
<P>

ICF's co-founder George Archibald had been a leader of the crane conservation movement for years. He gained popular recognition in
the media because of his work with a female whooping crane named Tex. The bird was hopelessly attached to (imprinted on) humans --
she especially preferred dark-haired men --  after being raised by the director of the San Antonio Zoo. She refused to mate with
other whoopers.
<P>

Female whoopers won't ovulate unless they are stimulated by the presence of their mate. Artificial insemination can't work
unless, basically, she's in the mood.
<P>

So Archibald courted Tex. He lived in a tiny shed inside her pen 15 hours a day for six weeks. He danced with her, and she danced
back. He helped her chase off human "predators." He talked to her. He also had whooper semen trucked in from Patuxent two or three
times a week. She was
artificially inseminated, and eventually it worked. She laid an egg, from which hatched Gee Whiz.
<P>

Tragically, Tex was killed three weeks later by raccoons that ripped a hole through the netting in her cage. All that remained was
her beak. The saddened Archibald went ahead with his scheduled appearance on <I>The Tonight Show </I>that evening, and news of Gee
Whiz and Tex spread, serving to enlist further public support on behalf of the cranes.
<P>

U.S. coordinator Lewis estimates that, since 1945, governments in the United States and Canada have spent more than $40
million to save the whooping cranes. He figures that tens of thousands of people, both paid and volunteer, have contributed time to
the rescue effort.
<P>

In recent years, he says, more than $1 million per year in taxpayers' money has gone to the whoopers. The United States has forked
over most of it, about 80 percent, Lewis says. But he worries about future funding.
<P>

"This year again, the budget is tighter. I don't know when it's going to get to the point where we have to drop some activities,"
Lewis says. So far, the popular whooper program has escaped serious cuts, suffering only a 5 percent to 10 percent decrease in the
past two years. But projects for other endangered species have been put on hold.
<P>

Knowledge gained from the intense efforts to save the whoopers has benefited other endangered species, including six other species
of cranes -- especially the Siberian and the red-crowned cranes of Asia.
<P>

Worldwide, there are 15 species of cranes, from elegant blue cranes with their flared cobra heads to gray- and black-crowned cranes,
with their shimmering gold halos of delicate feathers. In the United States, there are just two species: the endangered whoopers and
the abundant sandhill cranes.
<P>

Sandhills, which are gray and a little smaller than whoopers, have been valuable allies in whooping crane research. Because they are
not endangered, new breeding and tracking techniques are first tested on them. Reliable sandhills also act as brood mothers for
incubating whooper eggs. These days, they may be most valuable for the part they play in teaching captive whoopers to migrate.
<P>

For whooping cranes to be downgraded to "threatened" status, there must be three self-sustaining wild flocks, with at least 40
nesting pairs in the Texas flock (already accomplished) and 25 pairs each in the nonmigrating Florida flock and a third flock
expected to be started around the year 2000.
<P>

If all goes according to human plans, that third wild flock will migrate between summer breeding grounds in Canada (probably
Manitoba or Sas-katchewan) and winter quarters at some yet-to-be-chosen location in the southeastern United States. The problem is,
cranes don't innately know how to migrate. Their parents teach them. The new young flock will have no crane mentors.
<P>

Canadian artist-inventor Bill Lishman came up with the idea of teaching birds to follow his ultralight aircraft. From 1993 to 1995,
he led several flocks of captive-reared Canada geese 400 to 820 miles to the southeastern United States. Of 56 geese that followed
the little plane, 46 migrated north on their own the following year. Lishman's success was turned into last year's popular movie,
<I>Fly Away Home</I>.
<P>

Meanwhile, researchers in Idaho, Michigan and Maryland were trying to teach captive-raised sandhill cranes to migrate, hoping the
experiments would teach them what works best for similar-minded, captive-raised whoopers. Some of the sandhills learned to migrate
naturally when they were placed with migrating wild flocks. Others were taught to follow trucks and ultralight aircraft.
<P>

There were fatalities, including deadly attacks by golden eagles. But the experiments proved promising enough that this year
rancher-biologist Kent Klegg plans to lead some whoopers behind an ultralight from Idaho to New Mexico --where there are flocks of sandhills as well as three whoopers remaining from the discontinued cross-fostering experiment. If all goes well, the
same migration technique could be used for the new Canada-U.S. flock in the year 2000.

"Where's that baby? Where is that cute little thing?''
<P>

Marianne Wel-lington, a youthful aviculturist wearing jeans shorts and Nike Airs, coos and peeks inside a shed<B> </B>at the
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., one sunny morning early last summer.<B></B>
<P>

No luck. Instead, the baby crane is outside in the grassy pen with his protective parents.
<P>

"This guy's name is Cyclops, which is appropriate, since his dad is one-eyed,"says veterinarian Julie Langenberg, also dressed for
comfort and easy cleaning in jeans.
<P>

She and vet technician Nancy Businga grab battered brooms out of the back of a dented red van. They cautiously open the
pen gate, then walk forward aggressively, holding the brooms before them like swords as protection against darting beaks and claws.
<P>

Two brilliant-white adult cranes named Ursula and Ulysses run at them with flapping wings, their red foreheads pulsing angrily. But
they are held at bay as Wellington dashes in and grabs the fuzzy brown chick that had been hidden in the grass. The women retreat
and shut the gate, just before the female crane runs menacingly at them. Once the gate slams, the upset couple emit a shockingly
loud chorus of bugles.
<P>

"They are great parents," Wellington says, panting in admiration. "The male usually defends, but in this case, the female defends
more, maybe because he has one eye. She's almost the supermom, because she does all the defense and then she runs back to take care
of the chick."
<P>

Six months later, this chick will be one of 13 adolescent cranes released as part of a wild flock in Florida. But, for now, little
3-day-old Cyclops just looks confused. His skinny neck appears hardly big enough to support his head, but he gamely tries to
hop out of the blue bucket in which he is being weighed. The veterinarian finishes checking him over, then sneaks him back in his
pen. His crane guardians purr at him reassuringly and then honk again rudely at the humans.
<P>

"Fred is a nasty dude," Wellington says a few minutes later as they pass another whooper's pen. Inside, Fred is stomping his feet
and doing deep knee bends, trying to decide whether to sink to the ground in what is known as a crouch threat. "If you get a crouch
threat, you want to get out of there,"says Wellington. "It is amazing how fast they can get up and at you."
<P>

The staffers continue up the dirt road to the next cranes on their morning schedule in this sprawling complex of chain-link pens
called Crane City. As they walk past, cranes of all types bow and hop and stalk warily. The aggressive Siberian cranes bugle louder
than the others. A human-imprinted sarus crane dances flirtatiously, springing joyously in the air toward the passersby while her
ignored mate seems to pout.
<P>

Crane City is off-limits to the 35,000 visitors who stop each year at the private International Crane Foundation, which is home to
about 130 cranes, 34 of which are whoopers. Tourists can see splendid pairs of all 15 species of the world's cranes, including the
famous Gee Whiz, at the well-designed visitors center -- it's the only place in the world that displays all 15 species. But the
breeding efforts in Crane City are considered too important to risk disturbance.
<P>

Even the staffers aren't allowed to show themselves to the chicks destined for release in the wild unless they are performing
something unpleasant, such as a veterinary check. Those chicks must remain afraid of humans. For the most part,
they are reared in isolation, either by adult cranes or, commonly, by costumed handlers.
<P>

The handlers play crane sounds on a tape recorder and feed their fuzzy charges with plastic Dairy Queen spoons held in the beaks of
realistic crane puppets. They stab the puppet beaks into the ground to simulate searching for insects and tender plants. When an
airplane or predatory bird flies overhead, they even run and stand in a tiny pond in an alert position, teaching the chicks how they
should protect themselves.
<P>

Whooping cranes aren't easy to keep. They tend to fall prey to illness and accidents, perhaps because of the inbreeding
inevitable with such small numbers. Like other cranes, they can be particular about their love lives. It often takes several
attempts at matchmaking before they agree to bond and mate, regardless of what the meticulously managed whooping crane stud book
indicates would be best for the species.
<P>

For instance, a female whooper named Ginger wanted nothing to do with her prospective beau, Woody. She apparently thought the
mild-mannered crane was a wimp and tried to beat him up. She settled down happily, however, once she was put together with tough-guy
Napoleon.
<P>

ICF caretakers must coddle their charges, protecting them from each other and from such scary creatures as hot-air balloons, while
never letting their guard down around raking claws. Several staffers, most of whom are young, low-paid and dedicated, have scars on
their arms and legs.
<P>

Most of the time, they protect themselves from adult cranes by waving brooms or squirting water hoses. But to get close, such as during artificial insemination attempts, they opt for bizarre cowboy costumes with leather chaps and plastic
goggles. One massages the male's legs, and the other collects the semen in a shot glass. A well-aimed syringe and a back massage do
the trick for the receiving female. Artificial insemination is used often to produce genetically diverse chicks from a
variety of couples without disrupting the lifelong bonds between mates.
<P>

In the wild, whoopers lay only one or two eggs a year. In captivity, they lay as many as 11. To inspire the multiple efforts,
staffers remove the laid eggs from the pen and turn on artificial lights for long periods of time, which tricks the cranes into
thinking that it is the right season for laying eggs.<B></B>
<P>

Veterinarian Langenberg, an upbeat and earthy sort, is working to develop a technique for identifying the sex of a chick while
it's still in the egg. Researchers haven't abandoned the idea of cross-fostering whoopers by placing their eggs in sandhill nests.
Female whoopers seem to suffer less of an identity crisis than do males that cross-foster. So the thought is that the female
whoopers could learn to migrate from their sandhill parents and then could teach, and hopefully mate with, male whoopers introduced
later.
<P>

"I stop and think sometime, `Oh my God, I am one of the few people in the world that ever gets to touch one of these things,"
Langenberg says, taking a momentary break in the humid, windowless room where eggs are kept warm in wooden incubators. "Everything I
do, any mistake I make, could make a huge statistical difference in the world population. It's a huge privilege to be working with
them, but it's also a huge responsibility."
<P>


<P>

The Texas coast currently is the winter home for 158 wild whooping cranes. That's exactly the same number as last year's
record high. Canada's nesting grounds were a little dry this year, which may have contributed to the flat numbers.
<P>

"We sure were hoping for an increase," admits Aransas biologist Stehn. But he isn't too disappointed. He looks forward to results of
the upcoming migration experiment in Idaho and planning for the third flock. For encouragement, all he has to do is compare the tiny flocks that used to be at Aransas with today's thriving population.
<P>

Fifteen years ago, it took him 3&#189;hours to fly over the habitat and count each crane. Now it takes 7&#189; hours. The birds have
multiplied and spread out so that one-third of them live outside the refuge on private marshlands.
<P>

They'll stay in Texas at least through the end of March. Then, a family or two at a time, they'll head north to Canada. The
2,500-mile trip will take two to six weeks, including the several days they'll probably spend at a favorite rest stop, the Platte
River in Nebraska.
<P>

Joining the flock will be a certain crane couple whose torrid past no doubt is still the subject of tour operator Appell's rousing
annual spiel on the Texas marsh.
<P>

It seems, in this case at least, that the traditional crane value of lifelong love has reasserted itself in last year's divorc&eacute;s.
<P>

"They're back together," Stehn says, grinning. "It's a happily-ever-after story."
<P>

For now, it certainly seems to be, both for the wayward pair and for their species as a whole. As Captain Ted would say, maybe there
is hope for this ol' world after all.

<I>Port Aransas is hosting a whooping crane festival beginning Thursday. A Celebration of Whooping Cranes and Other
Birds, through March 2, will feature boat trips to see the cranes as well as photo exhibits, photo classes and seminars
with birding experts. International Crane Foundation co-founder George Archibald will speak Friday. Admission is $5, and
whooping crane boat tours cost $20. For details, call 800-45-COAST.</I> 
<P>

<I>To join the effort to save whooping cranes, call the Whooping Crane Conservation Association at
318-228-7563. </I>
