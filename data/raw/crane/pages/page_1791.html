        </b><font size="2">The return of a migratory flock of whooping cranes 
        to eastern North America took a major step forward with the publication 
        of the final rule allowing for establishment of an experimental nonessential 
        population of whooping cranes in 20 eastern states. Ten birds were shipped 
        to Wisconsin in July to begin ultralight training for a migration to Florida.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Wood Buffalo 
        National Park, a record 52 nesting pairs hatched 44 chicks, but only 14 
        fledged. In captivity, production totaled 29 chicks at four breeding centers.</font></p>

        BUFFALO POPULATION</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following 
        the loss of 6 cranes during the 2000-2001 winter, flock size in spring, 
        2001 was 174 whooping cranes, a net decrease of 13 from the 187 present 
        the previous spring and a disappointing drop from the record 188 present 
        in the 1999-2000 winter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Wally 
        Jobman of the USFWS Ecological Services office in Grand Island, Nebraska 
        recorded migration sightings reported during the spring migration, the 
        52nd migration monitored since the tracking project began in the fall 
        of 1975. The following is from the spring, 2001 cooperative whooping crane 
        tracking project report.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Departures 
        from Aransas were about average (i.e., the majority of departures normally 
        occur between April 4 and 12). The initial major departure of cranes occurred 
        on April 2 and 3, with all but 21 cranes having migrated by April 17. 
        The single bird present at Aransas on April 27... eventually migrated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The first 
        dates recorded for confirmed observations of migrating whooping cranes 
        were March 23 in the U.S. and April 18 in Canada. The last sighting date 
        was June 18. Sightings were reported from Texas (2); Kansas (2); Nebraska 
        (6); South Dakota (1); North Dakota (5); Saskatchewan, (23); Alberta, 
        (2), and Manitoba (1)..... No confirmed sightings were reported in Oklahoma.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With the 
        exception of three birds reported in west Texas during February, an early 
        migrant confirmed in Nebraska on March 23, and a late migrant reported 
        in North Dakota on June 11, all of the sightings in the United States 
        were reported between April 5 and 25....In spite of variable weather conditions, 
        the crane migration progressed quickly. Consequently, only 16 sightings 
        were confirmed in the United States, the least number of spring sightings 
        reported since the 1990 spring migration, when only 14 sightings were 
        reported.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 57 years 
        of data in the whooping crane migration sightings database provide a descriptive 
        summary of whooping crane migration over a large geographic region. A 
        report by Jane Austin and Amy Richert was completed in May entitled A 
        Comprehensive Review of Observational and Site Evaluation Data of Migrant 
        Whooping Cranes in the United States, 1943-99. Results confirmed findings 
        of previous migration work and also provided new insight into whooping 
        crane habitat use. Palustrine wetlands accounted for more than 75% of 
        records in all states except Nebraska, where riverine systems were also 
        used extensively. Private ownership accounted for more than 60% of all 
        sites used by whooping cranes. The authors also provided recommendations 
        on data limitations, needs for further information, and survey protocol 
        for future monitoring of whooping cranes during migration.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May, Canadian 
        whooping crane coordinator Brian Johns located a record 52 nests in Wood 
        Buffalo National Park, one more than last summer. At least five pairs 
        failed to nest. Water levels were high, providing what appeared to be 
        excellent habitat conditions. Production surveys were flown in June in 
        the USFWS Region 2 aircraft piloted by Jim Bredy, with observers Brian 
        Johns and Tom Stehn. Production totaled 44 chicks, including 11 sets of 
        twins. However, survival was very disappointing, with only 14 single young 
        located in August. Thus, with annual losses averaging around a dozen adults 
        between spring and fall, the population cannot be expected to increase 
        much from the 174 present in the spring. The decrease in the population 
        last winter and this summer's disappointing results fit the predicted 
        10-year drop in the whooping crane population that occurs at the start 
        of every decade, with a low for the decade predicted mathematically for 
        2001. This 10-year cycle in whooping cranes is totally unexplained, although 
        weather research may show a 10-year cycle in Pacific ocean surface temperatures 
        that affects climate and precipitation for North America. However, the 
        10-year cycle does not appear to fit with precipitation data from Ft. 
        Smith, N.W.T., or water levels in Wood Buffalo National Park.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">German crane 
        vocalization expert Dr. Bernhard Wessling completed analysis of calls 
        he recorded at Aransas last winter and will compare them with calls from 
        12 pairs recorded by Brian Johns in Wood Buffalo in August. Dr. Wessling 
        has recorded about 40 different pairs at Aransas. Results look promising 
        to match pairs on their summer and winter territories without having to 
        capture and band the birds. Observations in the fall in Saskatchewan and 
        at Aransas indicated the &quot;Lobstick&quot; male had lost a metal band, 
        leaving this 23-year-old crane unbanded. Dr. Wessling's recorded calls 
        from the Lobstick pair the past two winters proved that the Lobstick male 
        was still present.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The drought 
        at Aransas continued throughout the spring and summer. Heavy rains August 
        26-31 brought some relief. In a six-day period, the refuge received 8.5 
        inches of rain. The town of Tivoli located 15 miles north of Aransas received 
        an unofficial total of 22 inches which flooded the Guadalupe River bottoms. 
        This was a most welcome sight since freshwater inflows on the Guadalupe 
        River are needed to aid blue crab reproduction. The human reduction of 
        freshwater inflows is a huge threat to the whooping crane that could lead 
        to extinction. Data from the last eight winters indicates a direct relationship 
        between freshwater inflows on the Guadalupe River, blue crab populations, 
        and whooping crane survival. When inflows are high, blue crabs populations 
        increase due to enhanced reproduction and survival, and whooping crane 
        mortality is low. With reduced inflows, crabs do poorly and whooping crane 
        mortality rises dramatically. This makes sense since blue crabs make up 
        80-90% of the whooping crane diet. In 2 of the last 8 winters when crabs 
        were scarce, whooping crane mortality was 7 and 6 birds, respectively. 
        In the other 6 winters with adequate crab populations, whooping crane 
        mortality was only 0 or 1 bird annually. Also, whooping cranes have to 
        fly to seek out freshwater to drink which forces them to use energy whenever 
        marsh salinities, which are affected directly by inflows, exceed 23 parts 
        per thousand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With projections 
        over the next 50 years that human uses of water will reduce inflows and 
        decrease blue crab populations by at least 8 %, this is going to have 
        an alarming impact on whooping cranes. With the population of Texas predicted 
        to double in the next 50 years, the Texas legislature has initiated a 
        state-wide water planning effort. As water developers plan to take water 
        from the rivers, there is no direct mechanism in Texas water law to provide 
        freshwater inflows to the bays and estuaries. Basically, the bays get 
        whatever is leftover, and portions of Texas rivers are already over-appropriated. 
        The Rio Grande River made national news this summer when its flows no 
        longer reached the Gulf of Mexico.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. 
        Fish and Wildlife Service must take a strong stand on the </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">inflow/whooping 
        crane issue. All conservation groups need to do all in their power to 
        ensure that adequate inflows from the Guadalupe River reach the bays. 
        The Service has written a letter of support for the San Marcos River Foundation's 
        application for 1.15 million acre-feet of water that would remain in the 
        river for wildlife. This is the amount of water identified by Texas Parks 
        and Wildlife Department needed to keep the bays productive. The San Marcos 
        River Foundation's water rights application is an important step in ensuring 
        inflows on the Guadalupe reach the bays. It would be precedent setting 
        in Texas for a water right to be designated as an inflow. Water developers 
        are contesting the application. They are saying that human needs for water 
        are too great and that there isn't enough water available to provide the 
        water identified by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department study. This 
        issue has everyone's attention, and support is needed if the San Marcos 
        River Foundation's application is to be successful.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Work continued 
        between Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, the Nature Conservancy of Texas, 
        and local landowner Al Johnson to protect 829 acres of his property on 
        the Lamar Peninsula. The parcel includes 245 acres of salt marsh and a 
        wintering whooping crane pair. The Nature Conservancy has applied for 
        a grant that should provide nearly &frac12; the funding needed. Efforts 
        to fund the remainder through the federal Lands and Waters Conservation 
        Act fell just short in a competition with proposed acquisition projects 
        nationwide. Mitigation for gas well construction near whooping crane habitat 
        at Welder Flats is being pursued that could provide some funding.</font></p>

        CRANE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP (WCEP) <br>
        (web site: www.bringbackthecranes.org)<br>
        </b>In a historic event, 10 whooping cranes shipped from Patuxent to Wisconsin 
        on July 10th marked the return of whooping cranes to Wisconsin which had 
        been extirpated since 1878. Much hard work by many individuals from multiple 
        organizations led up to this event. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft 
        rule to establish a nonessential experimental (NEP) population of whooping 
        cranes in 20 eastern states was published March 9. A national news media 
        teleconference was held on that day that stressed the role of the partnership 
        and the consensus behind the proposed action. A delegation from WCEP made 
        a presentation to the Flyway Council meetings in mid-March to gain their 
        final support. Public hearings were held the first week in April in Crystal 
        River, FL, Nashville, TN, Indianapolis, IN, and Stevens Point, WI. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conference 
        calls continued in May to resolve several issues involved with finalizing 
        the NEP rule. These included whether to include northeastern states within 
        the NEP area, and the management for eastern whooping cranes that may 
        stray into the Central Flyway. After much discussion, the northeast states 
        were excluded from the NEP designation, primarily for procedural reasons. 
        Also, eastern NEP whooping cranes that leave the designated 20-state NEP 
        area become fully endangered. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A contingency 
        plan will be written with the Central Flyway to manage eastern whooping 
        cranes that stray into the Central Flyway. However, there will be no federally-mandated 
        hunting closures to protect eastern whooping cranes regardless of their 
        location. After summarizing and responding to public comments received, 
        the final rule was submitted to Albuquerque in mid-May and forwarded on 
        to Washington June 1. The submission package also included the Environmental 
        Assessment and Biological Opinion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Final project 
        documents can be found on the web site http://midwest.fws.gov/whoopingcrane. 
        The final rule was signed and became law on June 26, just in time to move 
        whooping cranes to Wisconsin to start flight training behind the ultralight. 
        A press conference was held July 2 at Patuxent to publicize the rule. 
        Present were numerous partners including USFWS Acting Director Marshall 
        Jones. The following day, a smaller group met briefly with Secretary of 
        the Interior Gayle Norton and presented her with project-related gifts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Events at 
        Chassahowitzka NWR in Florida to get ready for the wintering cranes included 
        field trips in March and May to select a release site. Plans were made 
        to construct a release pen and carry out prescribed burns to make the 
        habitat more attractive for the cranes. Summer rains lowered release site 
        salinities to around 15 parts per thousand, making it more suitable for 
        cranes, down dramatically from the 31 ppt present during the late spring 
        drought. A written project agreement with the State of Florida was finalized 
        and signed in May. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results from 
        the 2000 ultralight sandhill migration project were very encouraging. 
        The migration between Wisconsin and Florida behind the ultralight had 
        taken 40 days, and was the longest human-led bird migration ever completed. 
        Ten of the 11 ultralight sandhills that wintered at St Martin's Marsh 
        Aquatic Preserve in Florida started the spring migration on February 25. 
        One bird that was low in the social order and had not always made local 
        flights with the other sandhills stayed behind, but after food was withheld 
        for a few days, this crane started migration on March 17. All the ultralight 
        sandhills then put on quite a disappearing act, an encouraging sign that 
        they were showing proper wild behavior. The flock was finally located 
        on April 27 at Necedah NWR in Wisconsin. The birds had unerringly completed 
        the migration to the exact location where they had fledged. Nine of the 
        10 that had left Florida in a group were present; one was missing. One 
        of the ultralight sandhills was subsequently re-captured and the radio 
        replaced. The single sandhill that had stayed behind in Florida showed 
        up June 22 in North Carolina where it was lured into a shed by a farmer. 
        The bird was taken to a rehabilitator and later driven back to Wisconsin. 
        After diagnosing a chronic inflammatory disease and a continuing respiratory 
        gurgle and swelling around the head, the bird was euthanized. This chronic 
        disease explains the tame behavior exhibited by the bird in North Carolina. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After wintering 
        in Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee, all eight Cohort 3 birds that were 
        released one at a time last summer into flocks of wild sandhills in Wisconsin 
        successfully returned to Central Wisconsin the following spring. Some 
        returned precisely to Necedah where they had been raised. Also, the one 
        sandhill that split off from the ultralight-led migration while still 
        in Wisconsin over-wintered successfully in Deltona, Florida and returned 
        to Necedah on April 27th.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In late winter, 
        several credible reports of whooping cranes in Wisconsin were received, 
        but none could be confirmed. A pair of whooping cranes was reported March 
        1 at Naperville, Illinois (27 miles west of Chicago), and two independent 
        reports made from different locations near Saukville, WI (20 miles north 
        of Milwaukee) on March 13. It sure seemed like a pair of whooping cranes, 
        possibly from the Florida population, had headed north and were migrating 
        along Lake Michigan. One photograph taken May 4 of a single bird west 
        of Appleton, Wisconsin at the Rat River Wildlife Area sure looked like 
        a whooper, but could not be confirmed. Follow-up visits to the area, including 
        a search by helicopter, failed to find the reported whooper.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At Necedah 
        NWR, a photo blind was constructed as a joint project between Friends 
        of Necedah and the refuge. This blind provides excellent views of flight 
        training at Site # 1 and photo opportunities. Training of the 10 whooping 
        cranes proceeded on schedule with the birds making a 6-minute flight behind 
        the ultralight in early September. Once the cranes fledged, they were 
        allowed some time out of the pens in the natural marsh environment. Problems 
        encountered during the summer involved the water in the pens, which in 
        an effort to provide the birds wetland habitat, created pools with extremely 
        high coliform bacteria counts. Impoundment water levels were lowered to 
        remove water from the pens. Tests showed that the pans used to supply 
        the cranes with drinking water also had high bacteria counts. Solar pumps 
        will be purchased to provide a small flow of fresh water through the pens 
        to try to reduce bacteria problems. The cranes had to be treated for tracheal 
        worms and as usual received preventive treatment for coccidia. An outbreak 
        of eastern equine encephalitis occurred in Wisconsin 150 miles from Necedah, 
        so the whooping cranes were vaccinated for EEE. The first ever cases of 
        west nile virus in Wisconsin were documented in crows. A decision was 
        made not to vaccinate the whoopers for WNV because the vaccine was untested 
        in birds, and cranes are apparently not very susceptible to WNV. In the 
        fall, Patuxent and the National Wildlife Health Center will conduct experiments 
        on sandhill cranes to learn about WNV in cranes and whether the vaccine 
        is effective. The migration of the whooping cranes from Wisconsin to Florida 
        is scheduled to start some time around mid-October. Fund raising has continued 
        to be a big effort for WCEP. Although a funding shortfall still exists, 
        enough has been raised to ensure the migration will take place this fall. 
        A donor appreciation event is being planned at Necedah NWR on September 
        26, followed by two days of WCEP meetings. Project documents completed 
        by WCEP included the roles and responsibilities of WCEP, along with whooping 
        crane training, handling, banding, disposition, and health protocols. 
        One of the ultralight whooping cranes at Necedah NWR died presumably from 
        capture myopathy following health checks and banding on September 11.</font></p>

        </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
        estimated 75 whooping cranes are alive in Florida at the end of August, 
        including 14 pairs. This number could be higher if any of the 10 birds 
        unaccounted for from the 1999-2000 winter releases show up. One of these 
        birds showed up near Gainesville in early September. A batch of faulty 
        radio transmitters placed on the 99-00 releases has made tracking problematical. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The drought 
        in Florida greatly hampered the 2001 nesting season for both the non-migratory 
        whooping cranes as well as Florida sandhills. Despite probably the worst 
        habitat conditions for cranes in 25 years, two whooping crane pairs nested, 
        but no eggs hatched. The eggs were infertile in one of the nests, and 
        were lost from unknown causes from the other nest about half way through 
        incubation. Nesting totals for the past three years are 7 nests containing 
        eggs from 6 different pairs, but no chick has fledged. During the summer, 
        wetlands re-filled from summer thunderstorms and tropical storm Barry, 
        with water levels closer to but still below average levels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Survival 
        of cranes released in the 2000-01 winter continued to be good. Pelleted 
        food was provided to these birds for a much longer period to limit dispersal 
        during the drought. Of the 21 birds released in Polk County in 3 cohorts, 
        18 have survived. Documented losses were from alligator (1) and bobcat 
        (2). One of the losses involved a bird presumably being affected by some 
        illness that was acting tame in a suburban setting trying to get into 
        a screened swimming pool. One bird was taken into captivity so it could 
        recover from an unidentified setback and was released after eight days. 
        At least 16 adult/subadult whooping cranes underwent simultaneous molting 
        of their flight feathers. One subadult was apparently taken by a bobcat 
        while flightless.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 10 birds 
        missing from 1999-2000 winter releases, 4 may have dispersed into Georgia 
        (unconfirmed sighting), and one unpaired 4-year-old male moved to Virginia 
        in early May, but returned to Florida by the end of June. The female that 
        summered in Michigan in 2000 remained with other whooping cranes in central 
        Florida in 2001.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One female 
        (# 514) captured from the wild in summer 2000 and held at Lowry Park since 
        fall 2000 continues to do well. The bird was brailled following regrowth 
        of flight feathers. After discussions about whether to try to release 
        her back to the wild, she will be keep in captivity for genetic reasons, 
        a shortage of females in captivity, and concerns about how she might behave 
        in the wild after being in captivity for a year.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plans were 
        made to form one cohort of cranes at ICF scheduled to be released in Florida 
        at the end of November. The cohort will consist of 1 bird from ICF, 3 
        from Calgary, and 1 from the San Antonio Zoo. The Calgary and San Antonio 
        chicks were shipped to ICF by commercial air on August 30.</font></p>

        since one captive sandhill crane in Connecticut died from WNV.</font></p>

        75 days in jail, received two and a half years probation, loss of driving 
        privileges and daily curfew imposed during probation, and will provide 
        200 hours of community service. Initially charged with two counts of taking 
        a species of special concern and taking wildlife from a county right of 
        way, charges were increased to a felony taking of an endangered species 
        after the young man was subsequently involved with vandalism of shooting

        Well, the two recovery programs have interesting parallels. The last condors 
        were removed from the wild more than 15 years ago. In March 2001, 59 captive-bred 
        condors survived in the wild, with 101 in captivity. This spring, reintroduced 
        condors laid eggs in the wild for the first time, but none hatched. A 
        replacement egg from captivity hatched, but the chick was killed by one 
        of the adult females. In both cranes and condors, the delayed sexual maturity 
        and slow reproductive rates make recovery efforts very difficult. There 
        has still been no chicks fledged from condors or whooping cranes reintroduced 
        back into the wild, although this milestone hopefully will occur in the
