      <p><strong>City of Wuhan</strong> </p>

      <p>The city of Wuhan has a population of over 7 million, which makes it 

        the fifth largest city in China and one of the top 35 cities in the world. 

        It is ideally located for study of China&#8217;s environmental conditions. 

        Wuhan is located on the Yangtze River, at a major confluence with the 

        Han River. The Yangtze River is the largest river in China. It is the 

        fourth longest river in the world, the fifth largest in total discharge, 

        and the twelfth largest in drainage area. Its discharge is twice the size 

        of the Mississippi River. Wuhan is known as the City on Rivers, with approximately 

        25 percent of the area of the city consisting of either rivers or lakes. 

        Wuhan is rich in culture and history. Wuhan's civilization began about 

        3,500 years ago and is of great importance in Chinese cultural, military, 

        economic and political history. Today, Wuhan ranks third in China in activity 

        related to science and technology. Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei 

        Province which has a population of 57 million, almost twice the population 

        of California in half of the land area of California. The latitude of 

        Wuhan is the same as that of Jacksonville, FL and Austin, TX. Average 

        daily low and high temperatures in July are 76 and 90 degrees F and in 

        December are 34 and 49 degrees F. </p>

      <p>Approximately 175 miles west of Wuhan on the Yangtze River is the site 
        of the famous Three Gorges Dam, one of the largest civil engineering construction 
        projects in the world. This 15-year-long construction project is scheduled 
        for full operation in 2009. It is causing major environmental and ecological 
        changes which will be monitored and studied for years to come. We will 
        visit the Three Gorges Dam and take an extended tour of the river as part 
        of the 2005 program.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Wuhan University </strong></p>

      <p>The local hosts for our program at Wuhan University are the School of 
        Resource and Environmental Science and the College of Foreign Student 
        Education. Wuhan University (www.whu.edu.cn/en) is one of the top ten 
        universities in China. It is a comprehensive university with all major

        located on the picturesque Luojia Hill overlooking the famous East Lake.</p>

      <p>Wuhan University has organized its environmental-related education and 

        research activities into an Environmental Disciplinary Group consisting 

        of departments from the School of Resource and Environmental Science, 

        College of Civil and Architectural Engineering, School of Water Resource 

        and Hydropower, College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, College of 

        Life Sciences, School of Information Engineering and Remote Sensing, Law 

        School and Business School. Disciplines include environmental engineering, 

        environmental chemistry, environmental biology and ecology, environmental 

        geosciences, environmental planning and management, resource and environmental 

        law, environmental economy and environmental information. Wuhan University
