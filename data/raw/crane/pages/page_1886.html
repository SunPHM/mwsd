Baraboo, Wisconsin has a captive flock at the InternationalCrane Foundation. Whooping Cranes are the tallest birds in NorthAmerica. They are 60 inches tall, weigh about 15 pounds, and thewingspan is 7 1/2 feet. A chick is a reddish color, but soon thefeathers turn white and the head is red and black. This bird got it'sname because the call is a shrill bugle-like trumpeting. These birdsneed 300-400 acres of shallow wetlands and wet grasslands to findenough food and nesting areas. Cranes look for berries, minnows,crabs and rodents to eat. Much of the land they need is beingreplaced with farmland. We need to take of these birds so they do notbecome extinct.</H2><H2><CENTER>By Jim</CENTER></H2><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER><P>&nbsp;<A HREF="../26/j26.html">&nbsp;Return to Class WebPage</A></P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
