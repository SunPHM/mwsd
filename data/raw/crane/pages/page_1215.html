 <p>On November 30, 2002 we went for a walk in Chinatown. It occupies a small, and shrinking, patch of the central business district of Washington about 6 blocks north of the Mall. Just a couple of blocks between G and H Streets and and 7th and 9th Streets are where you'll find the restaurants and storefronts designated with the Chinese characters that are so familiar in their incomprehensibility. </p> 

<p>To digress for a moment on the designation of streets in the District of Columbia. The numbered streets run north/south, for the most part, and the lettered or named streets run east/west. The point of origin for both letters and numbers is the Capitol Building. The baselines for the grid are north Capitol Street, East Capitol Street and South Capitol Street. (There is no West Capitol Street, it's the Mall, bounded on the north by Constitution Avenue and on the south by Independence Avenue.) First, Second, Third and so on streets step off numerically east and west from North and South Capitol Streets and on the north and south of East Capitol Street, A, B, C and so on Streets step alphabetically further away from the baseline. You may be thinking, "Oh, oh! If he told me to meet him in Chinatown, at the corner of H and 8th, I've got 4 choices, each about a mile away from the other. Help!" </p>

<p>But not to worry, the baselines of the various Capitol Streets delineate four quadrants called, naturally enough, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest. Suddenly it all becomes much simpler to navigate. It's very important when getting addresses to be sure you discover which quadrant the address is located in. Even if the planners, in their wisdom, hadn't eliminated J and X,Y and Z Streets there still wouldn't be enough letters in the alphabet to designate all the streets it takes to fill the more than 7 miles from the center of the District all the way up to the north point. So, once you drive north or south past W Street, you're back to more conventionally named streets. We hadn't been told beforehand and it was, therefore, a delightful discovery when we recognized that these named streets are also organized alphabetically! </p>

<p>Now, before you start thinking that it's so easy that you'll be bored by the regimented gridiron, remember all those diagonal streets running roughly 30 degrees off the horizontal and vertical. These tend to behave rather independently, changing direction unexpectedly, much like the states after which they are named. Add to this the topographical challenges of hills and valleys, the irregular green intrusion known as Rock Creek Park, a few resolutely cursive swank neighborhoods in upper Northwest, the Anacostia River and some venerable footpaths-turned-four-lanes and you have a pretty interesting city to get around in.</p>
 
<p> After reading all this, you may not have to be patient while the images of our stroll through Chinatown load.</p>

The Subway is probably familiar throughout the westernizing world, but its neighbor the "Capitol Q, Texan BBQ" may indeed be unique in the world. And both have integrated, or been integrated by, the locally prevailing Chinese culture.</p>

	  <p align="center">The gate of Chinatown spans H Street at 7th in anachronistic contrast to the three hammerhead construction cranes that loom over it. There must be some local version of air-traffic control when all three of these are swinging things around together. The project they're building is called Gallery Place and will have a street-level facade of Oriental shops and a hulking block of who knows what inside. A safe guess would be more offices.</p>

	  <p align="center">Now this is one of the reasons for today's visit to Chinatown. Not that we wanted any of this particular batch of snakeskin, beetle bits, twigs and seeds you see prepared in the traditional style of the Chinese Apothecary. We were looking for some tea and Curing Pills, which are a sort of tonic. We found them, in a box labeled "Culing Pill", leading to speculation about what's lost and gained in translations and the charming Oriental habit of pronouncing "L" as "R". </p>

	<p align="center">The future has already come to this southwest corner of H and 8th, but for this freshly-painted little holdover from a hundred years ago. Notice the man in the red coat under the nearest red tree? That little speck is connected to the woman behind the camera. As much dark amusement as it may provide to see the changing cityscape as a struggle between the beautiful and the bland, the rugged individual and the corporate Leviathan, what we're witnessing, from a larger perspective, is simply an evolutionary process. And isn't it nice that the great big building has windows in the wall bracketing the little wee building? To us, this strongly suggests that, when the little place eventually goes, there will be something more beautiful in its place.</p>
