<P>We’ve just returned from the stimulating Midwest Birding
Symposium 2001, held in Green Bay from Aug. 30 to Sept 2, and our
minds and hearts are still overflowing with just about every
imaginable aspect of birds, watching, studying and enjoying them.
The primary themes of this conference were backyard birdwatching,
identification, wetland habitats and their birds, optics and
photography of birds, and natural history and environment in
general.

<P>These exciting symposiums, which have rapidly been gaining in
popularity, are held every two years somewhere in the Midwest.
Each chosen site hosts the large meeting twice in succession.  In
other words, the next event will be staged again in Green Bay
from Sept. 14-17, 2003 with a new roster of speakers and field
trips.  The primary theme of the next symposium will be Migratory
Upland Birds in Peril.

<P>One of several reasons we attended this extravaganza for
birdwatchers was to lead two of the many early morning field
trips.  Our 6 a.m. assignment for both Friday and Saturday
mornings was to take early risers to the Barkhausen Brown County
Park a few miles north of Green Bay.  This large park includes an
amazing diversity of habitats including lowland and upland
forests, marsh, prairie and waterfowl impoundments.

<P>It was wonderful having some excellent birders in the group
because many pairs of eyes helped immensely in locating 49 bird
species on Friday morning and 59 on Saturday.  Highlights on
Friday included very close looks at lesser and greater
yellowlegs, providing the watchers with a perfect chance to
compare these two easily-confused long-legged shorebirds.  Other
shorebirds seen included the stilt sandpiper, short-billed
dowitcher, least sandpiper and killdeer.

<P>Being able to carefully watch the intricate food-finding
antics and the awesome beauty of snowy egrets was a
never-to-be-forgotten thrill.  What good looks we had of their
so-called &quot;golden slippers.&quot;  Soon there were several
pure white great egrets majestically soaring back and forth to
the front of the early birders as though they wanted nothing more
than to have a close look at us beady-eyed birdwatchers, perhaps
the first they had ever experienced in their lives.

<P>Close viewing through spotting scopes of a Virginia rail, wood
ducks in their unusual eclipse plumages, a black-billed cuckoo,
ten different species of warblers, green herons and many
black-crowned night-herons and others made these field trips
adventures to remember and savor.  Charlotte and I, along with
many other birders from throughout the country, were so glad to
be introduced to new places to watch birds and study nature at
its finest, areas we will want to return to again and again.

<P>The Thursday evening keynote speaker was Kenn Kaufman, author
of the fine new Birds of North America field guide.  He spoke
about the secret lives of birds and birders and surely attracted
a long line of a few hundred people patiently waiting for him to
autograph their new Kaufman field guide.

<P>Friday morning’s keynote speaker was Peter Stangel who spoke
about the Future of Birds.  His fast-paced slide presentation
addressed one of the most pressing conservation issues of our
time: the decline and future conservation of the approximately
350 species of Neotropical migratory birds including many birds
that all of us enjoy in Wisconsin every summer.  He assured the
audience that we still have all the &quot;pieces of the
puzzle,&quot; but now we must put them together.  As Laura
Erickson, one of t he workshop leaders at the meeting, reminded
her listeners, &quot;There is no way that people in the U.S. are
required to learn about birds.&quot;  This further established
determination among the symposium audience to begin immediately
in helping to correct the situation.

<P>Collectively, the fifty to sixty million people in the U.S.
who enjoy birds should be able to and must help with the growing
problem.  An important challenge that is being addressed is
bringing together people from Central and South American, winter
homes for many birds, and those people residing in North America.
The world today has so many facts at hand, along with excellent
technology, telling us what the status of birds is – but – how do
we get this across to the masses of people.  One of the exciti ng
programs underway is called Partners In Flight.

<P>Another thought-provoking challenge Mr. Stangel offered to his
rapt listeners was, &quot;Not on my watch will I allow any of the
world’s birds to become extinct.&quot;  In other words, do all
you are physically capable of doing while you are here on earth
(performing your watch) to prevent a single species of bird to
become extinct.

<P>How we wished we could magically have been four or five
persons at the same time in order to attend all of the excellent
workshops held during the day.  And by the way, one of the
workshops dealt with butterflies and how to attract them, led by
Susan Borkin.

<P>Around 60 exhibitors, covering just about everything
imaginable dealing with birds, included nearly all of the major
binocular makers of the world.  What a perfect place this was to
actually try out the pair of binoculars, one of hundreds, that
will suit you the best.

<P>Mark your calendars for Sept. 14-17, 2003, and plan to attend
the next Midwest Birding Symposium.  You’ll be glad you did – and
so will the birds.
