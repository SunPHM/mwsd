Coerr wrote “Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes” with lots of emotion and
feelings. In the beginning of the book I knew it had something to do with a bad
thing that happened a long time ago, and it was the Atom Bomb that was dropped
in Hiroshima, Japan. Sadako was alive when it happened in Hiroshima. This
eleven-year-old Japanese girl got leukemia, a horrible disease, from the atom
bomb. Sadako went to the hospital because she was dizzy and then was very weak.
She tried to make one thousand paper cranes for a miracle, but she only folded
644. Sadako then died which was extremely upsetting. Her country made a statue
of her, which I thought was very respectful. Her classmates also folded 356
paper cranes to go with Sadako’s to make one thousand. They buried the cranes
with Sadako to show respect for her.</font></b></p>

I felt sad that Sadako had leukemia because leukemia was a fatal disease . I
think it was horrible that the U.S. air force dropped the Atom Bomb because the
war was almost over and Sadako and others wouldn't have died. I thought that
when Sadako's classmates buried her with the cranes it was a very respectful and
honorable thing to do.&nbsp;</font></b></p>

a sad book because Sadako dies in the last chapter. Sadako dies reaching up
trying to touch her golden paper crane. Sadako made a friend who also had
leukemia named Kenji who died a few days after she met him. My aunt Nancy died
because of cancer. I think that the Atom bomb disease made the people who had it
feel bad to know that people who had the disease had died. The Atom bomb was
dropped in 1945. My&nbsp; strongest image was when she fell down, and fell down
again when she tried to get up.&nbsp;</font></font></b></p>

day Sadako met a new friend his name was Kenji. Sadako found out that Kenji was
9 and got leukemia from the Atom bomb too! He got the Atom bomb disease from his
mother. She had the poison radiation all through her body. Sadako decided to
make Kenji a paper crane for a good luck charm. The next day Kenji died alone in
his empty hospital room. Sadako was crying her poor eyes out. She felt like her
