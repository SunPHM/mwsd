<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><font size="2">The storm 
continued throughout the night, as you can see Razorback drug anchor and is 
pointing more to the Southwest.&nbsp; She's safe now with her 3 anchors holding 
tight.&nbsp; A cold front moved in from Russia.<br>
<br>
The barge was brought ashore to unload the 63 battery cells keeping the dead 
crane on the barge.&nbsp; This afternoon the replacement crane began clearing the 
way.<br>
<br>
By this time Savas had arrived with his film crew in hopes of catching the 
remaining 63 cells coming off the boat and&nbsp;the dive operations&nbsp;for propeller 
removal.&nbsp; It wasn't to be.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><font size="2">Master 
Chief Adnan was busy with the cleaning crew inside the boat cleaning the acid 
residue from the forward battery compartment and putting a 'spit shine' on the 
forward torpedo room.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><font size="2">Arif</font><font size="2"> 
and Mahir were negotiating the sale of the lead from the batteries with a local 
factory.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><font size="2">Meanwhile, 
Huseyin and I were making our first attempt at removing the starboard propeller, 
using the jacking device we'd designed yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawings are being developed 
to show the shaft to propeller assembly, complete with Dunce Cap, Pilgrim Nut 
and how the jacking device is installed.&nbsp; The jacking device' total weight is 
close to 25 pounds, there are four 1 1/4 inch studs that are 18&quot; long which 
screw into the face of the propeller over which a piece of 1 1/8&quot; plate steel is 
fitted.&nbsp; The plate, called a 'strong back', is held parallel to the face of the 
propeller with&nbsp;4 nuts. Another bolt is threaded through&nbsp;the center of the plate 
and is tightened against the&nbsp;shaft.&nbsp; The idea is&nbsp;as you&nbsp;tighten&nbsp;the center bolt 
it puts stress between the propeller and shaft to break the metal to metal 
lock.&nbsp; This is the idea, but what you have to picture is two guys who are 
neutrally buoyant, floating in fluid space, working with tools that tend to drag 
you to the bottom.&nbsp; It's quite comical.&nbsp; Add to this, the storm churned up all 
the muck from the bottom of the bay and visibility is only about a foot today.&nbsp; 
Now Huseyin doesn't speak much English, even after almost 2 years I don't speak 
a lot of Turkish but underwater we communicate quite well.&nbsp; To add to the humor, 
after we assembled the propeller&nbsp;removal device&nbsp;and began to tighten the jacking 
screw it became obvious we'd need some leverage.&nbsp; Next tool in the water was an 
8' length of pipe.&nbsp; Now that's a little unwieldy in a neutrally buoyant 
environment but team work prevailed.&nbsp; In nature, with every action there is an 
equal (in force)&nbsp;but opposite (in direction) reaction...... it is&nbsp;proved 
very&nbsp;true underwater.&nbsp; We turned and pounded and tugged and pulled to the point 
where we bent the piece of 1 1/8&quot; plate but still the propeller had not budged.&nbsp; 
Time to fall back&nbsp;to plan 'b'.&nbsp; If the crane had been available I'd have had an 
upward pull on the propeller to alleviate unnecessary friction holding the 
propeller (propeller weighs 758 Kg or 1650 lbs)&nbsp;to the shaft but..... It 
wasn't.&nbsp; Since it was obvious we were wasting our time in the cold waters I 
ended the dive for the day to make some wedges, a stiffer strong back and take a 
hot shower.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><font size="2">After 
warmed and fed, Mahir calls and says he looked a little closer at the shaft 
drawing.&nbsp; There was a note pointing to the back of the propeller (written in 
Turkish) that says 'These bolts are a problem'!&nbsp; It appears that this 
propeller-to-shaft joint is a little different than anyone I or he had ever come 
across before.&nbsp; It's held in place not only by the threaded 'pilgrim nut' on the 
end but also by several bolts on the front end that are hidden under a shroud or 
'fairwater'.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;"><font size="2">Lesson of 
the day, you have to laugh at yourself and everyday, no matter how much 
experience you have or how smart [you think]&nbsp;you are, there is something more to 
learn.</font></span></p>
