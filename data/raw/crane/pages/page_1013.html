      <p><font size="3">We provide timely and cost-effective solutions to our clients.  We achieve these results by analyzing our clients’ needs and specifically tailoring solutions to meet those needs.  While many lawyers treat every construction matter exactly the same, we do not.  Every client has different needs and goals.  It is only through a thorough understanding of those needs and goals that the most advantageous strategy can be conceived and implemented.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      We owe our success to stellar service.  For example, we set up meetings as soon as our clients can meet with us whether at the client’s residence, a job site or office.  We return all telephone calls and respond to all emails immediately.  Exemplary service is our standard.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      We also understand the anxiety associated with any construction dispute or injury.  Accordingly, when we meet with our clients, we educate the clients by outlining what will happen, what could happen, how long various phases should take, and the best strategy for achieving a successful resolution.  We keep our clients apprised of all developments and how each development affects the clients’ ultimate goals.  We believe providing clients with prompt, honest, and understandable information is essential to reducing anxiety and creating the best possible environment for the clients and the successful resolution of disputes.<br>

      </font><img src="images/lift.jpg" alt="lift.jpg (9966 bytes)" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="138"><font size="3">The unprecedented national construction activity has created a great need for experienced and effective construction lawyers and this need is not being met.  All too often, construction cases are handled by lawyers who happen to be friends or relatives of the parties involved.  Unfortunately, although these lawyers might have their clients’ best interests at heart, they simply do not have the expertise to handle these cases as competently and effectively as does someone who practices almost exclusively in this area.  Accordingly, these types of cases are frequently mishandled.  In fact, a significant percentage of our cases come from lawyers who either were discharged or have recognized the matter was beyond their area of competence.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      We understand the industry because of our experience.  This experience enables us to craft cost-effective strategies unique to each client’s needs.&nbsp;</font></td>
