&nbsp;Restructuring Eliminates Equipment Rental Division<br>
<font size="2">(Re-printed from Spring '87)</font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2">&nbsp;<font face="Comic Sans MS">Several 
million dollars worth of heavy construction equipment went on the auction block 
April 7 &amp; 8 as Helmkamp continued to shift the focus of it’s contracting 
business from heavy/highway to industrial, commercial and institutional clients. 
Forke Brothers, auctioneers, of Lincoln, NE., sold over 700 pieces of 
construction equipment including tractors, loaders, loader-back-hoes, cranes, 
trailers, trucks and assorted small tools and supplies.</font></font><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><img border="0" src="images/Sale1.jpg" align="left" width="269" height="177"></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The 
auction also marked the discontinuation of Helmkamp’s equipment rental division. 
The decline in the highway construction market in southwestern Illinois and the 
skyrocketing costs of liability insurance were foremost in the decision to 
dissolve that portion of the company.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">“There 
is a relative lessening of road construction in southwestern Illinois,” says Bob 
Koepke, associate director, Regional Research &amp; Development Services, Southern 
Illinois University of Edwardsville. “I-255 is nearly complete. 413 is projected 
but not funded. We will still see roads built, but not on the grand scale of 
255. It makes a lot of sense for a firm that wishes to survive to restructure 
its product. There’s no need to provide a service that isn’t going to be used.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">“ Good 
business adapt to reality,” Koepke adds. “Those that don’t, don’t stay in 
business.<img border="0" src="images/Sale2.jpg" width="349" height="247" align="right"> 
Helmkamp’s early recognition that a change has to be made is a positive 
statement about the management of the company.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Harry 
Fabick, President of John Fabick Tractor Co., Fenton, Mo., agrees. “With the 
changes in the economy on the Illinois side of the river, unloading their 
equipment was the best thing Helmkamp could do,” Fabick commented. “They had to 
reduce and regroup to take the best advantage of a changing economy and a 
shifting market.”</font></p>
