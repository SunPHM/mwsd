<font SIZE="2">
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redberry Lake, which is located in the heart
of Saskatchewan's aspen parkland near <a href="http://www3.sk.sympatico.ca/haflib/" target="_blank">Hafford</a>, is an area rich in wildlife.&nbsp; On the
shores, islands, and bays you are likely to observe ducks, geese, shorebirds,
pelicans, gulls, terns, and hundreds of other species of birds.&nbsp; It is a
very clear, saline lake which is turquoise in color.&nbsp; The area has wide
open beaches and two creeks which flow into the lake, but none which flow
out.&nbsp; Due to this phenomenon, the lake's salinity has been steadily
increasing.</font></p>

The Sanctuary</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water level of Redberry Lake has been dropping for 40
years now.&nbsp; Some of the islands which&nbsp; were once isolated are now connected to the
shore by sandbars.&nbsp; The remaining three islands are important to a number
of bird species who nest and raise their young there.&nbsp; However, dropping water
levels threaten the island's isolation.&nbsp; A sandbar has formed from Old Tern
Island, the former nesting colony, connecting it to the shore allowing predators onto the island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lake is an important spring and fall staging area for
migrating waterfowl.&nbsp; Canada Geese, Tundra Swans, and about 30,000 ducks
regularly come here to rest and feed during migration.&nbsp; Over 188 species of
birds have been recorded here, many of which nest in the area.&nbsp; Increasing
numbers of Canada Geese nest on Redberry Lake and in the surrounding district.&nbsp; Nine species found
at this location have been identified as
&quot;endangered, threatened, or rare&quot;, meaning their populations are in
jeopardy.&nbsp; In addition, another 22 species of bird are &quot;of special concern&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lake is also a stopover site for the endangered whooping
crane.&nbsp; The Piping Plover, another endangered species, has been known to
nest at the lake and on occasion, the Peregrine Falcon can be viewed flying
overhead.</p>
<p><img border="2" src="images/pelicans.jpg" width="300" height="161" align="left" alt="American White Pelicans on Redberry Lake">The American White Pelicans are also summer inhabitants on
New Tern Island and are one of 14 breeding colonies in Saskatchewan.&nbsp; These
birds are large and white in colour with black wing tips and huge yellow beaks.&nbsp;
The pelican's wing
span is nearly 10 feet making it one of the largest bird species in North
America.&nbsp; Pelicans usually wait until they are 3 years of age to begin
nesting.&nbsp; They breed from June to August and lay 2 or 3 eggs.&nbsp;
Pelicans maintain their population when the colonies are protected. However,
these birds are
sensitive to disturbances.&nbsp; When the parents are scared away from the nest,
the young may be exposed to the sun causing sunstroke leading to death.&nbsp;
Regular disturbances can lead to permanent absence from the island.&nbsp; For
this reason people are prohibited from going within 100 meters of the island. In
addition to pelicans, the islands are home to other colonial
nesting bird species such as over 40 pairs Double-crested Cormorant in 1985,
2,700 pairs of California and Ring-billed gulls, and 200 pairs of Common Terns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Redberry Lake Migratory Bird Sanctuary also has the largest known concentration of
breeding White-winged Scoters in North America.&nbsp; It is a type of diving
duck which breeds on the islands as well as the mainland.&nbsp; In late spring
and summer you may be able to observe the scoters near Marshy Creek and Oscar
Creek.&nbsp; In late summer they form large &quot;nurseries&quot; of the young
which are cared for by a few adult birds. This is an interesting and uncommon
biological event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, Redberry Lake became a United Nations Biosphere
Reserve.&nbsp; In 1989, the Redberry Pelican Project Inc. was formed to
implement the growing mature tourism values at Redberry Lake.&nbsp; The main
objection of this group is to develop an ecotourism industry at Redberry Lake
which maintains a balance between the aspirations of the tourism industry and the
integrity of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sanctuary is protected by the Migratory Bird
Sanctuary Regulations and the Wildlife Act of Saskatchewan.&nbsp; There are blue
and white signs on the sanctuary boundaries.&nbsp; Use of the lake by the public is
encouraged but boaters are reminded not
to go within 100 meters of the islands to avoid disrupting the birds.</p>
