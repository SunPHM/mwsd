<H3>Aransas project is a winner</H3>
<H2>Galveston District receives honors award in Design and Environmental Awards competition</h2>
<p>     Galveston District is the recipient of an honor award in the Chief of Engineers Design 
and Environmental Awards Program for the work being accomplished to save the habitat of the rare 
and endangered whooping crane.  The team of Galveston District employees involved also received 
an honorable mention for the Design Team of the Year.  Galveston's entry competed in a field of 
59 projects.
<p style="line-height: 100%">The Aransas project is saving the endangered
Whooping Crane from extinction by
<P>protecting and improving its habitat while 
providing efficient navigation with state-of-the-art 
technology that works hand-in-hand with nature.
<P>     The project reach is a 31-mile stretch of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway on the Texas 
gulf coast about 35 miles northeast of Corpus 
Christi in Aransas and Calhoun Counties.  The area is 
the critical habitat of the rare and endangered Whooping Crane and includes about 13.25 
miles within the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.

<P>      The project addresses the serious bank erosion problem at the Aransas National 
Wildlife Refuge, the wintering grounds for the rare 
and endangered Whooping Crane.  Whooping Crane losses of about 2 acres per year are caused 
by vessel traffic and wind generated waves.  The critical habitat loss adversely impacts the 
Whooping Crane, which is re-establishing itself 
after near extinction in the 1940's.  The importance 
of the GIWW to the economy of the lower Texas 
coast and its uninterrupted usage is also critical.  
Tonnage transported along this section of the GIWW 
totaled nearly 27 million tons in 1995.  
<P>     The project provides erosion protection and 
limited spill containment for the existing alignment of 
the GIWW while also providing marsh creation with 
the beneficial uses of dredged material.  It required 
the formation of a remarkable and innovative team of State 
and Federal agencies to fully evaluate impacts to the 
natural resources as well as the Whooping Crane.  
This Interagency Coordination Team (ICT) was comprised of 
 the Texas Department of Transportation, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Aransas National 
Wildlife Refuge, the US Coast Guard, the Texas Water Development Board, the Texas General Land 
Office, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Corps of Engineers.  
<P>     Construction was limited in various ways.  The entire projecthad to be constructed within 
three years.  More importantly, no construction could occur while the Whooping Cranes were in the area, 
so the windows for construction were from 15 April to 15 October each year.  Construction had to 
be tailored to fit not only the time but also the funding constraints and the site priorities set by the 
refuge personnel. 
<P>     The project cost is $17,900,000 (current inflated estimate with contingencies--01 Oct 99 prices). 
 The project baseline estimate was $20,313,000.  
<P>     The project is a culmination of many outstanding, innovating ideas and designs.  Erosion 
protection on the shoreline absolutely needed to be compatible with the Whooping Crane and its need to 
feed at the water's edge.  Articulated concrete mats were flexible to mold to the existing shoreline, and 
the open spaces in the blocks allowed for vegetative growth throughout.  This feature protected over 
73,000 feet of shoreline.  
<P>     Geotextile tubes are an ingenious concept that was refined and improved for use as a breakwater. 
 This allowed seagrasses near the shoreline to remain intact while providing erosion protection 
for vulnerable areas.  A breakwater fashioned of the tubes provided for 1,500 feet of shoreline protection.

<P>     Spill containment was improved by the provision of booms that would be deployed by 
Coast Guard personnel. The Dredged Material Management Plan utilized the input and design of the 
Waterway Experiment Station (WES), the project team, and the ICT to plan for 1,600 acres of 
marsh..The Whooping Crane habitat will not only stop disappearing, it will also increase by at least 1,600 acres 
of prime habitat. The goal for the plan is to, &quot;Use dredged material to create marsh similar to 
nearby natural marshes, including both high and low marsh, without adversely impacting natural habitats 
or navigation requirements&quot;.
