        Seabees of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) FOUR&#146;s Crane Shop recently had
        the chance to do something other than work with cranes. They were tasked with replacing
        two wire rope bridges at the Jungle Warfare Training Center (JWTC), located in the
        Northern Training Area on Okinawa. The job was important to JWTC because the existing
        bridges had deteriorated over the years and were no longer safe to use.</big></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big>The crew had to overcome several difficult ch</big><a href="../images/bridges2-h.jpg"><img src="../images/bridges2-l.jpg" width="298" height="205" alt="bridges2-l.jpg (9896 bytes)" align="right"></a><big>allenges during the
        project along with ensuring the safety of its members. The largest challenge was the sheer
        size of the ravine. Using rigging skills they learned while dealing with cranes, the crew
        came up with unique ways to span the 210-foot wide, 100-foot deep ravine with only
        three-quarter inch wire rope.</big></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big>In spite of a typhoon, which threatened to remove everything
        previously installed, the six-man crew, directed by Equipment Operator 1st Class Scot J.
        Gallop and lead by EO2 Brian D. Sypher, completed the project on time. With the bridges
        now rebuilt and safe to use, other members of NMCB FOUR are preparing to visit the JWTC.

        the Jungle Warfare Training Course and trying out the new bridges for themselves.</big></p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big>In another project</big> <big>the crew of the Warehouse Addition
        project held a ribbon cutting ceremony for the &quot;opening&quot; of the two additions
        for outside storage on October 29, 1998.&nbsp; Capt. Frank Sweigart was assisted by Raul
        Malanyaon, the Assistant Warehouse Manager, and Construction Engineer 2nd Class Craig
        Quillen, the Project Supervisor, in cutting the ribbon.</big></p>
        <p><big>The project was started by NMCB 74 in March and was turned over to NMCB 4 in June
        completion. NMCB 74 had already expended 428 mandays in site preparation for the concrete
        pads, placing the concrete pads, erecting the structural steel on the west side of the
        building and excavating the trench for the concrete retaining wall. In true Seabee
        fashion, NMCB 4 picked up the project and expended an additional 412 mandays with a crew
        of 6 personnel to erect the structural steel on the west side of the existing warehouse,
        place corrugated sheeting, and install a light system and personnel door on both
        additions. They also fabricated the steel reinforcing bar cage for the retaining wall,
        formed around the cage and placed 22 cubic meters of concrete. The additions give the
        Housing Office 3000 square feet of much needed covered storage.</big></p>
