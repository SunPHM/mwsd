The Cranes are a fairly small (15 species) family of large impressive birds
of open country: marsh, tundra, and grasslands that go on forever. They
are evocative of the wild, open places left on earth. As those places become
fewer and smaller, it is not a surprise that 9 species (60% of all crane
species) are declining and considered endangered, threatened, or vulnerable
(Archibald &amp; Meine 1996). Those species that still remain reasonably
common can still be spectacular, like this adult and juvenal <b>Gray Crowned
Crane</b> (<b>left</b>) in the grasslands of east Africa.</td>

<td>Ten of 15 cranes are in the genus <i>Grus</i>: the tall, stately, and
retiring cranes of our dreams. The rarest is the huge <b>Whooping Crane</b>
(<b>right</b>, in a beautiful shot &copy; <b>Greg W. Lasley</b>), breeding
in one park in remote central Canada and migrating each winter to the Texas
coast at Aransas NWR. The world population was recently counted at 183
birds, and the good news is that this is almost twice what is was two decades
ago. (Birdlife International 2000). Most of the <i>Grus</i> cranes are
highly migratory, and the sight of a flight of cranes overhead can be awe
inspiring. The photo (below) is of <b>Sandhill Cranes</b>, the only other
New World species.

In Asia, there are five species of endangered <i>Grus</i> cranes that make
long flights south: Siberian <i>G. leucogeranus</i>, White-naped <i>G.
vipio</i>, Hooded <i>G. monacha</i>, Red-crowned (Japanese)
<i>G. japonensis</i>,
and Black-necked <i>G. nigricollis</i>. The Eurasian (Common) Crane <i>G.
grus</i> is not endangered but also makes long migratory flights.</td>

The champion distance migrant, and the most endangered of all cranes, is
the huge, red-faced <b>Siberian Crane</b> (<b>left</b>; in a photo &copy;
<b>Bhoulu
Khan</b>). Its estimated numbers are higher than Whooping (perhaps 2500
birds; Birdlife International 2000) but it is the crane most dependent
on remote taiga marshes without any human disturbance. It has three widely
separated populations: the western, which winters in Iran and is virtually
extinct; the central, which winters at Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India (where
this photo was taken) but has declined from several hundreds in the 1960s
to less than ten today; and the eastern, which winters along the middle
Yangtze River in s. China.&nbsp;
<p>The photo of these two Siberian Cranes is by my friend Bhoulu Khan,
now the head forester at Keoladeo Ghana reserve, known as Bharatpur, a
series of artificial marshes in the plains of India where these birds used
to winter regularly but are now more hit-and-miss as these population plummets
to near-extinction. The cranes travel in very small groups over a route
of 3100 miles; as Matthiessen (2001) explains, the loss of this population
would be the loss of millions of years of knowledge. Only adult wild cranes
can teach young how to make this incredible journey.
<p>On our visit there in March 2001, we were already too late for the two
Siberian Cranes that had wintered that year, but Bhoulu Khan put up a bed
sheet outside on the patio and showed us his amazing photos of the park,
including this shot. To my personal amazement, Bhoulo is the son of the
former head cook at the rest house at Bharatpur, where I had stayed 23
years before. It was his father that first served me real Indian food,
sparking a life-long interest in that vegetarian cuisine! [and, in a longer
story I can't tell now, it is because of Indian food that I met my wife.....]</td>

<p>Cranes have many fascinating features. They tend to mate for life and
can be tenacious in defense of their pair bond. Their stereotypic head-bowing
and back-arching display, and bugled calls, cement these bonds. Better
yet, they dance! As the displays pick up — often on the wintering grounds
— they perform ballet leaps of extraordinary beauty. The Red-crowned Cranes
wintering in Japan are especially famous for their "dances in the snow."
<p>Each species of crane has much history and many stories. Fortunately
for us, these are now woven together in Peter Matthiessen's marvelous book
<i>The
Birds of Heaven: Travels with Cranes</i> (2001). I highly recommend it
as an insightful and powerful wildlife read. The book is illustrated with
the art of Robert Bateman, known best for his wonderful wildlife panoramas.
Yet, in this book, the paintings are close-ups and not the "landscapes-with-birds"
I had hoped to find. To atone for that slightly, I've put together below
a short series of "crane panoramas" that may just capture, in photographic
form, a bit of the remarkable combination of crane-and-landscape that together
makes cranes such powerful and symbolic birds......

<p>Cranes have a mystical hold on many people. I am influenced by this
power. They do speak to me of vast wilderness, even though these days they
are mostly encountered in agricultural stubble next to a central California
freeway.&nbsp; But they belong to the wild. I remember my first crane (and
this is a true story): when I was only two (2) years old. We lived overlooking
a large lake. One early morning my father told me there was a crane standing
on the end of the dock below our house. It was the first bird I ever identified.....
alas, of course, I realized many years later that it had been a Great Blue
Heron (ahem...). But, in its own quirky way, you might say that it was
a "crane" that got me into birding......

<blockquote>This was quite a nice book at one time, but is now badly dated.
Crane populations have tumbled seriously since the 1970s, and efforts to
save many of them didn't get underway until the 1980s-1990s (Whooping Crane
aside). A tremendous amount of information not available back then is now
known. This is now out-of-print. Today, a full introduction to the family,
with exceptional photos, is in the <i>Handbook of the Birds of the World</i>
series (Archibald &amp; Meine 1996).</blockquote>
<b>Family Book</b>: <font face="Zapf Dingbats">HHHH</font> (out of 5 possible)
<br>Matthiessen, Peter. 2001. The Bird of Heaven: Travels with Cranes.
North Point Press, New York.
<blockquote>This is not at all a "family book" in any usual sense. It doesn't
have range maps beyond very generic end-sheets; it has not detailed description;
and the discussion of breeding biology is anecdotal. Indeed, the entire
book is a travelogue of the author's efforts to observe all the cranes
in the world, and learn of their habitat and their needs, and it reads
like a novel. Matthiessen is a world renown writer; I've read many of his
books and I may choose this as the best of them. Yes, it doesn't have the
deep introspective angle of <i>The Snow Leopard</i>, but the excitement
and wonder in tracking down the cranes in the most remote corners of the
planet shines through gloriously. I just loved the "read" of it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intermixed with good writing are a tremendous numbers
of facts about each of the cranes — their history, their lore, their protectors,
and their future. One gets a really good feel for the subject. Matthiessen
encounters various friends and acquaintances of mine as he travels (e.g.,
Victor Emanuel, Bhoulo Khan, Raj Singh) and others I wish I knew (e.g.,
George Archibald, the world's greatest authority and protector of cranes).
There is an astonishing amount of actual information in these 330 pages
(including some very useful footnotes).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The novel-like book is illustrated by Robert Bateman.
I have long considered Bateman among my favorite bird artists, but what
I have admired most are his "landscapes with birds." Cranes would be perfect
for such a treatment, but (perhaps due to the rush to publish) none of
them appear here (his Wattled Crane <i>Bugeranus carunculatus</i> painting
is the closest he comes in this book). Rather, we have close-ups of the
heads of all species, and we have close-up vignettes of all the cranes
— often wreathed in mists — with only bits of landscape. This is not classic
Bateman; I admit to being disappointed. The art is just fine and looks
accurate, but it is not nearly as evocative as his artistry usually is
to me.</blockquote>
