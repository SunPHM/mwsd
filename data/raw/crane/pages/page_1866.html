<H3>Current Status:</H3>
<blockquote>
The principal threat to whooping cranes in the wild continues to be the potential of a hurricane or contaminant spill destroying their wintering habitat on the Texas coast. Principal threats to captive birds are disease and parasites.
</blockquote>

<H3>Achievements:</H3>
<blockquote>
The whooping crane has responded favorably to management in several locations throughout its range. Its population continues to increase and is now estimated at 237 birds, including 93 in captivity. This success is due, in part, to increased production of young birds at the Fish and Wildlife Service's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (Patuxent) in Laurel, Maryland. Patuxent currently has a whooping crane population of 49, including 13 young. Captive production in 1992 was approximately double that of 1991, and included five captive-produced birds resulting from natural breeding. Seven chicks were raised at Patuxent from eggs removed from wild nests in Canada.
<p>
The Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to reintroduce the whooping crane in Florida in 1993 as part of a program to establish a nonmigratory population in the southeast. Cranes are being reared in captive facilities at Patuxent and the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin, and conditioned for release to the wild. Additionally, young birds have been sent to the Calgary Zoo to stock the Canadian Wildlife Service's new captive whooping crane facility.
</blockquote>

<H3>Current Recovery Needs:</H3>
<blockquote>
The reintroduction in Florida is likely to require a decade of annual releases to achieve success. The recovery plan calls for two wild, self-sustaining populations in addition to the population that migrates between Texas and Canada. Also, continued research is needed to improve egg fertility and reduce egg breakage.
</blockquote>

<H3>Partnerships</H3>
<blockquote>
<b>Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission:</b> A Memorandum of Understanding between this State agency and the Federal government is near completion. Under that agreement, the agency will care for birds being held in temporary enclosures and monitor the birds after their release. Two full-time personnel have been trained to conduct most of the field studies, and a management plan has been written.
<p>
<b>Canadian Wildlife Service:</b> This Canadian agency protects nesting habitat of the wild Texas/Canada whooping crane population and works with the Fish and Wildlife Service to collect eggs.
<p>
<b>International Crane Foundation:</b> This private foundation now houses approximately 37 cranes, including 12 chicks reared in 1992. Three of the six captive-produced chicks resulted from natural breeding, noteworthy because the first such breeding occurred in 1991.
</blockquote>

<H3>Recovery Plan Status:</H3>
<blockquote>
Original plan approved 4/12/85; revised 12/23/86.
