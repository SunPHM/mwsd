      <p><b>If one day you found nothing</b> but vast weed-strewn lots in their 
        place, which of Chicago's skyscrapers would you miss most? The Sears Tower? 
        The Wrigley Building? The Rookery? The Hancock? How many tall buildings, 
        if they disappeared, would you call a major loss to the city? A dozen? 
        Several dozen? Close to a hundred?</p>
      <p>Now think of the buildings you've seen go up over the past ten years, 
        or that you see going up now. How many of these, if they disappeared, 
        would you miss? Would you be able to name even one?</p>
      <p>After September 11, there were those quick to proclaim the era of tall 
        buildings over. Looking around at the Chicago skyline, punctuated by a 
        profusion of construction cranes, it's hard to see that. But the towers 
        now rising are the <img src="parkmillenium.jpg" width="102" height="162" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" border="1" alt="Millenium on the Park">residue 
        of the late 90s, planned years ago and only now topping out. A search 
        on Skyscrapers.com, an extensive global database of tall buildings, brought 
        up 42 new to downtown Chicago in the past three years and another 28 due 
        to be completed this year. But there are only half that number slated 
        for 2004, and even fewer for 2005. Which means that Chicago-a city at 
        the center of world architecture for over a century-could be closing out 
        a building boom that won't produce a single structure of international 
        significance.</p>
      <p>That many buildings are bad is no surprise-bad buildings, even in Chicago, 
        are always the norm. But never before has mediocrity been embraced with 
        such ardor. Chicago's collapse is not part of a universal trend. In other 
        major cities architecture that matters is still being created. In Manhattan 
        there's Renzo Piano's new headquarters for the New York Times, Donald 
        Trump's surprisingly elegant <a href="http://www.skyscrapers.com/re/en/wm/bu/100377/">new 
        residential tower</a>, and Raimund Abraham's narrow, razor-sharp <a href="http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0612/design_1-1.html">Austrian 
        Cultural Forum</a>, to name just a few. In Los Angeles you'll find Frank 
        Gehry's <a href="http://64.45.55.170/mod03/mod03-02.html">Walt Disney 
        Concert Hall</a> and Rafael Moneo's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/cl-et-ouroussoff2sep02,1,1025733.story">Cathedral 
        of Our Lady of the Angels</a>. Even in a city as small as Fort Worth, 
        there's Tadao Ando's dazzling new <a href="http://www.themodern.org/new_modern.html">Modern 
        Art Museum</a>. All of these projects have commanded attention and acclaim 
        that have eluded any recent Chicago building.</p>
      <p>In Chicago, architecture of consequence-Rem Koolhaas's student center 
        and Helmut Jahn's massive dorm complex at the Illinois Institute of Technology, 
        or Rafael Vinoly's <a href="http://www.rvapc.com/ht/HTProject.aspx?Base=Projects&projID=379">Graduate 
        School of Business at the University of Chicago</a>-has been relegated 
        to the cloisters of academia, while the city center has become a tepid 
        pot where all the ingredients appear to come from the generics aisle. 
        The most prominent exception is the forthcoming <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/past_exhibitions/gehry/millenium_30.html">Gehry 
        band shell</a> in Millennium Park, but its genesis points to a key reason 
        for the decline: it was brought here not by a committee of bureaucrats 
        or accountants but by the persistent work of one individual, enduring 
        civic booster Cindy Pritzker. It's a reminder of the fundamental truth 
        of architecture, recently expressed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, 
        whose new <a href="http://www.mam.org/site/buildingfuture.asp">Milwaukee 
        Art Museum</a> has won international praise: &quot;There is not a good 
        project without a good client.&quot;</p>
      <p>No less now than in the time of the Medici, great art requires great 
        patrons. Chicago's signature buildings arose from the egos of the men 
        running the city's great corporations: Montgomery Ward's original Michigan 
        Avenue tower, with its gilded, electrically lit nude of a weather vane; 
        First National Bank Plaza (now Bank One Plaza), which bank chairman Gaylord 
        Freeman rushed into construction before all the building permits could 
        be secured; the Civic Opera Building, nicknamed &quot;Insull's Throne&quot; 
        for Sam Insull, the utility tycoon who spent $24,000,000-in 1920s dollars-to 
        erect it.</p>
      <p>But more and more of the great Chicago corporations are dead or dying, 
        and the survivors are run by executives who come in and out as through 
        a revolving door. Ward's, Amoco, First National Bank, Continental Bank, 
        Morton Salt, and Field Enterprises have all been vanquished or assimilated 
        by multinationals, and for the Chicago operations of these conglomerates 
        distinguished architecture is neither required nor desired. Why make a 
        long-term commitment when you can lease and, if things don't go as planned, 
        just pack up and steal away?</p>
      <p>In this climate, Chicago has suffered a dramatic downsizing in corporate 
        support for great architecture-Los Angeles gets a major concert hall from 
        Frank Gehry, but Chicago settles for a footbridge and a canopy. We're 
        in danger of falling to the status of a provincial city, where the approach 
        to culture is to collect samples of the reigning brands: a Gehry here, 
        a Koolhaas there, perhaps even a Piano in the parlor. It's the name, not 
        the work, that's essential-an etching, a scribble, a band shell or a garden 
        shed, any bit of bone will do.</p>
      <hr align="center" width="300">
      <p><a href="http://www.llarch.com/">Lucien Lagrange</a> is arguably the 
        reigning monarch of Chicago architecture, and his success is far from 
        undeserved. A product of McGill University and an alumnus of the pioneering 
        postwar firm Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, he's charming, modest, and 
        gracious. His portfolio includes such important rescues and renovations 
        as Union Station and the old Insurance Exchange Building (175 W. Jackson). 
        He's behind a number of recent large-scale luxury high-rises, and is currently 
        transforming the Carbon &amp; Carbide Building into a new Hard Rock hotel.</p>
      <p>But although the splendid steel-and-glass <a href="http://www.skyscrapers.com/re/en/wm/bu/100429/">Erie 
        on the Park</a> (500 W. Erie) suggests that his firm may not be entirely 
        frozen in the past, Lagrange's specialty is a Disney-like denial that 
        the 20th century ever took place: comforting classicist facades with surreal 
        touches to accommodate the reality of commerce, like the 20-foot teddy-bear 
        window in the faux-second-empire FAO Schwarz on Michigan Avenue or the 
        huge bucktoothed grin of a picture window on the giant popsicle stick 
        that is the <a href="http://www.skyscrapers.com/re/en/wm/bu/116666/">Park 
        Hyatt</a>.</p>
      <p>He can be depended on not to challenge or offend: to have his name on 
        a luxury high-rise is an insurance policy that nothing will be seen that 
        hasn't been seen a thousand times before. He's a declared anti-Miesian, 
        pronouncing his contempt for those pompous glass boxes that turn their 
        backs to the street and offer nothing but empty lobbies and windswept 
        plazas where restaurants and shops should be. His points about the life 
        of the street are well-taken, his responses often imaginative and vital-at 
        175 W. Jackson, for example, he balances his a sensitive restoration of 
        the ravaged terra-cotta of the exterior with a wildly exuberant retooling 
        of the two internal light courts. We should be glad to have him-but for 
        his work to represent the best of the new is The Fall incarnate.<a href="arewe2.htm"><img src="next.gif" width="10" height="10" border="0"></a></p>
