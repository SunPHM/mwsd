            many different commodities all over the system. Things like grain, 
            ore, plastic pellets, scrap metals and coal are commonly seen on the 
            railroad. On November 1<sup>st</sup>, it was observed that some rare 
            cargo was in the consist. At least 27 carloads of precast concrete 
            &quot;Prison Cells&quot; came in to Madison from Janesville on the 
            JMA! These units were on there way up to Baraboo, WI on the Reedsburg 
            Sub for delivery at the construction site of the new Sauk County Jail 
            and Law Enforcement Center. Check out the photos and read the story 
            below to learn more about why this was being done.</p>

          <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Why Concrete Prison Cells?</font></b></p>
          <p align="left">Concrete prison systems are a fast, economical way to 
            build a secure facility. There is a tremendous need for new prisons 
            in the United States. With crime rates higher than ever before, our 
            nation's prisons are suffering from overcrowding. Unfortunately, it 
            takes time for governments to secure the funds they need to build 
            additions or new institutions. Once funds are available, owners want 
            the job done fast, at the lowest cost possible, using high quality 
            materials to ensure a secure facility. </p>
          <p align="left"><a href="images/2646.jpg"><img src="images/2646s.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left" border="0" alt="After arriving by rail, the cells are &quot;Stacked&quot; at the construction site."></a>To 
            meet these needs, owners are turning to modular concrete prison systems. 
            There's more to a prison than just cells. Today's prisons include 
            day rooms, fitness facilities, kitchens, chiller/cooler rooms, laundries, 
            cafeterias, work facilities, visitor areas and watch towers.</p>
          <p align="left">Concrete assures the highest strength and durability 
            to support heavy loads, meet long span requirements and minimize framing 
            members. And, with fewer visual obstructions from framing members, 
            correctional officers have clear lines of sight to properly supervise 
            inmates. The inherent strength and durability of precast concrete 
            makes this ideal for minimum, medium and maximum security institutions. 
          </p>
          <p align="left">Unlike steel, precast concrete is non-corrosive and 
            resists dents, punctures and other abuses caused by man and nature. 
          </p>
          <p align="left"><a href="images/2649.jpg"><img src="images/2649s.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="right" border="0" alt="Stacked cells go up in a hurry."></a>When 
            communities need additional detention space, concrete prison systems 
            can provide a fast solution. With year-round production and erection 
            these units meet the fast-track schedules required for prison construction 
            projects. Concrete precast modular boxes, a popular choice for standardized 
            prison housing units, can be cast with openings for electrical conduit, 
            plumbing and other systems. Plumbing fixtures, bunks and other hardware 
            items can be installed right at the plant. </p>
          <p align="left">You can order the finished box interiors with a smooth 
            surface. As a result, the modular boxes arrive ready for installation 
            in rows and stacks to facilitate completion. Stacked wall systems 
            combine precast concrete bearing walls, floors and roofing for superior 
            structural stability. The bearing walls support solid floor and roof 
            slabs while serving as partition walls. These stacked <a href="images/2657.jpg"><img src="images/2657s.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="left" border="0" alt="Modular unit loaded and ready to be taked to construction site."></a>wall 
            systems offer tremendous time savings overall for a fast prison completion. 
            Like the precast modular boxes, they can cast interior bearing walls 
            with openings for electrical conduit, plumbing and other systems. 
            Insulation can also be included, and walls are installed ready for 
            painting in the field. The underside of floor slabs can be finished, 
            doubling as a ceiling for the floor below and reducing the total number 
            of pieces needed for a job. Plus, crews can finish stacked wall exteriors 
            in a variety of colors and textures to meet architectural needs and 
            avoid additional exterior work.</p>
          <p align="left"><a href="images/2651.jpg"><img src="images/2651s.jpg" width="250" height="200" align="right" border="0" alt="Large cranes are required to do the job."></a>Compared 
            to traditional building methods and materials, concrete prison systems 
            are the most cost-effective choice for prison construction projects. 
            Off site fabrication methods reduce the initial cost of precast concrete 
            production, making these units very cost competitive. They also go 
            up faster than other building materials, so you not only save on site 
            time and labor costs, but you get use of the prison sooner. </p>
          <p align="left">In addition to lower initial costs, these units also 
            offer tremendous savings over time. Because they're so strong and 
            durable, they require little maintenance, saving communities time 
            and money on upkeep and repairs throughout their long life cycles.</p>
