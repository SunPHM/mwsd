<p><font color="#800080"><big><big>It</big></big></font> started off looking like it was
going to be really quiet in and around Boston at the annual <a
href="http://www.corelworld.com" target="_blank">CorelWorld</a> Rickfest September 9-14th,
2001. The first hint was the measly three other people along with <a
href="http://www.anzai.com/about.html" target="_blank">Tom Anzai</a> who boarded the
direct flight from Ottawa to Boston. Heck, the solitary flight attendant didn't even
bother with an official emergency speech on the intercom. Instead, he cozied up beside the
few passengers and whispered about this air mask and that safety latch (right beside the
wad of chewing gum under the seat). After our paltry snack of a healthy granola bar
(ingredients included glucose, fructose, corn syrup, modified sugars and...oh...actual
healthy stuff) and a bag of pretzels we landed at Boston's <a
href="http://www.massport.com/logan" target="_blank">Logan</a> airport on time and without
incident. We would have no idea that 72 hours later there would be a totally different
atmosphere at Logan.</p>

<p>From baggage claim to the airport Limousine with passengers and fellow CorelWorld
presenters <a href="http://blinn.com" target="_blank">Bill Blinn</a> and <a
href="http://www.rdpslides.com" target="_blank">Steve Rindsberg</a>. The destination? The
Conference hotel, the <a

target="_blank">Sheraton Ferncroft Resort</a>. But where the heck is <a
href="http://danvers-ma.org" target="_blank">Danvers</a>, Massachusetts? As the bird
flies, it's claimed to be 19 miles north of Boston. As the car drives, take the tunnel out
of the airport, get on I-95...or is that the McClellan Hwy 1A?...take the 60 to route
1...where is the Northeast Expressway anywise?...go past the Sheraton Ferncroft
Hotel...what? go past it?..come back south on I-95...or is that Hwy 1? After all, Boston
is the site of the <a href="http://www.bigdig.com" target="_blank">Big Dig</a> (the
largest municipal project in the country's history at a cost of $1 billion per mile).
Geez, just follow the dang Ferncroft hotel signs and you'll get there. Maybe even on your
first attempt...</p>

<p>The hotel is located on a hill near the <a
href="http://sports.yahoo.com/pga/golfcourses/massachusetts/danvers/1256.html"
target="_blank">Ferncroft Country Club</a> (as in golf, Trent Jones circa 1969 style).
With nothing else in sight. It reminded us of Alcatraz on a hill. The <a
href="http://www.virgin-express.com" target="_blank">Virgin airlines</a> crew (more about
them later) who regularly stay at the hotel call it the <a
href="http://www.bettyfordcenter.org" target="_blank">Betty Ford Clinic</a>. You ain't
escaping unless you have a car or are patient enough to tell the cabbies how to get to the
hotel from Boston. Was that the I-95 north they're supposed to take again?! Oh well, at
least no one will be skipping out during the conference sessions...unless they play golf.</p>

<p>Attendees and staff started to arrive throughout the weekend with Crash Courses on
CorelDRAW, Ventura, Photo-Paint, and Corel Painter being offered on Sunday. Tom diligently
conducted two back-to-back crash courses on CorelDRAW and Photo-Paint. Talk about crash,
this was the start of a total ten seminars Tom was to do...come Friday, that's exactly
what Tom did...crash.</p>

<h4><big><strong>Day One Starts With a Bang</strong></big></h4>

<p>Was he IN, or was he OUT? Was it to be 9:30 to 10:00 a.m. or 9:15 to 9:45 a.m.? Would
he mention the &#147;V&#148; word as in <a
href="http://www.corel.com/products/graphicsandpublishing/ventura8/" target="_blank">Ventura</a>?
Well, after much anticipation Corel's new CEO, <a
href="http://www.idg.com.hk/pcworld/printstory.asp?aid=20010216005" target="_blank">Derek
Burney</a>, honored his commitment admirably by delivering an upbeat speech to the almost
200 conference attendees. To the delight of Ventura-ists, he mentioned the &#147;V&#148;
word a total of seven (!) times. Exactly seven MORE times than was mentioned at last
year's conference. Burney went on to explain the revised focus on Corel's graphics
applications, the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20010716S0004"
target="_blank">buyout of Micrografx's</a> graphics suite, the new <a
href="http://www.procreate.com" target="_blank">Procreate</a> Macintosh vision, and he
even answered questions during a 20 minute plus Q&amp;A. The consensus? Burney came off as
a genuine and personable person who seems to have a clear vision to the future and
stability of Corel's products. He gets to stay on the island for another round or two.</p>

<p align="left"><small><em>Clean-shaven CEO, Derek Burney, addresses the CorelWorld
audience. And pleases many with a the &#147;V&#148; word.</em></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tom followed up with two sessions &#147;Crown Jewels in Version 10&#148; and
&#147;Making Arrangements with Combine, Weld, Trim, and Intersect&#148;. As for the latter
presentation, who knows what the heck the Target and Source objects are anyway?! Tom,
himself, had to duck out of that one. &#147;I dunno, just do it and see what
happens&#148;, answered Tom to that question. After Happy Hour at 4:30 p.m. and the Grand
prize draw at 5:00 p.m. patrons were either milling about the small Bogey's Bar or en
route to the <a href="http://www.bostonharborcruises.com" target="_blank">Boston Harbor
dinner cruise</a>. Word was that the cruise was very entertaining with musicians and skits
but too bad is was too dark to see...Boston! Word also got around that Bogey's Bar
triple-bogeyed with only one bartender on staff. Heck this was the so-called Betty Ford
clinic after all! Pssst, avoid ordering the portabello mushrooms from the menu too.</p>

<p><big><strong>Day Two Starts...</strong></big></p>

<p>Tony Severenuk (just call him &#147;Several...&#148;) was the Keynote on Tuesday.
Goodness gracious me. I don't know if I had more fun listening to him speak at warp speed
or watch the sign interpreters sprain their wrists trying to keep up with him. Brings to
light new causes of carpal tunnel syndrome other than by extensive use of a computer
mouse. Tony gets the nod for delivering the longest run-on-sentence...while maintaining
the audience's interest. Tony, he the man when it comes to talking about CorelDRAW. After
all, he is the Lead Program Manager for CorelDRAW at Corel Corporation. In his spare time,
he conducts presentations called &#147;My Name is Tony, and I'm a Geek&#148; where he
unleashes his trademark &#147;cone of silence&#148; secrets regarding CorelDRAW. I gather
he did alright as the Request Line posted on the conference bulletin board gushed
&#147;Anything with Tony.&#148; Couldn't tell if Tony wrote that request on the board
himself or not...</p>

with the new...um...logo. </em></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><big><strong>And Then Terror</strong></big></p>

<p>When did we first hear of the news? During Tony's keynote speech <a
href="http://www.wacom.com" target="_blank">Wacom</a> sales rep, Kimberly Elko's cell
phone rang with her husband in New Jersey shouting the news. Was it a commuter plane? A
helicopter? What the heck is going on? Immediately after the keynote speech, Help Center
staff Jim Hart and Wayne Kaplan get busy hooking up the projection unit and TV feed onto
the big screen while the day's first seminar sessions get underway.</p>

<p>During the first morning break, the mood dips from the high of conference adrenaline to
one of shock and disbelief. Attendees watch the horror, some in silence, others gasping at
the vivid sights of the plane's impact and damage of the WTC and Pentagon. <a
href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank">CNN</a> becomes the main attraction in
Conference Central. Forget about Geeky Secrets and <a
href="http://www.lindabucklin.com/fractals" target="_blank">Fabulous Fractals</a>. Or do
we? Rick and staff gather hurriedly to decide what to do. How could anyone have
contingency plans for this type of event? Should they cancel the conference? Should they
take an extended break? Should they have the guts to continue? Sue Blumenberg, Seminar
Manager, recommends that people came to learn and should be given the opportunity. A
decision to continue was made.</p>

<p align="left"><em><small>The horrific NYC skyline during the terrorist</small> <small>attack</small>
<small>as seen on TVs around the world.</small></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ironically, the next three sessions slated for the morning were presented by three
non-Americans&#151;Tom Anzai (Ottawa), Bob van Duuren (Amsterdam), and Paul Huntington
(Toronto). Even so, the terrorist attacks did not isolate one country rather it affected
the entire world (over 60 countries lost people in the WTC tragedy). Tom found it
extremely difficult to focus and start his &#147;All the RAVE, Part II&#148; session.
Everyone was stunned and literally going through the motions, struggling to maintain the
fervor that is common at the start of a conference. The conference was heading into an
aura it has never experienced before. One of unimaginable grief and disbelief.</p>

<p><big><strong>The Show Must Go On</strong></big></p>

<p>And on it went. After much discussion and little debate, the decision made by the
conference brass was to continue with the show. As Sue Blumenberg, said in a
post-conference email:</p>

<p align="center"><small><em>&#147;200 people had come to Boston for instruction and, to
the best of our ability, we would continue to provide it. Not only because it was our
responsibility to do so, but also because it would be so important for all&nbsp; of
us--staff and patrons alike--to have some kind of framework for holding the many thoughts
and feelings that would arise during the week.&#148;</em></small></p>

<p align="center"><small><em><strong>Note:</strong> To read Sue's entire email describing
her thoughts and decisions, click <a href="http://www.anzai.com/cworld01_sb.htm"
target="_blank">here</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>Not all patrons decided to stick around. Take for example fellow presenter <a
href="http://www.gorgeousgeorge.com" target="_blank">Sharon George</a> who hitched a
compact car rental ride with attendee Pam Delaney and her fiancé back to San Diego,
California. Said Sharon in an email:</p>

<p align="center"><small>&#147;I arrived in San Diego last night around midnight.
Thoroughly tired, but very fortunate I saw America in four days, literally coast to coast.
I was so aware of the disparity in my heart. Sorrow and beauty. We live in such a
wondrously beautiful country. I am so blessed to be home again, with my family, and my
hopes extend to everyone for peace and love to flourish on this Earth.&#148;</small></p>

<p align="center"><em><small><strong>Note:</strong> To read Sharon's candid email account
on the drive, where they slept (when they could), and the general notes, click <a
href="http://www.anzai.com/cworld01_sg.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</small><br>
<small><strong>Note2:</strong> Can you believe it that Sharon road cross-country in the
back seat of a very small car with luggage all the while recuperating from severe bruising
from an earlier car accident? Unbelievable.</small></em></p>

<p>About 20 attendees never got to experience CorelWorld 2001. People like Andrea Zuercher
from Lawrence, Kansas were disappointed at having to miss the event. But she was extremely
glad to have been home with her loved one at such a time (although she did mention that
the Ferncroft would have been a good second choice).</p>

<p>For those who stayed at the conference it was an attempt to continue on through the
week. Said Rick Altman:</p>

<p align="center"><small>&#147;The most difficult part of the entire week was trying to
simultaneously gauge the mood and direct the mood of 200 people. Who am I to say what to
feel and when to feel it? What right did I have? But that was my job, for which I was
wholly unqualified.&#148;</small></p>

<p align="center"><small><strong>Note:</strong> To read Rick's article describing the
conference, go to <a href="http://www.altman.com/articles/1001.htm" target="_blank">&#147;An
Unforgettable Week&#148;</a>.</small></p>

<p>The CorelDRAW trivia continued, the dinner at the Country Club was held, and the
seminars were conducted as scheduled. Heck, even the planned Keynote speech on Thursday by
<a href="http://www.corel.com/executive_bios/" target="_blank">Graham Brown</a>, Executive
VP, Business Applications (hey that would be <a
href="http://www.corel.com/products/graphicsandpublishing/ventura8/" target="_blank">Ventura</a>!)
went on in spite of Graham not being able to fly down to Boston from Ottawa. His body was
transformed into a black speakerphone on the presenter's table in the Main Hall. The
official word? Ventura is not dead. In fact, there are plans for a Ventura 10 to undergo
beta testing shortly. Look for a new CARM, direct to PDF, CorelDRAW engines, a CorelDRAW
10 filter, better overall stability, and color management tools. For that, a standing
ovation was in store. Not all news that week was of despair...</p>

<p><big><strong>What to do In and Around Bah-stun</strong></big></p>

<p>Beantown. Home of the Red Sox, Bruins, and Celtics. Campus for Harvard, MIT, and Boston
College. Boston is arguably the most historical city in America where it was founded in
1630 nearly 150 years before the colonies formed a new nation. Its been the site for
notable national events including the <a
href="http://www.pbs.org/ktca/liberty/chronicle/bostonteaparty-edenton.html"
target="_blank">Boston Tea Party</a> and <a href="http://www.paulreverehouse.org"
target="_blank">Paul Revere's</a> famous British alarm. If you like walking the <a
href="http://www.freedomtrail.org" target="_blank">Freedom Trail</a>, offers a three-mile
tour that follows a red line on the pavement. Keep your head up though once in a while.
The pedestrian crossings are known to be one of the worst in America rivaling those in
Europe. A street sign said &#147;Over 3 pedestrians are seriously hurt in Boston every
day.&#148; Careful now.</p>

<p>The summary list of sites that the CorelWorld attendees visited (that we knew about)
were:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hob.com" target="_blank"><strong>House of Blues</strong></a> Good
food, good practice session, not enough time to take it all in. Unfortunately, our bus
left at 10:30 so things were just starting to roll. And, hey, who was that guy hangin'
around the group? A groupie? ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.harvardsquare.com" target="_blank"><strong>Harvard Square</strong></a>
Boy does your IQ fall down the Bell curve while walking around here. &#147;Say bahnie, can
I borrow your slide rulah?&#148;</p>

target="_blank"><strong>Fanueil Hall</strong></a> Built in 1742 as an open forum and
meeting hall hosting speakers Samuel Adams to current Massachusetts Senator Edward M.
Kennedy and now is the city's most celebrated hub of commerce. And probably the most
misspelled Boston landmark...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ussconstitution.navy.mil/" target="_blank"><strong>U.S.S.
Constitution</strong></a> &#147;Old Ironsides&#148; withstood cannonball fire from HMS
Guerriere during the War of 1812. The Constitution is the oldest commissioned warship in
the world. Keep swapping those decks maties!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blueman.com" target="_blank"><strong>Blue Man Group</strong></a>
Totally tubular multimedia theater performed by a bunch of...blue men. With versions of
its show running in four cities across the country, this troupe drums on PVC piping or
buckets of paint and provides commentary on runaway technology. But does anyone
&#147;get&#148; it?!</p>

<p>Closer to the conference, many attendees chose to drive to closer venues such as <a
href="http://www.salemweb.com" target="_blank">Salem</a>, Massachusetts where in 1692 19
innocent people were hanged during the witchcraft delusion. More than 150 men and women
were accused of witchcraft by friends and neighbors who were said to be tormented by their
shapes or specters. Eventually Governor William Phipps appointed a new court that did not
allow <em>spectral</em> evidence, ending the tragic chapter in Salem's past. Today,
celebrating its 375th anniversary Salem is one of America's oldest cities as a result of
the first English settlement in 1626. Attendees visited the <a
href="http://www.salemwitchmuseum.com" target="_blank">Salem Witch Museum</a>, <a
href="http://7gables.org" target="_blank">The House of Seven Gables</a>, and the many
witch-related craft shops. But don't go there after 5 p.m. as all stores are closed. Bobbe
said so. Scary, very scary there.</p>

<p>Now one of the strategies Tom uses is one of &#147;do as the locals do, go where the
locals go.&#148; <a href="http://www.pubresources.com" target="_blank">Patsy Ames</a> from
<a href="http://www.ipswichma.com" target="_blank">Ipswich</a>, MA (&#147;almost too close
to Danvers,&#148; said Patsy) played tour guide when she foolishly posted a sign that
said:</p>

<p align="center"><small>&#147;Anyone interested in going to a local beach then to a local
seafood, clambake restaurant? I have a van.&#148;</small></p>

<p>Ummm, we ran on all fours to line up at the start gate Wednesday night. In what was to
be only one van, a caravan of seven packed automobiles ensued with more people meeting us
at the restaurant. The fact that the planned <a
href="http://www.emerson.edu/majestic/history/BosTheatres.html" target="_blank">Boston
Theater</a> district outing was cancelled due to the terrorist attack helped to increase
the flood of people. Patsy took us down the winding road through Ipswich which in
territory is huge, but Patsy warned us not to sneeze when we drove through the
&#147;downtown&#148; section or else we'd miss it (two blocks worth). We arrived at the <a
href="http://http://boston.citysearch.com/profile/11352054/" target="_blank">Crane Beach</a>
parking lot at 6:50 p.m. where the attendant graciously let us in for a quick look
(closing was at 7 p.m. sharp). Well, we wished we had more time because the beach was
beautiful. One of the top-rated beaches in the nation for its white sand, sand dunes,
surf, and tall sand grass along with a boardwalk up to the beach.<img

<p>After a quick stroll on the beach we headed over to <a href="http://www.woodmans.com"
target="_blank">Woodman's</a> of Essex for lobster roll, clambakes, and clam chowdha.
Mmmm, it was mahvelous. Grandpa &#147;Chubby&#148; (every heard of a restaurateur called
&#147;Skinny&#148;?) Woodman, the inventor of the fried clam, started the restaurant and
clambake catering business back in 1914. Today, two generations of Woodman's keep the
restaurant going. Hmmm, wonder if they would cater eight hours north to Ottawa?</p>

&#147;r's&#148; as in &#147;Paul Reveah is way wee-id&#148; (translation: Paul Revere is

<p>This year's conference will not be forgotten for many reasons. In the midst of the
WTC/Pentagon tragedy and the connection with Boston's Logan airport had impacted everyone
at CorelWorld and abroad. We experienced several emotions during the week starting with
the conference euphoria at the start of the week, to the stunned observance of the TV
images on September 11th, to the emotional tumble for some of the exhausted staff at
week's end. What it did bring, however, was the CorelWorld family closer together by
dealing with the horror together. We really had no choice. Either face the grim news in
solitude or join together and unite.</p>

<p>Perhaps we can sum up the conference by quoting what attendee Mark Doth of <a
href="http://www.trekwest.com" target="_blank">Grindstone Graphics and Marketing Services</a>
from Ruidoso, New Mexico posted in the <a
href="http://216.110.171.213/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;number=2&amp;SUBMIT=Go"
target="_blank">Boston, CorelWorld forum</a>:</p>

<p align="center"><small><em>&#147;Three cheers for Rick Altman for keeping the conference
together and moving in a positive direction! I seem to be more calm about things since
last week. I don't yell ant idiot drivers when they cut me off in traffic. Life is too
short. I refuse to let my computer upset me when it crashes. It's just a machine. It's
just a machine. It's just a machine.&#148;</em></small></p>

<p>Now before you go, the story doesn't end here. We still have to find out how Tom and
others got home. Did he fly? Did he drive or hitch a ride with a travelling Polka band?
Was he searched at the border? Was his family worried? Is this too? many? questions? To
read the continuation story including how one attendee got to play Twister with a bunch of
virgins, please go to <a href="http://www.anzai.com/cworld01_II.htm">CorelWorld '01 Part
Deux</a>.</p>

<p><big><strong>And Lastly Some Great Late Breaking News</strong></big></p>

<p>To make sure we leave on a positive note, Corel Corp. just recently announced
third-quarter earnings of one US cent a share for a net income of $500,000. This is
Corel's third straight profitable quarter. Chief financial officer John Blaine said this
can be attributed to the company's stronger fiscal discipline over the last year. Expenses
were 33 per cent less than the same quarter in 2000. In addition, Burney said Corel would
contribute 20 per cent of its third-quarter earnings to help with relief efforts in the
United States, in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>

<p>Well, if that doesn't warm your Corel socks...I don't know what will.</p>

    <td><font size="2">Why is it that when you stay at Hotels they insist on supplying new
    towels and changing your bed <em>every</em> day? Heck, at home it's lucky if the bed
    sheets are changed bi-weekly! And what's with that sharp tapping at the door followed by
    the infamous...wait for it...&#147;housekeeping, housekeeping!&#148;. Now don't get me
    wrong here most of those chambermaids are really sweet people but ever try holding a
    conversation with them? When you try to give them heck for changing your bed every day,
    they smile and say &#147;thank you, thank you&#148;. I just don't think they understand.
    At any rate, remember to leave them a tip when you depart. In all nationalities, money
    talks!<br>
