    <td width="444">If you&#146;ve been following our Moccasin Telegraph columns, you may
    recall an entry from back in <a href="http://www.cowboyhvn.com/mtjan01.htm">January</a>
    about an expedition we&#146;ve been monitoring the progress of via the <a
    href="http://ski.mountainzone.com/2001/yellowstone/html/updates/index.html">Mountainzone</a>
    site. Winston Goodbody and Joe Harney are on a most ambitious ski tour of the Greater
    Yellowstone area; beginning and ending in Wyoming, crossing Yellowstone Park coming and
    going, with Bozeman as the northern apex of their trip. Much easier said than
    done&#133;.There are a staggering amount of extremely rugged and remote mountains, and
    even the flatter riverbottoms consist of some of the most remote country in the lower 48.
    I had expressed reservations about their proposed route through the Absarokas, and
    particularly a specific spot near the start of the southbound portion of their tour; along
    the Gallatin Crest in the vicinity of Crater Lake. It seemed avalanche danger was all but
    guaranteed to be extreme. (See the prior <a href="http://www.cowboyhvn.com/mtjan01.htm">Telegraph</a>
    entry pertaining to my experiences in the area.) <p>Well, I&#146;m glad to report that Win
    and Joe made it through unscathed. Due to the ironic combination of low snowpack and high
    avalanche danger, they decided to bag their originally proposed route near the crest of
    the Absarokas. Those are some of the most rugged mountains in Montana, and a
    high-elevation late winter traverse of the range would border on suicidal, in my opinion.
    Instead they followed the lower Slough Creek/Boulder River route east of the main Absaroka
    Range, a wise decision that in no way diminishes their accomplishments; a classic example
    of disgression being the better part of valor. </p>
    <p>After catching a ride to Bozeman, they did follow their proposed route along the
    Gallatin Crest, and from their reports it was a highlight of their trip. The views from up
    there are stupendous, and it&#146;s one of our favorite hiking areas. Most of the crest is
    at or near 10,000&#146; of elevation, and as Win says &quot;It&#146;s harder to think of
    another vantage point from which one can see more of Greater Yellowstone at one
    time&quot;. A ski tour along the crest, not to mention the rest of their journey, would
    certainly be an epic trip. I&#146;ve gotta admit, though, avalanches scare me. I love
    adventure, but I hope to die at a ripe old age, and tempting fate by skiing avalanche
    chutes is not a good way to achieve that goal. In the collection of photos from their trip
    on the Mountainzone site, there&#146;s one of their ski tracks switchbacking up Hyalite
    Peak, directly below a scary looking cornice, that gives me the willies just to look
    at&#133;.So, I think I&#146;ll stick to summer hiking along the crest. In the milder
    seasons, it&#146;s possible to drive to within a couple of miles of the crest, and begin
    your hike at around 8000&#146;, instead of slogging from the valley floor. See our <a
    href="http://www.cowboyhvn.com/hiking.htm">Hiking</a> article section for trail reviews
    and directions about different routes. </p>
    <p>Win and Joe camped at a couple of my favorite spots along the crest; Crater Lake and
    Windy Pass. My son and I hiked to Crater Lake via an<img align="right"
    alt="Crater Lake, along the Gallatin Crest" height="223"
    src="http://www.cowboyhvn.com/images/CraterLake.jpg" width="293"> obscure
    &quot;trail&quot; up South Fork Swan Creek last summer. The accompanying photo is looking
    roughly north along the crest. Lewis Creek descends to the Yellowstone to the right of the
    photo. Unfortunately, that drainage is blocked to public access by private land. However,
    we can book you a stay at one of the top guest ranches around, located at the mouth of the
    canyon, in which case you can ride<img align="left" alt="Windy Pass  cabin" height="268"
    src="http://www.cowboyhvn.com/pay/WindyPass.jpg" width="240"> horseback to the lake. Also,
    there&#146;s a Forest Service cabin seasonally available for rent at Windy Pass, see our <a
    href="http://www.cowboyhvn.com/camping.htm">Camping</a> article page for details.</p>
    <p>See you on the Crest&#133;.<br>

    <td width="444">It looks like the dead of winter outside, but according to the calendar
    it&#146;s spring. It must be, since the sandhill cranes are back! The last few mornings
    prior to the snowstorm we&#146;re having now, while feeding the horses at daylight I was
    hearing an odd croaking noise, likely of avian origin. I commented to my wife that
    somebody in the neighborhood must have peacocks, but a few days ago the croaking noise was
    obviously coming from two sources, and lo and behold, a sandhill crane flew over, calling
    away like mad. The return of birds great and small is always a welcome sight &amp; sound
    after a long winter, an early sign that spring is on the way! The cranes are the<img
    src="images/SandhillCranes.jpg" alt="Sandhill Cranes" align="right" width="268"
    height="200"> earliest arrivals to begin their spring reproductive ritual, laying claim to
    prime nesting real estate. They must have a fairly varied vocal repertoire, as their calls
    sometimes more closely resemble screams than croaks. The first time I heard it, I was
    fishing the Virginia City Dredge Ponds (a sleeper trophy fishing spot, although some of
    them are restricted to kids 12 &amp; under; see our <a href="fishing.htm">Fishing Article</a>
    page). While walking along the old narrow-gauge railroad track between Virginia City and
    Nevada City, something cut loose with the most piercing and vivid screech, so different
    from anything I&#146;d heard before, that I stood there half alarmed and considered
    getting the heck out of there. But, I was fairly secure in the knowledge that it
    wasn&#146;t a mountain lion, and darn sure wasn&#146;t a grizzly bear, and since other
    creatures that can inflict harm on the unwary fisherman in that area consist mainly of
    rattlesnakes (not known for piercing shrieks), I decided to keep fishing. Soon I saw the
    cranes, who apparently took exception to my fishing in their territory as they shut up as
    soon as I passed. Anyway, these cranes setting up shop in our neighborhood certainly
    aren&#146;t shrieking, at least not yet. Their vocalizations are more of a basso profundo
    series of croaks, something like a bullfrog with a good PA system.<p>I hear a thousand or
    so trumpeter swans arrived at Ennis Lake a few days back, and the snow geese and honkers
    are flying into Freezeout Lake daily. On my recent snowshoe trek, I was camped on a
    ridgetop at about 7200&#146; on the west slope of the Madison Range. It seemed like every
    goose in creation was migrating right over my tent that night. It wasn&#146;t exactly a
    prime campsite, as level ground free of snow was in short supply. I&#146;d found a
    semi-level area under a big Douglas Fir, chiseled a few of the bigger rocks out, and
    I&#146;ve certainly had more comfortable beds. So, I was sleeping fitfully anyway, and
    every time I&#146;d drift off I&#146;d be jolted awake sure a flock of geese were going by
    ten feet overhead. Since I couldn&#146;t sleep, and it was a still moonlit night, I
    decided I might as well get up and watch. It turned out the geese were at least several
    hundred feet above, but that moonlight view, with geese above and coyotes below both
    announcing the importance of their tasks at hand, was such a vivid recharge for my psyche
    that a little lost sleep seemed an entirely inconsequential price to pay.</p>
    <p>Spring is a schizophrenic season in the northern Rockies, with glimpses of summer and
    flashbacks of winter often both occurring within the span of a few hours. East Glacier
    reportedly received three feet of snow a week ago, and much of the state has been under
    winter storm watches at different times over the last week. That&#146;s good, within
    reason, as we can certainly use the moisture, but I am about over winter, personally.
    I&#146;m ready for more bird calls, pussywillow buds, insect hatches on trout streams, and
    general greenness. Come on, spring&#133;.</td>
