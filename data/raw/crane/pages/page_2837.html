<p>Problems can sometimes arise when people come across young animals in the wild. Spring is a time when well-meaning people may find a baby bird or animal that appears to be abandoned by its parents.</p>

<p><b>Big game animals</b></p>

<p>Fawning season in Utah begins in early May and runs through the middle of June. Every year about this time, people find young elk or deer and, believing the baby has been abandoned by its mother, take it home to "take care of it."</p>

<p>Deer, elk and other mammals often leave their young for long periods of time while the parents feed or rest. They rely on the young animal's natural camouflage, lack of scent and instincts to protect it. In all likelihood, the mother was either feeding or even watching as the good folks drove away with its baby. As difficult as it may be, you should leave any young animal you find right where you find it. Don't try and feed it or pet it.</p>

<p><b>Birds</b></p>

<p>In Utah, we also enjoy a variety bird species. Many Utahns have already heard the peeping of baby birds coming from nearby trees, houses or fields. Many people find baby birds hopping around the yard. Most of these birds are old enough to leave the nest, but are still not good flyers or need just a few days for their feathers to finish growing.</p>

<table width="310" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" align="left">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="300">
	<img src="/news/05-04/chick.jpg" width="300" height="217" border="1" alt="photo"><br>
	<span class="body11" style="color:#555555; line-height:20px;">Sandhill Crane chick</span><br>

</td>
<td width="10"><img src="/images/clear.gif" width="10" height="1" alt=""></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If you find a bird that is fully feathered, leave it where you find it. The parents are still feeding it, and it should be capable of flying within a few days. If you find a baby bird with few or no feathers, look for its nest and put it back. Contrary to common belief, touching a baby bird and leaving your scent on it does not cause the parents to abandon it. Most birds have a poor sense of smell, and the crying of a bird's young will trigger parenting instincts to care for the nestling.</p>

<p><b>Leave them where you find them</b></p>

<p>Baby wild animals are fascinating creatures. While they are small, cute and playful, they do not make good pets. Wild animals, which are raised in captivity, have a very poor chance of surviving in the wild when they're released. Their natural parents are by far the best caregivers and teachers. For these and other reasons, it is illegal in Utah to possess most species of wild animals. In the rare case where human intervention is needed, only wildlife rehabilitators, with the proper state and federal permits, may care for them.</p>
