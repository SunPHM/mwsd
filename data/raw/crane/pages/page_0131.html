    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The DL (home of GVT's System Shop - Alco Heaven) is located
    at the end of Breck Street, off of Pittston Ave (Rt. 11), in the South Side section of
    Scranton, right behind Notarrani Produce.&nbsp; That is where a one track siding, together
    with the enginehouse leads are used for making up trains, and the starting point of all
    crews.&nbsp; Crew line ups are directed out of the DL's offices on the second floor of the
    former D&amp;H freight house, which the DL shares with its landlord - the Lackawanna
    County Railroad Authority, and customer 7D Lumber on the lower level.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The DL normally has two or three crews going on duty five
    days a week at the GVT South Scranton shop in the early morning. There is no set schedule
    as to what crews go where or when. It is all on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis. Carbondale
    sees 4-5 day/week service. Note that the third crew works Sunday at 0800 and are on-call
    Monday-Thursday. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The trip down to the R&amp;N at Pittston has become an
    infrequent route, as all of the DL&#146;s NS interchange is now made directly with the NS
    at Portland with the DL&#146;s Portland Turn, which usually runs on Tuesday and Friday. In
    addition to the Portland turn, a propane dealer in Tobyhanna warrants more than two trips
    a week up the old Lackawanna main, as well as the CP-powered grain trains to Mount Pocono.
    The Portland Turn will service the propane dealer as well as the grain train, and an
    occasional &#147;gas extra&#148; as the weather gets colder.<o:p></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>UPDATE - 11/26/01:&nbsp; </strong>In Scranton the
    DL has begun serving a new location for Laminations, located in a deep rock cut the new
    track is accessed by a switch back next to the co-gen plant at Archbald, Pa, on the
    Carbondale Line of the DL. The trackage provides interesting photo possibilities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Kane freezer warehouse in South Scranton has been sold
    to Henningsen, a large national freezer warehouse company that is very pro rail. Look for
    more refers and Cryo cars to begin showing up in Southside.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Also in Scranton with new traffic patterns on the Pocono
    Main with the NS interchange relocated to Portland, PA, the Pocono Main sometimes sees two
    or maybe even three trains operating on the line at one time.&nbsp; NS usually runs a

    the Poconos out of the Lackawanna Valley, for a 32 mile run to the mill. The train made a
    nice 1:18 run to the mill arriving just before 7:00 PM. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Mill manager Regis Weiss stated the
    &quot;this is an exciting day for us, until now, we were just overseeing construction of
    the flour mill. Now this is the starting point of our operation here&quot;. &nbsp; The
    grain received will be the start of operation's plans to fill all of the sixteen 130 foot
    tall silos, allowing them to &quot;settle&quot; for at least 45 days while the finishing
    touches are put on the milling and bagging equipment. Actual milling began in December
    1998.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">Prior to the 2 to 3 unit grain trains per
    week, and the build up of the Keystone Propane business, the track was used by Conrail, in
    December 1996, when they detoured a couple of GPU Energy unit coal trains to their plant
    at Portland. These detours occurred while the regular route over Conrail's Portland
    Secondary was washed out.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">2000 saw a month after month growth by Keystone Propane at
    Tobyhanna, a revitalization of the inbound and outbound business at Chamberlain
    Manufacturing, adjacent to Steamtown in downtown Scranton, Pa., and the location of a new
    lumber wood processing facility on the old Lackawanna main at Cresco, Pa.&nbsp; The
    latter&#146;s siding is expected to be installed by mid May. Working together with the
    Lackawanna County Railroad Authority, the DL completed a complete resurfacing of Bridge 60
    in Scranton, along with a reconnection and complete rebuilding of the historic DL&amp;W
    Diamond [mine] Branch. The Branch diverts off of the Pocono Main on Bridge 60, and
    provides a strategic connection to the DL&#146;s former D&amp;H main, via the Vine Street
    Branch.&nbsp; Previous access between the EL and D&amp;H lines were only over access
    rights over the CP/D&amp;H. With the rebuilding of Bridge 60, the North leg of the WYE was
    reconnected [on a alignment slightly west of the former DL&amp;W/EL through main]. This
    newly replaced track allows two connections to the CP main, and straight
    northbound/southbound [EL east-westbound] moves from off of the CP on to the DL&#146;s
    Pocono Main, and points east. Occasionally, unit grain trains are interchanged to the DL
    over this leg of the wye, and onto the Mall Siding, rather than the runaround move at
    Taylor Yard.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>RAILROAD TRAFFIC CONTINUES TO GROW IN LACKAWANNA
      COUNTY</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>By Jennifer L. Henn, Scranton Times Tribune</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">For the fifth year in a row, traffic on railroad tracks in
      Lackawanna County has increased, with more cars hauling more material to and from than any
      year since the system was activated. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A total of 6,418 carloads of freight moved across the
      county during 2002, up 7 percent from 2001, according to Larry Malski, executive director
      of the Lackawanna County Railroad Authority. The authority owns the tracks and contracts
      with Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad Co. for usage. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When the authority launched services on the lines in 1985,
      just 393 carloads rolled over the tracks. In the past five years, use has jumped 270
      percent. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Those statistics are in keeping with national rail trends,
      according to Warren Flatau, spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration.&nbsp;
      &quot;Generally speaking, smaller railroads and carriers have continued to increase over
      the last several years,&quot; he said. &quot;Despite what's been happening with the
      economy, hauling and material transport traffic on our rail lines continues to
      climb.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Chuck Riedmiller, Delaware-Lackawanna vice president,
      attributes the increase to the railroad and rail authority's efforts to attract new
      business. In recent years, Chamberlain Manufacturing and Compression Polymers in Scranton
      and Brojack Lumber, which has a distribution site in Archbald, have put more of their
      products on the tracks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Recently, Valley Distribution in South Scranton added 400
      cars a year to the railway, using the lines to transport paper from Canada, Mr. Riedmiller
      said. &quot;Basically, the increase is attributed to the great working relationship we
      have with the authority,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone involved works hard to make this
      work, and it does.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Delaware-Lackawanna gives the authority about 10 percent of
      the money it earns on the railway. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The county program has helped make railroading in
      Northeastern Pennsylvania a growth industry, Mr. Malski said. He views that success as a
      tribute to the railroads that originally built the area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">&quot;These (cars) actually equate to new jobs,&quot; Mr.
      Malski said, as area businesses are better able to distribute their products and grow
      their companies. &quot;The railroad itself is an example. In 1985, it employed five ...
      now it employs more than 25.&quot; &nbsp;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>GVT RAIL&#146;S D-L RR EXPANDS</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">GVT RAIL&#146;S &quot;the&quot; Delaware-Lackawanna RR Co.
      Inc. (DL) announces, that thanks the Monroe County Railroad Authority (MCRA), they can now
      formally add the Delaware to their name, as a long term lease/purchase agreement has been
      consummated with Norfolk Southern Railway Corp. Under the agreements the D-L will assume
      the operation of 10 miles of former Lackawanna Railroad mainline trackage from
      Analomink/Gravel Place (NS MP 12.2), through the famous Delaware Water Gap and on into
      Portland, Pa. (NS MP 2.0) where they will interchange with NS. The new line brings the
      D-L&#146;s total trackage in the Lackawanna Valley-Pocono Mountain Region to 88.7 miles.
      The new trackage will be operated as an extension of the D-L&#146;s Pocono Main.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Bob Hay, Chairman MCRA, Larry Malski, MCRA railroad
      consultant, and David Monte Verde of the DL all cite the transaction as an excellent
      example of team work, partnership, and cooperation between a Class I railroad-NS, private
      regional Railroad-the DL and a county railroad authority-MCRA to foster a win/win railroad
      revival which will benefit the entire railroad industry.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">This trackage is an intricate piece of the railroad map
      which will provide Monroe County the rail access needed for the resumption of through
      passenger service from Scranton, through the Pocono&#146;s, Monroe County and New Jersey
      into New York City. The famous Lackawanna Cut-off, now under study for the resumption of
      passenger rail service, diverges from this new line at Slateford Junction in the Water
      Gap. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The Stroudsburg Secondary operation by NS was formally
      ended in Norfolk Southern&#146;s Bulletin Order #185: &quot;Effective 12:01 AM, Friday
      September 14, 2001, Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad headquartered in Scranton, Pa. will take
      ownership of and dispatch all movements between MP DG 2.0 and Gravel MP DG 12.2.&quot; The
      famous fence west of GRAVEL, once a &#145;statement&#146; by Conrail that the Pocono Main
      Line ends here, has been removed in preparation to become the new owners mainline. The
      DL&#146;s Bridge 60 dispatchers will commence control of trains over this the new segment
      of track. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The new trackage gives the DL access to four new rail
      customers, which include DiverseyLever Chemical and National at Gravel Place/E.
      Stroudsburg, PA. Hughes Printing at, and Rock-Tenn Packaging - East Stroudsburg, PA. Along
      with the new customers added by the DL, they will also be interchanging with the NS at
      Portland, thereby giving the DL a more direct connection to NS and the ability to run over
      their own railroad rather than two foreign roads to receive their NS interchange.
      Interchange with NS is intended to be Monday, Wednesday and Friday, returning regular
      daylight rail service through the historic Delaware Water Gap. This operation will place
      the famous DL ALCOs through the Gap in daylight hours, at least three days per week. The
      first interchange train is scheduled to operate on September 17th. It is also likely that
      these interchange runs could include in its consist the DL 2461, which began life as EL
      2461, which made many runs through the Gap as an EL unit.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">With the movement today of 4 dimensional loads GVT Rail's
      Delaware-Lackawanna RR, saw the culmination of close to $1m in capital improvements done
      to its Pocono Main between Scranton and Portland, Pa., to accommodate over 25 dimensional
      loads bound for the Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light's coal generating plant at Martin's
      Creek. When the NS's former Lehigh &amp; Hudson River RR bridge at Phillipsburg, Pa. could
      not accommodate the loads PPL officials sought an alternate route, and they turned to the
      D-L.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Like in 1996, when the DL came to the rescue of Conrail to
      get coal around a flooded line to the Portland power plant, the DL again came to the
      rescue of another Northampton County power plant. Looking to expand their Martins Creek
      Plant, PPL faced a costly trucking and bridge building process as an alternative, so the
      capital improvements to the DL became a better option.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Work was performed on an expedited basis during April, May,
      and June, by forces from R. J. Corman and DL's track department. Work included the
      replacement of close to a mile of curve worn rails, jacking of an old Erie Railroad
      bridge, a 2400 feet extension of the Winton siding to a new station sign COBBS,
      realignment of the &quot;Conrail end of the line curvature&quot; at Analomink, and the
      replacement of ties on the Receiver Track east out of Scranton. The two mile rehab of this
      track provided access to the south track (former EL eastbound main track out of Scranton)
      of the Nay Aug tunnel necessary to clear the 19'6&quot; dimensional loads that moved on
      this date.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition, the NS' Old Main under the Lackawanna Cut
      Off&quot;s Delaware River bridge was centered to give the entire line a 19'6&quot;

      <p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong>D-L TO BUILD SLATEFORD INTERCHANGE YARD WITH NS</strong></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Matching funds to a Penn DOT Rail Freight Assistance Grant
      the D-L, through the Monroe County Railroad Authority, is about to enter into a contract
      to construct a modest two track interchange yard running east from the old Slateford Tower
      in the Delaware Water Gap. The tracks will be constructed on, the railroad south, side of
      the &quot;Old Main&quot; leaving room between the tower and the new construction for the
      reconnection of the Lackawanna Cut Off to New Jersey. The yard, west of Portland, will
      provide a place for the NS and the D-L to interchange cars for their fast growing
      business, while eliminating the present end to end interchange at Portland. The
      construction will open a small vista of the Gap from the former Cut Off overhead, as the
      site is cleared in anticipation of the construction. Work is expected to be completed by
      September.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="3">In addition, the D-L will be matching funds to a Penn DOT
      Rail Freight Assistance Grant, obtained through the Lackawanna County Railroad Authority,
      to install over 4000 ties between Scranton and Moscow.&nbsp; Contractors will be starting
      the installation of these ties in late July, and a DL bolt tightening and replacement
      project, along with surface work will follow the tie work. This section the up Pocono Main
      up the west slope of the Poconos sees heavy traffic with the grain trains, the Portland
      Turn, and the Steamtown excursions which started running on July 4th.</font></p>
