      by staff, research fellows, associates and postgraduate students of the 
      Construction Management Group addresses the whole range of activities in 
      the construction cycle. General areas of research range from project appraisal 
      to maintenance management, from value management to customer service and 
      from marketing and ethics to technical design support. <BR>
        <BR>Recently the Group has expanded its interests to include more work
        on construction project management, including risk management, project
        financing, investment appraisal, total quality management, best practice
        and business process re-engineering. Current research topics include a
        major review of the use of the Private Finance Initiative to provide
        transportation infrastructure, in particular light rail transit schemes.
        This work involves construction companies changing their traditional
        working environments and participating in project financing, marketing,
        operation and maintenance management and becoming committed over a much
        longer period of time in order to remain competitive.

      response the the national research theme of integrated design and construction, 
      the Group has received funding from the Research Councils, the Departments 
      of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and from industry to conduct 
      research concerned with structural steelwork. The research work is supported 
      by active collaboration and support from a number industrial organisations, 
      each one a market leader in its own sector. The team are developing a prototype 
      decision support system for the designer which will include the integration 
      of information from the fabrication, transportation and erections phases. 
      <BR>
        <BR>A common theme of much of the Group's work is the effective
        management and usage of information. This general area of Construction
        Informatics is recognised as increasingly important to the construction
        industry at at time when commercial pressures, quality targets and
        competition are imposing ever more rigorous performance targets. Future
        research will seek to identify and validate mechanisms whereby
        Construction Informatics might be improved.

      a higher degree need not confine themselves to the shortlist of topics outlined 
      here, but should forward an abstract of their preferred research topic when
