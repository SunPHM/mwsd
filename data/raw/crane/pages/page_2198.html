<P>Cranes are among the oldest living birds, with fossils dating back millions
of years. Cranes are also the Earth's tallest flying birds, with the Whooping
Crane reaching heights greater than 5 feet. The most numerous of all the
cranes is the Sandhill Crane, which is one of two kinds of cranes found
in North America. Sandhill Cranes are approximately 43 inches tall, weighing
7 to 14 pounds, and have wing spans of 6 to 7 feet. They are omnivorous,
eating cultivated grains when available during migration; and can be found
in marshes, grasslands, and fields. The Sandhill Crane is distinguished
by its resonating, trumpet-like call, which can be heard for miles, and
the various dances which it performs.</P>

<P>The Sandhill Crane can <A HREF="http://www.baraboo.com/bus/icf/sandhill.htm"
TARGET="_blank">migrate</A> up to 14,000 miles round trip at a maximum altitude
of 13,000 feet (Terres, 1980). They fly with their long neck and legs fully
extended, and they call constantly during flight to keep the flock together.
The migratory flocks can be composed of hundreds of birds, and it is not
uncommon for them to fly in a V formation. The Eastern Greater Sandhill
Crane (Grus canadensis tabida) is the subspecies which migrates through
Tennessee. These birds fly south from their northern breeding grounds in
Canada and the northern U. S. to winter in the south from the southern U.
S. to central Mexico.</P>

<P>An adult Sandhill Crane may have over 12 vocalizations. (Tacha, et. al,
1992) Their calls have been described as trumpeting, bugling, rattling,
and croaking, but no adjective can do justice to the volume and quality
of the sounds they produce. The unique sound is due to the length and positioning
of its trachea. The Sandhill Crane has a 6 to 8 inch trachea which coils
into the hollowed sternum giving their call harmonies and an expanded amplitude.
In general, Sandhill Cranes are most vocal during the mornings, beginning
right before sunrise, and in the late afternoons at feeding time. They are
also quite garrulous when arriving at their roosts or at pre-roost gatherings.</P>

<P>The vocalizations of the Sandhill Crane fall into three categories: trills
and purrs, loud rattles, and non-rattle calls. (Tacha, et. al, 1992) The
trills and purrs are the first to develop, and are given almost continuously
from hatching until the adult calls develop. The slow, low frequency trills
and purrs can even be heard before the young hatch. The loud <A HREF="http://www.petersononline.com/birds/week/sacr.html"
TARGET="_blank">rattles</A> are usually given in a series of 7 to 20 as
a shrill, rolling garoo-a-a-a, and can be heard up to 4 km away. While in
flight, the rattles have a rising or falling inflection and are a higher
frequency than those given on the ground. The rattles might be given as
a guard call when the bird is afraid, but not enough to flee. Unison calls
are also loud rattles. A pair or family might call in unison as a duet,
with the females part being higher and shorter than the males. The unison
calls can be an aggression display or can assist in the reproductive synchrony
and territorial defense of a pair. Non-rattle calls are used during aggressive
behavior such as bill sparring, or simply as location calls. They are also
used to alert others in the flock of taking flight or landing. Another non-rattle
call sometimes occurs as a &quot;snore&quot; while the Sandhill Crane is
on its roost.</P>

<P>The &quot;<A HREF="http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/odnr/wildlife/publications/wildnotes/sandhil.html"
TARGET="_blank">Crane Dance</A>&quot; (Perrins and Middleton, 1985) consists
of head bobbing and deep bows; leaps up to 8 feet off the ground; grasping
with the bill and tossing up objects such as feathers, stones, and tussocks;
and, running with the wings flapping or short, low ritual flights. If two
paired cranes come face to face upright, one bird bows while the other leaps.
If the two cranes are not a pair, the birds will assume stiff threat postures,
flapping their wings, stamping, and arching their backs. Sometimes, Sandhill
Cranes will dance for pleasure. In a preening flock, dancing seems to be
contagious, with the entire flock following the example of one bird who
begins to dance. The Crane Dance can often be recognized in the tribal dances
of Native Americans, Australian aborigines, the Ainu of Japan, and various
African tribes. (Perrins and Middleton, 1985)</P>

<P>Dancing also plays an important role in certain stages in the life of
a Sandhill Crane. Downy chicks might bow and run in excitement at the approach
of their parents. The subadult participates in &quot;social dancing&quot;
to redirect its aggression or kindle bonds between potential pair members.
Newly paired members of the flock may engage in periods of vigorous dance,
especially before mating. Dancing is the primary mechanism of pair forming,
and plays an important part in stabilizing and synchronizing new or unstable
relationships. Established pairs, for example, have no prerequisite dancing
ritual before mating. (Perrins and Middleton, 1985)</P>

<P>The song and dance of a Sandhill Crane is complex and fascinating. For
