<p>Each year, 300 million monarch butterflies from most of North America vanish into
Mexico in what is undoubtedly the greatest of all migrations. They flutter from
as far north as Canada and the United States east of the rocky Mountains to
twelve ancestral wintering grounds in the remote mountains of central Mexico.&nbsp;
Most monarchs west of the Rockies travel to small groves of trees along the
California coast. [<a href="http://www.monarchwatch.org/tagmig/fallmap.htm" target="_blank">
Fall Migration Map</a>] In Mexico, in semi-dormancy, the insects cling together for seven months, so tightly packed
on fir branches as to color entire groves of trees in orange and black. The
tree branches bend under the weight of 30 to 100 million butterflies packed into
a three-acre area. From the air the patch of butterfly forest glows bright
orange as if on fire.&nbsp; The monarchs choose their winter roosting sites
well. Located on Mexico's volcanic belt at altitudes over 9000 feet, the
sheltered trees sit on cool, north-facing slopes where low, moist cloud cover
prevents their drying out and the tree canopy protects against winds and frost. Most
important, the sites are thermally stable, with temperatures ranging from 42 to
60 degrees F, not cold enough to freeze the butterflies, but not warm enough to
speed up their metabolism and thereby waste energy needed for flight and
reproduction in the spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike most temperate-climate insects, monarchs are unable to withstand freezing temperatures. Yet they are dependent on milkweed
plants, which thrive in colder climates, for food and protection.&nbsp; For this
reason, monarchs spend part of the year in North America, where 100 different
species of milkweeds flourish. [<a href="http://www.monarchwatch.org/tagmig/spmap.htm" target="_blank">Spring
Migration Map</a>] Females lay their eggs on the underside of the
toxic leaves. When the tiny caterpillars hatch three to twelve days later, they
begin eating the leaves, ingesting the plants' poisonous cardiac glycosides. In
just two weeks, the caterpillars grow to 3,000 times their birth weight. During
the ensuing weeklong metamorphosis, the milkweed toxins are passed from
caterpillar to butterfly. Birds quickly get the message to leave these brightly
colored insects alone, as the bad-tasting toxins make them vomit. [See <a href="http://w3.tvi.cc.nm.us/~swan/populations.htm#Batesian Mimicry" target="_blank">Mimicry</a>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their food source in the temperate zone and their
winter roosting areas in the tropics, monarchs solved the distance problem by
becoming the only species in their family that migrates. No other butterfly
migrates like the monarch, traveling farther than any other tropical species, up
to three thousand miles. Weighing one-fifth of
an ounce, the fragile insects can fly eighty miles a day. They reach their
summer destinations by leapfrogging north in successive generations - several
generations are born, breed, and die before the last generation reaches Canada
in time for the winter migration south. With no previous knowledge of the route
or the destination, the last generation fuels up on flower nectar and then flies
by instinct 2,000 miles south to Mexico -- right back to the same three acre
patch of forest. Propelled on breezes at speeds up to thirty-five miles per
hour, these &quot;flying flowers&quot; make the return trip in six weeks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flocks of greater sandhill cranes, members of he
oldest living family of birds in the world, can be seen flying over the open
wetlands of New Mexico's Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge
is a primary wintering area for more than 12,000 of these magnificent birds, together
with thousands of snow geese [<a href="http://www.pbs.org/audubon/wildwings/namerica.html" target="_blank">Flyway
Map</a>], Canada geese, and other waterfowl. Six
subspecies of sandhill cranes inhabit North America and Cuba. Of these, three
are migratory and inhabit the West, where they winter in New Mexico, Texas,
Mexico, and parts of the Gulf Coast. When they migrate, cranes fly in long lines
across the sky, using rising thermals to carry them to altitudes as high as
13,000 feet. While aloft, or when alarmed, the cranes' sonorous, trumpeting
calls can be heard for several miles. The calls are produced through
extraordinarily long windpipes which have been compared to French horns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of North America's largest birds (the Whooping Crane
is larger), sandhill cranes
stand up to four feet tall with a six-to-seven-foot wingspan. For the most part,
they are shy, wary birds. Each year,
500,000 migrating sandhill cranes converge along the eighty-mile stretch of the
Platte River in Nebraska to rest and refuel before
continuing their migration north. With 10,000 to 20,000 birds packed per mile,
it is the largest single gathering of cranes in the world, constituting roughly
80 percent of the total sandhill crane population in North America.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the winter, as they fly between their daily feeding
and roosting sites, greater sandhill cranes fill the dawn and dusk skies over
the Bosque del Apache. See [<a

In the spring they
migrate to Gray's Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho and the greater
Yellowstone ecosystem. The cranes pair for life and maintain their monogamous
bonds by performing musical duets and elaborate bowing and leaping courtship
dances at both their wintering and breeding grounds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following their spring migration, the crane couples stake
out and defend enormous territories on which they build large mound nests. Both
parents incubate two brown-spotted eggs and attend the young. Because northern
summers last only three months, young cranes must grow quickly in order to be
strong enough to survive the fall migration. Sandhill cranes are especially
sensitive to human disturbance and need large open areas of shallow wetlands in
order to nest successfully. Even under ideal circumstances, coyotes and ravens
prey heavily on the eggs and young.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> The whooping crane is the tallest North American bird.
Males, which may approach 1.5 meters in height, are larger than females. Adults
are snowy white except for black primary feathers on the wings and a bare red
face and crown. The bill is a dark olive-gray, which becomes lighter during the
breeding season. The eyes are yellow and the legs and feet are gray-black.
Immatures are a reddish cinnamon color that results in a beautiful mottled
appearance as the white feather bases extend. The juvenile plumage is gradually
replaced through the winter months and becomes predominantly white by the
following spring as the dark red crown and face become apparent. Yearlings
achieve the typical adult appearance by late in their second summer or fall. The
life span is estimated to be 22 to 24 years in the wild. Whooping cranes are
omnivorous feeders. They feed on insects, frogs, rodents, small birds, minnows,
and berries in the summer. In the winter, they focus on predominantly animal
foods, especially blue crabs and clams. They also, however, forage for acorns,
snails, crayfish and insects in upland areas.
<p><b>REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT:</b> Whooping cranes are monogamous and form
life-long pair bonds but will remate following the death of a mate. Whooping
cranes return to the same breeding territory in Wood Buffalo National Park,
Canada, in April and nest in the same general area each year. Whooping cranes
construct nests of bulrush and lay one to three eggs, but mostly two-egg
clutches, in late April and early May. The incubation period is about 29 to 31
days. Whooping cranes will renest if the first clutch is lost or destroyed
before mid-incubation. Both sexes share incubation and brood-rearing duties but
they seldom fledge more than one chick. Autumn migration begins in
mid-September, and most birds arrive on the wintering grounds in Texas by
late-October to mid-November. Whooping cranes migrate singly, in pairs, in
family groups or in small flocks, and are sometimes accompanied by sandhill
cranes. They are diurnal migrants, stopping regularly to rest and feed, and use
traditional migration staging areas. On the wintering grounds, pairs and family
groups occupy and defend territories. Subadults and unpaired adult whooping
cranes will form flocks, which use the same habitats but use areas outside
occupied territories. Subadults tend to winter in the area where they were
raised their first year, and paired cranes often locate their first winter
territories near their parents' winter territory. Spring migration is preceded
by dancing, unison calling, and frequent flying. Family groups and pairs are the
first to leave the refuge in late-March to mid-April. Juveniles and subadults
return to summer in the vicinity of their natal area, but are chased away by the
adults during migration or shortly after arrival on the breeding grounds. Only
one out of four hatched chicks survive to reach the wintering grounds. Whooping
cranes generally do not produce fertile eggs until age 4.
<p><b>RANGE AND POPULATION LEVEL:</b> The historic range of the whooping crane
once extended from the Arctic coast south to central Mexico, and from Utah east
to New Jersey, into South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The historic breeding
range once extended across the north-central United States and in the Canadian
provinces, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. A separate non-migratory
breeding population occurred in southwestern Louisiana. The current nesting
range of the self-sustaining natural wild population is restricted to Wood
Buffalo National Park in Canada and the current wintering grounds of this
population are restricted to the Texas Gulf Coast at Aransas National Wildlife
Refuge and vicinity. In June 1994, this population was estimated at 146
individuals.
<p>In 1975, an effort to establish a second, self-sustaining migratory flock was
initiated by transferring wild whooping crane eggs from Wood Buffalo National
Park to the nests of greater sandhill cranes at Grays Lake National Wildlife
Refuge in Idaho. This Rocky Mountain population peaked at 33 birds in 1985, but
declined to only seven birds in 1994. Pilot studies are being conducted to
reintroduce whooping cranes to a migratory situation by bonding captive-reared
chicks with wild cross-fostered adults, which would teach the chicks appropriate
survival techniques and a migration pathway.
<p>Captive populations exist at three facilities, including Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center, International Crane Foundation, and the Calgary Zoo. Several
whooping cranes are located at the San Antonio Zoological Gardens, Rio Grande
Zoo Park, and Grace, Idaho.
<p><b><i>Florida Experimental Nonessential Population</i>:</b> [See <a href="http://www.earthwatch.org/pubaffairs/pubs/cranes.html" target="_blank">Worldwatch
Institute Crane Research Page</a>] An experimental reintroduction of whooping
cranes in Florida was initiated in 1993 to establish a non-migratory population
at Kissimmee Prairie. This approach was influenced by the apparent failure to
establish a migratory population in the Rocky Mountain reintroduction, probably
the result of inappropriate sexual imprinting associated due to cross-fostering
with sandhill cranes and the lack of a proven technique for establishing a
migratory flock. A nonmigratory population will avoid the hazards of migration,
and by inhabiting a more geographically limited area than migratory cranes,
individuals can more easily find a compatible mate. Captive-reared chicks were
released and monitored, and three additional groups of whooping cranes were
released in 1994. Bobcat predation was a problem because young birds did not
select appropriate roost sites. By June 1994, there were 15 whooping cranes in
Florida, and behavioral observations indicate evidence of pair formation with
hope of the establishment of a nesting territory in Spring 1995.
<p><b>HABITAT:</b> The nesting area in Wood Buffalo National Park is a poorly
drained region interspersed with numerous potholes. Bulrush is the dominant
emergent in the potholes used for nesting. On the wintering grounds at Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, whooping cranes use the salt marshes that are
dominated by salt grass, saltwort, smooth cordgrass, glasswort, and sea ox-eye.
They also forage in the interior portions of the refuge, which are gently
rolling, sandy, and are characterized by oak brush, grassland, swales, and
ponds. Typical plants include live oak, redbay, Bermuda grass, and bluestem. The
Kissimmee Prairie experimental population release site includes flat, open
palmetto prairie interspersed with shallow wetlands and lakes. The primary
release site has shallow wetlands characterized by pickerel weed, nupher, and
maiden cane. Other habitats include dry prairie and flatwoods with saw palmetto,
various grasses, scattered slash pine, and scattered strands of cypress.
<p><b>REASONS FOR CURRENT STATUS:</b> The whooping crane population, estimated
at 500 to 700 individuals in 1870 had declined to only 16 individuals in the
migratory population by 1941 as a consequence of hunting and specimen
collection, human disturbance, and conversion of the primary nesting habitat to
hay, pastureland, and grain production. The main threat to whooping cranes in
the wild is the potential of a hurricane or contaminant spill destroying their
wintering habitat on the Texas coast. Collisions with power lines and fences are
known hazards to wild whooping cranes. The primary threats to captive birds are
disease and parasites. Bobcat predation has been a serious problem with the
Florida experimental population.
<p><b>MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION:</b> The self-sustaining wild population is
protected on public lands in the nesting area at Wood Buffalo National Park in
Canada and on the principal wintering area at Aransas National Wildlife Refuge
in Texas. A major traditional migratory stopover is at Salt Plains National
Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma. This population is closely monitored throughout the
nesting season, on the wintering grounds, and during migration. The Canadian
Wildlife Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are involved in recovery
efforts under a 1990 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), &quot;Conservation of
the Whooping Crane Related to Coordinated Management Activities.&quot;
