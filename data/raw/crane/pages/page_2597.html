<p><font SIZE="2"><img border="1" src="Diversity.jpg" align="right" width="184" height="129">The Sandhill
Crane Natural Area is located in north central Anoka County, within the City of
East Bethel.&nbsp; The Sandhill Crane Natural Area is comprised of 533 acres of
biologically significant lands which are unique to the Twin Cities Metropolitan
Region and also notable to the State of Minnesota.&nbsp; In the photo to the
right is an example of the diverse native prairie and oak savanna plant
communities that once dominated the landscape within the Sandhill Crane Natural
Area.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2">At the time of European settlement, the uplands in the
Sandhill Crane Natural Area were dominated by oak openings and barrens oak
savanna plant communities.&nbsp; Wet prairies, marshes and sloughs dominated the
lower areas around the lakes.&nbsp; These wetland communities included tamarack
swamps and fens, which were unique to the region at the time of settlement.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2"><img border="1" src="Blandings.jpg" align="right" width="184" height="132">Today, the
Sandhill Crane Natural Area still harbors numerous plant and animal communities
that are relatively undisturbed by humans.&nbsp; The Sandhill Crane Natural Area
and some of the adjacent lands are an outstanding resource, given its proximity
to the vastly expanding metropolitan area.&nbsp; Key conclusions from the
natural resource analysis include the following:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2">The natural communities of the SCNA constitute one of the
    largest areas of undisturbed land in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">The natural communities of the SCNA provide the types of
    habitat for at least one rare plant and one rare animal.&nbsp; The
    lance-leaf violet, a threatened species in the state of Minnesota, has been
    documented in some of the wetland communities. Blanding’s turtles, also
    threatened in Minnesota, have been documented within a mile of the SCNA, and
    it is likely that they make use of the site’s habitat.&nbsp; Above-right
    is a photo of a Blanding's turtle.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Sandhill Cranes, once a species of special concern, are
    still considered a special find and are becoming more prevalent at the SCNA.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">A long-term monitoring program will be established to
    detect ecological trends and to form and adapt possible resource management
    solutions.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">The overall goal for the SCNA is to identify restoration
    and management needs and to define and implement strategies that can sustain
    the native biological diversity and overall ecological functions within and
    surrounding the SCNA.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font SIZE="2">Due to the unique ecological integrity of the SCNA, low
impact, soft-surfaced trails and nature observation areas are the most desired
recreational uses.&nbsp; Already existing foot paths seem to be logical trail
corridors that will require minimal, if any, modifications and will provide
nature oriented recreational experiences.&nbsp; Providing an area of handicapped
accessability, under the concepts of the universal design framework, will
provide more people of different levels of ability an opportunity to have
life-enriching experiences at the SCNA.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2"><img border="1" src="RemnantPrairie.jpg" align="right" width="184" height="123">The
design program seeks to find a responsible balance between providing facilities
and amenities that allow the public to enjoy the SCNA without compromising its
natural character. The design program includes the following key components:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Provide a trailhead parking area.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Provide soft-surfaced recreational trails.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Provide observation areas to view wildlife.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Provide low-impact picnic areas.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font SIZE="2"><img border="1" src="Cranes.jpg" align="right" width="184" height="150">At this time, there are no designated parking areas, trails,
or other recreational amenities at the SCNA.&nbsp; The Interagency Mangement
Committee and the Citizen’s Advisory Committee are currently working together
to implement the design program outlined in the master plan.&nbsp; For the
adventurous native plant and wildlife enthusiast, very limited parking (along
city streets) and trail access opportunities are located at the dead-end of 209<sup>th</sup>
lane NE and along 207<sup>th</sup> Avenue NE.&nbsp; There are some existing
earth-surfaced trails that have not been designated and only offer limited
access and use opportunities.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2">Based on input from the SCNA Citizens Advisory Committee and a
number of public meetings, residents of East Bethel highly value the open space
and natural communities at the SCNA.&nbsp; A recognition that the SCNA provides
a number of environmental, social, and economic benefits is at the root of the
value that its neighbors place on the area.&nbsp; As such, there may be strong
support among nearby landowners to adopt voluntary best management practices and
land protection options that benefit the natural area by creating a future
conservation buffer.&nbsp; All private landowner rights will be fully respected
and any conservation effort implemented on private lands will be strictly
voluntary for interested landowners only.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2"><img border="1" src="Upland.jpg" align="right" width="184" height="131">The low-impact
recreational development of the Sandhill Crane Natural Area, as outlined in the
master plan, will require some capital investment.&nbsp; In all likelihood,
implementation will occur over a number of years as funding through various
sources becomes available.&nbsp; Emphasis will be placed on the priority of
creating an access road, parking area, and trails in the northwest corner of the
SCNA.&nbsp; To the right is a photo of the uplands within the SCNA that are
dominated by oak shrubland plant communities primarily due to fire suppression.</font></p>
<p><font SIZE="2">The Citizens Advisory Committee for the Sandhill Crane Natural
Area examined the high quality natural resources of this unique area, and
realize the potential for change as the area grows.&nbsp; The Committee
developed a vision that emphasizes protecting and enhancing the character and
quality of lands and resources in the SCNA and surrounding area.&nbsp;
Following, are some of the primary goals identified by the Citizens Advisory
Committee that will be critical to achieving the long term vision of the
Sandhill Crane Natural Area:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Maintain the existing character and natural appearance of
    the SCNA by keeping the natural communities intact.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Maintain and restore the habitats that support sandhill
    cranes and Blanding’s turtles.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Keep the area open to the public for educational purposes
    and low impact environmentally sensitive recreation, but remembering the
    primary goal is to protect the natural vegetation and animals in the area.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Do not construct any buildings or paved surfaces within
    biologically significant areas.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Keep publicity to a minimum.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">When designating soft-surfaced trails, avoid critical
    nesting areas and sensitive plant communities.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Work cooperatively with adjacent landowners to inform and
    employ best management practices and land protection options.</font></li>
  <li><font SIZE="2">Continue regular meetings and active interface among the
    Citizens Advisory Committee and the Interagency Management Committee.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2">The Sandhill Crane Natural Area project has recently been
nationally recognized by being the recipient of two national awards.&nbsp; The
National Recreation and Park Association - Great Lakes Region - presented their
Partnership award to the SCNA at the national convention in Chicago, IL in July
of 2000.&nbsp; In addition, the National Association of Counties presented their
Achievement award to the SCNA at the Annual Conference in New Orleans, LA in
July of 2002.</font></p>
