<P>It was on October 24, 1978 that I saw and photographed my
first white pelican in Door County.  A call came from the owners
of Gordon Lodge that a huge, white, lethargic bird was standing
in shallow water next to their main dock and that it appeared to
be quite tame.

<P>Within minutes I was aiming my camera at &quot;whitey,&quot;
eager to get at least one picture for the record of the enormous
bird which at that time was considered to be rare in Wisconsin.
After my third or fourth shot he eased into deeper water and
slowly chugged, like a powerful little tugboat, toward the bay.
Walking as briskly as I could I scooted out to the end of the
L-shaped pier.  Fortunately the stately bird paused just long
enough for a half dozen more pictures.

<P>That was the last time I saw one of these social birds in Door
County until June of 1999 when our nature class had a small flock
of around a dozen fly directly over our heads on Rock Island
State Park.  What an imposing picture they made with their white
bodies, huge yellowish-orange bills, black wing tips and eight to
nine-foot wingspread.

<P>The feature of their flight that was so impressing and
unforgettable was the air of majesty and dignity.  We were
reminded of a synchronized, well-rehearsed ballet.  Either they
appeared to flap their wings in unison or they glided together.
Their slow powerful wingbeats carried the birds with great
solemnity.  How we wished the exciting performance could have
lasted much longer.

<P>We had heard at the time that the nesting colony of white
pelicans on Cat Island north of the city of Green Bay had been
growing, so our sighting of the Rock Island flock was not totally
unexpected.  Today the sightings of what could be termed
&quot;non-breeding&quot; white pelicans have been quite regular
along both shores of Green Bay, along the shores of Door County,
and most likely south of Green Bay along the Fox River as well.

<P>The majority of people we talk to associate white pelicans
with Florida, not realizing that their nesting range includes
Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and North
Dakota, as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  The 200+ nests on Cat Island this
year reflect the typical nesting site of these unusual birds.
Islands in inland rivers and bays that are free of mammalian
predation are their usual choices, and naturally a good
day-to-day source of food is also important.

<P>The fact that white pelicans don’t breed until into their
third to fifth year accounts for the small flocks of non-breeding
birds that have been recently seen and reported.  My guess is
that these are birds that were hatched on Cat Island during the
past few years and, as frequently happens with colony-nesting
birds, they return to their natal area during the succeeding
years to feed and &quot;grow up&quot; until they are ready to
mate and nest.

<P>There are only six different species of pelicans in the world
with two being common to North America, the brown and the white.
So many people who vacation in winter in Florida soon come to
admire the brown pelican and its awesome ability to dive for
fish.  The white pelican is not built like its cousin, the brown
pelican, in that it is very buoyant, having hollow bones and an
unusual system of internal air sacs.  These graceful white birds
float very high on the water for being such large heavy creatures.
  They can weigh upwards of 18 to 20 pounds.

<P>The white pelican’s heavy body, long neck, long wide bill with
a capacious pouch, wings that are long and broad, short tail and
powerful legs, and large webbed feet make it appear more like a
caricature of a bird than a real one.

<P>This incredible bird’s bill can hold two to three times more
than its stomach can.  In fact it might scoop up to three gallons
of water along with the fish it catches.  As Dixon Lanier
Merritt’s famous limerick about the pelican (&quot;A wonderful
bird is the pelican…&quot;) states: &quot;Its bill can hold more
than its belican.&quot;

<P>Charlotte and I saw our first flock of around 25 white
pelicans north of Vero Beach, Florida in the mid 1970’s and were
fortunate to be able to watch them hunt for food in their famous
cooperative manner.  They were swimming in an arc, quite close to
one another, in the head of a narrow bay, all the while forcing
schools of small fish ahead of them into the shallows.  Suddenly
the birds began flailing their wings and splashing, and then down
went their cavernous beaks into the water to capture their prey.

<P>Incubation of the eggs lasts around 29 days.  Growth of the
chicks is fast and they are ready for flight at about 60 days.
There is no evidence that they nested in Wisconsin in the early
days.  Today their nesting site on Cat Island is being watched
carefully and monitored in all respects.  Perhaps the largest
nesting colony in the U.S. is at the Chase Lake National Wildlife
Refuge in North Dakota where as many as 8,000 pairs are nesting.

<P>We should count ourselves lucky that some of the world’s
largest and most beautiful, graceful and dignified waterbirds
have chosen to nest in our region.  &quot;What a wonderful bird
is the pelican!&quot;
