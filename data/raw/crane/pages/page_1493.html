<h1 align=Center>1996 Europe Trip Report</h1>
<p>
I was in Europe August 22 to November 11 1996: in the former West Germany, 
in and many former communist countries: East Germany, Poland, Russia, Latvia,
and the Czech Republic.

There are 8 images on this page, varying in size from 5K to 35K (JPEG
compressed).
The linked-to images vary from 18K to 67K.  I have about 17 rolls of
pictures from the trip; of course much happened on this adventure I
don't mention here.

After Dagmar hosted me in Frankfurt and Koblenz, I took off
bikeriding, making it to Halle after 700km or so of riding.  At this
point I was tired of the constant rain threat and terrible E German bike
routes.  I saw nice books and signs for the "Saale Radweg" and thought
this would be a nice way to go.  It turns out the Salle Radweg doesn't
really exist yet.  One day for kicks I decided to take a picture every time
I saw some ridiculous condition on the route, and it wound up being
an entire roll.  Anyway, after Halle I continued by train, and after
some nice bike riding along the Elbe near Dresden, I made it to Berlin.
Berlin is a pretty good city for biking around in.  Here is my faithful
bike at the Wilhelmstrasse portion of "The Wall:"

East Germany is under construction; many roads are ripped up.
Much of Berlin is an ocean of cranes, even familiar sights are flooded
with them:

I took the 34-hour trainride from Berlin to St. Petersburg for the
Shostakovich 90th birthday celebration.  This event is covered
quite excellently on a
<a href="http://bofh.its.rmit.edu.au/richard/trip96/afs.html">web page by Richard Muirden.</a>
Richard, Daria, Jim and I were treated wonderfully by various people
connected with Shostakovich, so that we got a special museum tour,
introduction to Shostakovich's kids, a backstage visit at the Symphony,
etc.  We saw the 4th annual Shostakovich String Quartet competition,
which helped me to set the American Tourist record for hearing
most different groups play Shostakovich String Quartet number 3 (3):

I also saw the Russian Museum and Hermitage, of course, but the 6 day
stay was mostly dominated by Shostakovich events.
The stay was in St. Pete was made easier by the English language-oriented
<a href="http://www.arcom.spb.su/users/ryh/home.html">St Petersberg Youth Hostel.</a>
I went on to Moscow; here I am at Shostakovich's grave:

This is at the Novodevichy Convent and Cemetery.  The convent is one
of the nicest places around Moscow, which is otherwise quite hectic.
The cemetery is large and also has Chekov, Gogol, Prokofiev, Khruschev.
Here is the Shostakovich grave without me:

<P>  See my list of 
<a href="ruslist.html">ridiculous observations on Russia,</a>
but don't get the impression I didn't like the people.  Its just quite
different.  I went to Riga, Latvia, then to Warsaw, then Krakow.
I didn't want to do tourist things; I wanted to meet and take about
politics with people.  So when doing my laundry at a student hotel in
Krakow, Poland, I was pleased to find out about the European Youth
Convention, signed up, and met many interesting people, most of whom
liked to party more than discuss politics, but we did plenty of both:

I retreated from 5 days of all this excitement to the beauty of the Tatry
Mountains at the Poland/Slovakia border.  I was there in late October.
I'd like to go back in Summer sometime, its quite nice:

I spent a week in the Czech Republic; Chesky Krumlov is quite nice. Poland
and the Czech Republic are cheap, interesting, pretty laid back and mostly easy
to travel in, though the people in travel services in Karlovy Vary seem
to have personality problems.  Then more time in Berlin, a quick visit
to ZEGG, and a lovely weekend in Rheinsberg for the Shostakovich Gessellshaft
annual meeting.
