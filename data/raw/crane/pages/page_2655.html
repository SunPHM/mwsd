<p><b><font size="+1">Water Demands Draining U.S. Rivers</font></b> </p>
<p><b>By J.R. Pegg<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, DC</b>, April 10, 2003 (ENS) - Many of America's rivers are 
suffering from severe water shortages, with drought and human water consumption 
placing some of these waterways in acute peril, warns a new report released 
today by American Rivers. </p>
<p>The conservation organization's report, &quot;America's Most Endangered Rivers of 
2003,&quot; details 10 rivers that face immediate and severe danger, but paints a 
larger picture of a nation tumbling towards a possible water crisis. </p>
<p>&quot;America's seemingly insatiable demand for fresh water is nearing nature's 
limits,&quot; American Rivers President Rebecca Wodder told reporters at today's 
press conference. &quot;And we have designed much of the human landscape to make the 
problem worse, not better.&quot; </p>
<p>At the center of the concern is a simple fact - the United States uses more 
water per person than any other country with little regard for waste or cost. 
The U.S. average of 1,300 gallons per day is some 60 times the average for many 
developing countries, according to the World Water Council, with some 85 percent 
used to for irrigation.

and human consumption. <small>(Photo courtesy

<p>U.S. irrigation habits, urban sprawl, increased groundwater pumping and loss 
of wetlands are endangering the nation's rivers and draining its fresh water 
supply, Wodder explained, and more often than not government policies are making 
things worse. </p>
<p>Two federal government projects, one to drain 300 square miles of wetlands 
and another to scour more than 100 miles of river bottom, put Mississippi's Big 
Sunflower River at the top of this year's list. These U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineer flood control projects are poised to go forward this year, unless 
reviews by state officials or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
judge otherwise. </p>
<p>&quot;Unless the EPA stands up to political armtwisting,&quot; Wodder said, &quot;the Corps 
of Engineers will drain and scrape the life out of the Big Sunflower River to 
help a small number of farms collect bigger subsidy checks from American 
taxpayers.&quot;

<h5>Americans love pristine rivers for relaxation and recreation, but the 
nation's water use choices are putting many rivers in danger. <small>(Photo by 
Mark Lance courtesy American Rivers)</small></h5>
<p>The effects of federal agricultural policy and subsidies have had a severe 
impact on the Klamath River, which is the second cited by American Rivers. </p>
<p>The Bush administration's decision to increase irrigation flows to farmers in 
the upper region of the river contributed to the deaths of some 33,000 salmon 
last September. This was the worst recorded fish kill in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Balancing the water needs of competing interests in the Klamath River Basin 
is not easy, said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat. But the 
Bush administration's policy, by pitting upstream farmers against 
conservationists and fishers, is an attempt &quot;to shoehorn a political solution to 
a scientific problem,&quot; Thompson said at today's press conference. </p>
<p>&quot;The problem with the Klamath River is a uniquely local problem that is 
unfortunately exacerbated by this administration's policies,&quot; he said.

</p>
<h5>Low water levels contributed to a massive fish kill in the Klamath River 
last September. <small>(Photo by Northcoast Environmental Center courtesy

<p>Thompson introduced legislation in the House today that would allocate $200 
million to landowners and tribes throughout the Klamath Basin who participate in 
water conservation projects. It is designed to bring together stakeholders from 
the upper and lower basin, Thompson explained, to &quot;eliminate competing interests 
and find feasible solutions.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The communities within the Klamath Basin cannot afford to wait any longer,&quot; 
he said. </p>
<p>Severe water shortages earned the Ipswich River the number three slot on the 
list, but it is not agricultural policy that is causing the crisis in the 
Massachusetts river. It is excessive groundwater pumping and municipal water 
consumption that leave portions of the river dry each summer. </p>
<p>The river often looks more like a dirt road, said Kerry Mackin, executive 
director of the Ipswich River Watershed Association. </p>
<p>&quot;We count more dead fish than living fish,&quot; Mackin said. </p>
<p>The combination of excessive municipal water consumption and groundwater 
pumping are directly related and threaten water supplies across the nation, 
warned Robert Glennon, a law professor at the University of Arizona and author 
of the book &quot;Water Follies: Groundwater Pumping and the Fate of America's Fresh 
Waters.&quot;
<img alt="crane" hspace="2" src="images/earth040403d.jpg" align="right" vspace="2" width="250" height="231">
</p>
<h5>Low water levels at the Platte River could have a negative impact on 
migrating waterfowl, including the sandhill crane. <small>(Photo courtesy
<a href="http://www.nps.gov" target="_blank">U.S. National Park Service</a>)</small></h5>
<p>The United States now pumps some 28 trillion gallons of groundwater every 
year, Glennon explained, with little regard for how this affects the 
hydrological cycle. </p>
<p>&quot;We are allowing limitless access to a finite resource,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a 
disconnect between the law and science.&quot; </p>
<p>Pumping groundwater, Glennon explained, reduces the natural flow of water 
into the nation's rivers and depletes a resource that took thousands of years to 
accumulate. But as demand for water increases, local and state entities are 
increasingly looking below ground for additional supply. </p>
<p>This has created a direct threat to the Platte River, which is on the 
endangered list, and threatens to undermine an agreement to secure adequate 
flows in the Platte River and to protect its adjacent wetlands. </p>
<p>The Platte River, which runs through Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska, is 
considered by conservationists to be the most important stopover for migratory 
birds in the nation's heartland. </p>
<p>Excessive diversion and consumption are also responsible for putting the Rio 
Grande on this year's list, Wodder explained, and water flow issues also led the 
organization to put Colorado's Gunnison River on its list. </p>
<p>In part because of population growth, the nation's municipal water 
consumption is the fastest growing sector of U.S. water use, in particular from 
low density sprawl development. </p>
<p>This is a serious concern for the Mattaponi River, which makes the endangered 
list because it is threatened by a planned reservoir that would provide water 
for the sprawling cities of Virginia's Tidewater region.

</p>
<h5>Virginia's Mattaponi River is considered one of the most pristine coastal 
river systems on the eastern seaboard. <small>(Photo by G. Warren Mountacastle, 
Jr. courtesy American Rivers)</small></h5>
<p>&quot;Healthy watersheds capture and store water for human and natural needs, but 
sprawl development creates landscapes that shed water like a raincoat,&quot; Wodder 
said. &quot;Water rushing down storm drains when it rains is water that will not come 
up from your well when it is sunny.&quot; </p>
<p>Wodder also warned that the Bush administration's decision to revise the 
scope of the Clean Water Act's protection for wetlands could add to the long 
list of threats to the nation's rivers. Conservationists believe the 
reinterpretation of the law by the administration effectively removed protection 
for as much as 20 percent of the wetlands in the lower 48 states. </p>
<p>&quot;Draining, filling or paving over wetlands and small streams sets off a chain 
reaction that eventually reduces the water available in river for people and 
wildlife,&quot; Wodder explained. &quot;As wetlands are lost, flash floods increase but 
less rainfall soaks into the ground. As groundwater levels fall, springs dry up 
and stream flows drop.&quot; </p>
<p>U.S. Representative James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, told reporters at 
the press conference that he supports a legislative effort to reverse the 
Supreme Court decision that the Bush administration has used to justify its 
narrow reinterpretation of what constitutes a protected wetland under the Clean 
Water Act. </p>
<p>&quot;The Supreme Court decision is undermining a 30 year effort to improve 
America's waterways,&quot; Oberstar said. &quot;We have to get back on track to what the 
Clean Water Act intended.&quot; </p>
<p>The other rivers on the list are Colorado's Gunnison River, which is burdened 
by unnatural water flows, along with the Snake River and Georgia's Tallapoosa 
River, which are both threatened by impacts from dams, and the Trinity River in 
Texas, which could be severely affected by planned flood control and floodplain 
projects. </p>
<p>The water issues that are affecting America's rivers will only get more 
serious, said Glennon, and will require strong leadership at the local, state 
and federal levels of government. </p>
<p>&quot;This is a tragedy of the commons,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to start to recognize 
the economic value of water.&quot; </p>
