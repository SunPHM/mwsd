              sin and all.&nbsp; But the story you told about the bird fighting

              have been fighting with myself.&nbsp; Inside, I'd really like to
              be a good guy, but bad stuff keeps wanting to come out of

              <p><font size="4">There was a rockery nearby.&nbsp; Josh took hold
              of Randy's arm and guided him to a large rock, where they could
              sit and talk.&nbsp; &quot;Sin is scary stuff, Randy.&nbsp; The
              Bible says that the pay we get for sinning, is death.&quot;</font></p>

              rubbish!&quot;</font></p>

              <p><font size="4">&quot;So,&quot; Randy let out a breath,

              <p><font size="4">Josh leaned back against the rock, his hands
              clasped behind his head, &quot;Its about an Ostrich named Oswald,
              though his friends called him Ozzie.&nbsp; He lived in a zoo near
              a big city.&nbsp; Life wasn't too bad there.&nbsp; Ozzie quite
              liked it.&nbsp; Though it was fenced in, there was a big space for
              him to run in, and he always got enough food.&nbsp; He had also
              become friendly with the zoo keeper.</font></p>
              <p><font size="4">&quot;Then, one day a scary thing
              happened.&nbsp; A tiger escaped from its enclosure.&nbsp; It
              remained hidden by day, but roamed about the open spaces of the
              zoo at night.&nbsp; It had already killed a few of the other
              animals by the time Ozzie heard about it.</font></p>

              &quot;You think I'm stupid or something?&nbsp; Nobody would be as
              silly as to think danger wasn't there, just because he couldn't

              being just as silly as Ozzie the Ostrich.&nbsp; I've told you
              about sin.&nbsp; And sin is much more dangerous than a
              tiger.&nbsp; You think by pretending there is no such thing as sin
              and punishment, that it isn't really there.&nbsp; You are just
              like the Ostrich, hiding his head in the sand.&quot;</font></p>
