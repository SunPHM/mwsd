Sandusky, Ohio - 06/29/2003
=============================
&quot;Look!  A bunny rabbit!&quot;

The weather report Saturday said that a cold front would be bloiwing 
through Northern Ohio on Sunday, bringing with it a high probability of 
strong thunderstorms, especially North of Mansfield.  So I wasn't 
terribly surprised when I drove through some really light rain showers on 
my trip up to the North Coast.  By the time I got to the park, though, 
the skies were mostly clear, and I never saw anything that looked like 
rain all day long.

This was my sixth visit to Cedar Point this season.  I'm gonna save 
myself a whole lot of typing and save you a whole lot of reading by 
noting that the place doesn't change a whole lot during the season.  I 
took a leisurely pace through the park riding lots of rides as I usually 
do, in fact probably a more leisurely pace than usual.

I did buy one of the $10 Dragster sipper mugs.  Let me tell you, the ONLY 
redeeming feature of these things is that you can take it to any food 
joint in the park and get it refilled with Pepsi product for $0 
additional for the rest of the season.  For that, it's almost a 
worthwhile investment.  I say &quot;almost&quot; because the park's selection of 
beverages leaves a lot to be desired, as it generally includes Pepsi, 
Diet Pepsi, Sierra Mist, and two equally disgusting varieties of Mountain 
Dew.  For a Coke drinker such as myself, there really isn't much of a 
choice.  Why no root beer, for instance?  But my purchase is my vote that 
I at least like the concept, and I can seek out the few stands that have 
a couple of additional options.  Apart from the selection, for a frequent 
visitor to the park it really is a great deal, although I had to go to 
four stands before I found one that not only had dozens of these ugly 
bottles on display, but could actually sell me one.  The bottle is 
generally barbell-shaped, about 2' long, and has the shape of a dragster 
molded into the side.  It allegedly holds 44 ounces of product, and it is 
about as impractical as it could possibly be.  It has no handle, no means 
of carrying it whatsoever other than to hold it by its midsection, it's 
way too big to fit into a pocket, it's too tall to fit into a locker, 
it's too bulky to carry on a ride...it's almost as though the foods 
people said, &quot;How can we make this fantastic deal as inconvenient to 
implement as we possibly can?&quot;  Not to mention, the bottle in question is 
really, really ugly.  Why is it that the departments didn't get together 
and deal with this product in a systems fashion...pick a bottle design 
and realize that it's a deal that a significant proportion of the park 
population will want to take advantage of...so deliberately pick a design 
that is user-fiendly and better still, even &quot;coaster friendly&quot; so that 
people waiting in hour-long queues can use their refillable drink bottles 
to refreh themselves while baking in the queue.  Instead we have a great 
idea backed up by a lousy design implementation.  Sorry, Cedar Point.  
Concept:  A.  Planning:  C-.  Execution:  F.

I made it a point to see the &quot;Snoopy Rocks On Ice&quot; show.  I noticed that 
the show is exactly the same as last year.  It's pretty well done, with a 
lot of crowd-pleasing skating.  My concern from last year still stands, 
though...at the beginning and end of the show, five performers are 
identified (including Snoopy).  But there are twelve skaters, plus the 
Browns and Van Pelts.  Don't these other eight deserve at least an 
acknowledgement?  Anyway, it's a good show, but if you saw it last year, 
you've seen it.  

Over by the Corkscrew, a series of tarps have been attached to the fence 
along the Top Thrill Dragster launch track.  On closer inspection I 
realized they weren't there to hide the work from the midway, but rather 
to protect bystanders because arc welding was being done during park 
operating hours.  Top Thrill Dragster is getting a far more extensive 
overhaul than the hydraulic problems we've all heard about would 
indicate.  The fifth car is missing from all six trains (and yes, it is 
the fifth car this time).  Many of the advancing wheel assemblies are in 
various stages of disassembly.  Several workers were working with new 
brackets attached beneath the catchwagon trough at the start of the 
launch track, and on closer examination I could see that they were 
installing several brake fins for the catchwagon.  My guess is that they 
are planning to make the catchwagon reset faster, using the new brakes to 
bring the catchwagon to a quicker stop closer to the launch point.  That 
should reduce the reset time, making it possible to launch and reset the 
system in under 30 seconds.  Back at the hydraulic building a small crane 
was poised with its hoisting rope dropped through the building roof, 
apparently supporting something inside.  Oh, and at the opposite end of 
the ride, another small crane was at work underneath the Iron Dragon 
pretzel; I got a picture of it:  
<a href="http://capital2.capital.edu/admin-staff/dalthoff/pic/crane.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://capital2.capital.edu/admin-staff/dalthoff/pic/crane.jpg</a>
[Footnote
1].

In any case, substantial work is being done on Dragster, and some of it 
looks like &quot;wish list&quot; kind of work...design alterations that should 
improve the ride's throughput...and hopefully its reliability as well.  
Heck, anything would be better than the 0 PPH it's been running at.  But 
in spite of the rumors and news reports, I saw a whole lot of elbows, as 
it were, surrounding the ride.  It is quite clear to me that if it is 
possible, the ride will run for Independence Day weekend.  I know there 
has been talk of just shutting it down for the season, but clearly that 
decision has not been made yet.

In all, it was a slow, relaxing, and not terribly crowded day at Cedar 
Point.  I did, for only the second time in three decades, ride both 
Thunder Canyon and Snake River Falls.  This time I rode the canyon first 
so that the cleaner water of Snake River Falls would serve to rinse off 
some of the lake water.  Once again, everybody in the boat on Thunder 
Canyon got positively drenched except me (I merely got wet), and once 
again, Snake River Falls was a total drenching.  They're both good rides, 
but I have to be in the right mood for them.  Oddly enough, I didn't ride 
White Water Landing.  Something about the 40-minute wait just didn't 
appeal to me.  

I finished my day, as I normally do, on Magnum.  They build them taller 
and faster, but I don't think they have figured out how to make them 
better.  I failed to ride about half the coasters in the park, but I had 
a good time.  And history suggests I'll be back up there again soon
enough.

Footnote 1:  Okay, so technically it is not a crane, but a white heron.  
Do I look like an ornithologist to you? I have enough trouble telling 
doves and pigeons apart!
