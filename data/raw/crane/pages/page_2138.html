	<p class="quote">"For the Whooping crane there is no freedom but that of unbounded wilderness, no life except its own. Without meekness, without a sign of humility, it has refused to accept our idea of what the world should be like. If we succeed in preserving the wild remnant that still survives, it will be no credit to us; the glory will rest on this bird whose stubborn
    vigor has kept it alive in the face of increasing and seemingly hopeless odds."<br>--Robert Porter Allen</p>

	<p>We are often asked why we dedicate our time and effort to save Whooping cranes. The answer is simple for
    us; As aviators, we have a love for the creatures that taught us the art of flying. Now that they need our help, how can we refuse?</p>

    <h5 align="left">The Whooping Crane</h5>
	
    <p align="left">The Whooping Crane is the most famous endangered bird in
    North America. In part because it is large, distinctive, and photogenic and
    partly because, since 1967, Canadians and Americans have cooperated in a
    successful recovery program to safeguard it from extinction.<br>

            <p>The adult Whooping Crane Grus americana, is the tallest North American bird. It has a long neck, long dark pointed bill, and long thin black legs. A large male is about 1.5 m tall. In the air, the wings measure 2
            meters or more between the tips of the long black primaries, or flight feathers, which cannot usually be seen when the bird is at rest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left">Whooping cranes take their name from their distinctive <a href="Unison.wav"> whooping
    call</a>. During the early spring courtship, a pair of birds may perform a duet, or unison call. A nesting whooper frequently bugles loud and clear during the early morning hours. This sound carries over several
    kilometers, and it is used by the adults to advertise their breeding territory to other Whooping Cranes. Adult birds at the nest use a
    purring sound referred to as a <a href="Contact-brood.wav">contact call</a> to communicate with newly hatched chicks.<br>
    <br>
 When the weather is good and the winds favourable, a migrating Whooping Crane flies like a glider, on fixed wings. The bird spirals upwards (aided by thermal activity), glides down, dropping as low as 70 m above ground, and then begins
    spiraling upwards again. This spiraling and gliding, carried out when the cranes encounter suitable thermal updrafts, is energy-efficient and allows the cranes to fly nonstop for
    great distances.&nbsp;</p>
	
    <p align="left">In flight, Whooping cranes can be distinguished from other large white birds by the long neck extended forward and legs that trail equally straight behind.
    Whooping cranes communicate vocally with each other even while flying, using
    <a href="3-150flight1.wav">flight calls.</a>&nbsp; Birds often confused with the Whooping Crane are American White Pelican, Tundra Swan, and Lesser Snow Goose. All three species are mostly or entirely white but, in flight, none has long legs trailing behind.<br>
    </p>
	
    <h5 align="left">Migration</h5>
	
    <p align="left">Each fall, the only naturally occurring Whooping cranes migrate south
    from Canada's Wood Buffalo National Park to their
    traditional wintering grounds in Texas at the Aransas National Wildlife
    Refuge. The birds spend the winter feeding and resting. Wintering Whooping
    cranes prefer blue crabs and several types of clams, but they also eat crayfish, small fish, snakes, insects, acorns, and small wild fruit.<br>
    <br>
    In early spring, while still on the wintering grounds, pairs of cranes whoop and
    <a href="the%20dance.ram"> dance</a> as part of courtship. Dancing intensifies until the migrants depart,
    usually in mid-March. The breeding pairs begin arriving in northern Wood Buffalo National Park during the third week in April,
    where each pair establishes a territory.&nbsp;<br>
    </p>
	
    <h5 align="left">Breeding &amp; Nesting</h5>
	
    <p align="left">Whoopers usually build a nest in marshes or shallow ponds, in about 25 cm of water (the flightless chicks can swim to escape predators) and most often in relatively dense stands of bulrush.&nbsp;</p>
	
    <p align="left">A pair usually has two eggs. Both eggs generally hatch, but if both eggs are left in the nest, usually only one chick survives. The reason for this may be related to a food shortage, particularly when wet areas begin to dry out and terrestrial predators, such as the gray wolf, are able to penetrate the cranes' nesting marshes.<br>
    <br>
    The incubation period is 29– 30 days, and both parents share the task of incubating the eggs in the nest. Few eggs are lost to predators thanks, in part, to the vigil of the adult birds. The reddish orange young hatch during the last week in May or the first week in June. From then on, the parents are kept busy feeding their chicks. During the summer, the cranes rarely fly. Some birds may be incapable of flight during short periods due to the
    molt of major wing feathers.</p>
	
    <p align="left">Family groups frequent the shallows of small ponds and marshes, where the adults perhaps find larval forms of insects such as dragonflies, damselflies, and mayflies, and also snails, small clams, water beetles, leeches, frogs, and small fish to feed their young. When the parent birds kill larger prey, such as snakes, mice, small birds, ducklings, and even birds up to the size of half-grown bitterns, they share the spoils of these hunts with their young.<br>
    <br>
    By the end of September or early October the young birds are ready to try their wings on the 4000 km migration to the Texas winter range. On the way south, the birds spend one to five weeks feeding in their staging (stopover) areas in Saskatchewan. In these areas, undisturbed whoopers may spend the entire one- to five-week staging period on the same quarter or half-section of land. Here the birds fatten up on waste barley and wheat in stubble fields, and roost during the night in nearby wetlands.<br>

    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/whop_sep_bar.gif" width="456" height="37"></p>
	
	<h5 align="center"><u>Recovery Efforts</u></h5>
	
	<p align="left">It is believed that approximately 1,400 whooping cranes
    existed in 1860. Their population declined because of hunting and habitat
    loss until 1941 when the last migrating flock dwindled to an all-time low of
    15 birds. The wild flock has slowly increased to over 180 in late 1999. This
    flock winters in and around Aransas National Wildlife Refuge on the Gulf
    coast of Texas. In spring, they migrate north, nesting in Wood Buffalo
    National Park, which straddles the border of Alberta and Northwest
    Territories in Canada. This flock of whooping cranes is the only naturally
    occurring wild population in the world. Scientists have long recognized the
    risk of having all of the wild whooping cranes using one wintering and
    breeding location. With all the wild birds concentrated in one small area,
    the population could be wiped out by disease, bad weather, or human impacts.
    Whooping crane survival depends on additional, separated populations.</p>
	
	<h5>International Whooping Crane Recovery Team</h5>
	
    <p>The Whooping Crane Recovery Team (WCRT) is the governing body charged
    with responsibility of the species. Consisting of ten members: five Americans and five
    Canadians the team of ornithologists and biologists provide policy recommendations to the
    <a href="http://www.fws.gov">U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service</a> and <a href="http://www.cws-scf.ec.gc.ca/index_e.cfm"> Canadian Wildlife
    Service</a>. Primarily, the team plans actions to protect the Aransas/Wood Buffalo natural flock and to establish two additional
    flocks in efforts to safeguard the whooping crane from possible
    extinction.&nbsp;
    </p>
	
    <p> The team's efforts to establish a non-migratory Whooping crane flock began in Florida in 1993, using cranes hatched in captivity.
    In September, 1999, after searching for the best possible location to establish a second
    <i> migratory</i> flock, the team recommended&nbsp; that the flock be taught a migration
    route with central Wisconsin as the northern terminus and the west coast of Florida
    as the new wintering location. The WCRT sanctioned Operation Migration's ultralight-led
    migration technique as the main reintroduction method.
