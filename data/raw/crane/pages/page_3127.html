    <br>
      <b><i><font color="#3333ff"><font size="+1">Cape Cod Academy - Massachusetts 
  USA</font></font></i></b>  </p>
               
  <p>In Spring 1996 the 'Children's Peace Project of Cape Cod' began in a 
  Grade 3 classroom of Cape Cod Academy in Osterville, Massachusetts USA when
 Ms Patty Doherty's class worked throughout the year to establish a peaceful
 classroom.  </p>
               
  <p>Students work out problems at a peace table in the classroom.&nbsp; It
has all the students' handprints on it, each with the words 'Your friend' 
  and&nbsp; a student's name written in it.&nbsp; A feelings meter is used 
 to help solve conflicts, which goes up and down like a thermometer from good
 feeling words like 'peaceful' and 'friendly'&nbsp; to unpleasant words like
 'grumpy' and 'mad'.&nbsp; A conflict escalator is also available so that
students in conflict can see where their picture is on the escalator, trying
at all times not to reach the top by talking to each other and stepping back
down.  </p>
               
  <p>Each student shared time with a local 'community hero' and wrote their 
  biography, as part of getting to understand other cultures.&nbsp; Students 
  also had a potluck dinner for which each student cooked with his or her 
hero.&nbsp; Some of the dishes came from different cultures and recipes were 
made into cookbooks in class.&nbsp; After dinner students and their heroes 
shared folk dances.  </p>
               
  <p>The students were active participants in Increase the Peace Week, sponsored 
  by the Cape Cod Consortium for Diversity Education.&nbsp; The week aims 
to promote awareness of the prevalence and causes of violence in the community 
  and to inspire communities to work together for peace.  </p>
               
  <p>Ms Doherty's class marched in the Walk for Harmony as the 'Cape Cod Academy
Grade 3 Peacemakers', some walking with their community heroes.    </p>
               
  <p>In another activity, students wrote peace statements and turned these 
  into peace pictures.&nbsp; After colouring the pictures with fabric crayons 
  they were ironed onto pillowcases so that the students could sleep on their 
  dreams and wishes for peace.&nbsp; The statements and pillowcases were later
 exhibited in the library of the Cape Cod Community College and at the Children's
 Museum in Falmouth.  </p>
               
  <p>Students also read <i>Sadako and the thousand paper cranes</i> and together 
  they folded a thousand cranes as a wish for peace in their community and 
 among all people in the world.  </p>
               
  <p>In the past our students had sent their cranes to peace statues in other 
  parts of the USA, but on this occasion they decided to initiate their own 
  peace monument, to be designed by the children of <br>
    Cape Cod as a place where people could reflect on and find peace, and 
as  a symbol of their hope for peace, racial harmony and non-violence.&nbsp; 
 Students addressed the local Town Council and gained approval for a piece 
 of land for the project. They also presented the idea to the media.  </p>
               
  <p>In January 1997 a travelling exhibit began to tour Cape Cod to display 
  more than 400 items including drawings, sculptures, poems and stories for 
  the peace monument.&nbsp; Also, a Steering Committee of children and adults 
  was formed, together with subcommittees for Design, Public Relations, Exhibit, 
  Site, and Fund-Raising.&nbsp; Each committee is co-chaired by a child and 
  an adult 'advisor'.&nbsp; All meetings are chaired by students, although 
 adults take the minutes and do the mailings.  </p>
               
  <p>All of the Town's various committees have accepted the final design plan
and we are actively beginning the fundraising process.&nbsp; We have also
formed an executive board of interested and influential adults who will help
us along this journey.  </p>
    Our original 'Grade 3 Peacekeepers' from 1996 are finishing up their
Grade   5 school year and at least five of them are still very active in
the project!     <br>

  <p>Elise Leijten from the Netherlands is an active campaigner against nuclear 
  violence in the world, who now wishes to contribute to the goal of folding 
  1,000,000 paper cranes.&nbsp; She wants to do this to make people aware 
of the nuclear madness in this world.  </p>
               
  <p>'This project began just after Christmas 1998 with an action in front 
  of the International Court of Justice in The Hague (the &#8220;PeacePalace&#8221;).&nbsp; 
  Together with deputees of other peacegroups, we sent out a press release 
 on the action with information on the One Million Cranes project.&nbsp; We
 also sent information on the nuclear weapon situation in the Netherlands 
and on some of the many actions to come next year <br>
    towards the year 2000.  </p>
               
  <p>'We intend to have people folding cranes during actions but also in schools,
bars and homes.&nbsp; In December 1999 these cranes will be taken to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague because of its importance for
the abolition of nuclear weapons in the world (8 July 1996).&nbsp; The intention
is to have a big information/cultural event. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    'It would be great if from all countries in the world (and maybe also 
different  cities within these countries) ONE crane would be sent to the address
below  for the symbolic meaning of it.&nbsp; Please do not send boxes filled
with  cranes - I don&#8217;t like the idea of having more planes flying for our
cause,  and I have no place to store them.&nbsp; However, pictures, wishes,
stories  and ideas would be very welcome.' <br>

  <p>Artist Cathy Lancaster has found a way to combine business with the pleasure
of folding cranes.&nbsp; The Web site for Classic Cranes contains images
of wonderful artworks created from cranes folded in gold or silver paper
and mounted on a black velvet background.&nbsp;&nbsp; These provide inspiration
for creative ways to present folded cranes and turn each little work of art
into part of a larger work.  </p>
               
  <p>Cathy's works are sought after for weddings, anniversaries, birthdays 
  and other special occasions and her Web site provides some background on 
 the Hawaiian tradition of folding 1001 paper cranes as a symbol of long life
 and happiness.  </p>
               
  <p>Cathy explains how Classic Cranes came to be: <br>
    I have always been interested in art and have painted pictures for years
  as a hobby.&nbsp; About 15 years ago I started folding and I found it very
  relaxing.&nbsp; I guess my desire to paint, combined with my enjoyment
and   satisfaction with folding, led to the form that I now do.  </p>
    My first pictures were given to friends and as more people saw them and 
 requested them, creating the business was the practical approach. <br>

    STARTTS (NSW) is the Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of
Torture    and Trauma Survivors - an organisation which has since 1988 been
in the  forefront  of providing assistance and early intervention for refugees
who  have experienced  torture and trauma.&nbsp; STARTTS employs a multidisciplinary
 staff from a wide range of cultural backgrounds reflecting client groups.
   <br>
    . <br>
    In 1996 STARTTS developed a training course and an accompanying resource 
 called    <i>Families in Cultural Transition: a resource kit</i> <br>
    (ISBN 1 876056 13 4).&nbsp; This innovative kit contains&nbsp; a comprehensive
  package of resources such as group activities, board games, and ideas,
which   a facilitator can use with groups of immigrants and refugees to assist
them   to deal better with the process of adjusting to living in a new country. 
              
  <p>The first module of the kit is called 'Hopes and fears' - the objective 
  of this module is for participants to share hopes and fears about the course 
  with others, and to clarify expectations.  </p>
               
  <p>The activity involves participants writing down their hopes and concerns 
  on the white side of origami paper and folding these into paper cranes.&nbsp; 
  The cranes are then made into a mobile and participants come back together 
  to discuss their hopes and fears.  </p>
    In this module participants have found that they have many hopes and
fears   in common.&nbsp; It has become clear that in order to maintain a
balance  in the training room everybody's crane (and everybody's contribution)
is important.   <br>

  <p>The peace crane project at Mokena Elementary School began as a response 
  by Grades 3 through 5 to the story of <i>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes.&nbsp;
   </i>The students watched the video of Sadako's story and the video on
how  to fold a crane, and decided to fold a thousand cranes as their wish
for peace.  </p>
               
  <p>Third grade teacher Brian Fogarty said: "The students were saddened and
touched by the story of a girl getting sick and dying because a bomb was
dropped.&nbsp; They are too young to understand anything else about the conflict
between Japan and America.&nbsp; The only thing they understand is that a
child died."  </p>
    Learning Center coordinator Kathy Wierzbicki made contact with <a
 href="http://www.cranesforpeace.org/">Cranes for Peace</a> and subsequently
  with Mr June Tahara at Nagatsuka Elementary School in Hiroshima to arrange
