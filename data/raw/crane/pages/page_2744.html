<table width=300 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=left><tr><td><IMG SRC="_uimages/parentonnest.jpg" width=300 height=200 border=2><br><font size=2><center><i>Sandhill Crane on the nest</i></center></font></td></tr></table>After much incubation, a Sandhill Crane egg has finally hatched! At 34 days old, this egg took a little longer than the typical 28-32 day incubation period of Sandhill Cranes. And for several days a parent sat on the nest with one wing slightly raised, making us search unsuccesfully for the new baby. Finally, he (just guessing here) wobbled out from under the wing and stood insecurely outside the nest while the parents fed nearby.<p>
<table width=215 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td><IMG SRC="_uimages/babyingrass.jpg" width=215 height=179 border=2><br><font size=2><center><i>The new Sandhill Crane - a few days old</i></center></font></td></tr></table>Suprisingly bright orange (you'd think that would scream "eat me" to passing predators), the baby became stronger each day and was soon toddling after his parents as they poked the mud flats for food. The first few days in the flats proved difficult for the youngster. Thick mud made each step treacherous and multiple falls painted him with a bib of black muck.
<p>
No longer anchored by the nest, the cranes soon widened their wanderings. They spent some time each morning eating offerings of corn from the neighbors' yards, then returned to the mud flats for the afternoon with the baby in tow.
<p> 
<table width=301 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=left><tr><td><IMG SRC="_uimages/parentandbabyclear.jpg" width=301 height=223 border=2><br><font size=2><center><i>A parent feeding the baby</i></center></font></td></tr></table>Every few steps, the parents would turn and feed the baby, poking muddy morsels into his beak. After a few days, feedings switched to offerings and a parent would place food on the ground for the baby to pick up and eat.
<p>
Never having seen a Sandhill Crane before this trip, I was thrilled to have the added bonus of a baby, although I had a hard time imagining that tiny mass of fuzz growing into a loud and leggy crane! <a href="14a.html">More pictures of the cranes</a>
