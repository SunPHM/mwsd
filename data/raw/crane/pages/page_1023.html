          Giant Buddha and Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island <br /><br />This monastery was built in 1924 and is the most important of four grand monasteries in Hong Kong.<br /><br />The monastery is located in the middle of the mountains of Lantau Island, a 30 minute ride from downtown Hong Kong, and not far from the airport as the crow flies. However, as the bus goes, getting to the monastery involves a harrowing 40 minute ride over narrow and winding single lane roads cutting through beautiful mountains. Over the course of the day, there must have been thousands of overwhelmingly Chinese tourists and pilgrims who required dozens of buses to shuttle them back and forth between the MTR station and the monastery. From what little Chinese I know and from the people I spoke to, most were from the Chinese mainland, enjoying the newly found freedom offered by the looser travel restrictions I described previously.<br /><br />The bronze Buddha stands around 34 metres tall and at the time it was a marvel of engineering. Located at the top of the mountain, it enjoys a commanding view of the surrounding area. Six smaller statues are at its base. Inside is a temple and the famous bell which rings 108 times per day, each time symbolically releasing man from the 108 troubles of mankind.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Po_Lin_Monastery_Lantau_Buddha.JPG"><br /><br />The wind at the top was absolutely ferocious, unlike anything I had ever felt. I had trouble even holding my camera steady long enough to take decent shots. Below is the view as seen from the foot of the Buddha statue, showing the scenery and indicating type of terrain through which our bus had to go.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Po_Lin_Monastery_Lantau_Buddha_view_L.JPG" height="240" width="320"><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Po_Lin_Monastery_Lantau_Buddha_view_R.JPG" height="240" width="320"><br /><br />I visited the monastery proper and was dazzled by the exquisite decorations inside the buildings: wall and ceiling paintings, silk banners and gold decorations were all exquisite. Here is the gateway to the monastery site, a stone’s throw from the foot of the Buddha statue.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Entrance_To_Monastery_Po_Lin_HK.JPG"><br /><br />I then had a special vegetarian lunch at the restaurant. It was excellent.<br /><br />After lunch, I emerged to find out that a tremendous downpour had started. The lineup to the bus snaked way beyond the bus stop and onto the main plaza. In this pouring rain I waited for my bus #23. Having not taken an umbrella, I feared I would get absolutely drenched, but the crowd was so thick that I was protected by other people’s umbrellas. Imitating roman soldiery tactics, we formed a protective “testudo”-like structure with overlapping umbrellas braced against the howling elements that were sending sheets of rain at us. I contributed how I could by lowering my head to fill small gaps in the umbrella coverage with my wide-brimmed hat, all the while using my left hand to hold onto my hat and my right hand to keep the adjacent umbrella from swaying or flipping as the winds shifted. It was unreal.<br /><br />This experience of being locked into a protective crush of humanity at a Chinese monastery at the top of one of Hong Kong’s mountains while a mini-typhoon attacked everyone is one I will not soon forget. As every bus came and picked up its 40 people, we slowly moved closer to the stop. After 45 minutes in the outdoors, with the rains increasing and diminishing in fury according to the weather’s whims, I finally got on a bus. It turns out that the typhoon warning #1 had been emitted the day before but no one paid any attention. Now I know.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

          Man Mo Temple<br /><br />This temple is located a good fifteen minute walk from the Bank of China building.<br /><br />The temple was built well over a century ago in honour of the martial god Kwan Kung and the civil god of literacy, Mun Cheong, and is one of Hong Kong’s most important temples.  Government officials often participated in some of the ceremonies. <br /><br />Upon entering the temple, I was immediately overwhelmed by the smoke. There must be hundreds of incense burners perpetually lit and it was extremely difficult for me (and most other people as well) to stay in there for more than ten minutes without crying and coughing. I saw no one taking pictures inside so I did not take any, not knowing what could and could not be done.<br /><br />Inside, there were very nice raised chairs which I learned were used for the statues during parades. The Buddha statues were lavishly made and decorated, and people came to offer many gifts such as oranges which were piled high in front of the altars. Many people also lit yet more incense burners.<br /><br />Outside the temple I saw many people both presumably local as well as out-of-town taking pictures, so I figured that was ok. Besides, the guide book had pictures of the outside, but not the inside. Here is the temple. Note the smoke coming out of the small shelter out front. This is indicative of the quantity smoke inside the building.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Man_Mo_Temple_HK.JPG"><br />

          DIY Tourists Invade Hong Kong!<br /><br />Until a few days ago, the only way a "mainland" Chinese could enter HK for tourism was by going along with a tightly-controlled official tour, which was quite a hassle.<br /><br />However, as yet one more step in the reforms sweeping through China, a few days ago the government officially allowed "mainland" Chinese tourists to come alone into Hong Kong on their own with just a simple tourist visa. These DIY tourists (<em>China Daily </em>expression) flooded into the city and all the tourism I have been doing these last days has been conducted with these mainland tourists enjoying the same sights and the same freedoms as myself.<br /><br />This decision for opening up was based in part on economic grounds since HK’s economy is still just sputtering along, what with SARS and other issues. I do not know how many mainlanders came into HK before, but given the crush of people coming in at the Kowloon Tong MTR (Subway) station where the mainland rail line joins the HK MTR network, this is going to be an economic success story on both sides of the one-nation-two-systems “border.”<br /><br />The government has gone one step closer to full freedom of movement. On grounds of principle alone, this is an excellent and noteworthy decision.<br /><br />

          Hong Kong Park: The Conservatory<br /><br />This is actually a very sophisticated greenhouse with different climates, a bit like the Biodome in Montreal.<br /><br />The first region in the building features a desert climate.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/HK_Conservatory_Desert.JPG"><br /><br />The second region features very a humid tropical climate , although in Hong Kong this must not be much of a novelty. The closer plant on the right I believe is a cocoa plant and the far one is a rubber plant.

          Hong Kong Park<br /><br />Hong Kong Park is an exquisite little haven of peace located nestled just underneath the main downtown office towers. Intelligently laid out and superbly maintained by a meticulous staff, it is a joy to visit. Like everything else in the city, it is built on the side of the mountain, which means there are always stairs or ramps to go up and down. The advantage of all this climbing, however, is that there are always new and impressive vistas to enjoy after just a short walk.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/HK_Park_View1.JPG"><br /><br />Here is a pelican that was out for its afternoon walk. It was so close I could almost touch it.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Pelican_in_HK_Park.JPG"><br />

          Victoria Peak<br /><br />Wanting to get a good view of the city, I tried to go up to the top of the Bank of China Tower, but public access is limited to the 43rd floor only, so I did not get a great view.<br /><br />I then walked around a bit and took the tram almost to the top of the peak that dominates Hong Kong: Victoria Peak. The view of the city and the harbour was beautiful. You can see there is a handful of construction cranes here and there, but no sign of feverish construction activity. In fact, the economy is pretty slow around here nowadays.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Vic_Peak_HK_View_L.jpg" width="256" height="192"><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Vic_Peak_HK_View_M.jpg" width="256" height="192"><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Vic_Peak_HK_View_R.jpg" width="256" height="192"><br /><br /><br />A big mall is located near the top of the peak at the tram railhead; in fact, the whole city sort of sprawls right up to the top of the peak on the landward side. In the mall there was a group of school kids with their English teachers conducting small field-classes: they would home in on the numerous foreign-looking people and ask them simple questions in English like "where do you come from?" and "how long do you intend to stay?" I was interviewed by one and I was impressed by the poise and speaking ability of the little kid who interviewed me with her teacher. The kid could not have been more than 8 or 9 years old.<br /><br />

          Hong Kong Statue Square and Esteemed Citizen<br /><br />I finally got to Hong Kong proper for my first tourist visit. Coming out of the “Central” MTR Station led me right into Statue Square which is directly in front of the Legislative Council Building, or LegCo . <br /><br />Now, it is fair to say that the sole statue in Statue Square which dominates said square in front of the LegCo should be of a citizen that all other citizens respect and wish to emulate. So, this being said, I took a closer look at the statue and the description plaque. <br /><br />The statue represents a man who was a banker (Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank).  <br /><br />I had never seen a statue in honour of a banker before. <br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/HK_Banker_Statue.JPG"><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/HK_Banker_Statue_Plaque.JPG"><br /><br />Looking around, I realized  I was surrounded by bank buildings. Here, for example, is the very distinctive Bank of China Tower.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Bank_Of_China_Bldg_HK.JPG"><br /><br />It all fit together. Hong Kong, banking capital of the Pacific, has a statue of a banker on the most expensive piece of downtown real estate.  I could only respect and admire this consistency. <br />

          The First Night in Hong Kong and the Benefits of Native American Work<br /><br />After that long flight and taxi ride from the airport to the university campus on Kowloon, I got into my dorm room, dumped all my suitcases and crashed onto the bed that had no sheets, no blankets, no pillow, no nothing besides a mattress. I turned on the air conditioning in my small room but it was very cold even at the "low" setting and in my tired frame of mind I did not wish to spend any time tweaking the settings. Prefering a heatstroke over a bad cold or worse, I therefore shut off the A/C and simply opened the window in the hope of catching the few breezes I had felt when entering the building.<br /><br />Unfortunately, window open or not, it was so hot and humid that I could not possibly fall asleep. Worse, at around midnight a violent thunderstorm arose with near-concurrent lightning and thunder just like the wizard's castle scene in "The Wizard of Oz". Water then started pouring in through the window and onto my head that was of course on the end of the bed right under the window. <br /><br />I slammed the window shut, turned on the A/C, and got ready to freeze through the night.<br /><br />It was then that I remembered my purchase of that Klagetoh rug back in Ganado in Navajo Country. I frantically dug through all my suitcases, found it, and at least my critical body parts spent a nice toasty night under my wool rug. I slept well and awoke still healthy. The Navajo people rock.<br /><br />

          A Bed & Breakfast in Berlin <br /><br />Berlin is a great city to visit and I strongly recommend it, but I had a very difficult time getting a bed and breakfast. After much surfing and mailing, I finally found something. Calling it a bed and breakfast, however, is a misnomer: bed and fridge was more like it since I had to rummage around it for breakfast every morning. Moreover, the owner always woke up late and he had two mean-looking dogs who would watch me poke around their master's kitchen for food every morning while he slept, which was very disconcerting (zey don't bite, he had said in a broken English that was as good as my broken German...) Nonetheless, for a last-minute deal, 35 Euro / night for a place just a fifteen minute walk from Potsdamer Platz was a situation I could not complain about and he did offer all-you-could-eat Nutella which was a huge plus. And I found out that unknown dogs can be bought off with Nutella-covered Corn Flakes, my greatest practical discovery while in Berlin. <br /><br />

The most spectacular was the Pergamonmuseum with the Pergamon altar as well as its stunning reconstruction of Ishtar's gate using mainly original bricks. This gate was the entrance to Babylon and is visually stunning.

          Berlin Formerly Divided City<br /><br />The Berlin Wall divided the City from 1961 to 1989. It was hated by all Berliners who tore down huge chunks of it almost with their bare hands right after the fall. Most of it was then torn down with bulldozers but traces remain here and there. There is of course Checkpoint Charlie, site of a US-Soviet tank showdown in 1961 and frequent site of prisoner exchanges. A museum nearby relates some of the history of the wall along with names of those who tried and failed to cross "In from the cold" and into freedom as LeCarré put it so well. There are also many quotes from President Kennedy. JFK successfully argued that defending Berlin meant defending Paris, London and New York and vice_versa.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_Checkpoint_Charlie.JPG"><br /><br />The wall ran right through Potsdamer Platz, right behind the Reichstag, and through the city. <br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_Wall_Trace1_Potsdam.JPG" width="256" height = "192"><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_Wall_Trace2_Potsdam.JPG" width="256" height = "192"><br /><br />A small inlaid brick trace indicating the location of the wall can be seen on many city streets and it shows how much the city must have suffered as the trace cuts right through the heart of many residential and business areas.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/BerlinWalltrace3.JPG" ><br /><br />I finally found an intact length of the wall not far from Potsdamer Platz, right beside the "Topographie des Terrors" museum on Niederkirchnerstrasse, near the headquarters of former Nazi political departments. This length of Wall will be preserved as part of the museum.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_Wall_Length.JPG"><br />

          Berlin the Sprawling City<br /><br />Above all, Berlin is big. In Vienna, it is easy to overshoot an objective even on foot since everything is so compact. Berlin, on the other hand, is huge and long subway rides or longer walks are the norm between all attractions. In addition, there are many forests, rivers, and lakes reaching right into the heart of the city.<br />Here is a view taken from the victory tower (the Siegessaule, which recalls 19th century German victories against its neighbours: Denmark, Austria, France) which shows part of Tiergarten park, right in the middle of the city. The Brandenburg gate can also barely be distinguished at the end of the  boulevard.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_View_From_Siegessaule.JPG"><br /><br />Here is a better view of the famous gate, this time seen from a different angle:<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_BrandenburgerTor.JPG"><br /><br />Not far from there is the  famous Reichstag where the reunited German government finally reconvened after both the nazis and the communists finally fell, neither party having actually ruled from the Reichstag. The exhibit in the Reichstag depicts the scary rise in power of the nazis, with the photos showing their uniforms taking a greater and greater importance in all pictures of the deputies as the 1930s draw closer and then begin. The exhibit then shows the communists errecting the symbol of their failure -the Berlin Wall - right by the building. Finally, the Wall falls in 1990 and shortly thereafter the reunited German government returns.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Berlin_Reichstag.JPG"><br />  <br />There are also huge parks not far from the city centre. Here is Schloss Babelsberg built in 1833-1835 for the future Kaiser Wilhelm I; it is  located in a big forest park right across the river from Potsdam, a 45 min train ride south-west of Berlin.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Schloss_Babelsberg.JPG"><br />

          Vienna Past, present and future<br /><br />So is Vienna just one big monument to its past glories? Is there anything more? As I walked around, I looked for signs that Vienna does more than just bask in its triumphs long gone.<br /><br />I ended up in the university on the ring. This is yet another beautiful museum-calibre building but in this case it is an active university. If nothing else, the history students here must be the best in the world since they need only keep their eyes open when walking from class to class to soak in lessons on European history, as indicated by this typical hallway lined with statues. The past is used to teach the future leaders of the country.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Wien_Universitat.JPG"><br /><br /><br />I also went to a concert by the Vienna Mozart Orchestra at the gold room of the Muzikverein.<br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/WIen_Muzikverein_gold.JPG"><br /><br /> They played selections from all the classics: Mozart's 40th and 41st symphonies, <em>Nachtmuzik</em>, <em>Die Zauberflote</em>, and so on. They also included the great crowdpleaser, Strauss' <em>Blue Danube</em> and wrapped up the evening with his <em>Radetzky March</em>.<br />The venue was very nice and the music was excellent, but the funniest part came right at the end during the <em>Radetzky March</em>. This piece consists of loud and soft parts, and during the loud parts, the audience claps to the beat of the music. During these loud parts, the conductor actually faced the audience and "conducted" the audience, leading them to clap at the right moments. However, as in any crowd clapping, the crowd slowly started clapping out of beat by clapping too fast. Fortunately, just when complete arhythmic pandemonium was about to break out, the music became soft again and the conductor made the motion to us to stop. Of course we did not all stop at the exact same time and the result was ugly, greatly "shocking" the conductor. This started and stopped several times in a row and the conductor made a great show of his displeasure. It was hilarious.<br /><br />So Vienna is not afraid of using its great cultural assets that its past produced in order to have fun today and to prepare its students for the future. That realization was the highlight of my visit.<br />

          Music in Vienna<br /><br />Vienna is music. It has its own Walk of fame à-la Hollywood with stars for all major composers, orchestras and the like. Here is Mozart's star on the Vienna walk of fame, not far from the Cathedral.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Moyart_Star_Walk_of_fame.JPG"><br /><br /><br />There is the musical instruments museum at the Hofburg which houses a dazzling collection of instruments including primitive harps and "harmony pianos" which offered the full number of pitches per octave but must have taken forever to tune. The Hofsburg also houses excellent museums on the history of armaments and an exhibit on Ephesus which housed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient <br />

          The Palaces<br /><br />There is the above-mentionned Hofsburg. Toward the outside of the city, there is the dazzling Schonnbrunn Castle - the Habsburgs' reply to Versailles. There are the Belvederes which were built for the soldier who ejected the Turks from Austria and Hungary, Eugene Prince of Savoy. And there are so many more. With each castle housing complete museums, Vienna is a European cultural treasurehouse.<br /><br /><br />This is Schonbrunnn seen from the gloriette, along with the city of Vienna out back.

          The Ring<br /><br />In the 19th century, the Kaiser ordered the destruction of the fortifications surrounding the town. The destruction left a large belt of land on which were built great houses, palaces, and concert houses. I walked all around, stopping to visit selected sites. Here is the street near the stockmarket where the 1873 crash wiped out all those without the foresight to be short on banking stocks. The bourse is on the right and the street is typical of the streets feeding into the ring.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Borse_Gasse_Wien.JPG"><br /><br />I also closed the loop by walking along the Danube canal where the atmosphere is much less glitzy but nonetheless very interesting. From there one can see simpler cafes and also, across the canal, the headquarters of influential OPEC.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/WIEN_OPEC_AM_DANUBE.jpg"><br /><br />Then there is the monument remembering all those who died at the hands of the Gestapo. Vienna is dotted all over with monuments remembering the evil of those days along with reminders to "never again" participate in this type of butchery.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Wien_Gestapo_monument.JPG"><br /><br />

          Stephansdom<br /><br />The Vienna Cathedral is a stunning work that has survived sieges and bombings and it still carries the scars to this day. I visited the inside, went down to the catacombs, and climbed all the way up to the spire. Frequently, cathedral carvers included jokes or self-portraits in their work. Here can be seen a small self-portrait statue of a certrain carver Meister Pilgram at the foot of the original organ.<br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Pilgram_Dom.JPG" ><br />The cathedral also had a military value. During the siege of 1683 in which Vienna and the Habsburgs successfully beat back the Turkish army, the defenders used this view to track enemy troop movements.<br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/View_from_Stephandom_military_value.JPG"><br />Finally, from this pulpit, a representative of Pope Nicolas V called for a Crusade in 1451.<br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Dom_Call_for_Crusades.JPG"><br /><br />A few dozen metres away is the monument commemorating Vienna's triumph over the plague.<br />

Instead of playing insipid corporate-flavoured elevator music, they play Mozart's <em>Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</em>  when you are boarding. And their stewardesses wear these smashing all-red outfits.

          Back Down to London <br /><br />We drove back in two days, spending the night in the walled city of York. We saw two major cathedrals: Durham and York. They were both beautiful. Durham is a Norman style cathedral, with its rounded arches, large circular pillars with decorations, and the appearance of a fortress. York was gothic, with its more pointed arches, more elaborate inner pillars, and a less fortress-like external appearance. Its stained glass are among the finest in the world. Our guide explained that stained glass windows need constant maintenance: roughly once a century, they have to be taken down and the lead must be replaced or repaired, along with various other reparations. In addition, they were taken down on many occasions and survived countless wars, bombings, and religious upheavals.<br /><br />The first picture is an external shot of Durham's cathedral( no pictures were allowed inside) seen from the river.<br /><br />The other pictures are of York's cathedral.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Durham_Cathedral.JPG" ><br /><br /> <img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/York_Stained_Glass-1.JPG" ><br /><br /> <img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/York_stained_glass_2.JPG" ><br />

          Scotland <br /><br />The wedding was a tremendous success. The Old City Hall reception was splendid and the bride was ravishing.<br /><br />I ended up spending a total of five nights in the greater Aberdeen area in several different bed and breakfasts and farms. During those days I drove around and in Aberdeen, on motorways and on tiny roads. The weather was beautiful - apparently the best in decades - and the harvest was going very well. The air is reinvigorating and everyone is so kind. There are castles everywhere; here for example is Castle Fraser. <br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Castle_Fraser_kemnay.JPG"><br /><br /><br />I came to Scotland tired and weary.

          Aberdeen<br /><br />Aberdeen is sometimes called the granite city; many of its buildings are made of the material, giving the city a solid, grey appearance. <br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Aberdeen_granite1.JPG" > <br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Aberdeen_Granite2.JPG"><br />The city bills itself as the Energy Capital of Europe because of its proximity to North Sea oil wealth. The oil rigs cannot be seen off the coast since they are a bit too far out but there are plenty of reminders such as the harbourfront ships and terminals, the presence  of Europe's greatest heliport right beside the airport, and the sponsorship of road roundabouts by oil engineering and exploration companies. Incidentally, the price of gas is nonetheless about 75 pence per litre (1 pound = 1.61 $US), or well over double the price in the USA. Here is a view of the harbour showing a small part of the installations and ships that support the oil industry.<br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Aberdeen_Harbour1.JPG" width="256" height="192"><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Aberdeen_Harbour2.JPG"width="256" height="192"><br /><br />Nestled in between industrial installations near Aberdeen harbour, there is a former fishing village that has been somewhat gentrified and now features renovated fisherman houses along with small "shacks" built up beside, typically across the tiny street in front of the house. Imagine a city square in which the "bigger" fisherman houses are on the outside of the square and the shacks, are inside the square, facing their respective big house.  It is very hard to describe but the result is a very cozy residential district in which each houseoffers these former peculiar houses consisting of main houses built about a city square very nice cozy little houses. The place is well worth seeing. <br /><br /><img src="http://seeworldsprosper.blogspot.com/Aberdeen_ex_fishing_village_houses.JPG"><br /><br />We saw one of these for sale. A two-level house with perhaps 900 sq ft total living space plus the associated small single-level shack about 10' x 6' had a total asking price of 110,000 pounds.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
