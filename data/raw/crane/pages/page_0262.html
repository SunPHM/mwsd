I</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>n the land of the trans-Ural Bashkorts there lived
a hero of great strength. His most devoted friend, a swift steed, carried
him far and near in no time at all. No one could equal the hero in power,
wit and wisdom. If the enemies invaded his country he would rout them mercilessly,
defending his people and his land. He would readily sacrifice himself for
the sake of his motherland. He was not only a powerful man but a skilful
kurai player and singer. When he climbed the Irandek peak and played his
kurai there, the sound would reach the villages at the foot of the mountains.</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

The hero got married but it was only years later that his wife gave birth
to a long-awaited child, exceptionally robust and strong. The baby grew
as big in a day as he would in a month and he grew as big in a month as
he would in a year. "He will be even stronger than his father", people
used to say. Indeed, the boy grew up more powerful and a better archer
than his father. The proverb says "He can make an arrow who saw his father
do it". So the young man learned to play the kurai from his father and
became well-known for his skill. The father wanted, while he was still
alive, to make his son "headed" and ''eyed", i. e. to have him wedded.
He found a bride for the young man and gave him a grey colt that was born
from a grey winged horse.</FONT></FONT></FONT></TD>

<FONT FACE="Arial Cyr,Helvetica Cyr"><FONT SIZE=-1>On a fine summer day
the young man rode to his prospective father-in-law's homestead. On reaching
the village he left his horse in the meadows. At dawn the next day when
he was going to take his horse back the young man was brought to a halt
by a distant sound, strange and sweet. Anxiously, now at a run, now at
a fast pace, he made straight for the place from which the sound was coming.
Once he got close enough, he stopped, fascinated. A flock of tiny blue
cranes came to his view. A lone crane stood in the middle, flapping its
wings and crying both beautifully and mournfully. As if by signal, the
rest of the birds joined in, flapped their wings, cried and circled around.
The man stood with bated breath, listening to the doleful, ringing cranes'
song till it sank deep into his heart and imprinted itself in his memory.
For fear of forgetting it he kept repeating the song as he mounted his
grey horse. He darted back to his father-in-law's place. On jumping down
from his horse he took his kurai and began playing the cranes' song which
he had already turned into a melody.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

People began to gather: the old, the young. An old man with a grey beard
asked the lad.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT FACE="Arial Cyr,Helvetica Cyr"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Where did you learn to play such a mournful tune, or did you compose
it yourself?</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT FACE="Arial Cyr,Helvetica Cyr"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- No, <A HREF="#BM1_">Olatai</A>, said the young man and related to the
people all that he had seen. The people began to whisper, fearful a disaster
might befall their land and home.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT FACE="Arial Cyr,Helvetica Cyr"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- That was a song of the singing cranes. The place where they play will
be devastated, a lot of people will die. That's what our fathers and forefathers
used to say, said the grey -bearded old man. On hearing that, the young
man hurried back home to his father and gave him a careful account of what
he had seen and heard in his father-ill-law's house</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><FONT FACE="Arial Cyr,Helvetica Cyr"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It's true, my son", said his father. "That is what our ancestors would
say: where the singing cranes play and dance there would be warfare and
the land would go to rack and ruin. Many a battle like that has your father
fought", said the old hero. "I'm too old now, my strength is gone. I'm
handing down my weapons to you. Be brave, take care not to bring disgrace
upon your off springs, show no mercy to the enemy who invades your country,
be faithful to your land, to your people - only then will you be happy.
This is my behest. And now start gathering an army of most loyal people".</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

The son sent a call to the young people of the neighborhood, raised an
army and got it ready for battle. Indeed, in a short while the war did
break out in the land. The deadly arrows of the hero and his archers killed
the enemy in plenty. When the assault abated, it was followed by a sumptuous
feast for several days. The young man was glorified as a national hero.
Since then the song of the cranes became known as "The Singing Crane".
The lake near the former battlefield was called <A HREF="#BM2_">Yaugul</A>.
It is 10-15 km to the south of the town Sibai, in the Baimak district.</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;
