          Each unit is capable of reproducing up to six adult crane calls that
           handlers can use to communicate with the colts. Only pilots and qualified
          
          handlers will use the vocalizers to broadcast any calls other than
          the  brood/contact call.<BR>

           the cranes to the sound of their human imitations of brood calls</B>.
            This will be done sparingly to afford some control over the birds
           in 
          the event of equipment failure in the field. Only the handlers that
            will accompany the birds after they leave Patuxent should conduct
           this 
          exercise and it should be done from a distance so as to not attract
            the chick's attention to the handler's head.<BR>
