At a press conference held on Tuesday, June 25, York Technical College
highlighted the importance of the York Technical College Foundation's Dawn
to Dusk Golf Marathon and the substantial contribution of those who made
this year's event successful.  This year's Golf Marathon, spearheaded by
Foundation President Frank Campbell, President of AME, Inc. and board member
Bill Kimbrell, raised more than $40,000, which will be used to provide scholarships for needy students.
The 26 golfers (six teams,) who played on
five area courses, represented the support of major donors such as Comporium,
Founders Federal, Chester Telephone, AME, Inc., as well as the faculty and
staff of York Technical College and hundreds of individual donors.

The college gave special recognition to AME, Inc., a company headquartered
in Fort Mill, which is an industry-leading provider of a wide variety of
industrial and general contracting services.  AME, Inc. was a significant
supporter of the Golf Marathon and a major partner in the college's
Institute for Manufacturing Productivity.  
<P>
The endowed scholarships provided by the York Technical College Foundation
continue to be important even after the advent of lottery-generated tuition
assistance.  Currently, lottery money is covering only half the cost of
tuition.  For many students, Foundation scholarships meet the critical need
for the remainder of tuition as well as books and relevant costs.
