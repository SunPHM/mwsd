Sold in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere for many years, Merkur metal construction sets are a relative newcomer to this country. Merkur was first introduced in 1920; in their current incarnation, the sets are manufactured in a completely refurbished factory in the Czech Republic by the Merkur Division of Cross-Merkur, a well-known and respected European toy company. We are pleased to be able to offer them to you here at Girders &amp; Gears in our <a href="store.html"><strong>Online Store</strong></a>. 
<p>
<font class="txtSmHeader"><b>MERKUR AND GILBERT ERECTOR</b></font><br>
<img src="merkur/images/hole-spacing.jpg" width="150" height="89" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;">Although there are some similarities between Gilbert Erector and Merkur, the two systems are based on different scales, with Merkur being slightly smaller than Erector. Merkur is based on a hole spacing of 10mm, while Erector and Meccano have 12.7mm (&frac12;&quot;) hole spacing (see photo). Screws are likewise smaller in diameter (3.5 mm) than Erector.
<p>
<img src="merkur/images/sm-w-cranetruck.jpg" width="250" height="224" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" alt="" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px;">Along with the difference in scale, there are also significant differences in part design between the two systems (as well as many similarities).  I will address many of these in a <a href="merk-erector.html"><strong>separate feature</strong></a>, but I think the primary difference between Merkur and Erector is in the focus of the systems themselves.  It seems clear that A.C. Gilbert designed his sets from the very beginning to focus on the engineering of what in the real world would be large, girder-based construction projects (bridges, towers, buildings, large mechanical structures or facilities, etc.).  In contrast, the Merkur system focuses for the most part on all types of vehicles (cars, trucks, airplanes, helicopters, etc.), machines, machine tools, and so forth. Girders as an entity are smaller and fewer than their Erector counterparts, and secondary to the other parts, the opposite of what we find in the typical Gilbert Erector set. Instead, specialized plates of all shapes and sizes, a variety of sophisticated wheels and tires, etc., and other parts make up the bulk of a Merkur set (see photo below). 
<p>
The advantage of this for those of us who love to build with our sets is that we can now build a large variety of more realistic designs than were possible with Erector (with the exception of the special Classic Period sets) (see the images on this page, and the Merkur models on display in our <a href="models.html"><strong>Model Gallery</strong></a>).  This is not to say, however, that you cannot design and build towers, cranes, and other Erector-typical models with Merkur - on the contrary, have a look at the two models shown at the bottom of this page, both of which were built with Merkur.  In fact, I think you'll recognize the one on the left (Portable Gantry Crane), since it is almost identical to the Floating Crane model from the Musical Ferris Wheel Erector Set (see the Model Gallery for an example).
<p>
<font class="txtSmHeader"><b>INSIDE A MERKUR SET: WHY WE LIKE 'EM</b></font><br>
<img src="merkur/images/sm-w-dozer.jpg" width="250" height="217" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;">Prior to offering Merkur for sale in our <a href="store.html"><strong>Online Store</strong></a>, we acquired several sets for evaluation, including the largest set in the current Merkur line, the M8.  The M8 comes packed in a reasonably sturdy cardboard box with a slide-on &quot;shoe box&quot; style lid covered with large, color photographs of some of the models that can be built with the set.  At 1405 pieces and over 15 pounds, the set is slightly larger than the now-classic No. 10&frac12; &quot;Amusement Park&quot; Gilbert Erector set.
<p>
Since we are now selling Merkur here at Girders &amp; Gears, you may have concluded that we were pleased with our evaluation of Merkur, and you would be right.  In fact, we are quite enthusiastic about them, and we feel that Merkur offers perhaps the best value for your money today in new construction toy systems.  This is particularly true if you, like us, prefer a (mostly) metal construction set with lots of generically styled parts that will allow you to design dozens, if not hundreds, of different models.
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="merkur/images/parts-list.jpg" width="450" height="175" border="0" alt="Merkur Parts"><br><img src="images/spacer1x5.gif" width="1" height="5" border="0" alt=""><br>Merkur parts catalog (part inventories vary between sets)</div>
<p>
Almost all components of a typical Merkur set are made of steel of a thickness and weight comparable to Erector in its heyday. Most of these parts are formed, punched, and/or machined, rather than cast.  All larger parts such as plates and girders are painted; only smaller holed strips, brackets, screws, nuts, connectors, and other similar parts are plated. In most sets, painted parts are typically red, blue, green, or yellow, and all four colors are usually represented. Paint is typically of good quality, as is plating, although occasionally a painted part will show some build-up or thin spots, and a plated part may show some minor discoloration (not unlike Erector).  As the parts catalog shown above indicates, the Merkur system features a large number of different sizes and shapes of plates, brackets, and strips, allowing for fairly realistic model designs approaching scale-model quality. 
<p>
<img src="merkur/images/tire.jpg" width="125" height="125" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" alt="" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px;">Many Merkur sets also contain a variety of black rubber tires (both hollow and solid) in different sizes that fit onto nicely designed painted metal wheels. And, each Merkur set contains at least some parts made from thin, translucent, flexible plastic in different colors and even clear.  These parts are usually duplicates of small or medium sized plates, and can be used where a curved or bent part may be required (a nice feature really, as it saves having to bend any metal parts).
<p>
<img src="merkur/images/sm-motor.jpg" width="150" height="111" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 10px;">To power those wheeled (and other) Merkur models, the largest set (the M8) includes a battery powered electric motor (also available in a separate Motorizing Kit). This two-speed, reversible motor has an integrated gearbox and a separate battery case, and is easily mounted in any model using bosses molded onto the motor housing. To read more about just how to make your Merkur models run, see our special feature <a href="merkur-power.html"><strong>Powering Merkur Models</strong></a>. The M8, and selected other sets, also include lighting parts (bulbs and sockets).
<p>
<img src="merkur/images/sm-tools.jpg" width="150" height="96" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" alt="" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 10px;">Another nice feature of Merkur sets are the various building tools. These include a plastic-handled screwdriver, two double-ended wrenches (one flat, one offset), and a combination nut holder and screw holder. 
<p>
Overall, Merkur parts are very well designed and manufactured, and they offer tremendous flexibility in model design, as there are many more different styles of parts than there were in Gilbert Erector. We're sold on them so far, and are already having great fun building with them. Be sure to check out the Merkur models we have posted in the <a href="models.html"><strong>Model Gallery</strong></a>.
<p> 
<font class="txtSmHeader"><b>PACKAGING AND INSTRUCTIONS</b></font><br>
<img src="merkur/images/part-trays.jpg" width="250" height="153" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">All sets in the Merkur line come packed in cardboard boxes; most of these are of average to good quality, but bear in mind that, like any similar packaging, they will likely not stand up to much abuse.  Inside the box, parts are typically arranged in molded compartments within thin, flexible vacu-formed plastic inserts; in larger sets, multiple plastic inserts are used, each resting within its own cardboard tray.  These trays are covered with a thin molded, clear plastic cover to keep the parts in place, although the parts will easily dislodge if the box is tipped to any degree. In addition, all screws, nuts, and other small pieces are also stored in these compartments, and are prone to moving about the box if it is jostled or tipped. Our solution here at Girders &amp; Gears is the same as the one we use with our Erector sets: we re-pack all of the small components in clear plastic compartmented storage containers that are made for screws, nuts, and other small items (you can find these in the hardware section at your local home center or discount department store). And, with their snap-tight lids, those parts stay put even if you drop them (assuming that you latched the lid, of course)!
<p>
Until recently, most Merkur instruction manuals pictured a relatively small number of different model designs. While this is still true in many cases, new sets, along with certain older sets, are getting new manuals that feature many more designs to build. Of course, in all cases, just as with Erector, each set will build many more models than its manual may illustrate. And, to assist all of you model builders, both young and old, we have posted additional model designs on the <b><a href="gfiles.html"><strong>G-Files</strong></a></b> page that you can download.
<p>
<font class="txtSmHeader"><b>THE BOTTOM LINE</b></font><br>
To reiterate, we're believers here at Girders &amp; Gears. We'll always love Erector, but with Merkur we have yet another way to enjoy our favorite hobby and pastime. Watch for our latest Merkur models in the Model Gallery, and if you purchase your own Merkur set (<a href="store.html"><strong>you can get one right now in our Girders &amp; Gears Store!</strong></a>), be sure to send in pictures of the models that you build so that we can share them with others.
