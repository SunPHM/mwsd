height="31">he old St. Louis riverfront was selected in 1935 as the site of a 
        national monument to commemorate the westward expansion of the United 
        States in the 19th century. An area of some 40 city blocks was purchased 
        and <img src="images/40blocks.jpg"

        all buildings were cleared, but because of World War II,&nbsp; further 
        progress on the Memorial was halted.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">In 1947 
        the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association, a group of public-spirited 
        citizens, held a nationwide competition to obtain an appropriate design 
        for the Memorial. The winner in the competition was the late Eero Saarinen, 
        whose design was dominated by the now famous Gateway Arch.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="8">The Memorial 
        includes, in addition to the Arch, an underground visitor center located 
        directly beneath the Arch. The center contains the Museum of Westward 
        Expansion, which tells the century-long story of the opening of the West 
        in the 1800s, as well as theaters with movies on westward expansion and 
        the Arch's construction.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Magnificent 
        in its concept, majestic in its setting, unique in its execution, the 
        Gateway Arch towers 630 feet above the banks of the Mississippi River, 
        a part of the $30 million Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. The smooth, 
        graceful lines of the Arch, designed by Eero Saarinen, also serve as one 
        of three firsts in the history of engineering in this country, all in 
        the City of St. Louis.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Historic 
        Eads Bridge, the first tubular steel arch structure of its kind, completed 
        in 1874, forms the northern boundary of the Memorial. At the southern 
        boundary stands the steel plate girder bridge designed by Sverdrup and 
        Parcel -- the first <img src="images/archdraw.jpg"

alt="Sarrinen's conceptual drawings of the Arch, 1948" align="left" hspace="15" width="288"

height="208" vspace="10"> U.S. bridge of this size to employ orthotropic design. 
        The Gateway Arch, in neighborly spirit, borrows the arch concept from 
        Captain Eads and makes use of the new concept of stress analysis and structural 
        design from Sverdrup and Parcel.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Eero Saarinen, 
        in designing the Arch, conceived of it in stainless steel, and asked Fred 
        Severud to study its feasibility from the structural engineering point 
        of view, again demonstrating the need for joining the skills of more than 
        one discipline in order to create a project of this magnitude.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The stainless-steel-faced 
        Arch spans 630 ft. between the outer faces of its triangular legs at ground 
        level, and its top soars 630 ft. into the sky. It takes the shape of an 
        inverted catenary curve, a shape such as would be formed by a heavy chain 
        hanging freely between two supports.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Each leg 
        is an equilateral triangle with sides 54 ft. long at ground level, tapering 
        to 17 ft. at the top. The legs have double walls of steel 3 ft. apart 
        at ground level and 7-3/4 in. apart above the 400-foot level. Up to the 
        300-foot mark the space between the walls is filled with reinforced concrete. 
        Beyond that point steel stiffeners are used.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1"><img src="images/steel2.jpg"

alt="Cross section of Arch construction" align="right" hspace="15" width="252" height="249" vspace="10">The 
        double-walled, triangular sections were placed one on top of another and 
        then welded inside and out to build the legs of the Arch. Sections ranged 
        in height from 12 ft. at the base to 8 ft. for the two keystone sections. 
        The complex engineering design and construction is completely hidden from 
        view. All that can be seen is its sparkling stainless steel outside skin 
        and inner skin of carbon steel, which combine to carry the gravity and 
        wind loads to the ground. The Arch has no real structural skeleton. Its 
        inner and outer steel skins, joined to form a composite structure, give 
        it its strength and permanence.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Entrance 
        to the Arch is from the underground George B. Hartzog, Jr. Visitor Center, 
        located directly beneath it. Visitors are carried from the lobby level 
        below to the observation platform at the top of the Arch by a unique conveyance 
        system - a 40-passenger train made up of eight five-passenger capsules 
        in each leg. Operating at the rate of 340 ft. per min., the ride takes 
        10 minutes for the round trip. The observation platform is 65 ft. by 7 
        ft., with plate-glass windows providing views in the east and west directions. 
        There is also a conventional maintenance elevator in each leg as far as 
        the 372-ft. level, and stairways with 1,076 steps in each leg rise from 
        the base to the top of the Arch. The elevators and stairways are for maintenance 
        and emergency use only.</p>

      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Reinforced 
        concrete foundations sunk 60 ft. into the ground extend 30 ft. into bedrock 
        and contribute substantially to the structural strength of the Arch. Structural 
        engineers Severud, Elstad, Krueger and Associates report that under a 
        wind load of 55 psf (equivalent to a 150-mph wind), the Arch will deflect 
        at the top only 18 in. in the east-west direction. Its legs are oriented 
        on a north-south line.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">To prepare 
        the site for the Arch foundations, the visitor center and museum, MacDonald 
        Construction Company, general contractor for the project, excavated 300,000 
        cu. ft. of earth and rock.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/found1.jpg" alt="Leg foundation and visitor center shell"

align="left" hspace="15" width="288" height="219" vspace="10"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Alloy-steel 
        tensioning bars or tendons, 252 of them for each leg, extend 34 ft. below 
        the top of the foundations to anchor the structure securely to its base. 
        At ground level, only the two outside corners of each triangular base 
        are prestressed by two groups of 63 steel bars in each corner. To facilitate 
        the fabrication, shipping, positioning, and erection of the 35 ft.-long 
        steel bars, the fabricators, Stress Steel Corp., chose to pre-assemble 
        them into groups of 21 each, which could be shipped and erected as a unit. 
        Each unit has three rows of seven bars each, the bars in the middle row 
        starting 10 ft. above the bottom. Specially designed jigs were used in 
        the shop to fabricate and assemble the steel bars, grout tubes, anchors 
        and bracing.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The bars, 
        1-3/4 in. in diameter, are made of alloy steel with an ultimate strength 
        of 145,000 psi. The ends of the bars were threaded into steel end plates, 
        1-3/4 in. thick.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Rigid 
        welded steel tubing of 1-1/2 in. inside diameter, tack welded to the end 
        plates, served as grout tubes around the steel bars and acted as stiffeners 
        for the 21-bar assemblies during shipping and concreting. Steel angle 
        braces were attached to each group of bars for added rigidity during handling 
        and erection, as well as steel cross-plates for extra support.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">A completed 
        bar assembly weighed less than 3 tons and could be handled quickly and 
        easily. Six such assemblies (126 bars) made a truck load for shipment 
        to the job site. Three bar assemblies (63 bars each) were placed on each 
        side of the two exterior corners of each triangular Arch leg.</p>

      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Each group 
        of tensioning bars required careful positioning because the bars had to 
        be inclined in two directions-- to fit the curvature of the Arch as well 
        as the tapering cross-section of the legs. With the steel-work in place, 
        <img src="images/found2.jpg" alt="First section is placed, 1963"

align="right" hspace="15" width="252" height="215" vspace="10">concreting proceeded 
        in lifts of about 5 ft. each. The bars were post-tensioned after the 5,000-psi 
        concrete reached a strength of 4,000 psi--usually after 7 to 10 days.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The stressing 
        was done by a hydraulic jack, which applied a load of 71 tons on each 
        bar, or a total of 18,000 tons for each leg. Bars were tensioned in a 
        strict sequence specified by the engineers. The full load was applied 
        to each bar in one operation with a center-hole hydraulic jack of 100- 
        ton capacity, which reacted against a steel jacking plate 1-3/4 inches 
        thick, embedded in the top of the concrete.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Welded 
        steel tubing around each 1-1/4 inch diameter bar had an inside diameter 
        of 1-1/2 in. This left little space between the bar and the inside wall 
        of the tubing, so that relatively high pressures were needed during grouting. 
        To simplify this operation, pairs of grout tubes on adjacent tensioning 
        bars were connected at their lower ends by specially fabricated steel 
        grout pipes 1 inch in diameter.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Grouting 
        was done by a worm-type, high-pressure pump which forced the grout down 
        one tube and up the adjacent tube. This procedure enabled the contractor 
        to take advantage of the hydraulic head in the first tube to grout the 
        second tube and eliminated the need for special grout pipes and bleed 
        openings. The top of the second tube served as a bleed opening to insure 
        complete expulsion of air.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">When steel 
        erection on the south leg had reached an elevation of about 120 ft., it 
        was noticed that the bars would not elongate properly under post-tensioning 
        because of jamming in the grout tubes. The post-tensioning tendons were 
        coupled on each station line about 12 ft. apart. A &quot;coupler shield,&quot; 
        essentially a piece of tubing with increased diameter, surrounded each 
        coupler. When concrete seeped into the tubing, the space above the coupler 
        (inside the shields) was filled up; it was decided to add 12 tendons to 
        each leg from that elevation to the 300 ft. mark, where concreting ended. 
        Also, additional steel was used in the upper sections of the Arch.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/found3.jpg" alt="Beginnings of the legs, 1963"

align="left" hspace="15" width="280" height="209" vspace="10"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">When 
        the keystone sections were placed, a crown thrust was applied by hydraulic 
        jacks to increase the compressive bending stress in the extrados of the 
        Arch legs to offset tensile stress under wind load. Following the trouble 
        with the tendons, it was decided to apply an additional 10 percent of 
        crown thrust so that the increased compressive bending stress in the extrados 
        of each Arch leg could offset the prestress loss caused by the jammed 
        tendons. The extra steel in the upper region of the Arch resists additional 
        axial and bending stresses due to the increased crown thrust.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">In addition 
        to the vertical, or near vertical, prestressing of the concrete foundation, 
        horizontal post-tensioning was utilized to prestress that part of the 
        foundation slab designed as a cover or bridge above the access tunnel 
        to the Arch. Forty-two bars of 1-1/4 inches diameter, in flexible steel 
        grout tubes, were used for this operation. They were prestressed the same 
        way as the vertical bars.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Above 
        the foundation, concrete in the walls of the Arch was prestressed up to 
        a height of 300 ft. Above this level the space between the inner and outer 
        walls is hollow and steel bracing joins the inner and outer skins. This 
        design reduces sway because the bulk of the weight is in the concrete-filled 
        lower sections of the Arch.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Massive 
        foundations and filled walls are typical of a weighted catenary arch, 
        structurally the soundest of all arches, for the thrust passes through 
        the legs and is absorbed in the foundations. In other arch shapes, pressure 
        tends to force the legs apart.</p>

      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">In cross 
        section, each Arch leg is a double-walled equilateral triangle with a 
        hollow core 40 ft. wide at the base, tapering to 15-1/2 ft. at the top. 
        The inner skin is of A-7 carbon steel, 3/8 in. thick, except at the corners 
        where it is <img src="images/steel1.jpg"

alt="Welding sections together" align="right" hspace="15" width="180" height="254" vspace="10">1-3/4 
        in. thick to provide greater stiffness. The outside surface was fabricated 
        from 900 tons of polished stainless steel in panels 14 in. thick, varying 
        in size from 6 x18 ft. to 6 x 5 1/2 ft. The outer and inner walls were 
        fabricated in sections and bolted together at the Pittsburgh and Warren, 
        PA., plants of the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company, steel fabricators 
        and erectors for the Arch.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">In the 
        shop, the fabricator designed and built two house-size welding fixtures, 
        one for butt welding the inner shell plates of carbon steel and filleting 
        angles to them, and the other--the larger one--for butt welding the stainless 
        steel.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">MIG (metal 
        inert gas) welding with an automatic electrode head, utilizing a shielding 
        mixture of 75 percent argon and 25 percent carbon dioxide, was selected 
        for joining the stainless-steel plates on the polished side only. Nondestructive 
        testing with spot X-ray was used to check the welding both in the shop 
        and in the field. Electrolytic cleaning removed the halos on the stainless 
        steel caused by heat from welding.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">After 
        the stainless-steel plates for the sections up to the 300-ft. level were 
        welded together, they were turned over and moved to a work table where 
        they were cut to size. Operators using templates welded rows of 5/16-in. 
        stainless-steel studs to these plates. Then Z-bars were fastened to the 
        studs with carbon-steel nuts tightened to 22-1/2 ft. -lbs. with a torque 
        wrench.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/assembl2.jpg" alt="Placing first section" align="left"

hspace="15" width="180" height="252" vspace="10"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">For 
        the Arch sections up to the 300-ft. level, high-strength steel bolts were 
        attached to the Z-bars. These bolts passed through holes in the inner 
        skin of carbon steel and were held in place by nuts that applied a squeezing 
        force to the concrete core of the wall &quot;sandwich,&quot; creating 
        a friction bond. To resist local bending, the outer and inner skins act 
        as the top and bottom flanges of a beam, providing a stressed-skin action 
        comparable to that employed in modern aircraft design.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">From the 
        top of the composite wall section to the crown of the Arch, all direct 
        compressive loads are carried by the outer stainless steel skin and the 
        inner carbon-steel skin. Vertical steel diaphragms, spaced 2 ft. on centers, 
        connect the two skins and serve as stiffeners to prevent buckling of the 
        inner skin. Steel angles spaced halfway between each diaphragm stiffen 
        the outer skin. The stiffeners and diaphragms are interrupted at each 
        field splice and do not contribute to Arch actions.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Spot welding 
        was chosen for attaching the carbon-steel stiffeners to the stainless-steel 
        skin to eliminate the warping that would be caused by heat if arc welding 
        were used. Except for a few seconds of localized heat, spot welding is 
        practically heatless.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The completed 
        Arch sections were shipped to St. Louis on gondola cars. Two &quot;sandwich&quot; 
        wall sections rode side by side, their stainless sides facing each other 
        but held apart by steel uprights covered with wood and neoprene. Steel 
        rods welded to the carbon-steel plates and to the steel sides of the cars 
        secured each section.</p>

        job site, cranes equipped with a tubular steel spreader-bar placed the 
        sandwich panels upright in a specially constructed storage area. Initially, 
        the sides of the triangular sections were prefabricated at the plant and 
        sent to the site as three legs of a triangle. Assembling these sections 
        at the site required extremely rigid controls for positioning and <img

src="images/assembl1.jpg" alt="Derricks lifting sections" align="right" hspace="15"

width="180" height="252" vspace="10">welding the corners, but any additional pre-assembly 
        in the shop was impossible because the resulting sections would have been 
        too large for shipment. Triangular sections for higher positions in the 
        Arch had smaller dimensions and could be fabricated and shipped as three 
        dog-leg-shaped pieces, each with a short side and a long side. Thus the 
        corner connections could be made in the shop, leaving the simpler and 
        faster task of welding along the sides for the field crews.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">At the 
        site the triangular wall sections were assembled on a 56 x 125 ft. concrete 
        welding pad. To shield the welding operations, the pad was equipped with 
        a steel-framed shelter 56 x 60 ft., 20 ft. high and roofed with corrugated 
        galvanized steel. Canvas tarpaulins that could be raised and lowered protected 
        the ends. The entire structure rode on wheels and moved back and forth 
        over the pad as successive sections of the Arch were assembled.</p>

        lifted a completed section from the welding pad onto a specially designed 
        railroad car with a 42 x 52 ft. deck composed of 24 WF beams. The car 
        was equipped with an outrigger that rode on rubber-tired wheels and supported 
        one corner of the triangular Arch section. A tractor pushed the railroad 
        car along special tracks to a position near the Arch leg.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/truss1.jpg" alt="Bird's eye view of construction"

align="left" hspace="5" width="288" height="244" vspace="10"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Specially 
        designed creeper cranes climbing the Arch legs lifted a completed section 
        into position 4 inches above the previously placed section and set it 
        on three 35-ton screw jacks. The jacks positioned the section accurately, 
        leaving a gap between the sections just wide enough for the welds. The 
        first section on each leg was attached to the foundation by anchor bolts 
        5/8 inches and 1inch in diameter. These were tightened with a manual wrench. 
        To stiffen the triangular section during moving and concreting, the corners 
        were braced with adjustable steel pipe struts of 5-in. diameter and 12 
        WF steel-beam wales.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The inner 
        plates of carbon steel were welded with low hydrogen electrodes using 
        a normal welding procedure. Semiautomatic gas-shielded welding was used 
        to join the outside stainless-steel surfaces. After welding, concrete 
        was placed in the walls and post-tensioned. Concreting was stopped at 
        the 300-ft. level; above this point the triangular sections were fabricated 
        with diaphragms between their outer and inner skins.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Welding 
        sections for the assembly of a triangle caused some deformation due to 
        heat shrinkage of the welds. Later, these sections were forced into the 
        proper position for welding on the legs, causing a slight buckling of 
        the stainless-steel surface. After a study of the situation and of the 
        welding operations, the steel erector decided to camber the walls of each 
        triangular section about 1-1/2 inches in 35 feet, so that the walls would 
        be in the desired straight line after the welding shrinkage occurred.</p>
      <p align="left">It should be pointed out that all the welding on the Arch 
        was done by expert welders who not only successfully completed welding 
        tests but also showed exceptional welding skills.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Interior 
        installations, including prefabricated steel stairs, tracks for the passenger-train 
        conveyor system, utility pipes and electrical wiring were put in each 
        Arch leg both from the bottom entrance and from the top, depending on 
        the level of the construction stage.</p>

        Derricks</strong></font></a></p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Both legs 
        of the Arch acted as free-standing cantilevers before completion and were 
        erected simultaneously without scaffolding. The first few triangular sections, 
        up to a height of 72 ft., were handled by crawler cranes operating from 
        the ground. Above that <img src="images/derrick1.jpg"

alt="Creeper derrick" align="right" hspace="15" width="252" height="238" vspace="10">height 
        two creeper derricks, each weighing 100 tons, were used to raise the 12-ft. 
        high, 50-ton sections.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The derricks 
        pulled themselves up the curved legs of the Arch; their adjustable supports 
        kept them level regardless of the height and curvature of the legs. Because 
        the height made it impracticable for workmen to climb to and from the 
        work area, the derrick platforms (43 X 32 ft.) were reached by a passenger 
        elevator and were equipped with a tool shed for workmen, sanitary facilities, 
        and communications equipment.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Two vertical 
        tracks held the sled that supported the derrick and platform. These tracks, 
        made from 12 WF steel beams with cover plates on both sides, were spaced 
        24 ft. apart. Each track was about 2 ft. from the extrados of the Arch 
        leg and was attached to brackets held by four high- strength steel bolts 
        of 1-1/4in. diameter.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Four high-strength 
        steel pins of 5-3/4 in. diameter connected the sled to the tracks. The 
        telescoping steel legs that extended between the outer corners of the 
        platform framing and the lower part of the sled had pin connections at 
        both ends. As construction progressed, and the curvature of the Arch increased, 
        the telescoping legs were shortened to keep the derrick platform level. 
        Sections of track were added in about 48-ft. lengths, and the entire derrick 
        crept up after it had placed four sections of the Arch. Lifting an Arch 
        section into place took only about an half hour.</p>

      <p align="center"><a name="stabilizing"><font color="#804040" size="5"><strong>The 
        Stabilizing Truss</strong></font></a></p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The preliminary 
        design for the Arch called for guy cables at about the 530-ft. mark to 
        stabilize the structure. Computations indicated that such stabilization 
        would require one 6-in. or two 3-in. cables on each leg--resulting inconsiderable 
        cost as reuse of the cables would not be practicable. This, and some additional 
        problems with the cables, led designers to the idea of using a stabilizing 
        strut or truss at the 530-ft. level.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">When this 
        level was reached, the two creeper derricks working together raised and 
        positioned a steel stabilizing truss 255 ft. long, which connected the 
        ends of the two legs and braced them against each other while the remaining 
        sections were put in place to complete the Arch. The bridge-like truss 
        was shop fabricated of small wide-flange beams and tubular members made 
        from high-strength constructional alloy steel. It was assembled at the 
        site with A-325 high-strength bolts and lifted into place as a unit.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The truss 
        was 40 ft. wide, 15 ft. deep and weighed about 60 tons. It was connected 
        to the Arch by means of a steel harness fitted around each leg so that 
        the loads due to the increased weight and wind force on each leg would 
        be transferred directly to the foundations. Two 45-ton horizontal jacks 
        were used at each end, at the points of contact of the strut and the harness, 
        to fit the brace against the legs.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">After 
        the stabilizing truss was erected, 21 sections were added to each leg. 
        The next step was to put the final &quot;keystone&quot; section into place 
        to complete the Arch. A jacking frame was used to exert pressure against 
        the two legs so that this section could be set in. With the Arch completed, 
        the stabilizing strut was lowered by the creeper derricks before they 
        started their trip down the legs, dismantling and lowering their tracks 
        as they progressed. At the same time the bolt holes in the stainless-steel 
        surface were plugged and ground smooth.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">An important 
        phase of the project was the method of survey control. Triangulation was 
        used with the aid of four monuments, which formed a rectangle 300 x 720 
        ft. around both center lines of the Arch. By using the two north monuments 
        for triangulation on the south leg, and the two south monuments for triangulation 
        on the north leg, all three corners of each leg could be seen. All survey 
        work was done at night to eliminate distortion caused by the sun's rays 
        striking one side of the Arch while the other two sides were in shadow.</p>

      <p align="center"><a name="elevator"><font color="#804040" size="5"><strong>The 
        Workmen's Elevator</strong></font></a></p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">A unique 
        temporary elevator system was devised to transport workmen up and down 
        during the project. This system, designed by Marshall Elevator Co., had 
        several unusual features--a travel path that could be extended as construction 
        of the Arch progressed, an interference-free radio control inside the 
        car that eliminated the need for collector rails or hanging electrical 
        cables, and a device to keep the cab level.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">One creeper 
        derrick track on each leg served as the guide for the elevator car. Two 
        hoist cables, attached to the top of the car, led directly up one track 
        beam to the base of the creeper derrick, across <img

src="images/elevat2.jpg" alt="Worker's elevator" align="right" hspace="15" width="216"

height="297" vspace="10">the 24-ft. span to the other track beam, then down to 
        the base, and horizontally to separate drums on a hoist at ground level.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The elevator 
        consisted of a main structural-steel frame or sling to which was welded 
        the structural steel sub-frame that supported the tiltable cab. The main 
        frame was held to, and guided by, the flange of the track beam by means 
        of two sets of six steel rollers mounted at the top and bottom of the 
        frame. A specially designed tilt-sensing mechanism and a motor-operated 
        leveling device kept the cab level at all times.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The Memorial 
        development was financed jointly by the Federal Government and the City 
        of St. Louis on a ratio of $3 to $1. The Bi-State Development Agency of 
        the Missouri-Illinois Metropolitan District, in a contract with the National 
        Park Service, the owner, financed the transportation system within the 
        Arch.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">The architects 
        were Eero Saarinen and Associates, in cooperation with Severud, Elstad, 
        Krueger and Associates for the structural engineering. The prime contractor 
        was the MacDonald Construction Company of St. Louis. Fabrication and erection 
        of the Arch was done by the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company, subcontractor 
        to MacDonald.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/space.gif" width="25" height="1">Acknowledgment 
        is due to the many people who carried out the construction and erection 
        of this monument with care and precision - the structural men, electricians, 
        steamfitters, sheet metal journeymen, and others who risked life and limb 
        in using their skills to meld all the component parts together into a 
        lasting monument for the inspiration of future generations. Although it 
        was estimated that 13 workers might lose their lives on the project, there 
        were no fatalities. The dedication and determination on the designers, 
        engineers and workers on the Arch echoed the pioneer spirit of those in 
        commemorates, the people who explored and settled the American West.</p>
