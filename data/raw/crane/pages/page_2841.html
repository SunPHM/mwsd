  <p>We got to go to the <a href="springflowers32602.html">Farm</a> again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We had to visit the chickens, again. One was inside the chicken house on 
    a large clutch of eggs. It takes 20-21 days for the eggs to hatch, so at the 
    beginning of next month we will have little chicks to visit!</p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/clutchofchickens200.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt=" a clutch of chickens"></td>
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/frankportrait200.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Frank in a great pose"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The Farm is next to a river, and there are all sorts of birds there, like 
    the Sandhill Cranes. The Cranes like to come into the fields and dig for grubs 
    and such.<br>
  <p>There is also a pond on the Farm with ducks and turns. (sounds like a fight...) 
    The wood ducks were looking at this birdhouse, but then a family of starlings 
    moved in.</p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/sandhillcrane200.jpg" width="200" height="161" alt="sandhill crane in a feild"></td>
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/birdhouse200.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="bird house box alonide a pond"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then there are the predators. We saw several Red Tailed Hawks and Turkey 
    Vultures. They seemed to keep out of each other's way, but there was always 
    some sort of big bird in the air.</p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/redtailedhawk200.jpg" width="200" height="161" alt="red tailed hawk in the air"></td>
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/turkevulture200.jpg" width="200" height="159" alt="turkey vulture in the air"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>We also saw many little birds, but the finches were the only ones that stood 
    still long enough to take a picture.</p>
  <table width="75%" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
    <tr> 
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/finch200.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="finch at a barn shaped feeder"></td>
      <td><img src="../immages/farm5-6-2200/finchdinner200.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="finch on a window feeder"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>We always have fun on the Farm. And this time, it was a swinging time, too.</p>
