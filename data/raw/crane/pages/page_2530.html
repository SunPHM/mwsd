<H2>Flora of the Okefenokee Swamp</H2>
<H3>By <a href="/bios/richard.html">Richard J. Lenz</a></H3>
<H3> Flora of the Okefenokee Swamp<img src="69POND-C.jpg" width="198" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Pond-cypress. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The swamp is relatively low in diversity of plants because of the acid water, 
  low nutrient levels, and sandy soil. There are no known endemics (species found 
  only in the Okefenokee Swamp), perhaps due to the young age of the swamp estimated 
  at less than a million years. Because of the acid water, the swamp is dependent 
  on physical processes to convert and release nutrients. Water depth and cycles 
  of flood and drought, known as hydroperiod, are very important, as are UV light 
  mediated decomposition, and fire. Some scientists are concerned about the upsetting 
  of these physical processes due to man's control of the swamp's water level 
  by the construction of a dam, and fire prevention. Approximately 600 species 
  of plants are found in the Okefenokee swamp.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Pond-cypress and Bald-cypress<BR>
</H3>
<P> The dominant tree of the Okefenokee Swamp is the pond-cypress, <I>Taxodium 
  ascendens </I>, a rot-resistant species recognized by its wide base which emerges 
  out of the water then quickly tapers to a much narrower trunk. The cypress, 
  with its branches draped with Spanish moss, creates the mysterious look that 
  most<img src="70GOLDEN.jpg" width="167" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Golden Trumpet. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"> 
  associate with the swamp. Although most of the Okefenokee Swamp's cypress was 
  harvested in the early 1900s, some giants are still found over 120 feet tall 
  and older than 400 years.<BR>
</P>
<P> A descendant of an early tree species that covered much of North America 70 
  million years ago, the pond-cypress is a conifer. But unlike pines, spruces 
  and firs, it loses its needles in the fall. Known to hybridize with its close 
  relative the bald-cypress, <I>Taxodium distichum </I>, both trees are members 
  of the redwood family and are not true cypress like white-cedar, juniper, and 
  redcedar. The two water-loving species are distinguished from each other by 
  where they are found, the characteristics of their bark, and the shape of their 
  needles. The pond-cypress is found in lakes and ponds, has thick, <img src="70HOODED.jpg" width="250" height="167" border="2" align="right" alt="Hooded Pitcher. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com">deeply 
  furrowed bark and closed needles that lie flat, whereas the bald-cypress prefers 
  the moving water ofstreams and rivers, has shallowly furrowed bark that sloughs 
  off in thin, flaky scales, and has open needles that fan out from twigs in two 
  rows. Both cypress have deep, laterally growing roots, adapted for the wet peaty 
  soil, and a base of knees which give the treeadditional stability and may play 
  a role in providing oxygen to the tree in the wet environment.<BR>
</P>
<P> Because of its decay resistance, the cypress has many practical uses involving 
  exposure to weather or contact with soil, and is a prized lumber for interior 
  trim. More than 400 million board feet of Okefenokee cypress were cut from 1909 
  to 1927. A testament to cypress's durability is found in theswamp, where many 
  old abandoned train pilings are found still standing in rows like silent soldiers 
  marching into the swamp.<BR>
</P>
<P> Other trees found in the swamp include slash pine, <I>Pinus elliotii </I>; 
  blackgum, <I>Nyssa sylvatica </I>; Ogeche lime, <I>Nyssa ogeche </I>; loblolly-bay, 
  Gordonia lasianthus; Swamp-bay, <I>Peresa </I>palustris; sweet-bay, <I>Magnolia 
  virginiana </I>; water ash, <I>Fraxinus caroliniana </I>; and others. <BR>
</P>
<H3> Carnivorous Plants<img src="70ROUND-.jpg" width="166" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Round-leaved Sundew. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Because of the swamp's phosphate-and-nitrogen poor soil, the Okefenokee is 
  home to many fascinating &quot;meat-eating&quot; plants. Decay is slow in the 
  acid soil, therefore little nitrogen is available for the roots of the plant. 
  Carnivorous plants have adapted to these conditions by developing a variety 
  of strategies for trapping and ingesting insects - an excellent source of protein 
  in the swamp. One wonders what the swamp would be like if the carnivorous plants 
  grew as large as the cypress trees.<BR>
</P>
<H3> The Pitcher Plants<BR>
</H3>
<P> Some of the most distinctive looking plants in the swamp are the pitcher plants, 
  found growing in clumps around the swamp. The <I>Sarracenia </I>genus of plants 
  has eight species, seven of which are found only in the southeastern U.S. The 
  pitcher plants hold small pools of water inside their long stalks, or &quot;pitchers.&quot; 
  Insects are attracted inside the pitchers, sometimes by the odor of decay or 
  sweetness, and are forced downward by pointing hairs inside thelining of the 
  plant. Trapped inside the pitcher's small pool where a narcotic helps drown 
  them, bacteria then decomposes the soft parts of the insect, and enzymes convert 
  the protein into usable nitrogen. Slicing open the tube of the pitcher will 
  reveal the black skeleton remains of many insects. Three varieties of pitcher 
  plants are found in the swamp: the golden trumpet pitcher, <I>Sarracenia </I><I> 
  flava </I>; the hooded pitcher plant, <I>Sarracenia </I>minor; and the parrot 
  pitcher plant, <I>Sarracenia </I>psittacina. The golden trumpet pitcher is recognized 
  by its more open top. Thehooded pitcher has a definite curving top, sometimes 
  with small, transparent windows on the back of its hood which help trap insects 
  inside the pitcher. Flying insects are attracted to the windows where they spend 
  their last hours. The parrot pitcher has smaller, reclining pitchers. All havea 
  remarkable drooping flower that helps attract insects.<BR>
</P>
<H3> The Sundews<BR>
</H3>
<P> A variety of sundews use a sticky substance to catch smaller insects such 
  as gnats. The round-leaved sundew, <I>Drosera rotundifolia </I>, has reddish 
  leaves with long, stringy red hairs covered with glistening droplets of a sticky 
  substance that makes the plant a type of natural flypaper. After the insect 
  becomes stuck to the plant, the leaf slowly closes to enclose and digest the 
  insect.<BR>
</P>
<H3> The Butterworts and Bladderworts<img src="70BLADDE.jpg" width="250" height="178" align="right" border="2" alt="Bladderworts. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Butterworts and bladderworts are classified in the bladderwort family, <I>Lentibulariaceae 
  </I>, but use very different strategies for eating insects. The yellow butterwort, 
  <I>Pinguicula lutea </I>, uses a sticky substance on its leaves to trap and 
  digest insects. The small plant is recognized by its solitary yellowflower growing 
  out of a basal rosette of yellow-green, sticky leaves. There are also purple 
  flowering butterworts in the Okefenokee. The swollen bladderwort, <I>Utricularia 
  inflata </I>, is an aquatic plant, that eats tiny aquatic creatures such as 
  insect larvae, protozoa, and crustaceans. The plant is recognized by yellow 
  flowers on a long stalk growing out of a center of feathery leaves which look 
  like spokes on a wagon wheel. The leaves are made up of small air sacs or bladders. 
  The bladders have a small opening and a trap-door device that is tripped by 
  entering insects preventing their escape. There are five species of bladderworts 
  in the swamp.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Golden Club<BR>
</H3>
<P> Golden club, <I>Orontium aquaticum </I>, is one of the more common aquatic 
  plants of the Okefenokee prairie, and one of the more beautiful in the spring. 
  An emergent perennial, it has minute yellow flowers clustered on a golden yellow 
  club-like spadix. Below the yellow tip the plant is white then red. The 10-inch, 
  dark green, oblong-pointed leaves have a waxy coating that easily repels water 
  and earns the plant the swamp nickname of &quot;neverwet.&quot; It is also considered 
  the &quot;Herald of Spring,&quot; because whenthey emerge, it is spring in the 
  swamp.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Water Lilly<img src="71WATERL.jpg" width="167" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Water Lily. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Probably the most dramatic and common flower found in the Okefenokee is the 
  fragrant water lilly, <I>Nymphaea odorata</I>. Found floating on top of the 
  reflective, black swamp water in large communities, the plant consists of white 
  flowers with yellow stamens and round, flat, floating leaves that are shiny 
  green on top and purplish-red underneath. The stomata or tiny openings on the 
  leaf surface through which carbon dioxide and other gases pass into the plant 
  are located on the upper leaf surface instead of underneath like most land plants. 
  <BR>
</P>
<P> The leaf stalk has four main channels for the movement of gases from the leaves 
  to the large stems or rhizomes. The rhizomes scare tourists who believe them 
  to resemble some undiscovered swamp snake and frequently foul the props of outboard 
  boat motors. When the flower fades, the stalk retreats into the water submerging 
  the hard-cased fruit while the seeds mature. When the case opens, the seeds 
  float free until they become waterlogged, sink, and take root.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Green-briar<img src="71GREEN-.jpg" width="207" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Green-briar. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The green-briar, <I>Smilax walteri</I>, is a vine with flowers with a putrid 
  smell that put it in the Smilax or carrion flower genus. It's bad-smelling flowers 
  attract carrion flies, which act as pollinators. The green-briar is the only 
  cat-claw briar species that doesn't have thorns. It's red berries, which drop 
  and float, are popular with waterfowl.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Climbing Heath<img src="71CLIMBI.jpg" width="171" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Climbing Heath. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Climbing heath,<I> Pieris</I> phillyreifolia, is one of 2,500 species in the 
  heath family, Ericaceae , consisting of shrubs or woody perennial herbs, often 
  with showy flowers. Many ornamentals, such as rhododendrons and azaleas, come 
  from this family as do several edible fruits such as blueberries, huckleberries, 
  and cranberries. Heaths thrive in acid soils in temperate regions. The climbing 
  heath likes to grow under the bark of cypress trees and has tiny, tube-like 
  white flowers.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Spanish Moss<BR>
  <img src="71SPANIS.jpg" width="196" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Spanish Moss. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"> 
</H3>
<P> Spanish moss, <I>Tillandsia usneoides</I>, is one of the distinctive plants 
  of the Okefenokee, adding to the swamp's mysterious allure. Spanish moss is 
  not a true moss, but an air plant or epiphyte. Not a parasite of the tree, it 
  gets nourishment from the sun, airborne nutrients, and foliage of the host tree. 
  Flowers on the plant are small, green, and rarely seen.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Virginia Chain Fern<img src="71CHAINF.jpg" width="166" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Virginia Chain Fern. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The Virginia chain fern, <I>Woodwardia virginica</I>, is one the most primitive 
  plants in the swamp. Growing two-to-four feet tall, straight out of the water, 
  the spore cases form chains thus giving the plant its name. <BR>
</P>
<H3> The Peat Battery<BR>
</H3>
<P> The Okefenokee is a southern blackwater swamp which is defined by its tea-colored, 
  acidic water. Helping to create this brew is a mix of decaying organic matter, 
  called peat. Peat is easily found in floating peat batteries, which according 
  to one study are 80 percent decaying water lillies and cypress. Standing on 
  one of these floating islands is like standing on a waterbed, and is thought 
  to be the origin of the Creek Indian name <I>O-ke-fin-o-cau</I>: &quot;Land 
  of the Trembling Earth.&quot;<BR>
</P>
<H3> Swamp Iris<img src="72SWAMPI.jpg" width="168" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Swamp Iris. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The southern blue-flag, <I>Iris virginica</I>, is a beautiful purple-blue 
  flower found in the swamp. A showy native iris of southern wetlands, the extremely 
  poisonous rhizome was dried and used in small amounts as a diuretic and cathartic 
  by Indians. </P>
<H2> Fauna of the Okefenokee Swamp</H2>
<P> An estimated 425 species of vertebrate animals have been found in the Okefenokee, 
  including 39 fishes, 37 amphibians, 64 reptiles, 235 birds, and 50 mammals. 
  Eleven species are threatened or endangered. With more than 50 percent of the 
  vertebrate species, the Okefenokee's birds are the easiest to see and experience. 
  There is an especially high diversity of reptiles. The insect life is abundant, 
  as a visitor during June will attest, and an important contributor to the cycling 
  of nutrients. An estimated 12 to 40 percent of the forest canopy is consumed 
  by insects, primarily butterflies and moths.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Florida Black Bear<img src="72BLACKB.jpg" width="250" height="246" align="right" border="2" alt="Black Bear. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The Okefenokee's largest mammal is the Florida black bear, <I>Ursus americanus 
  floridianus</I>, and reportedly can grow to 400 pounds, though they generally 
  average approximately 150 pounds, smaller than the average Appalachian bear. 
  This subspecies or &quot;hog bear&quot; as locals call it, has a healthy population 
  of approximately 500 animals, equivalent to the numbers found in the Great Smoky 
  Mountain National Park. Populations have grown to this historic high level after 
  the state began protecting the bear statewide in 1972. Today, there is a six-day 
  bear hunting season and approximately 50 percent of all bears killed in Georgia 
  are in Charlton County near the swamp. Okefenokee pioneers held black bears 
  in low regard and tried to hunt them into extinction -- not because they found 
  them threatening but because the bears threatened the swampers' survival by 
  attacking and consuming the settlers' hogs, cows, chickens, honeybees, corn 
  fields, fruit trees, and grape vines. Today, there's no swamper property to 
  protect, so the bears have made a comeback and are found mainly around the Trail 
  Ridge section of the swamp. There are concerns about poaching of bears for the 
  bogus use of bear parts in exotic medicines in the Orient.<BR>
</P>
<P> Black bears are opportunistic feeders, and will eat berries, reptile eggs, 
  yellow jacket nests, insects, grasses, and palmettos, among other items. The 
  bears are mainly nocturnal and have a home range of approximately 8-10 square 
  miles. If you hear a big crashing sound in the woods you are probably hearing 
  a bear.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Bobcat<img src="72_BOBCA.jpg" width="167" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Bobcat. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The bobcat, <I>Felis rufus</I>, is widespread and plentiful in the Okefenokee, 
  which has one of the best populations in the state. Bobcats range from the dry 
  sandhill communities along the eastern boundaries of Trail Ridge near Folkston, 
  to the low wetlands surrounding &quot;the pocket&quot; and Jones Island on the 
  southwestern perimeter of the Okefenokee. Bobcats are illusive and retiring 
  creatures and normally are only seen at night, but increasing populations in 
  the swamp have made daytime observations more common. Floyds Island, in the 
  Okefenokee interior, houses one of the greatest concentrations of wild bobcats 
  in any wildlife refuge in the U.S. Here it is not uncommon to see one of these 
  wild creatures creeping within a few meters of a campsite.<BR>
</P>
<P> Bobcats, unique to North America, get their name from their stubby, or &quot;bobbed&quot; 
  tail. The bobcat eats mice, shrews, rabbits, wild turkey, and other mammalian 
  prey and mates in the spring, producing a litter of two to four kittens in late 
  April early May.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Raccoon<BR>
</H3>
<P> The raccoon, <I>Procyon lotor</I>, is the masked bandit of the swamp. If any 
  mammal deserves to wear a facial mask of a midnight thief, the raccoon is doubtlessly 
  the prime candidate. These jolly creatures have earned their place in Okefenokee 
  folklore by chewing on hunting dogs, invading corn fields, stealing meat from 
  the smoke house, eating grapes from the arbor, killing chickens, and creating 
  mischief every chance they get. Campers should be alert that raccoons are not 
  only &quot;cute&quot; but are also intelligent, and can crack a camper's cooler 
  in less than five minutes. The raccoon is the most abundant fur-bearing animal 
  in the swamp, and it eats berries, frogs, fish, reptile eggs, and anything else 
  it can get its dexterous hands on.<BR>
</P>
<H3> River Otter<img src="72RIVERO.jpg" width="250" height="164" align="right" border="2" alt="River Otter. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The river otter, <I>Lutra canadensis</I>, is found along the main waterways 
  of the Okefenokee, in the open water of the prairies and in the Suwannee and 
  St. Marys rivers. The otter is a marvelous, graceful swimmer that feeds mainly 
  on fish, but will supplement its diet with just about anything including crustaceans, 
  small mammals such as mice, and snakes. The Okefenokee settlers made household 
  pets of the playful, sociable otter. Oldtimers tell stories about how otters 
  would eat from their dinner table and play with the children and family housecat. 
  Sought by trappers for their valuable fur, their numbers once dwindled but have 
  made a comeback with a crash in the market for their fur. Today, the otter's 
  main enemy is probably the alligator. You may find otters by looking for mud 
  slides on river banks where otters have been amusing themselves.<BR>
</P>
<H3> White-tailed Deer, Red Wolf, Panther<img src="73WHITE-.jpg" width="250" height="166" align="left" border="2" alt="White-tailed Deer. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> White-tailed deer, <I>Odocoileus virginianus</I>, are now common in Georgia, 
  and are often observed in the Okefenokee. The deer frequent a wide variety of 
  habitats in the swamp, and it is exciting to see onewading in the water while 
  foraging on berry-producing plants. Another good time to see deer is early or 
  late in the day as one travels the roads into the Suwannee Canal Recreation 
  Area or Stephen C. Foster State Park. With the general demise of the red wolf, 
  <I>Canis rufus</I>, and panther,<I>Felis concolor</I>, the white-tailed deer 
  have no natural enemies other than man. This has led some to propose the return 
  of red wolves and panthers to the wildlife refuge to control deer populations. 
  The last wolves were reported<img src="73_PANTH.jpg" width="166" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Panther. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"> 
  on Floyds Island in 1921, whereas observations of panthers occur fairly frequently 
  with no corroborating evidence such as tracks, photos, or the animals themselves. 
  In a study several years ago, mountain lions, <I>Felis concolor</I>, with radio 
  collars were released in the park to see how they would adapt to the swamp environment. 
  Researchers found that the animals had no trouble traveling through the refuge. 
  One animal was shot by a poacher. When the study was completed, the animals 
  were picked up.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Barred Owl<img src="73BARRED.jpg" width="162" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Barred Owl. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The barred owl, <I>strix variar</I>, has a loud barking call that will startle 
  you into looking for the shy bird. The owl is usually found sitting back in 
  a tree's foliage in a thick grove of a lowland forest. The owl is recognized 
  by feathered bars on its neck and an absence of feather tufts around the ears. 
  A nocturnal bird, like most owls it rests during the day, coming out at night 
  to hunt frogs, rodents and birds.<BR>
</P>
<H3> Sandhill Crane<img src="74SANDHI.jpg" width="168" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Sandhill Crane. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Florida naturalist Archie Carr wrote that there are only three great animal 
  voices remaining in the southeastern United States: the &quot;jovial lunacy 
  of the barred owl ... the roar of the alligator ... (and) the ethereal bugling 
  of the sandhill crane.&quot; All three can be heard in the Okefenokee, and all 
  three can stop you in your tracks. The inexperienced can probably imagine the 
  hoot of the owl and the dinosaur rumble of the alligator, but the call of the 
  sandhill crane is unlike anything you've ever heard. Once you've heard it, I 
  guarantee that you will never forget the voice of the &quot;watchmen of the 
  swamp.&quot; Sandhills, <I>Grus canadensis</I>, are the largest birds in the 
  swamp, standing nearly four feet tall, with a 7 foot wingspan, gray body and 
  red forehead. You will usually hear them before you see them, as they blend 
  into the landscape very well. The Okefenokee has populations of sandhills that 
  spend their entire life in the swamp. The sandhill cranes mate for life and 
  nest in open places where treesdon't block their keen vision. The are best viewed 
  on the eastern side of the Okefenokee at the Suwannee Canal Recreation Area.

<H3> Anhinga <img src="74_ANHIN.jpg" width="166" height="250" align="left" border="2" alt="Anhinga. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"></H3>
<P> The anhinga, <I>anhinga anhinga</I>, is also called the water turkey and snake 
  bird, because of its turkey-like tail and snake-like neck. The anhinga feeds 
  by swimming under the surface of the water and spearing fish with its sharp, 
  yellow beak. Because the wings of this water bird do not contain oil glands 
  to keep them sufficiently dry for flight, the anhinga is frequently seen perched 
  on a branch or stump with its beautiful wings outstretched. On dark, cloudy 
  days, anhingas instinctively avoid the water. Their unmistakable flight pattern 
  is flap, flap, flap, flap, and glide.<BR>
</P>
<H3> White Ibis<img src="74WHITEI.jpg" width="166" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="White Ibis. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The white ibis, <I> Eudocimus albus </I>, with its orange curved bill and 
  orange legs, is the most commonly observed white wading bird in the park. The 
  ibis congregates in flocks and likes to perch at the very top of trees. Found 
  in the shallow prairies, they move as they feed, using their curved bills to 
  probe the mud for insects and crayfish. During flight, their black wing tips 
  become obvious, and their wing beat is much more rapid than other white wading 
  birds. According to Dr. Bill Cribbs, &quot;this bird was one of the favorite

<H3> Great Egret<BR>
</H3>
<P> The great egret or American white egret, <I> Casmerodius albus </I>, was almost 
  pushed into extinction by turn-of-the-century market hunters and European fashion 
  mavens, who prized the bird's beautiful white feathers for use in women's hats. 
  Conservation efforts by groups such as the National Audubon Society (which was 
  established specifically to save the great egret and snowy egret) helped protect 
  the bird, one of America's finest herons. It is distinguished from other white 
  wading birds by its yellow beak and black legs. Like the great blue heron, the 
  great egret is a solitary feeder, seen standing motionless as it stalks fish, 
  frogs, snakes, and crayfish. Locals call the great egret a &quot;scoggin&quot; 
  or &quot;plume bird.&quot;<BR>
</P>
<H3> Prothonotary Warbler<BR>
</H3>
<P> The Prothonotary warbler, <I> Protonotaria citrea </I>, is a characteristic 
  bird of southern swamplands, where its bright, golden-orange plumage is conspicuous 
  in the dark, cypress swamps. Called the &quot;flame bird&quot;of the swamp, 
  the prothonotary has a loud, ringing &quot;sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet&quot; 
  song. It is unusual among warblers in that it nests in cavities in trees, and 
  has been found nesting on the refuge. The family of warblers has the highest 
  number of bird species found in the swamp with 32.<BR>

</H3>
<P> When cartoonists draw caricatures of swamps, they inevitably perch a vulture 
  in a mossy snag of a dead cypress tree. Vultures are common and nest in the 
  Okefenokee swamp, including the turkey vulture, <I> cathartes aura </I>, and 
  the black vulture, <I> Coragyps atratus </I>. These birds have a famous preference 
  for dead meat, and where they are seen circling is evidence of a fresh, dead 
  animal. The turkey vulture is the largest of the two, with black wings. The 
  smaller black vulture, with white patches near its wing tips, is more aggressive 
  than the turkey vulture and will drive it away from a carcass. Turkey vultures 
  locate carrion by smell, and black vultures by sight. Both birds are found perching, 
  or soaring high overhead on thermals.<BR>

<H3> Green Anole<img src="75GREENA.jpg" width="159" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Green Anole. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Called the &quot;swamp chameleon,&quot; the green anole, <I> Anolis carolinensis 
  </I>, can change color between greenand brown. It has a pink throat fan and 
  grows from five to eight inches long. A member of the iguana family, the adults 
  prefer shaded perches and the young prefer sunny locations close to the ground. 
  The most abundant lizard of the south, they mate from March to September, and 
  females can lay a single egg every 14 days, with incubation five to seven weeks. 
  Anoles slowly stalk their prey of flies, beetles, spiders, moths and other insects. 
  Anoles are the largest group of reptiles in the Western Hemisphere, with more 
  than 200 known species, but only the green anole is native to North America.<BR>

<H3> Southern Five-lined Skink<img src="75FIVE-L.jpg" width="250" height="167" align="left" border="2" alt="Five-lined Skink. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The southern five-lined skink, <I> Eumeces inexpectatus </I>, and its close 
  relative, the five-lined skink, <I> Eumeces fasciantus </I>, are both commonly 
  observed sunning themselves on the boardwalks of the refuge. Skinks are lizards, 
  not salamanders as many mistake them. The two species are recognized by their 
  five, beautiful yellow stripes and bright blue tales in the juveniles. Adults 
  lose much of the coloration of their stripes and their tales are not as blue. 
  The two species are distinguished from each other by the scales on the underside 
  of their tales. The five-lined has one row of broader scales, whereas the southern's 
  scales are all the same size. The tail of the skink has fracture planes, allowing 
  it to break off easily when grasped by a predator. The tail is vividly colored 
  to draw the attack away from thebody. There are five species of skinks in the 
  refuge and to identify them, you have to capture them. Don't grab a skink by 
  the tail because first, you won't capture the skink, and second, the escaping 
  skink's survival chances are greatly reduced because it won't have its decoy 
  tail when it needs it for a predator. Cats that eat the southern five-lined 
  have been known to lose their sense of balance or develop paralysis requiring 
  veterinary attention.<BR>

<H3> Southern Spring Peeper, Florida Cricket Frog, Bullfrog<img src="75SOUTHE.jpg" width="161" height="250" align="right" border="2" alt="Southern Spring Peeper. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> What would a trip to a swamp be without seeing a frog on a lilly pad or hearing 
  the grunt of the bullfrog? Frequently heard and less often seen, the more than 
  20 species of frogs and toads in the Okefenokee make their presence known by 
  their loud chorus of voices. Like their name suggests, the voice of the Southern 
  spring peeper, <I> Hyla crucifer </I><I> bartramiana </I>, is an early announcement 
  of spring in the South. Usually a brownish or tan color, the inch-long, nocturnal 
  spring peeper is recognized by a dark X on its back <img src="75_BULLF.jpg" width="250" height="171" align="left" border="2" alt="Bullfrog. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com">(hence 
  crucifer - - cross). The Florida cricket frog, <I> Acris gryllus dorsalis </I>, 
  is a tiny frog that many mistake as a juvenile version of other species. It 
  has a dark triangle between the eyes, a rapid, cricketlike voice, and is a good 
  jumper. Active during the day, the &quot;swamp&quot; cricket frog prefers the 
  margins of swamps, roadside ditches, and lakes, and is many times the creature 
  jumping into the water just before you as you walk along the water's edge. The 
  bullfrog, <I> Rana catesbeiana </I>, is the largest frog in the Okefenokee, 
  and the largest frog in North America, growing to eight inches. The bullfrog's 
  legs are so large that they are raised commercially and sold as meat in the 
  restaurant trade. A nocturnal amphibian, the bullfrog has been known to eat 
  small birds and young snakes, but it usually preys on insects, small fish, crayfish, 
  and other frogs. The bullfrog's coloring varies, but it is one of the more beautiful 
  animals with its dark green mottling on top and lighter coloring underneath. 
  It's voice is usually described as &quot;jug-o'-rum.&quot;<BR>

<H3> Eastern Hognosed Snake<img src="76HOGNOS.jpg" width="250" height="161" align="right" border="2" alt="Hognose Snake. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> Found in the drier, sandier parts of the refuge is the Easternhognosed snake, 
  <I> Heterodon platyrhinos </I>. Sufficient to identify the hognosed snake is 
  its unforgettable and unique behavior. The hognose will puff out its neck like 
  a cobra, hiss, and strike without biting. When further molested, the hognose 
  will roll over on its back, open its mouth, convulse a few times and play dead. 
  Turn the snake right side up, the snake will twist again to belly up position. 
  The snake has many nicknames, such as &quot;hissing sand snake,&quot; &quot;puff 
  adder,&quot; and &quot;blow viper,&quot; but goes by hognosed snake because 
  of its upturned snout. The Eastern species' skin pattern is spotted, and the 
  coloration is widely variable (unlike the Southern hognose, also found in the 
  refuge, which is fairly constant), with dark patches on a yellow, brown, olive, 
  gray, orange, or red snake. The Eastern grows to more than three feet in length, 
  whereas the Southern species is a smaller, foot- to two-foot-long snake. <BR>

<H3> Cottonmouth Snake and Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake<img src="76COTTO1.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="right" border="2" alt="Cottonmouth. Photo by Richard T. Bryant.

</H3>
<P> The Okefenokee has 37 species of snakes, but the cottonmouth snake, <I> Agkistrodon 
  piscivorus </I>, and Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, <I> Crotalus adamanteus 
  </I>, are the most feared by man. The cottonmouth has a venomous bite and tends 
  to hold its ground more readily than a water snake. When aroused, the cottonmouth 
  will threaten an intruder by exposing the light &quot;cotton&quot; lining of 
  its mouth and mimic a rattlesnake by shaking its tail. Its bite is more serious 
  than the copperhead's, and can be fatal. It is distinguished from other water 
  snakes by its vertical pupil and pit below its eye, and its method of swimming 
  with its head out of the water. You do not want to disturb or handle this snake. 
  The Eastern diamondback, the largest rattlesnake in the world, is also best 
  left alone because of itspoisonous and possibly fatal bite. The Eastern diamondback, 
  known to grow to eight feet, prefers dry pinelands and palmetto flatwoods that 
  surround the swamp. The snake is recognized by, of course, its rattles, its 
  distinct colored diamond shapes on its skin, its large head and heavy body. 
  Some diamondbacks will wait until the intruder is nearly upon it before it rattles. 
  Others will rattle when an intruder is 30 feet away. The diamondback has been 
  persecuted by man for &quot;round-ups&quot; and fear, and is becoming less common 
  throughout its range.<BR>

<H3> Florida Cooter<img src="76FLORID.jpg" width="250" height="160" align="right" border="2" alt="Florida Cooter. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The Florida cooter, <I> Pseudemys floridana floridana</I>, is a very shy turtle 
  that is difficult to catch in the refuge. Usually about a foot long,<img src="76BOXTUR.jpg" width="250" height="164" align="left" border="2" alt="Box Turtle. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"> 
  the Florida cooter has yellow stripes on its head, an unmarked plastron, and 
  donut-shaped marks on the underside of its marginals. It is frequently seen 
  basking, butthis turtle is extremely wary and will slide into the water before 
  you get too close. The Florida cooter has an unusual habit during nesting which 
  it shares with only two other species of turtles in the world. Most turtles 
  dig one nest in the ground, lay eggs in the the hole, and cover it with dirt. 
  The Florida cooter digs one main nest, lays most of its eggs in this nest, pauses, 
  and digs two side nests and places a few eggs in each of these. The reason for 
  this behavior is unclear to scientists. This turtle lives in the coastal plain 
  of the U.S. <BR>

<H3> Bowfin<img src="77_BOWFI.jpg" width="250" height="155" align="right" border="2" alt="Bowfin. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The bowfin, <I> Amia calva </I>, is a fascinating fish that is a legend among 
  fishermen. So much so, locals have given it many names such as mudfish, dogfish, 
  black fish, shoepick, cotton fish, grinnel, scaly cat, spottail, Florida trout, 
  Cypress trout and others. The bowfin is like a swimming fossil: it is the last 
  remaining survivor of an ancient family of highly predaceous fishes. Relatives 
  of the bowfin were abundant in marine environments during Jurassic and Cretaceous 
  times approximately 150 million years ago, and are found represented in fossils 
  from those times. The bowfin has a gular bone, a flat plate on the floor of 
  the mouth between the lower jaws, not found in any ofNorth America's freshwater 
  fishes but found in some marine fishes such as the tarpon. The bowfin spawns 
  in spring in shallow waters where the male clears vegetation and excavates a 
  shallow nest. After spawning, the male protects the nest and guards the young 
  for several weeks after they've hatched. Bowfins are considered transitional 
  fishes, developed somewhere between gars and bony fishes. With partially developed 
  air breathing devices, the bowfin can survive a long time out of water. They 
  will gulp air into their swim bladders, which are equipped with blood vessels 
  and can serve as a primite lung. Fishermen should beware of the fish's sharp 
  teeth. Bowfins are common around the sill and below the sill in the Suwannee 
  River. <BR>

<H3> Chain Pickerel<img src="77CHAINP.jpg" width="250" height="155" align="right" alt="Chain Pickerel. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_t_bryant@mindspring.com" border="2"><BR>
</H3>
<P> The chain pickerel, <I> Esox niger </I>, also called a jackfish, black pike, 
  green pickerel, green pike, and justjack by swampers, is an exciting fish that 
  loves to jump, and more than one fisherman has beensurprised by a slap in the 
  face by a flying jackfish. A solitary fish, it prefers quiet waters with heavy 
  vegetation, where it stalks its prey. The chain pickerel is a popular gamefish 
  in the northeast and is caught by ice fishermen during the winter, but the world 
  angling record for the chain pickerel was set in Georgia in 1961 at nine pounds, 
  six ounces.<BR>

</H3>
<P> A beautiful orb-weaving spider, the golden-silk spider, <I> Nephila clavipes 
  </I>, is found in the refuge. The female golden-silk spider has a one-inch long 
  golden body, and golden legs with conspicuous tufts of black hair on the first 
  and last pairs of legs. The male, sometimes located nearby on the web, is much 
  smaller - only an eighth of an inch and drab colored. Also known as the calico 
  spider, during the day the female is found perched head downward near the mesh-like 
  center of the two- to three-foot web. Some orb-weavers replace their web every 
  day, but the golden-silk spider redoes only one side a day and never the whole 
  web. Sometimes, the spider can be found in large groups in shaded woodlands 
  near water and swamps. </P>
