<P>Just for old time’s sake, and to review nature’s happenings in
June of ten years ago, I got out my June, 1991 records containing
hundreds of day-to-day natural occurrences.  A favorite
non-native tree, the horse chestnut, greeted the month at Baileys
Harbor like a gigantic, white, flowering tower.

<P>Henry Oldenburg, building contractor from Baileys Harbor, and
the first president of the Ridges Sanctuary in 1937, planted a
small horse chestnut tree near each, or at least most, of the
homes, cottages and resorts that he and his men built, mostly in
northern Door County.  Quite a few of those trees are large
memorials today to his thoughtfulness.  In fact the enormous
horse chestnut tree that grew in his front yard, immediately
north of the Yum Yum Tree ice cream shop in Baileys Harbor, was a
state record until a few years ago when it was toppled by a
storm.

<P>Some of the finest panoramas of wildflowers decorating fallow
fields were also in bloom by the first of the month.  Even though
classified as weeds, the expanses of thousands of yellow Canada
hawkweeds, orange hawkweeds and white ox-eye daisies are a
welcome sight.  They are here to stay so we might just as well
enjoy them.

<P>June began with quite a few eastern tiger and black
swallowtail butterflies on the wing.  Just as we had hoped for,
the month turned out to be one of the best butterfly Junes many
people had ever encountered.  Wood satyr and white admiral
butterflies were in plentiful supply by the middle of the month
joined by a smaller number of viceroys and red admirals.
Hundreds of eyed browns and pearl crescents were fluttering by
toward the end of the month.

<P>Charlotte and I helped lead a birding trip for the Wisconsin
Society for Ornithology to Rock Island State Park on the seventh
and were treated to a phenomenon referred to as a &quot;reverse
migration&quot; of several hundred broad-winged hawks.  These
hawks, and quite a few other buteos, depend largely upon thermals
for their long-range migration.  In that thermals, or updrafts of
air, ordinarily don’t occur over bodies of water, these hawks
tend to not fly over large expanses of open water.

<P>They reach the Northport area, head across the relatively
narrow Death’s Door body of water, and then venture across
another narrow channel to Rock Island.  Once the hawks fly to
that island they apparently sense the much broader expanses of
water beyond that point and head back to the mainland.  Now they
continue heading southward along the Green Bay side of the
peninsula nearly to the city of Green Bay where they head
slightly westward, then northward into the state, the U.P. and
Canada.

<P>The maple-leaf viburnums (one of our top favorite native
shrubs) and some of the dogwood shrubs were in good bloom by the
thirteenth.  That night our front yard and the nearby edge of the
woods were highlighted by the first fireflies, or lightning bugs,
of the season.  By the way, these amazing creatures are neither
flies nor bugs.  They are beetles, but have you ever heard them
called firebeetles?  Neither have I!

<P>Three male bobolinks, perched together on an overhead
powerline, entertained us royally along Plateau Road on the
eighteenth.  That June, 1991, was one of the better years for
these beautiful singers whose numbers appear to be diminishing a
little each year.  However we have already seen a fair number so
far this spring.

<P>The tall irises, both tame and wild, were in good bloom by the
nineteenth.  Drive some off-the-beaten-track backroads during
this season to find occasional large stands of one of their wild
relatives, the blue-eyed grass.  We make repeated visits to an
eighth-mile-long stretch of roadside where hundreds of these
sparkling blue-blossomed wildflowers grow.

<P>Speaking about blue, I was watering the sweet corn patch in
our garden with a hose that same day and was entertained by a
female eastern bluebird who made repeated passes through the fine
spray of the hose within 25 feet of where I stood very quietly.
After getting thoroughly washed for at least five minutes, she
spent the next five perched on a garden stake, out of range of
the &quot;shower bath,&quot; preening herself.

<P>Two of the native dogwood shrubs that were in excellent bloom
by the twentieth were the pagoda, or alternate-leaved, and the
round-leaved.  The pagoda dogwood, <I>Cornus alternifolia</I>, is
readily available from area nurseries and is an outstanding
choice to be included in a landscaping plan.  Its intriguing
shape adds great beauty to a winter landscape as well.

<P>Just as we had expected, baby white-breasted nuthatches and
red-bellied woodpeckers were being fed in our front yard by their
parents by the twenty-seventh.  We’ve come to use &quot;marvel
meal&quot; year-around, a mixture of two cups lard, melted
together with two cups of peanut butter. Then stir in four cups
yellow cornmeal, four cups quick oats, two-thirds cup sugar, and
two cups white flour.  It’s magic especially to the woodpeckers,
chickadees and nuthatches.

<P>James Russell Lowell wrote: &quot;And what is so rare as a day
in June?  Then, if ever, come perfect days: Then Heaven tries the
earth if it be in tune, and over it softly her warm ear
lays.&quot;  Open the Door to June!
