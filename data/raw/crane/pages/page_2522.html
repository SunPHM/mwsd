  <font size="-1">The American bittern, the sandhill crane (left), and the yellow-headed 
  blackbird (cover) are three of the bird species that were familiar to early 
  settlers and may still be seen in the Sugar-Pecatonica watershed, although the 
  numbers of each are much reduced. The Colored Sands Bluff Nature Preserve in 
  Winnebago County includes plants such as the bearberry (right) which prefers 
  sandstone outcrops and sand deposits.</font></p>
<p>The region once teemed with large mammals. Forty-five species of mammals are 
  still known or are likely to occur here, including some that are unusual in 
  most of Illinois. For many years, Lake Le-Aqua-Na, north of Lena in Stephenson 
  County, was the only state park where badgers could be seen in the wild. The 
  secretive animals are also occasionally spotted at the Wilson Prairie Nature 
  Preserve in Winnebago County. River otters have been sighted locally at least 
  eight times since 1992, and a bobcat was spotted northwest of Ridott in 1992. 
  In 1996, students from Highland College at Freeport found a dead porcupine while 
  hiking on the Pecatonica Prairie Path in Stephenson County. Whether this animal 
  was a stray or a member of an established population that moved down from Wisconsin 
  is not known.</p>
<p>Parts of both the Sugar and Pecatonica rivers are bordered by a complex archipelago 
  of woodlots that offers food and shelter to many kinds of birds. The wetlands 
  between Pecatonica and Shirland alone host more than four dozen species of birds. 
  Among them are species rare in Illinois, such as the pied-billed grebe and the 
  Virginia rail. In all, approximately 260 bird species regularly appear in the 
  Sugar-Pecatonica watershed - nearly nine of every ten of the species found anywhere 
  in Illinois. Records of the bird-band&shy;ing station set up in 1967 at the 
  Colored Sands Bluff Nature Preserve (which has tagged more than 85,000 birds) 
  confirm that the Sugar River is an important rest stop for migrating birds. 
  In addition, more than 136 bird species breed here, from the wild turkey to 
  the tufted titmouse, including virtually all the forest songbirds typically 
  found at this latitude. Among the breeding species are 25 that are considered 
  rare.</p>
<p>DWINDLING DIVERSITY</p>
<p>This wealth of life persists in spite of the fact that the forests, savannas, 
  prairies, and wetlands of the Sugar&shy;<br>
  Pecatonica watershed are being altered or destroyed as fast or faster than in 
  Illinois as a whole. In the presettlement era, prior to the arrival of large 
  numbers of Euro-American settlers begin&shy;ning about 1820, an estimated 36% 
  of the land area of the Sugar-Pecatonica watershed was woods, with the rest 
  covered by prairie or some other type of grassland. Today, 6-7% of the Sugar&shy;Pecatonica 
  watershed is forested, and many of these woods differ in charac&shy;ter and 
  quality from the presettlement forests. Dryish oak-hickory forest, with its 
  park-like open understory, once fes&shy;tooned most west- to south-facing slopes 
  and uplands. To see one today, one must visit a nature preserve such as Oakdale 
  Nature Preserve, south of Freeport, or the Hartley Memorial Nature Preserve 
  in Winnebago County. </p>
