A close shot from a similar angle as the <A HREF="TreeCrane2.htm">previous page</A> features the whooping crane, along with a porcupine and a number of other animals.
<p>
The North American whooping crane, a white bird almost 5 ft tall, was nearly extinct in 1941 and is still endangered; the gray sandhill crane, which winters west of the Mississippi, has also become rarer.  
<p>    
The whooping crane is believed to have never been very abundant.  &nbsp; Indiscriminate shooting, habitat disturbance, and the draining of large isolated marshes decimated the crane population. &nbsp;  And, by 1941, there were only 21 wild birds and two captives in existence.  &nbsp;  Today the species is still on the endangered list, with only 300 whooping cranes in the world, and is carefully monitored.
