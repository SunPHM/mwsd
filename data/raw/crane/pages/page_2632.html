                        <p> This simple, unremarkable declaration, a mere 48 words, 
                          although heartily welcomed by many, was not a major 
                          event at the time. The press did not trumpet the news. 
                          There was no sense that this was the beginning of something 
                          that would produce immeasurable benefits for generations 
                          to come. Yet by affixing his signature, Roosevelt officially 
                          launched the National Wildlife Refuge System, which 
                          is the only network of federal lands dedicated to wildlife 
                          conservation. The refuge system is truly an American 
                          original. There is nothing else like it in the world. 
                          And now, during the refuge system&#8217;s centennial 
                          year, it is an especially fitting time for all Americans 
                          to take advantage of the wonders that refuges can provide.

                          America&#8217;s natural treasures. Its 538 refuges and 
                          thousands of waterfowl-production areas contain 95 million 
                          acres, an area larger than the National Park System 
                          and about the same size as the state of Montana. There 
                          are refuges in every state and many U.S. territories 
                          and possessions, and they range in size from the diminutive 
                          0.6-acre Mille Lacs National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), 
                          in Minnesota, to the enormous Arctic NWR, which extends 
                          over 19.6 million acres of the Alaskan landscape. The 
                          refuge system offers an impressive array of habitats&#8212;barrier 
                          islands, bogs, caves, coastal lagoons, coral reefs, 
                          deserts, estuaries, hardwood forests, islands, lakes, 
                          meadows, mountains, ponds, rocky coastlines, salt marshes, 
                          sand dunes, swamps, tall-grass prairies, and tundra. 
                          These habitats protect, nourish, replenish, and restore 
                          thousands of species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, 
                          fish, and plants, many of which are endangered and hanging 
                          on to survival by the weakest of threads. </p>

                          creating memories and hoping for a fish to bite. Hikers

                          and its many, at times competing, constituencies. Public 
                          and economic uses of refuges must be carefully designed 
                          and implemented to ensure that they are compatible with 
                          wildlife management goals. The spread of development 
                          and the corresponding decrease in the country&#8217;s 
                          reserves of wild and open spaces will place added pressures 
                          on the refuge system as people, weary of manufactured 
                          landscapes, seek out the pleasures that nature provides. 
                          While the refuge system should welcome more visitors,

                          need for funding will grow. Thus, even if efforts to
