size="5">erlin was a city of contrast and construction. The
skyline of the east was dominated by cranes, especially the
Potsdammer Platz, which was being slowly filled to the brim with
new, modern buildings. These newer buildings set off the older
buildings, or, those that were restored to how they originally
looked.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5"><img src="images/Statues.JPG"
width="540" height="405"></font><font size="4">Sometimes the
restored buildings would have original pieces, making the
building itself a contrast of old and new. This is not a
photography trick or digital enhancement, the statues at the top
were burned and blackened in the war, the statue on the bottom of
the picture is a reproduction, part of the acurate restoration.</font></p>

width="300" height="500">Here is another shot full of contrast.
In the foreground is a newer monument, in the background, you can
see again the blackened statues that survived the war. Further
back, in a building built to look older, is a Hilton Hotel,
another example of the USA's everpresence. Finally, the
farthest-back building is modern, playing no games, not trying to
&quot;fit in&quot; what so ever. </font></p>

a mistake. I like the directional contrast with the bridge.<img

was absolutely stunning, making the building impressive before
you even noticed the archetecture or artwork. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">The Fernsehturm (TV Tower) was an
easy landmark, and allowed you to get your bearings from almost
anywhere in this sprawling city. The contrasts of this city are
once again visible. If you look closely at the bottom of the
picture at left, the people and car can give you a nice size
reference. The wires hanging across the middle picture are for
the Strassenbahn, one of which is visible at the very bottom
(looks like a long yellow and white bus.) Only the former East
Berlin had these convienient forms of public transportation. </font></p>

construction have been the dominant feature of the East for
almost a decade now.</font></p>

that construction, on the outskirts of Potsdammer Platz.</font></p>
