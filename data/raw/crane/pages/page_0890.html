      <p>Planning and building a custom log home demands attention to many details 
        and options. To ensure our customers are thrilled with their complete 
        log home system, we perform a site analysis as we begin designing. Our 
        individually designed plans may be a combination of an existing plan and 
        your dreams or 100% your imagination.</p>
      <p>Natural full size Eastern White Pine logs averaging 18&#8221;-20&#8221; 
        butt diameter (larger sizes available) create structural integrity and 
        greater thermal performance. Your log home stays cool in the summer and 
        warm in the winter. </p>

      <p>Hand picked, hand peeled, hand scribed and hand cut equals a Timber
        Wolf Handcrafted original!</p>
      <p>Tree selection is critical for a well-built log home. We hand select 
        every log to ensure the best quality timber in our buildings. The logs 
        are hand peeled with a drawknife one pull at a time. Peeling is often 
        a taken for granted art that requires attention to the log and physical 
        strength, without a good peel the character of the log is lost. Take a 
        close look at the detail of our logs, we are confident you will be impressed 
        with the natural contours maintained after peeling.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/nz_trees.jpg" alt="New Zeeland Trees" width="220" height="280" border="1"><img src="images/kiln.jpg" alt="Kiln dried logs" width="220" height="280" border="1"></p>
      <p>In addition to producing handcrafted log homes using fresh-cut, Michigan-native
        Pine, we are pleased to offer our customers fully handcrafted log homes
        using kiln-dried Pine, Douglas Fir and Cedar. As one of only a select
        few handcrafters in the world to offer customers the option of kiln-dried
        logs, our log homes experience less shrinkage and less surface checking
        than homes built with air dried logs. Besides significantly reducing
        the adjustment period of the home, kiln-dried logs have the added benefit
        of simplifying subtrade construction and providing a log surface that
        is ready for staining. Like our fresh-cut logs our log homes are environmentally
        responsible and use tree length logs with sizes of over 20 inches in
        diameter.<br>
          <br>
          Immediately after peeling, our logs are treated with a non&#8211;toxic 
          coating to maintain their natural brightness and discourage any fungi 
          or molds. Nylon straps are then used to transport the log throughout the 
          building process, keeping that freshly peeled surface nice and smooth. 
          We take these extra steps to assure you the finest looking logs you can 
          find.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/groove.jpg" alt="Corner detail " width="433" height="286" border="1"></p>
      <p>We take great pride in our hand cut double scribed lateral grooves and 
        notches. Our attention to detail shows. Flexible and weather tight, we 
        run EPDM rubber gasket, imported from Sweden, along all long grooves and 
        notches. On site, natural wool insulation fills the long groove insuring 
        the best, least toxic weather barrier. Our double scribed long grooves 
        and notches provide an airtight fit lasting for generations to come.</p>

      <p>All window and door openings and exposed log end details are cut, ground 
        and beveled. Appropriate keyway splines (angle/iron) for windows and doors 
        are also included. Log drilling, mortising and necessary flats for electrical 
        box covers and fixtures are done in our log yard prior to shipping. We 
        supply and properly install through-bolts, adjustable screw jacks for 
        vertical posts and required steel for structural log work including plates 
        and washers.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/construction_yard.jpg" alt="Fully assembled in log yard " width="431" height="289" border="1"></p>
      <p>While most of the work to your log shell is completed in our log yard, 
        a few things are left to complete on site. Items such as slots for interior 
        walls, ceiling grooves and various roof details are better finished when 
        the shell is set on your site. </p>
      <p>Once your shell is completed in our yard, it is carefully loaded using 
        the same non-marring nylon straps.Our experienced drivers deliver your 
        log shell on our trucks and trailers.The reassembly of your Timber Wolf 
        Handcrafted Log Home is performed by the same crew who first built it 
        in the log yard.</p>
     
      <p align="center"><img src="images/construction_site.jpg" alt="Two cranes setting roof logs " width="432" height="285" border="1"></p>
      <p>Real log possess the beauty nature gave it &#8211; even if that means
        nature&#8217;s imperfections like burls, &#8220;cat faces&#8221; and
        scars. Timber Wolf Handcrafted Log Homes supplies and installs every
        log component of your log shell to insure quality and the precision necessary
        to make your home weather tight. Our solid reputation of quality workmanship
