Budapest! The train ride wasn't as smooth as we had hoped, but that's all right…we're 
in Budapest! We arrive around 9:30 AM with reservations again at the Strawberry 
Hostel, but this time with misgivings. We have heard from one of the Strawberry 
owners himself that this one was the worst of all the Strawberry hostels. So when 
a woman named Beata approaches us at the train station and offers us an apartment 
for rent, we're willing to see what she has to offer. She takes us to the apartment, 
helping us find an ATM and tickets for public transportation along the way. <IMG SRC="images/Beata.jpg" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="169" ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG SRC="images/Apartment2.jpg" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="144" ALIGN="LEFT">The 
apartment turns out to be a really good deal for only $30 a night, so we take 
it. Beata is a fountain of "Information!" as she puts it, and describes the city 
layout, what to watch out for, what to stay away from, and then points us to a 
great place for lunch. We eat stuffed mushrooms, chicken breast and potatoes, 
and beef stroganoff at the Blue Rose restaurant. (Incidentally, we are eating 
beef again with no qualms about Mad Cow Disease. We met some British and Irish 
medical and veterinarian students in Krakow, and they say it's fine for several 
reasons. Plus they eat it themselves.) After lunch we sleep off the train ride, 
waking a few hours later to go grocery shopping and take a walk down to the Danube 
River, drink coffee, and read our guidebooks. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wednesday,</FONT></B>

<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heavy construction is usually 
the mark of an improving economy, but this morning, it only serves as an ugly 
wake-up call RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW at 6:00AM. Joe cooks breakfast this morning 
(did we mention the apartment has a mini-kitchen?) which consists of sausage, 
pasta, peas and corn.<IMG SRC="images/DomeAtSunset.jpg" WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="141" ALIGN="RIGHT"> 
The food is cheap and more like home than anything we've eaten so far. After breakfast, 
we head down to the main square of the city to take a bicycle tour of Budapest. 
Lots of people are there for the walking tours, but only the two of us are taking 
the Bike Tour. It makes for a cozy tour, and Bea, our tour guide, is wonderful. 
We think the tour may have actually lasted an hour or two longer than normal because 
Bea patiently answered all of our questions and shared some personal stories of 
her own. Bea mentions that there is an international soccer game tonight between 
Hungary and Germany, so after the tour, we get tickets at the stadium. (No easy 
task thanks to surly ticket-people and our limited Hungarian language skills! 
But a friendly man who had once been to New York goes out of his way to help us 
out.) It's still a few hours before the game, so we walk home, take a break, make 
dinner, and chill. Then, around 8:00 PM, we take the ultra-crowded Metro back 
to the game. We are paranoid (unduly, it turns out) about the possible hoolaganism 
among the rowdy soccer fans, so we decide not to take our digital camera. Germany 
- one of the best soccer teams in the world - shows why they're so good. Although 
Hungary comes out extremely aggressive early in the game, with at least half a 
dozen shots on goal; Germany's stifling defense shuts them down shot after shot. 
After Hungary gets tired, they start to make mistakes and Germany easily takes 
advantage and skunks Hungary, 5 - 2. We leave the game 30 minutes early to avoid 
the throngs that are sure to descend on the Metro and fall quickly asleep at home 
by midnight. </FONT></P><P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thursday, 
August 16<BR></FONT></B> <FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
loud 6:00AM wake-up call by the construction crews makes sure we get an early 
start on the day. After another breakfast of our favorite sausage, peas, corn 
and pasta, we head out to spend most of the day looking for a new apartment. Tomorrow 
Beata will kick us out of our $30 apartment because a group of Italians had already 
reserved it for the Formula One racing event over the weekend, so we make a list 
of potential hostels and then spend hours checking them out. They all suck. Nasty 
places - one resident Joe cornered for an honest opinion actually said that small 
animals are rumored to roam the halls, but he had not yet seen any. Maybe he means 
cute little dogs, maybe he means rats. We're taking no chances - that hostel is 
scratched from the list. Another hostel is cheap but smells bad. Another cheap 
hostel is selling converted little janitor closets as "medium-sized" rooms. We 
couldn't have stood up together in this tiny room! This process takes all day 
long, and it's exhausting. We end up just calling Beata to see if she has another 
apartment close by, at the same price. She does! Mission accomplished. We decide 
we want a quiet night at home, so we rent a movie and buy some more groceries. 
The movie, Amadeus, does not work in the DVD player of our laptop computer. Actually, 
the video part works, but our laptop's DVD player does not have audio capabilities 
for some reason. Oh well … we'll watch movies when we get back to Texas. Instead, 
tonight, we spend the time doing some long-range planning on the trip, adjusting 
our calendars and still trying to figure out our Italian and Spanish itineraries. 
And, of course, we are kept entertained by the loud construction crews working 
late RIGHT OUTSIDE THE WINDOW until 10:00PM.</FONT> </P><P><B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Friday, 
August 17</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR> We 
get up early (loud…well, you know why). We stretch and make breakfast again. We 
have to move apartments this morning, and Beata shows up at 9:00 to take us to 
the next one. It's a half-mile or so closer to the city center, and appears to 
be on par with the last one. This one, she assures us, is quiet. No construction. 
Jenni runs off to buy a towel and other necessities while Joe naps. We meet at 
St. Stephen's Basilica to see a glorious interior along with their most prized 
possession: the gnarled 1000-year old right hand of St. Stephen himself which 
they keep on display in a little gold, glass cage. Eeeewww. We climb the steep 
staircase to the top and see a glorious view of Budapest…along with all the construction.<IMG SRC="images/ConstructionWide.jpg" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="192" ALIGN="LEFT"> 
We count eleven construction cranes along the skyline. After the tour, we go to 
the Blue Rose restaurant for delicious Beef Stroganoff. We read the "Budapest 
Sun," the English-language newspaper here which has some interesting, well-written 
stories. Don't know why we're sleepy, but we can barely move. It is warmer than 
we had thought it would be in Budapest; around 85 degrees. We head back to the 
apartment for a nap, and discover that it is indeed quiet…and also 95 degrees 
in the room! Since the windows are tucked into a corner and face the courtyard, 
there is very little breeze. After a 2-hour sweaty nap, we are miserable and seriously 
contemplate buying a fan. Just a little 10 dollar fan that we would find a way 
to stuff in our backpack or leave here when we're done. We actually go into a 
store to shop for a fan when we realize how absurd that is, (not buying it but 
carrying it around in our backpacks) so we reluctantly disregard the thought and 
walk down to the Danube river bank for a cup of coffee. We have a long talk with 
a waiter about Budapest, then check our e-mail and do some research on Romania. 
Afterwards, around 11:00PM, it's time for beer and a glass of wine at the Old 
Man's Blues bar. But there's no blues … the musicians had stopped playing at 10:30 
PM and the locals gather to drink and smoke an awful lot and attempt to dance 
techno on a tiny dance floor. Jenni takes a cold shower because of the oven-hot 
apartment … Joe decides to try and go straight to sleep but stays up most of the 
night an uncomfortable, sweaty mess.</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Saturday, 
August 18</B> <BR>We're having issues deciding when to do what in the town, so 
in a burst of compromise, we make a list of things we both want to accomplish 
in the next four days before we leave. Today the list includes making train reservations 
to Romania, a visit to one of the thermal baths, and listening to some Gypsy music.<IMG SRC="images/LionCastle.jpg" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="240" ALIGN="LEFT"> 
All goes well except the Gypsy music plan, which was supposed to happen at 9:00 
PM at a touristy restaurant with reasonable prices that promises the music plus 
some traditional dancing. We found this place in the morning and made reservations, 
but when we show up at 9:00, there is no music and no dancing. They have amnesia. 
First, they tell us they don't have any record of our reservations and then they 
tell us that, in order to hear music, we'll have to eat upstairs in the waaay-too-expensive 
restaurant. No thanks. We decide to just eat at the downstairs restaurant anyway. 
It's too late now to try and find another place, and we have no groceries. We 
probably embarrassed the manager in the process because, when the musicians from 
upstairs come down to our area, the manager points at our table. At first, it's 
sort of nice to see such a level of service, until we realize that this means 
we must tip big. The music was very good though.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<B>Sunday, August 19</B> <BR>We sleep late, then head to Statue Park, the virtual 
cemetery for the Communist statues that used to adorned Budapest. It's quite a 
distance out in the western suburbs, so we have to take two different buses, a 
feat which we accomplish with relative ease. We get back downtown by 4:00 PM. 
Yesterday's thermal bath outing was soooo relaxing we decide we have to go again 
today - it's only about $1 per person if you leave within four hours. Once again, 
it is wonderful and relaxing! Afterwards we meander down Andrassi Utca; Budapest's 
main boulevard lined with trees and embassies. Turns out that tonight is Buda-Fest, 
the last of a series of celebrations that commemorate the 1000th birthday of Hungary 
(tomorrow there will be fireworks). Organizers have shut down Andrassi for 6 or 
7 mini-concerts. Bands are playing on stages at every major intersection. We grab 
a schedule, pick out a few acts we want to see, and spend the next few hours before 
showtime wandering Margarit Island in the middle of the Danube River. The island 
is named for the young girl sent there by her father, a Hungarian King, who promised 
he would make her a nun and cloister her on the island if the Turks didn't decimate 
the city on one of their attacks. Margarit almost escaped a life of solitude - 
although the town was destroyed, it was not decimated. (Who decides the difference!?!?) 
<IMG SRC="images/GypsyBand.jpg" WIDTH="224" HEIGHT="121" ALIGN="LEFT">The guidebook 
recommends a good place to eat, and once again, the guidebook is right. We eat 
traditional Hungarian dishes of goulash, stuffed potato pancakes and chicken. 
The chicken dish Joe orders turns out to be fried … it does not say, "fried" on 
the menu, but it is so delicious that we decide we don't care! We stroll back 
up Andrassi Utca, wading through thick crowds. We stop first at the Opera House 
to hear the symphony, then move on to a small stage between a DJ playing Shaggy 
and a Hungarian 50's Rock 'n Roll band to watch and dance to an awesome display 
of Gypsy Swing Music. The music is still blaring loudly when we head home around 
1:30 AM. We both take ice cold showers and sleep soundly.</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Monday, 
August 20<BR></B> We're still a little unclear on our Romania plans, so we skip 
breakfast and hit the Internet café for a few hours for some research. We leave 
in time to get to St. Stephen's Basilica and stake out a good place to stand for 
the afternoon's High Mass. We end up with a dinner of absolute junk food we bought 
from street vendors as the entire city gears up hours in advance for the fireworks 
show at 9:00 PM. After standing in crushing crowds for three hours at the High 
Mass, we decided we didn't want to repeat that performance for the fireworks show. 
So we wandered up Gellert Hill overlooking the river in search of a good, (uncrowded) 
seated vantage point for the show. Who were we kidding? Hundreds of thousands 
of locals had already staked out the prime spots weeks earlier and had been camped 
there all day. Despite our best attempts, we end up packed shoulder-to-shoulder 
with thousands of Budapestians on Elizabeth Bridge. We wonder how much weight 
it would take to collapse this thing… The fireworks show was spectacular. Forty 
minutes later, as thousands of people herd down main boulevards towards home, 
the metro, and the city center, we head to a bar to get out of the crowds and 
watch the flow of people from the comfort of a chair, some beer and several glasses 
of wine for Jenni. An hour later people are still flowing by, but now relegated 
to the sidewalks as the streets have been reopened to traffic. We watch a pretty 
good guitar duo at the bar, finish our drinks and go home. An ice cold shower 
once again allows us to sleep throught the night.</FONT></P><P> <FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>Tuesday, 
August 21<BR></B> Today is our last day in Budapest. Around 10:15 AM, Beata brings 
new recruits to the apartment as we are leaving. We spend a few minutes giving 
them some tips about sightseeing around Budapest. We don't have the heart to tell 
them how hot the apartment gets. We don't want to embarrass Beata and, besides, 
it's still the best accommodation we could find for such a low price. We leave 
our packs at the left-luggage counter at the train station, which is a kind of 
baggage check where we get a ticket from an attendant. Beata says it's much safer 
than the lockers (did we mention she's a fountain of information?). Then we buy 
some picnic supplies in the tiniest grocery store a few blocks from the station. 
<IMG SRC="images/SpaghettiIce.jpg" WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="178" ALIGN="RIGHT">A picnic 
table in City Park is our restaurant for lunch, and we feed the leftover bread 
to the skittish pigeons. With 11 hours to kill before the train leaves tonight, 
we camp out near Hero's Square and take a leisurely nap (covered in OFF to thwart 
the mosquitoes). Later, we pick up some travel books mailed to us from Des Acosta 
in Prague (thanks, Des!) then eat some Spaghetti Eis, ice cream that looks like 
spaghetti (but tastes pretty good.) After ice cream, we stop by a computer store 
to see what's wrong with the audio system. They fix the problem in just a few 
minutes (to Jenni's monumental surprise!) and we are on our way. We then browse 
an English-language bookstore where Joe buys a book ("Virtual War" by Michael 
Ignatieff. It turns out to be an excellent book about the war in Kosovo). We then 
buy some postcards and a Budapest keychain, have a cup of coffee on the Danube 
and update the Web site. We buy two big bottles of water and some pretzels and 
get on our 11:30 PM train with plenty of time to spare. </FONT></P></TD><TD WIDTH="5" BGCOLOR="#FF9999"><P>&nbsp;</P></TD><TD WIDTH="80">&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE>
