<p div style="text-align:justify;">When we think of colors in Japan, three things come to mind,
Kabuki, Girls day, and TANABATA. Most of us know Tanabata, from what we see on supermarket
shelves, in shopping alleys, and at stations, with sprays of Sasaki with pieces of white
paper with kanji in combination with some other &quot;things&quot; dangling. But what
exactly is this, Tanabata. Tanabata is in fact a happy celebration - the only time of the
year, two mythological lovers can meet there in a far spot, in a place hard to beat for
romancing - in the Milky Way.</p>
<p div style="text-align:justify;">Some say that the name Tanabata is a compound word of Tana and Hata. Tana means shelf or trellis, and hata means weaving. In ancient times, a maiden serving the god of weaving had to weave a cloth for the god of weaving to drape on a shelf or trellis near a river or
lake. Others say that the word Tanabata has its origin from a mythological goddess.</p>
<center><img src="image/tanabata01.jpg" width=500 height=400 border=0></center>
<p div style="text-align:justify;">What we do know for sure is that Tanabata has its origin in China. However, Tanabata was first introduced to the Japanese during the Nara Period (710-784 AD). And in the Heien era (794-1192 AD.) it became a celebration for children and young girls wishing for
progress in sewing, weaving, calligraphy and other handicrafts.</p>
<center><img src="image/tanabata02.jpg" width=500 height=400 border=0></center>
<p div style="text-align:justify;">However, there are more than one explanation of the real origin of
Tanabata. Some say that it is the love story of a Herdsman, Aquila, and the weaver in the
star Vega, Shokujo (sometimes known as Orihime). Shokujo, or Orihime as she is also
called, was the weaver of the Emperor of Heaven. She was so occupied with her occupation,
making garments for the offspring of the Emperor of Heaven, that she had no leisure time
to take care of herself, or to weave garments for herself. However, God, the Emperor of
Heaven took care of her loneliness and married her off to the Aquila, a herdsman who dwelt
on the opposite side of the Celestial River, or the Milky Way. </p>
<p div style="text-align:justify;">But, as things happen when you fall in love, you tend to neglect what you are supposed to do, and that is just what happened to Shokujo. She neglected the weaving of the
garments for the Emperor of Heaven to the extend that the emperor got so angry that he
forbid her to see her husband, Aquila. Shokujo lost all hope and cried all day, and so the
Emperor, in order to comfort Shokujo, promised the young couple that they could meet once
a year on the 7<sup>th</sup> of the 7<sup>th</sup> month. And this became Tanabata.</p>
<center><img src="image/tanabata03.jpg" width=500 height=400 border=0></center>
<p div style="text-align:justify;">Another version of the story portrays them as ordinary people, mortals who got married at the ages of 12 and 15 and who died at the ages of hundred and three and ninety-nine respectively. After death, their spirits went up into the sky, to the place where the
Emperor of Heaven took his daily bath in the Milky Way. But no mortals are allowed to
pollute the Milky Way by human touch, except for the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the 7<sup>th</sup>
month, when the Emperor of Heaven is away to listen to the chanting of BuddhistScriptures.</p>

<p>The Manyoshu is an anthology of ancient poems of the Japanese language, published in
760 AD and one verse goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <i><p>The evening we meet<br>
  Tanabata is endless<br>
  Tomorrow starts another year</p>
  </i>
</blockquote>
