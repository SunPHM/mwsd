CONTENT="The USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center has held a        leading international position in wildlife research and management since its                                         founding in 1936 as America's first wildlife experiment station and research refuge.
In 1940 there were less than 20 whooping cranes alive in the world. Changes in habitat, egg collecting, and hunting almost led to its extinction. There are now 188 whoopers in that wild flock, another 100 in captivity, and over 60 in an experimental flock in Florida. This recovery was directly due to conservation efforts, scientific research, and changes in land management.
	Unique to North America, the whooping crane stands 5 feet tall with a long neck and long legs. Its pure white body feathers are accented by jet black wing-tips and a red-and-black head with a long, pointed beak. The wings measure about 8 feet across.
	Breeding whooping cranes in captivity at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center began in 1967 with 12 eggs collected from the wild flock.  The Patuxent flock currently has 44 adults, with 9 experienced breeding pairs who generally lay around 50 eggs a year in total. From these eggs last year, we raised 26 chicks most of which were released in Florida.  ">

      the wild. The plastic decoy in the right side of the picture is something
      they've seen since they were just a few days old. It looks like a whooping
      crane and is familiar, so when the chicks are brought to an unfamiliar
      place, planting a whooper decoy will encourage the chicks to stay in a
      safe area. (The white object in the center of the picture is the pond's
      drainpipe.)<br>

      <p ALIGN="CENTER">Whooper chicks -- growing up fast!</p>
      </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">
      <p>It's hard to believe how fast whooper chicks grow, even when you're
      there to watch it happen every day. It's especially obvious in June, when
      the early chicks are nearly grown and we're still hatching new ones. We've
      got whooper chicks in two different buildings now -- the propagation
      building aviary houses the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP)
      chicks, the ones who will learn to migrate behind an ultralight aircraft,
      and the crane chick building holds the chicks destined to go to the
      non-migratory flock in Florida. Some of the chicks going to the
      non-migratory flock are also raised in the field by whooping crane parents
      in a process we call &quot;parent-rearing.&quot;</p>
      <p>In less than 50 days, the oldest chick, produced from an egg brought
      from the San Antonio Zoo, has gone from a tiny, wet bundle weighing around
      140 grams, to a stately bird almost 3 feet tall, weighing 2 kilos. And
      that's only about half grown. The chicks still have to finish growing
      their flight feathers, and they'll get a lot taller yet. The WCEP chicks
      will be sent to Wisconsin before they can fly, so they can get more
      training in following the ultralight, and get used to the environment that
      will someday, we hope, be their breeding grounds. There are 18 chicks in
      the WCEP program, and they'll be sent in separate groups, by age, since
      some are much older than others.</p>
      <p>While the WCEP chicks are being trained to follow the ultralight and
      are being taken out to the ponds to learn how to roost and forage, the
      chicks slated for the non-migratory flock are still hatching. They need
      much the same care and exercise as the WCEP chicks, but they don't have to
      learn to follow planes. Not all the non-migratory birds are
      costume-reared. Because they don't have to follow planes in flight, and
      therefore, don't have to have a close relationship with costumed
      technicians, some of the chicks are raised by whoopers. Parent-reared
      chicks have to be monitored closely to make sure they're gaining weight
      properly and are healthy, just like costume-reared chicks. However, that's
      quite a bit more difficult when you have to confront an angry pair of
      protective whooper parents determined to keep their chick safe from <u>you</u>.
      Parent-reared chicks grow up to be very wild.</p>

      their chick has already taken its first flight, at a younger age than
      Lucky did. The chick is about three months old. Both of Lucky's parents

      all white now, having lost his juvenile plumage.</p>
      <p>Another whooper pair is raising a chick which is now over 57 days old
      and doing well. We're all anxiously waiting to hear that this chick has
      taken his first flight! Photos of this chick can be seen on the WCCA's
      website. There is a third pair with a living chick, also.</p>
      <p>The biologists in Florida have found 7 nests this year. Some have
      failed, unfortunately, and some pairs have already lost their eggs or
      chicks, but some pairs are still sitting eggs and one pair has made a
      second nest and laid a second clutch of eggs after losing their first

      <p ALIGN="left"><font FACE="Times New Roman"><font color="#800080">June
      10, 2003: We currently have 28 very active whooper chicks ranging in ages
      from 2 days old to the oldest at 50 days old. Eighteen of the birds are
      being trained for the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP) migration
      project. All 18 have had extensive exposure to the ultralight plane as
      part of their &quot;ground school&quot; training, and are following well.
      Because the chicks all hatch a different times, they are grouped in
      similar ages for training. The 10 oldest chicks are scheduled to be
      shipped to Wisconsin very soon. Because of age differences, this group
      will be treated as two different cohorts, until they all mature further
      and the age differences aren't as significant. The last eight, which are
      still quite young, will be sent after they've gotten older. The weather
      has continued to be a challenge as the East Coast has experienced more
      unseasonably cool, rainy days that have negatively impacted the chicks' exercise and
      training regimens.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#800080">There are currently 10 whooper chicks scheduled
      for the Florida non-migratory release program. These are the youngest
      chicks at Patuxent, and the oldest of them is about two weeks of age. Six
      of the chicks are being costume-reared and 4 are being parent-reared by
      whooping crane pairs. All 10 chicks are currently thriving.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#800080">Current whooping crane egg production is 51 eggs
      from 10 producing females. Thirty eggs are fertile. Twenty-six eggs
      hatched. In addition, 2 eggs sent from the San Antonio Zoo, and 1 egg sent
      from the International Crane Foundation also hatched. One whooper chick
      slated for the WCEP program died, apparently from peritonitis; we are
      speculating that might have been caused by the thorny-headed worm [<i>Acanthocephalans
      sp. --</i> More information on this parasite can be found on line in
      &quot;Cranes: Their Biology, Husbandry, and Conservation&quot; at <a href="http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/resshow/gee/cranbook/cranebook.htm">http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/resshow/gee/cranbook/cranebook.htm</a>&nbsp;
      in Chapter 8: Medicine &amp; Surgery]. There is another whooper egg
      scheduled to hatch within the week, and the fertility of the last egg is
      still unknown.</font></p>
