    <h1>Origami</h1>

<p>My father introduced me to <a href="http://www.origami.vancouver.bc.ca/Info/intro.php">Origami</a> -the japanese art of paper folding- when I was very young. I think it was mainly because my parents really needed something to give them a break from a very talkative wee son. I could entertain myself with square paper for hours. </p>

<p>My favourite fold is a <a href="images/dancers.jpg">man and woman dancing</a> (accredited to Neal Elias - USA). It uses one piece of square paper which is white on one side and coloured on the other. </p>

<p>I've created one fold myself sofar. It's a two-colour standing dragon folded from one square.(<a href="images/dragon1.jpg">image1</a>, <a href="images/dragon2.jpg">image2</a>) I created the first version in 1998. I thank my school friend Inga Johnsen who pointed out that the bat I was trying to create looked more like a dragon when help upside down. The final version was born in 2003 when I reviseted the model and re-did the base to give me two disconnected arms and legs.</p>

<p>For the illostrated model I used hand-made "fluffy" paper with kitchen foil glued to one side. I hope to be able to publish the diagrams in near future.</p>

<p>My favourite Origami Website is <a href="http://www.origami.vancouver.bc.ca/">Joseph Wu's Origami Page</a> as well as the online copy of the first ever Origami book for amusement <a href="http://www.origami.gr.jp/Model/Senbazuru/index-e.html">Hidden Senbazuru Orikata</a>. I was very pleased with myself when I managed to figure out the fold of the <a href="http://www.origami.gr.jp/Model/Senbazuru/S12-1.jpg">crane with many cranes piled on his back</a> described in Hidden Senbazuru Orikata.

<p>(my flatmate Damian was kind enought to take the pictures for me)</p>
