An update on what has happened to three of these species over the past two decades illustrates that recovery is usually possible, although not inevitable.</P></FONT><FONT FACE="ITCGarMM_300 LT 625 NO" SIZE=4><P><IMG SRC="b0vc01m.gif" ALT="Image" WIDTH=135 HEIGHT=121> . . . <B>Everglade Snail Kite (<A HREF = "/birds1.html#Lnk0v"><i>Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus</i></A>)</B></P><P>The August 1976 issue of the <i>Endangered Species Technical Bulletin</i> reported in 1976 that the recovery plan for this bird would be released shortly. The account discussed components of the plan and research indicating that Lake Okeechobee was a significant gathering and nesting area, particularly in drought years.</P><P>The population of the Everglade snail kite has stabilized since 1976 and apparently increased, particularly in the past two years, due in part to wet habitat conditions. Since the 1976 article, the recovery plan has been finalized and has undergone four revisions. While the kite was primarily restricted to an area south of Lake Okeechobee 20 years ago, it has reestablished itself in much of its historic range. Kites are now found breeding and feeding in the Kississimmee Chain of Lakes area and the marshes of the Upper St. Johnþs River. Annual snail kite surveys from 1969 to 1978 indicated population counts of 65 to 267 birds. In the 1990's, surveys produced counts of from 378 to 996 individuals. </P><P>Research has shown that population fluctuations are synchronized with drought/flood cycles, but the species does appear to be resilient and the population seems to be increasing. Radio-tracking studies conducted by University of Florida researchers have shown that snail kites will travel long distances to where their main food source, the apple snail, can be readily found. University researchers also have begun studies on the apple snail itself, and on the effects of natural and human-caused drydowns on their abundance. While the kite still needs ESA protection, the FWS is working on identifying criteria for reclassifying this bird to the improved category of threatened. </P><P><IMG SRC="sandhill.gif" WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=125> . . .<A NAME="b4n"></A><B>Mississippi Sandhill Crane (<A HREF = "/birds1.html#Lnk4n"><i>Grus canadensis pulla</i></A>)</B></P><P>From 1929 to the early 1990's, the nonmigratory Mississippi sandhill crane population had fallen to fewer than 100 individuals. The 1976 account on the Mississippi sandhill crane mentioned that the draft recovery plan recommended establishing an 11,000-acre (4,450-hectare) refuge for this subspecies. It also indicated that pending litigation involving an interstate highway project could impact the refuge project. The recovery plan was expected to recommend maintaining the captive breeding program at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland for 10 years as well as the reintroduction of cranes into their former range.</P><P>Since the 1976 article, a recovery plan has been finalized and undergone three revisions. The pending litigation mentioned in the original article was settled in favor of the FWS and supported protection of the crane. Over the last 20 years, the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge has been established and now protects over 19,250 acres (7,790 ha). The captive breeding program has continued, and although the Patuxent flock has been disbanded, breeding flocks now exist at the Audubon Institute/Species Survival Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, and at the White Oak Conservation Center in Yulee, Florida. These cooperative efforts are producing young birds for release into the wild. Reintroduction efforts have proceeded since the early 1980's. The crane population at the refuge has grown to about 120 birds. While there have been some contaminant and predation problems along the way, this subspecies continues to forge ahead, and the outlook for recovery looks good. </P><P><IMG SRC="b04c01m.gif" ALT="Image" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=125> . . . <B>Dusky Seaside Sparrow (<i>Ammodramus maritimus nigrescens</i>)</B></P><P>The 1976 article said that a draft recovery plan indicated an immediate need to acquire 3,000 acres (1,214 ha) of habitat southwest of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. Habitat management was also recommended, and it was believed that it might be possible to extend the range of this songbird across the St. John's River.</P><P>The FWS subsequently established the St. Johns National Wildlife Refuge. Unfortunately, a precipitous decline in the population was already underway. By 1980 only 4 singing males could be found. The decline in the bird's population was attributed to habitat fragmentation and degradation. </P><P>In 1980, a captive breeding program was established to perpetuate the species, but no female "duskies" could be located. Intercrossing with a closely related subspecies yielded several offspring, but it was believed that these progeny were not eligible for ESA protection because of their hybrid origin and could not be released into the wild. On June 16, 1987, the last dusky seaside sparrow died and the subspecies became extinct. In spite of attempts by a coalition of agencies and groups including the FWS, Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, Florida Museum of Natural History, Florida Audubon Society, Santa Fe Community College Teaching Zoo, and Walt Disney World's Discovery Island, the dusky was lost. </P><HR WIDTH=50><A NAME="Richard Hannan"></A><I><P>Richard Hannan is Chief of the Branch of Information Management, Division of Endangered Species, in Washington, D.C.</I></P></FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica Black" SIZE=2><P><A HREF="#TOP">^ [TOP]</A></P><A NAME="sidebar"></A><P><B>Ilustrations are USFWS file images: the snail kite photo by Paul W.
