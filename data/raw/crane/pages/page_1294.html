<p><i>Schloss Charlottenburg</i>. It is the old summer house for the kings
of Prussia. The castle is
<br>called the way it is because the central part has been built by Sophie-Charlotte
<br>(well not herself personally), Frederick Ist's mother. Since then,
it has been enlarged many
<br>times and the front is not 500m long. It has been nearly completely
destroyed during
<br>the bombardments of 1943 (the pre-"chirurgical" strikes), and has been
restored with
<br>newly acquired furniture (only a few blackened statues were left).
<br><img SRC="berlin01.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>Part of the visit is made with slippers so that the tourists don't damage
the wooden floor!
<br>Photos inside forbidden, so I have nothing to show for it.
<br><img SRC="berlin02.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p><img SRC="berlin03.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>From the back, in the French garden.
<br><img SRC="berlin04.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>In one corner of the park, the is a belvedere with an exposition of
porcelain.
<br><img SRC="berlin05.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p>And at another corner, there is a mausoleum where
<br>Frederic-Wilhelm III and queen Louise are buried.
<br><img SRC="berlin06.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p><img SRC="berlin07.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p><i>Brandenburger Tor</i>. It is the infamous border between West and
Est Berlin.
<br>The new French embassy built by Christian de Porzampac will be close
to the door.
<br><img SRC="berlin08.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>The Wall has disappeared soon after the opening of the border in 1990.
<br>However, in front of the <i>Reichtag</i>, we can see a line where it
was standing.
<br><img SRC="berlin09.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p><i>Reichtag</i>. In 1991 (one year after the border between Est and
West was open),
<br>the German deputies voted to move the parliament from Bonn to Berlin.
The new
<br>parliament has opened in 1999. You can even see some of the sessions
behind a
<br>glass wall (a symbol of transparency I guess).
<br><img SRC="berlin10.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>You can go on the roof where there is a glass dome, but you have to
deserve it and queue.
<br><img SRC="berlin11.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>The glass dome. I don't know how the Germans see it, but it reminds
me of the infamous
<br>Louvre pyramid. It is as weird and out of place.
<br><img SRC="berlin12.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>From the roof, you can see all of Berlin. Berlin is a gigantic construction
site.
<br>Apparently, the Germans have decided to destroy the center of Berlin
after the
<br>reunification, and rebuild it. I was told you can see 31 cranes from
here.
<br><img SRC="berlin13.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>This is the communication tower used by West-Berlin to communicate with
West-Germany
<br>when before reunification. Apparently, Est-Germans understood well
what the problem
<br>with radio transmissions was, and they listened to all transmissions
going through the tower.
<br><img SRC="berlin14.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p>On the shore of lakes in the West of Berlin, there are many strange
looking
<br>castles.
<br><img SRC="berlin15.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p><img SRC="berlin16.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p><img SRC="berlin17.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p><img SRC="berlin18.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p>I saw the bridge where spies were exchanged between the West and the
Est!
<br><img SRC="berlin19.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>When Germany was divided, this church was neither in West-Germany, neither
<br>in Est-Germany. As it was in the no man's land, nobody could go there.
Therefore
<br>it's been abandoned for 30 years, and has just been restored.
<br><img SRC="berlin20.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>In the <i>Kurf&uuml;rstendamm</i> area. This strange looking church
is the
<br>Keiser-Wilhelm-Ged&auml;chtniskirche (memorial to Keiser Wilhelm).
It's also known
<br>as the hollow tooth. The church has extensively damaged during WWII.
It is now a
<br>place of exhortation and commemoration. The hexagonal tower next to
the church is the
<br>new church.
<br><img SRC="berlin21.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p>This tower is the TV tower. It must be the best known landmark in Berlin.
<br><img SRC="berlin22.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p>I think it's the Marx-Engels forum, but I'm not sure.
<br><img SRC="berlin23.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>This is the St Nicholas church in old Berlin. It's the oldest church
in Berlin (the
<br>foundations date back to 1280). It is easily recognizable with its
donkey hat like
<br>towers.
<br><img SRC="berlin24.jpg" height=512 width=384>
<p>This is a street of old Berlin (<i>Nikolaiviertel</i>). It has been
destroyed during WWII, and has
<br>been reconstructed on its 750th anniversary.
<br><img SRC="berlin25.jpg" height=384 width=512>
<p>As I said, the wall has almost entirely disappeared. Most of it has
been sold
<br>by Est-Germany who was the legal owner (for 1000000 DM). I found this
piece, saved by
<br>Reverent Fischer on the side of his presbyter.
