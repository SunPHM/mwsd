After a late start due to fog, but the cranes and planes got airborne and traveled another 20 miles! They left
			Hamilton County, FL at 9:19 a.m. and landed at 10:05 at stop 21 in Suwannee County, FL. They've come a total distance
			of 1099.6 miles, and the team again revised their earliest expected arrival date to Thursday, November 29. They're
			not at a good location, so may move on. We'll update today's report as necessary.<BR>
			<BR>
			Pilot Joe Duff wrote on Saturday, &quot;For the next four days the winds are forecast to blow out of the south.
			We no longer think in terms of 60 to 70 mile legs but would be content with half that distance. This morning, after
			three days on the ground, we waited for the fog to clear and took-off in headwinds and haze. The temperature and
			winds aloft were higher than on the ground so we kept the birds low to keep them cool and make the best speed possible.
			Just over the trees the turbulence was rough but we maintained a ground speed of 35mph or better. Three birds surfed
			on each wing as we passed over private homes on a Saturday morning. It is a common sight to see a homeowner standing
			in his backyard sipping coffee as we approach. The reaction is predictable as he drops his coffee and dashes for
			the back door. As we pass by the house, husband, wife and kids, still dressed in pajamas, charge out the front
			door with cameras in hand.&quot;<BR>

			<P>Today's photo shows the young cranes surfing on the wing of the ultralight, as Joe described above. Their wild
			crane cousins made the journey south by riding on thermals, but the new reintroduced Eastern flock had no adult
			cranes to show them the way. Although an ultralight aircraft can't ride thermals like the wild cranes did, it CAN
			provide the cranes following it with a little help. Enjoy our lesson on Flight Formation, which includes a fun
			comparison of Giant Canada Geese, wild sandhill cranes and wild whooping cranes. The lesson's facts and chart will
			help you answer these questions:
			<BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>1.Why do you think wild cranes fly on thermals while wild geese do not? <BR>
				2.Why do you think geese follow landmarks while cranes do not? <BR>
				3.Why do you think geese fly in 'V' formation while cranes do not? <BR>
				4.Why can geese following an ultralight cover more miles per day than cranes can?
