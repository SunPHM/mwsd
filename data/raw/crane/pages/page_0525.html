      <p>Nearly since the dawn of the nuclear age, Paducah, Ky., has laid claim 
        to one of the nation's most strategic functions&#8212;uranium enrichment. 
        The U.S. government opened the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1952 
        to manufacture enriched uranium to fuel military reactors and to produce 
        nuclear weapons. </p>
        <p>
        As nuclear power became a more widely used source of energy, the plant 
        changed its mission in the 1960s and began to enrich uranium for commercial 
        reactors to generate electricity. </p>
        <p>
        The plant today is the only uranium enrichment facility in the United 
        States. It employs more than 1,200 people locally. But a need for a new 
        facility using a more efficient method of enrichment has put the future 
        of the Paducah plant in jeopardy. Although one plant official says, "Paducah 
        continues to be the heart of the company's business," the 
        question has arisen, "For how much longer?" As community leaders 
        rally to keep uranium enrichment in Paducah's economic arsenal, 
        they also have begun to seek other prospects. </p>
        <p>
        <span class="subhead">"It Ain't Over"</span></p>
        <p>The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion
        Plant is owned by the U.S. Department of  Energy and is leased and operated
        by the United States Enrichment Corp. 
        (USEC). The plant, which competes with companies in other nations, sells
         nuclear fuel to about one-half the U.S. market and one-third of the
        world 
        market. While USEC uses the older gaseous diffusion process, its international
         competitors employ a more efficient centrifuge process to enrich uranium.</p>
        <p>
        USEC recently announced that it will switch to centrifuge technology, 
        which will require building a new facility to replace the existing Paducah 
        operation. That new $1.5 billion, 500-job plant will be located either 
        in Paducah or near USEC's facility in Portsmouth, Ohio, where the 
        company maintains certain operational and administrative functions. USEC 
        will announce its decision next year. Some feel, however, that the handwriting 
        is on the wall, based on the company's decision late last year to 
        build a centrifuge demonstration facility near Portsmouth in the town 
        of Piketon, about 30 miles north.</p>

          <td class="caption"><p>Uranium is a natural element found in the ground
               in certain parts of the world. It contains mostly U-235 and U-238
              
            isotopes. Only the U-235 isotope is fissionable, or capable of being
               split in order to release large amounts of energy in the form
              of heat
              that a nuclear reactor can use for fuel. Enrichment is the process
               of increasing the concentration of U-235 and decreasing that of
              U-238. 
              The amount of the U-235 isotope is normally enriched from 0.7 percent
               of the uranium mass up to about 5 percent.</p>
            <p>Two methods are used
              to enrich uranium: gaseous diffusion and centrifugal
               force. In gaseous diffusion, natural uranium is heated to about
              135 
              degrees Fahrenheit in order to form a gas. As this gas flows under
               pressure through a very fine filter, the lighter U-235 isotopes
              are 
              separated from the heavier U-238. In centrifuge&#8212;a cheaper and
               more efficient process&#8212;the two isotopes are separated by
               weight through a spinning process. Significantly more U-235 enrichment
               can 
              be obtained from a single unit gas centrifuge than from a single
             unit  gaseous diffusion barrier. </p></td>

      <p>"The competition seemed more wide open before the test facility 
        announcement," says Georgann Lookofsky, public affairs manager at 
        the USEC plant. "Some people believe that at this point we may be 
        out of the running. But I don't know that for sure. I think it's 
        still a viable competition."</p>
        <p>
        One of Paducah's handicaps is that it sits within the New Madrid 
        seismic zone. The cost to build a new plant in Paducah would be substantially 
        higher than to do so in Ohio because of the need to strengthen the infrastructure 
        to withstand an earthquake. </p>
        <p>
        "That is a hindrance, but it's not an immovable obstacle," 
        Lookofsky says. "You can engineer a building that is seismically 
        sound and adequate, but it does increase the costs and time that you need 
        to deploy operations."</p>
        <p>
        Paducah's economic development officials are not conceding anything 
        yet. </p>
        <p>
        "To borrow a phrase from Yogi Berra, 'It ain't over 
        till it's over,'" says Mark Edwards, outgoing president 
        of the Greater Paducah Economic Development Council. "The next round 
        of proposals will be coming soon, and we intend to be very aggressive 
        with respect to our bid for the full commercial plant," he says, 
        referring to incentives that local, state and federal officials will present 
        to the company. </p>
        <p>
        Says Ken Wheeler, Edwards' successor as chair of the council and 
        head of a local nuclear energy task force: "The Portsmouth announcement 
        was a wake-up call for the community, but we didn't view it in a 
        negative sense. I think it reinforced our efforts to still go after the 
        full-scale centrifuge plant, and we have been doing that very diligently." 
        </p>
        <p>
        Whatever the final decision, the Paducah plant will remain open for at 
        least another eight to 10 years. In fact, USEC in recent years has been 
        consolidating some of its operations in Paducah. The company ceased enrichment 
        operations in Portsmouth in 2001, making Paducah the only production site. 
        Last year, USEC moved its transfer and shipping functions from Portsmouth 
        to Paducah. In addition, the company has spent about $80 million in seismic 
        and security upgrades at the Paducah plant since 1998. </p>
        <p>
        <span class="subhead">Rivers, Ice Cream and ... Cars?</span></p>
        <p>It seems
        fitting for a place nick-named "Quilt City, USA" 
        (Paducah is home to the National Quilt Museum) to understand that it
        can't  depend on just one company for its vitality, but rather on a patchwork
        
        of diverse industries. Although the USEC plant has an enormous economic
         impact in western Kentucky&#8212;by one estimate, second only to the
         Fort  Campbell Army base&#8212;other companies maintain a strong presence
         in  and around Paducah. </p>

      <p>McCracken County's largest employer, Ingram Barge Co., is one of 
        more than 20 towing companies based in Paducah, which rests on the banks 
        of the confluence of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers. </p>
        <p>
        One of Paducah's most unusual and fastest-growing companies is Dippin' 
        Dots Inc. Its tiny, bead-shaped ice cream is sold at more than 2,000 outlets&#8212;including 
        malls, festivals, theme parks and stadiums&#8212;in nearly 20 countries. 
        The company is investing $6.5 million in an expansion that will double 
        production capacity and triple storage capacity. With just a handful of 
        employees, Dippin' Dots moved its headquarters and production facility 
        from southern Illinois to Paducah in 1990. Now, the company employs 170 
        in town. </p>
        <p>
        "Having our home plant in Paducah has certainly served us well over 
        the years," says Terry Reeves, corporate communications director 
        at Dippin' Dots. "The city and county have worked with us 
        on financing construction projects and providing a good work force, utilities, 
        services and transportation."</p>

        Economic developers want to attract large manufacturers, too. The region 
        is hoping to join nearby areas like Georgetown, Ky., and Spring Hill, 
        Tenn., in luring an auto manufacturer to town. </p>
        <p>
        To help turn that dream into reality, eight western Kentucky counties&#8212;which 
        make up an area known as the Jackson Purchase&#8212;have combined to throw 
        their support behind a 4,200-acre industrial park in Graves County, one 
        county south of Paducah. </p>
        <p>
        Bill Beasley, manager of the Purchase Area Regional Industrial Authority 
        Inc., says the eight counties have agreed on a revenue-sharing plan from 
        which they would all benefit if a large company moves to the park. </p>
        <p>
        "When USEC made the announcement that it was going to build the 
        pilot plant in Piketon, it pretty much made the regional industrial park 
        the No. 1 priority for the area," Beasley says. </p>
        <p>
        Beasley adds that the goal is to attract a company that would offer a 
        minimum of 2,000 jobs. He says the industrial authority is in contact 
        with consultants in the site selection business for automotive firms. 
        Although Beasley would not comment on any specific company, the president 
        of one automaker, Mitsubishi, announced in February that his company needs 
        to build a new plant in North America to meet increased demand.</p>

        As the Paducah area prepares to embark on an uncertain economic course, 
        the development council's Edwards says that the community is taking 
        a "glass is half full" approach. </p>
        <p>
        "I just can't see us wringing our hands for the next 10 years 
        wondering, 'Oh my gosh, what's going to happen?'" 
        he says. "We are concerned, but we're determined that we're 
        going to overcome. Whether the USEC plant stays or goes, we're prepared 
        for the future."</p>
