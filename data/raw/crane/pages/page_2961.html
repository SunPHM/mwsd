<P>Having worked with various groups in the field and spent much
time outdoors during the past several weeks, I continue to be
amazed at the incredibly large number of butterflies on the wing
this June.  One scientific writer, describing this unusual
phenomenon, indicated that this may occur only three or four
times every century.

<P>More than one person has asked me, &quot;How can a person get
a close look at, for example, an American lady butterfly, when
they are always flying around!  Or they take off before you can
approach closely enough to get a good look.&quot;

<P>Surely one could use a butterfly collecting net, capture one,
enjoy it from really close range, and then release it.  But how
many people have a butterfly net?  Another rather unusual way to
see one from extremely close range is to examine the grill in
front of your car’s radiator.  You may be surprised at the number
of flattened butterflies you have accidentally and
unintentionally killed.

<P> Perhaps you would look rather silly, and even suspicious,
walking through the parking lot of a shopping mall, examining the
radiator grills of the cars!  But believe me, you will discover
plenty of not only American lady butterflies there but others as
well.  I shudder to think of the millions upon millions of moths
and butterflies that are done away with daily in our country by
motor vehicles.

<P>Examine the underside of a hind wing of an American lady and
you will discover that it contains two neatly spaced
&quot;bulls-eye&quot; patterns, or eyespots, referred to as
ocelli (o-CELL-i) near the margin of the wing.  Its close
relative, the painted lady butterfly, will have four smaller
black ocelli that are blue in the center.

<P>It was while I was still working at the Ridges Sanctuary that
we were in the process of a three-year insect study of the
general area and were developing a permanent collection.  The
idea was to have the collection provide good base-line insect
data for future studies’ comparisons.

<P>A letter from one of our members expressed objections to
developing the insect collection, the thought being -- how can
you call this a sanctuary when you take the lives of some of the
creatures that live there?  The answer I gave was, &quot;Our
total collection, accumulated over a three-year period, would
amount to a small fraction of all the insects, moths and
butterflies included, killed by automobiles driving between
Baileys Harbor and Sturgeon Bay in a 24-hour period.&quot;  We
were extremely selective in collecting the insects and never
tried to see how many of one kind we could obtain.

<P>It was about three weeks ago that I began to notice large
 swarms of small, blackish, hairy caterpillars feeding on the
 stinging nettle leaves north of our garden.  I knew immediately
 that they were the larvae of the Milbert’s tortoise-shell
 butterflies.  Had they been those of red admiral butterflies
 they would have been existing singly, not in clusters on the
 leaves.  However, both species do lay their eggs on the nettles,
 and I have also recently observed some red admiral females busy
 laying their eggs in the nettle patch.

<P>The Milbert’s tortoise-shell larvae resulted from eggs laid by
one of the females that over-wintered as an adult, as all
Milbert’s do, and was perhaps seen by us in late March before the
last of the snow had melted.  Finally, after the stinging nettles
had grown to the desired height and plenty of leaves had
developed, the eggs were laid.

<P>There will be a total of three broods of Milbert’s
 tortoise-shells this summer.  The females of the last brood will
 be bred this summer and will carry tiny &quot;packets&quot; of
 sperm cells within their abdomens.  Keep in mind that they will
 spend the winter as adults, perhaps within a wood pile or behind
 a loose slab of tree bark.  Next spring, when the stinging
 nettles poke out of the ground, each of the females, now upwards
 of nine to ten months old, will deposit nearly 700 eggs, in
 clusters of 30 to 40, on the plants.  The eggs will be
 fertilized as they leave the females’ bodies.  Shortly
 thereafter the females die, leaving only the eggs and then the
 larvae remaining to represent the species.

<P>By all means, allow some stinging nettles to grow on your
property, maintain a colorful butterfly garden, and develop an
on-going kinship, a deeper appreciation of the interdependence of
all living things.  You’ll be glad you did, and so will the
Milbert’s tortoise-shells.
