<b>Seminole County</b> is known for its natural beauty.  <img src="graphics/blkwhtbird-cranes.jpg" width=267 height=284 align="left" border=1 alt="">The lakes, lush tropical growth, pine
and oak trees, clean, fresh air; these are the things that make living here special, and one of the
most desirable areas to live in Central Florida.<br>
<p>
<b>There are seven incorporated communities</b> in Seminole County: Altamonte Springs,
Casselberry, Lake Mary, Longwood, Oviedo, Sanford and Winter Springs. Sanford is the county
seat.</p>
<p>
<b>Seminole has some of the finest</b> residential neighborhoods to be found in Central Florida. The Seminole County school system is rated number one in the state of Florida. You'll, also, find a wide variety of
recreational, cultural, and civic activities in Seminole County.</p>
<p>
<b>Seminole is one of the fastest</b> growing county's in Florida, and also one of the
smallest in size, 321 square miles. </p>
<p>
<b>Seminole is located</b> in the northwest area of Greater Orlando. The western boundary is
the Wekiva River, to the north Lake Monroe, to the east the St. John's River and to the south
Orange County.</p>
<p>
<b>Although there is great commercial expansion underway,</b> Seminole County is
predominantly a residential community.  About 70% of Seminole residents work outside the county.</p> 
<p>
<b>Seminole, is one of the fastest growing</b> communities in the United States, due to its great economic potential and excellent quality of life. It is also one of the most affluent communities, with a median household (effective buying income-EBI) income of $40,549.  Seminole County has 37.1% with an EBI of $50,000; 21.4% with EBI of $35,000 to $49,900; and 22% with EBI of $20,000 to $34,900. </p>
<p> It is a young community, with 35% of the population under 25, and 69% under 45 years of age.</p>

<p><IMG src="graphics/gld-lin.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="2" ALT="ender"></p>

<b><h3><font size="+1"><a name= "growth">Growth</a></font></h3></b>

<b>Commercial and residential expansion is in full bloom!</b><br>
<p>
 <p>This is a high growth area.</p>
<p>
<b>The Central Florida Regional Airport</b>, east of the GreenWay's Lake Mary Blvd. exit in Sanford,has international arrival and departure terminals.
 There is an access road to the GreeneWay.  Like Orlando International Airport,
 the Central Florida Airport was a former military base and features "runways that can handle any kind of air traffic.</p> 
<p>
<b>The Seminole Town Center,</b> completed in the fall of 1995 is a 1.2 million square foot mall. 
The mall, off of I-4 and Route 46 in Sanford is the second largest enclosed mall in Florida, Altamonte Mall is the first. Both are in Seminole County.</p>
<p>This is one of the hottest areas in the Metro Orlando area right now. The I-4 and Route 46 corridor is home to major construction of retail businesses and new home communities. It is ideally located: A 30 minute drive into Orlando, 35 minutes to Daytona Beach, I-4 and the Seminole Town Center at your doorstep, major companies in Lake Mary a few minutes away; Yes! An ideal location!</p>
<p><b>Each city in the county</b> is taking an active role in its economic development, paying special attention to their downtown areas.
 See City information for more details.</p>
<p>
<b>Although, retail and construction</b> are the bright lights of Seminole's economy, it is attracting more corporate headquarters and hi-tech companies.
 Agriculture still
plays an important role.

<b><h3><font size="+1"><a name="History">Brief History</a></font></h3></b>

<b>Seminole County's</b> history is wonderfully colorful.  It is full of Indian uprisings, river boat gamblers and military bastions.<br>
<p>
<b>The English</b> were the first to inhabit the area in the 1770's.  They settled in plantations along what is now the Lake Jessup area.</p>
<p>
<b>After the American Revolution</b> the stretch of land from St. Augustine southe to Alachua County, known as Mosquito County was acquired by the Spanish.  In 1821, Spain ceded the Florida territroy to the United States and the first American settlement, Camp Monroe, was built in 1836.  Originally a military fortress on lake Monroe, the camp was renamed Mellonville after Captain Charles Mellom, killed in a battle with the Seminole Indians.</b>
<p>
<b>Years later Cornelius Taylor</b> designed an orange grove community near Mellonville, called Enterpise.  General Zachary Taylor, who replaced Jessup, carved a roadway from lake Monroe to Tampa, making both towns important trade centers for the transfer of goods by riverboat and wagon.  The county seat was then moved from New Smyrna to Mellonville and the county's name was changed from Mosquito to Orange.  The new name certainly fit.  Once tracks were laid for the South Florida Railroad which connected Sanford to Orlando, the county became the world's largest shipper of oranges in the world.</p>
<p>
<b>In 1913,</b> delegates from Sanford were successful in lobbying the state leglislature in splitting the county into two parts, Seminole and Orange Counties.  Sanford remained the county seat in Seminole and Orlando, whose economy was more citrus and tourist-oriented, was named Orange.</p>
