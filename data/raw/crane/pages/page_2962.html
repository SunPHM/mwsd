<font size=-2 color=000000>This white-breated nuthatch, a permanent resident
bird of Wisconsin, relishes a handout of walnuts.  Notice its large, curved,
hind toe
"claw" that enables it to easily cling upside-down on the trunk of a tree.

<P>One aspect of this winter that is somewhat different than the
past several winters, when the depth of snow was considerably
less, is that food-finding is more difficult for the hawks.  More
and more people who provide daily handouts of food for the birds,
that in turn invariably attract their natural enemies, are
reporting sharp-shinned and Cooper’s hawks along with an
occasional northern goshawk.

<P>Yesterday we had an exceptionally close look at a Cooper’s
hawk which, at first glance, was so large that we were sure it
was a northern goshawk.  After careful identification we simply
concluded it was a female Cooper’s due to her large size.  The
females of hawks in general are a fourth to a third larger than
the males.

<P>It is quite natural that we fear for the lives of the very
songbirds that have been attracted to the feed we put out.
However we also realize the great importance of predatory birds
and animals in healthy ecosystems.

<P>It doesn’t require many episodes of that sudden flurry of
wings and evacuation from the feeding area to realize when the
&quot;hawk alerts&quot; are for real.  Nearly always there is a
frenzied flight and a 100 per cent withdrawal by the birds and
squirrels from the yard whenever a hawk or northern shrike makes
a strike.  Occasionally one bird suddenly finds itself all alone,
out in the open, fair game for the hunter.

<P>Such was the case with a female white-breasted nuthatch a few
years ago.  A genuine attack occurred.  All creatures including
the red squirrels made headlong dashes for safety, and the yard
was deserted.  Seconds later in flew the unsuspecting female
nuthatch to the big suet feeder.  We saw her land and could
immediately read terror in every feather.  She absolutely FROZE
in her head-downward position.  Not even her eyes blinked!

<P>Naturally I raced for my camera and immediately began taking
pictures of this miniature drama.  That little bob-tailed defier
of gravity remained riveted to the spot for at least five
minutes.  It required a brave black-capped chickadee, buzzing in
for a sunflower seed nearby, to break the spell and bring an end
to the alert.

<P>The stocky-legged nuthatch with the wide stance had obviously
learned her lessons of survival extremely well.  Her ability to
remain absolutely motionless for relatively long periods of time
also caused her to become virtually invisible to her predators.
Perhaps her black, white and gray color pattern imparted to her a
natural interruption of outline, making her body blend perfectly
with the surroundings.

<P>By the way, we recognized the nuthatch to be a female by her
gray cap as compared to the black cap of a male.   Sometimes you
have to look at the cap carefully because those on some females
are darker than on others – but there is a definite difference.
A male’s cap is jet black.  Surprisingly the young hatch-year
males resemble their fathers, females their mothers, soon after
they have become completely feathered.

<P>If you can imagine hacking at a piece of kindling wood, for
example, with a hatchet then the white-breasted nuthatch’s name
isn’t as baffling as some take it to be.  A very similar species
in England is called the nuthack, very likely because they hack
at nuts in order to get at the meat.  I wouldn’t doubt that our
name of the nuthatch is nothing more than a corruption of
nuthack.

<P>This &quot;upside-down bird&quot; always leaves me with the
impression that it is a fussy, inquisitive gleaner of the first
magnitude – always on the move.   How easy it is to attach an
important role to this dapper gray-backed white-breasted forager.
Scores of insects and their eggs are devoured by them as well as
acorns, pine seeds and even a little corn now and then.

<P>They are known to be especially fond of wood borers, leaf
beetles, tree hoppers, scale insects, ants, larvae of gall flies,
larvae of gypsy moths and also forest tent caterpillars.  We
consider them to be invaluable to the overall health of our
woods.

<P>Lately we’ve been putting out small quantities of shelled
 walnut pieces on the deck railing where we can watch and
 photograph the white-breasted nuthatches from extremely close
 range.  Close observations lead me to believe that many artists’
 renditions of this bird depict bills that are too short and fat
 and feet that are much too small.  In fact I am amazed at the
 large size and curved shape of especially the hind toe and claw.
 How perfectly it is constructed to enable the bird to cling
 tightly, in its typical upside-down position, to the bark of
 tree trunks and limbs.

<P>These hardy widespread birds inhabit woods from southern
Canada clear into central Mexico.  Watch their pair-bonding
antics from now on until their egg-laying begins which can be as
early as April 10 in our area.  Come to know and to love these
valuable little partners in nature.  Help preserve the forests
that are their homes.
