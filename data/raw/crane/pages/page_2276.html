      </i></font>
      <p>A translation of the scientific name of the Bald Eagle (<i>Haliaeetus
      leucocephalus</i>) literally means &quot;white-headed sea eagle&quot;. The
      Bald Eagle is endemic to North America, and the national symbol of the
      United States of America. Previously classified as an endangered species
      under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act (1973), the Bald Eagle
      was down-listed or &quot;reduced in status&quot; from endangered to <b>threatened</b>
      as of July 1995. Due to the banning of DDT (a dangerous chlorinated
      hydrocarbon chemical responsible for eggshell thinning) from the
      environment coupled with significant population gains made by the Bald
      Eagle over the last two decades, this bird is expected to be de-listed or
      &quot;removed&quot; from the endangered species list as of the fall of
      2000 or the winter of 2001.</p>
      <p>Adult Bald Eagles are relatively easy to identify. They are chocolate
      brown bodied raptors with a pure white head and tail, including an unfeathered
      tarsi and a massive yellow beak. It typically takes Bald Eagles 5 years to
      acquire definitive adult plumage. Immatures come in a variety of plumages
      based on age. Darker-headed, darker breasted birds being of younger age
      classes, with 3-4 year old birds being lighter colored in the head, beak
      and tail. Adult male Bald Eagles are smaller than females, weighing 8-9
      pounds compared to 10-14 pound females.</p>
      <p>Current population figures indicate there are 26 nesting pairs of Bald
      Eagles in Yellowstone National Park, compared to 10 nesting pairs in 1986.
      And only 14 eaglets fledged in 1999, compared to 10 fledglings in 1986.
      Weather continues to play a critical role in eagle production and most
      Yellowstone bird production for that matter, since the Yellowstone Plateau
      is notorious for its weather extremes.</p>
      <p>Bald Eagle habitat, movements, and food habits change dramatically from
      summer to winter. Nesting usually begins in late February to mid-March.
      Eagle chicks hatch from the large platform tree nest in late March-early
      April, while fledglings leave the nest somewhere between late June and
      late July depending on the elevation of the nest. In the summer, Bald
      Eagles are often found in close association with water, however they can
      be found venturing over mountain meadows and even the summits of mountain
      peaks on occasion. Their summertime prey is primarily fish and waterfowl.
      As winter approaches, immature and sub-adult eagles typically leave the
      park. Research has found many eagles in these young age classes migrate in
      a westerly direction often ending up occupying coastal and interior winter
      habitat that ranged from northern California through Oregon. Some
      Yellowstone adult Bald Eagle pairs spend the entire winter in close
      proximity to their nesting territory, other pairs migrate to lower
      elevations such as the area around Gardiner, Montana to secure food.
      Winter habitat for Bald Eagles often centers around ungulate winter ranges
      and watercourses free of ice. Carrion and waterfowl are the primary food
      items taken by Bald Eagles in the winter. Fish can be taken as a winter
      food item, but are not as easily available as in the summer due to the
      icing of lakes and rivers. By February eagle pairs return to their nesting
      territory thus completing a year in the life of the Yellowstone Bald
      Eagle.</p>

      <p>The scientific name of the Whooping Crane <i>Grus americana</i>,
      literally translated means &quot;American crane&quot;. While the Whooping
      Crane is endemic or native to North America., it is without question one
      of the most <b>endangered </b>and spectacular of the 15 species of cranes
      found in the world. The Whooping Crane is currently classified as an <b>endangered
      species</b> under provisions established by the Endangered Species Act of
      1973 and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</p>

    Whooping Crane Population Chart</a></b></p>
    <hr>
      <p>Adult Whooping Cranes are easily identified by their strikingly bold
      white body plumage, black wingtips, black facial feather markings, red
      crown patch, black legs and feet, yellow-black bi-colored bill, and yellow
      eyes. The Whooping Crane is the tallest bird in North America, standing 5
      feet tall, with a wingspan that measures 7 feet in length. In flight these
      birds are quite easy to identify with the bold black and white plumage,
      extended neck, and trailing legs. Males are slightly larger than females
      both in size (although difficult to judge) and weight ( males weigh 16
      pounds and females 14 pounds).</p>
      <p>Whooping Cranes get their name from their loud, distinctive
      &quot;whooping&quot; call emitted by the male or female or simultaneously by both members of a pair.
      Calling is a method of communication in cranes and is used to reinforce
      pair bonds, defend territories, detect danger, or consequently sound
      alarm.</p>
      <p>Historically speaking, fossil evidence of Whooping Cranes in North
      America dates back several million years, and shows these birds once
      occurring in a large geographical area extending from central Canada to
      central Mexico, and from Utah to the Atlantic coast.</p>
      <p>Information is sketchy as to whether or not Whooping Cranes ever nested
      in Yellowstone National Park. Whooping Crane numbers were probably never
      superabundant over the last 200 years, however there was still a sizeable
      North American population remaining up until the 1860's. By the 1890's the Whooping Crane
      was nearly extirpated from most of its range, with only two flocks
      remaining by 1939 - a relic non-migratory flock in southwestern Louisiana,
      and a migratory flock that nested in west central Canada and wintered in
      southeastern Texas.</p>
      <p>The decline of the Whooping Crane in North America was primarily due to
      an expanding human population. In the late 1800's and early 1900's there
      was a rapid western expansion of the continent by pioneers and European
      settlers. Shooting played a major role in the decline of these birds,
      however agricultural practices such as tilling prairies and draining
      marshes also contributed to the decline. As these crane numbers plummeted,
      demand for rare species such as the Whooping Crane increased further
      through demand created by taxidermists, private and museum collectors, and
      hunters. By 1950, the entire Louisiana Whooping Crane population had
      totally disappeared. All that remained was a migratory wintering Texas
      population numbering about 15 individuals, yet the location of the nesting
      grounds remained unknown. In 1954, that mystery had been solved, when a
      helicopter crew returning from a wildfire discovered three Whooping Cranes
      in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1955 Robert Porter Allen and Robert
      Stewart confirmed the location and discovered a Whooping Crane nest. The
      riddle had finally been solved and this marked a critical juncture in the
      conservation of the Whooping Crane.</p>
      <p>The isolation of Wood Buffalo National Park coupled with creative captive
      propagation techniques played a critical role in bringing the Whooping
      Crane back from the brink of extinction. Biologists learned over time that
      Whooping Cranes which traditionally lay two eggs, only are successful in
      fledging one young. Therefore one egg was removed from wild nests and
      hatchlings from this experiment formed the basis for the captive flocks we
      find in existence today. In 1999, the North American Whooping Crane
      Population was estimated to be 183 birds in the wild, 99 birds in
      captivity, and 4 birds found in the Rocky Mountains classified as
      &quot;experimental-nonessential&quot;.</p>
      <p><font color="#000080" size="4">Whooping Cranes in the Rocky Mountains</font></p>
      <p>A cross-fostering experiment to create a new migratory flock of
      Whooping Cranes took place in the Rocky Mountains in 1975. Under the
      direction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Canadian Wildlife
      Service, researcher Rod Drewien transported Whooping Crane eggs from Wood
      Buffalo National Park in Canada and placed them under incubating Sandhill
      Cranes on Gray's Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho. The main focus of
      the cross-fostering experiment was to have Sandhill Crane adults hatch and
      raise Whooping Crane young, thus leading immature Whooping Cranes on
      migration to a Sandhill Crane winter safe haven known as Bosque del Apache
      National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico.</p>
      <p>Initially, the cross-fostering experiment showed promising signs, but
      eventually problems began to develop. Of particular concern was high crane
      mortality, and Whooping Crane mating behavioral problems associated with
      the experiment. However, a significant amount of valuable information was
      gained as a result of this study. In summary, a total of 289 eggs were
      removed from the wild for this experiment, which resulted in the Rocky
      Mountain Whooping Crane population reaching a peak of 35 subadult/adults
      in 1985. In 1999, only two adults survived from the original Gray's Lake
      experiment, and resided within the Greater Yellowstone. These birds were
      not paired. One bird resided in a remote area of Yellowstone National Park
      for years, and the other frequented the Centennial Valley of Montana. On
      March 15, 2000, a significant event took place in the history of
      Yellowstone ornithology, when the lone whooping crane that had resided in
      Yellowstone National Park for years, died from a collision with power
      lines
      in the San Luis Valley of Colorado. Therefore, only one adult from the
      Gray's Lake experiment remains alive today. This bird frequents the
      Centennial Valley of Montana.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Yellowstone National Park bird program has been
      monitoring a &quot;sandhill-whooper&quot; hybrid since it was discovered
      in 1992. The bird was frequently seen with a Sandhill Crane and was being
      carefully monitored. This bird had significant scientific value, since it allowed
      scientists an opportunity to determine whether it could reproduce
      successfully in the wild. This is an important piece of information could
      have assisted Whooping Crane recovery efforts in the future. However, the
      hybrid crane could not be located in Yellowstone National Park in 1999,
      and is presumed dead.</p>
      <p>Another Whooping Crane &quot;experiment&quot; occurred in the Rocky
      Mountains in 1997/1998 that had a bearing on Yellowstone National Park.
      Four young Whooping Cranes raised in captivity at Patuxent Wildlife
      Research Center in Maryland, were transported to a ranch in eastern Idaho
      as part of an experiment to learn how to establish a new migratory flock
      of Whooping Cranes in North America. The birds were trained to follow an
      ultralight aircraft. In the autumn of 1997, these cranes traveled from
      eastern Idaho to Bosque del Apache NWR in New Mexico following the
      aircraft. Two of the cranes were killed by predators on the wintering
      grounds. The two remaining &quot;ultralight&quot;cranes began their spring
      travels north on March 5,1998, staging for a month in the San Luis Valley
      of Colorado. Once moving again, the birds started to have problems with
      fences and power lines. Collisions with wires continues to be the greatest
      cause of mortality for immature Whooping Cranes. Therefore, these cranes
      were quickly recaptured and released into a safer environment in
      Yellowstone National Park. In May1998, without little forewarning, two
      &quot;ultralight&quot; Whooping Cranes were released in the Slough Creek
      area of the park. This area where the cranes were released proved to be
      troublesome. Large numbers of visitors were coming in close contact with
      the birds creating further imprinting problems. Later that summer, an
      effort was made to recapture the cranes, but only one &quot;ultralight&quot;
      bird was caught and transported to a remote area of the park. The other
      crane remained in the vicinity of Slough Creek until it migrated that fall
      out of the area. Both birds returned to the wintering grounds in New
      Mexico. Then in the
      spring of 1999, one bird died in northern Utah from undetermined causes
      due to the condition of the carcass, leaving a lone survivor residing in
      eastern Idaho for the summer.</p>
      <p>As it now stands, there are only two Whooping Cranes remaining in the
      Rocky Mountains. One adult from the Gray's Lake experiment, and one &quot;ultralight&quot;
      crane. The prognosis for the Whooping Crane in the Rocky Mountains does
      not look promising. Whooping Cranes are expected to disappear from the
      Greater Yellowstone landscape in the near future. The Whooping Crane
      Recovery Team has abandoned efforts to establish this species in the
      Greater Yellowstone and in the Rocky Mountains in the immediate future, citing mortality, disease,
      habitat, pair-bonding, and imprinting issues to name a few. In September
      1999, the Whooping Crane Recovery Team recommended the Wisconsin-Florida
      corridor as the best experimental site for establishing a new migratory flock
      of Whooping Cranes. Experimental efforts will begin in the year 2000.</p>
