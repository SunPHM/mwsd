      <P>The Industrial Works of Bay City, Michigan built this crane in 1914 as 
        unit #2573 for the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR); the railway assigned 
        it the number 63017. Most of its career was spent working out of the station 
        in Hanna, Alberta. It is self-propelled and powered by a vertical steam 
        boiler inside the cab. It received number 50127 when the CNoR became part 
        of Canadian National in 1920. </P>
      <P>The steam boiler in the crane appears to be in good condition and it 
        will be evaluated for eventual operation. Pictured below are two plaques 
        from the crane; its original number is visible on the plaque at left.

      <P>This heavy duty lifting crane is a fine example of the typical "big hook" 
        found on all but very minor railways in North America. Usually there was 
        an auxiliary outfit stationed at every mainline terminal and some branchline 
        points when conditions warranted it. The auxiliary was available on very 
        short notice for dispatch to any point within its designated territory 
        to attend to mishaps. Clearing the line was of utmost importance in order 
        to restore service as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P> A collision sometimes only involved crew members, but a passenger train 
        collision compounded the problem. It was then that the crane and the people 
        who manned the auxiliary were put to the test, clearing wreckage away 
        gently but quickly in order to allow removal of passenger casualties.</P>
      <P>The crews who manned the auxiliary were all specially trained and assigned 
        to it, and were on call at all times. Engine and train crews were pulled 
        from assignments still in the terminal or else were called as soon as 
        possible depending on the situation.</P>
      <P> The shops always had an engine available for just such occasions. The 
        assigned crew, the grub, and the locomotive were assembled and could be 
        underway in as little as thirty minutes. Since wrecks often involved injury 
        or death, the survival of an injured person relied heavily on the prompt 
        dispatch of the auxiliary to the scene.</P>
      <P> The crane was also called upon to do routine chores found elsewhere 
        around the railway such as maintenance, but these other uses were not 
        as high a priority. Authorization was required from division officers 
        - including the chief dispatcher - whenever the services of the "hook" 
        were required for these other lower priority duties.</P>

        providing additional information.)</P>

      <P>A constant companion to 63017 is its idler car, 57611. It was originally 
        a flat car built in 1912 and was later converted for use as an idler. 
        The car serves two purposes. First, it provides space in a train for the 
        crane arm to &quot;sit&quot;; without it, the front coupler on the crane 
        would be inaccessible with the crane arm in the front position. Second, 
        it carries spare equipment, supplies and tools required for the crane 
        during operation. This idler, however, serves a third purpose: sleeping 
        accommodations. Since the crane is fired and operated like a locomotive, 
        there are sleeping bunks for a crane engineer, an operator and a fireman.</P>

        Its capacity is 250 tons. Note the flat car on the right, 54597, with 
        which the crane is paired. This allows the crane to be placed in the centre 
        of a work train, since without it the coupler underneath the boom would

        combined with some pieces of cardboard for a mattress and an old blanket

      <p>This car was acquired by the Museum in 1983. It was built in the 1920s 
        as a 10-compartment companion car #52 for Henry Ford's business car "FAIRLANE". 
        The Museum has copies of the original plans for the car, courtesy of the 
        Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. The plans were found recently 
        among Mr. Ford's personal papers. </p>
      <p>The NAR bought the car about 1942 to accommodate increased passenger 
        traffic during the Second World War. It debuted in NAR service as Day 
        Coach #1953. It is uncertain when this car was converted for work service; 
        probably in the late 1960s or early 1970s.</p>
      <p>In its current incarnation as a bunk car, it has a toilet, wash room, 
        shower room, and bunk area.&nbsp;There is a bed, two drawers, window, 
        upper shelves, and locker for each man. It is also very well heated.&nbsp;There 
        is even a recreation room for smoking, socializing, and playing cards.
