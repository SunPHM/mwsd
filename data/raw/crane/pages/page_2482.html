<h4>Health check for experimental sandhill cranes paves way for whooping crane in Wisconsin</h4>

<i>Marianne Wellington, assistant curator of birds, International Crane Foundation (left) works with veterinarian Dr. Barry Hartup of the crane foundation and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Veterinary School as they take fecal and blood samples from young sandhill cranes at the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge June 30. The health check is an early step toward eventually using similar procedures to reintroduce endangered whooping cranes back into Wisconsin. </I>

<P>NECEDAH, Wis. -- Veterinarians and animal health technicians from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the International Crane Foundation today performed health checks on 14 sandhill crane chicks that will be trained to migrate by following an ultralight aircraft as part of a migration experiment leading to reintroduction of the endangered whooping crane in Wisconsin.</p>

<P>Wisconsin was the first state to join in partnership with the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, International Crane Foundation and Operation Migration, Inc. in a plan to establish a migratory flock of the endangered whooping crane, east of the Mississippi. Currently, there is only one remaining flock of wild migratory girds that migrate between Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in south Texas and Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada. The Wisconsin flock would be trained to migrate to Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge in central Florida and nest in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The cranes are six to eight weeks old and were raised from eggs collected in central Wisconsin in early May. The eggs were flown to the U.S. Geological Survey’s Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, hatched, and reared to this point. At all stages of hatching and rearing, direct human contact has been limited to crane-costumed handlers to maintain the animals’ natural tendency to avoid humans.</p>

<p>The crane chicks are now being transferred to Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin where they will be trained to follow the aircraft by Operation Migration, the Canadian/U.S. non-profit organization of "Fly Away Home" fame.

<p>"A health check is necessary at this stage for three reasons," says Julie Langenberg, DNR wildlife veterinarian. "We need to be sure that the birds are not carrying any disease that could be transmitted to Wisconsin wildlife; that the individual animals are fit and healthy and not in need of any special care or treatment; and we’ll be testing techniques and protocols that we’ll use on the whooping cranes a year from now. This is a very important step in the reintroduction process."</p>

<p>International Crane Foundation veterinarian Barry Hartup, who, with Langenberg, heads up the health team, recently performed similar examinations on a smaller group of sandhill cranes that remained at the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge and are being trained in a slightly different manner. Hartup is also affiliated the University of Wisconsin Veterinary School which is supplying some of the testing and diagnostic equipment for the exams.</p>

<p>"The birds reared on-site at Necedah appear healthy and vigorous and their appetite for mosquitoes is impressive!" said Hartup following the examinations. "These birds were hatched from the same collection of sandhill eggs as the Patuxent birds but have been raised slightly differently. They’ve still been strictly isolated from human contact but they’re being introduced to the aircraft at a later stage of development."</p>

<p>Among several diseases veterinarians will screen for is West Nile Virus. This is a potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease that has only recently been discovered in the Mid-Atlantic States, including the area around Patuxent. "To our knowledge, until a year ago, this disease didn’t exist in the U.S.," says Langenberg. "But it has the potential to cause great harm to our wildlife and we want to be absolutely sure we aren’t responsible for bringing it here."</p>

<p>Blood and fecal samples will be collected to screen for viruses, parasites and bacteria such as salmonella.</p> 

<p>Of particular interest to the overall health of the cranes is how they are responding to the stress of being crated, trucked, flown and trucked again to the Necedah pens. The vets will look for physical injuries and prescribe any treatment deemed necessary. Cranes and especially whooping cranes have a habit in captivity of eating any bits of metal they find. These sandhill cranes and the whoopers will be x-rayed for swallowed metal. Small pieces, judged to be harmless, will remain to pass through the digestive tract. Sharp pieces that could puncture the digestive tract, or pieces that contain toxic metals that the cranes might absorb, may be removed.</p>

<p>Cranes, especially these that are being raised to be as wild as possible, present a challenge to the health teams.</p>

<p>"The birds are being raised to be as wild as possible," says Langenberg. "They’re not happy about being handled and provide more of a challenge for examination and treatment. Birds, because of their high metabolic rates, can be more susceptible to stress so we have to handle them carefully and work quickly."</p>

<p>The whooping crane reintroduction project is a partnership effort between the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, International Crane Foundation, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Natural Resources Foundation, Operation Migration, Inc., Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and Florida Department of Environmental Protection.</P>
