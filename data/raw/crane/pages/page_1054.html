Guide</B></FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The 
construction industry has always had a fluctuating workforce, due to the</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
fact that workloads vary according to the amount and nature of the contracts a 
company undertakes. </FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Companies 
have traditionally maintained a core nucleus of staff and <IMG SRC="images/cranes1.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="167" ALIGN="RIGHT">supplemented 
this during busy times with sub contract</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">or 
freelance staff. This working model is becoming more prevalent with the advent 
of modern construction agencies and the general trend in the UK to employ a more 
flexible workforce. It is now commonplace for the workforce on a project to be 
made up of both permanent members of staff and freelance staff. Deciding whether 
you want to go freelance or permanent is a decision that should be given careful 
consideration. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Freelance 
- the benefits</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>1. 
MONEY!</B> Freelancers will generally have a disposable income which is anywhere 
between 20% - 80% higher than their permanent colleagues. You will get paid a 
higher hourly rate as you are expected to make provisions for your own holiday 
pay, sick pay, travel and other benefits that your permanent colleagues enjoy. 
If you are getting paid standard market rates and you are working on a project 
which involves working 45 hours a week or more, then you will almost certainly 
have more money in your pocket, even once you have made provisions for the benefits 
mentioned.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>2. 
VARIETY</B> If you work for the same company, then your experience will generally 
be limited to a certain size and type of contract. When you are freelance however, 
you can experience different sectors of the construction industry ranging from 
highways, structures, land reclamation, WWTW, high rise office blocks, industrial 
units to refurbishment's and housing - the list goes on! A lot of people find 
this very attractive, as the environment and their skills are constantly changing. 
This alleviates a lot of the boredom that a lot of people feel when they stick 
with the same company for a long time, and also gives you the opportunity to work 
on some of the more prestigious projects in the area. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>3. 
LOCATION </B>Normally, if you want to work on larger projects, with a financially 
stable company, then you have to work for one of the national contractors. The 
problem with this, is that they can't guarantee to keep you in work close to home. 
With contracts being won all over the UK, you could be in the situation where 
the only work they have for you is 100 miles or more from home. When you are freelance, 
this is much less of a problem. A lot of people prefer to work freelance, because 
they can dictate which geographical area they will work in. As long as you are 
living in a relatively urbanized area, then your agency shouldn't have much problem 
finding you work within around a 30 minute traveling distance from home, although 
you should be prepared to travel up to 1 hour during quiet times. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><B>4.	
FLEXIBILITY</B> Freelancers are their own boss. The only people who dictate to 
you when you work is you and your bank manager. This flexibility can be beneficial 
if you have interests outside of your chosen career field, such as your own business, 
family commitments etc. If you develop a good relationship with your agency, then 
they will quite happily accommodate you if you need to take a few months off to 
pursue your own interests, whereas you will seldom find this if you are working 
permanently for a company. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Freelance 
- the drawbacks </B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>1. 
JOB SECURITY </B><BR>Although here at Rockall, we find it very easy to give our 
best freelancers continuity of work, year in year out, we still can't give any 
guarantees. There may be occasions when the market is slightly depressed in your 
area and you could find yourself out of work for a few weeks. This period should 
never be longer than 3 weeks even at the quietest of times, (apart from the Christmas 
shutdown, when the construction industry effectively slows then grinds to a halt 
for around 4 weeks). However, this is no longer of such concern to many people, 
because the concept of a job for life is rapidly disappearing as many companies 
now shed their permanent staff when times are hard. </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>2. 
FINANCIAL PLANNING</B> Freelancing is not as bad as some people think. All agencies 
can pay their workers on a PAYE basis, which means that they take care of all 
of your tax and national insurance contributions, and the money that gets paid 
into your bank account is yours to keep. What you will find though, is that your 
income will fluctuate during the year. During the summertime, or if you are working 
on a fast track project, you could be working long hours and thus have a very 
high income, whereas in winter time these hours may well be shorter. These financial 
irregularities can be planned for. The best way to budget, is to work out the 
average hours and wages for a week and to multiply this by 44 weeks, to give you 
your predicted annual income. Divide this then by 52 to give you your average 
weekly wage. Any money which you receive over and above this figure should then 
be banked for sickness, holidays and quiet periods. You will also need to make 
provision for a pension and health insurance (if required). </FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>3. 
CAREER PROGRESSION</B> If you want the traditional career path, with a structured 
approach to training courses and promotions, then freelancing may not be for you. 
Broadly speaking, freelancers fill an intermediate skills gap in a construction 
team. They occupy temporary positions where they are required to 'hit the ground 
running. For this reason, employers would expect to give little training and to 
freelance staff. Freelance staff are also very rarely appointed to positions of 
responsibility. Employers are always keen to employ their management team on a 
permanent basis, so that there is continuity in the style of management within 
the company. However, having said that, there are still occasions when companies 
win more contracts than they have managers for, so there are still some opportunities 
for freelance managers and consultants. </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="275" VALIGN="MIDDLE"><P>&nbsp;</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Have
