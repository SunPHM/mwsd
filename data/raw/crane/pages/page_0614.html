The Sarawak Canopy Crane was erected in March 2000 at the Lambir Hills National Park
as the result of a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Forest Department
of Sarawak and the Japanese Science and Technology Corporation in December 1999.
The canopy crane is an extension of the <A HREF="canopy.htm">
Canopy Biology Program</A> in Sarawak.  The
purpose of the canopy crane is to facilitate a study on the interactive mechanisms
between the ecosphere and the atmosphere in a tropical forest, a terrestrial 
ecosystem with high productivity and is among the most complex in the world.

<P>
Using the canopy <A HREF="bccrane1.htm">crane</A>, gaseous exhcange will be studied
and photosynthetic activities, water budget and carbon flux measured.  The changes in
carbohydrate level of trees will be monitored to see how they are influenced by
climatic conditions and how the mechanism of the mass flowering is triggered.  The
results of this study will have important implications for the restoration of
deforested and degraded areas using indigenous tree species.

The Canopy Crane at the Lambir Hills National Park in Sarawak is the eighth and the latest
to be erected for studies.  It is the highest and the second longest.  The other seven 
erected earlier in other forest types include:
