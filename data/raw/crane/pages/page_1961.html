<b>Land Trusts</b>.  We learned more about this increasingly popular method of
preserving land from development...the land trust.  Our speaker, Leslie Taylor, is
director of the
<a href="http://www.newlt.org/">Northeast Wisconsin Land Trust</a>.
Her informational presentation
included a video/slide program.  She addressed land trusts in general, highlighting
succesful acquisitions around the country.  Special emphasis was on conservation
easements, an innovative and cost-effective method of preserving land in perpetuity.
Leslie also detailed current projects in our area and explained opportunities for
volunteer involvement.  She was joined in her presentation by Thomas Sutter, one
of her board members and a local attorney.

<B>New Center for Biodiversity</B>.  UWGB has unveiled its work in progress...the Center for
Biodiversity, one of the first attempts to develop a local biodiversity center for
promoting environmental protection at the grassroots level.  It combines UWGB's Richter
Museum of Natural History, the Cofrin Arboretum, and the UWGB Herbarium.  It will be housed
in the academic building currently under construction on campus.<BR>

<a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/nas/howe.htm">Dr. Robert Howe</a>, UWGB professor of
Environmental Sciences and director of the Center,
joined us to explain and demonstrate the current status of the Center, and its exciting
plans for the future,
including on-line (Internet) resources and programs for outreach and information.
Biodiversity, a concept whose time has come, is a prime method of preserving our presious
natural resources.  We learned the role of this new center in educating the public
and coordinating efforts to protect our environment.<BR>

<b>The Crandon Mine</b>.  Even with the moratorium, this issue is far from settled.
Nashville Town Chairman, Chuck Sleeter, presented the <i>David and Goliath</i>
perspective of small town vs. multi-national corporation, including the agreements with
Exxon, the recall of the town board, the current status of the issue, and more.  It was an interesting evening!<BR>
<BR>
The tiny Town of Nashville is standing its ground against Nicolet Minerals Company, a subsidiary of the multinational, multibillion dollar Rio Algom mining company. The company wants to build an underground mine that would be partially within Nashville and extract approximately 55 million tons of ore over the next 30 years. Nashville is leading the fight in trying to prevent that from happening.<BR>

We learned more about how this process works: who can report a suspected violation;
the difference between a civil and a criminal violation; how cases are investigated and
developed, and how they move to eventual compliance or penalty.<BR>

<b>Explore Newfoundland.</b>  So, what do you know about Newfoundland?  OK, eastern Canada, must be a lot like Nova Scotia, right?  Well, Yes and No!  To learn about this youngest of Canada's provinces, join us for a travelogue from two FVSG members who adventured in Newfoundland in summer 2000.  Nancy Brown-Koeller participated in a Sierra Club National Outing, hiking extensively on the internationally known East Coast Trail.  Daily sightings of whales and seabirds were among the highlights of this route.  Taking a different route, Maureen Birk and a friend utilized a fly/drive package to start from the western coast of the island, explore the national parks, Viking settlement historic areas, and gradually work over to the east coast and the same Trail.  They will share stories and pictures of whales, puffins, archeological sites, light houses, and Arctic-like tundra terrain, and some of the local history and culture.

The Colorado Plateau region of Utah and Arizona has huge expanses of undeveloped territory and some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. Within this region are canyons - sized from grand to sinuous, flat-topped mesas, winding green and brown rivers, mountain ranges with snow-covered peaks, prehistoric Anasazi sites, vast wild areas and a host of national parks. Having taken many trips over a 30-year time span to the Plateau, I will show slides and talk about some of these wondrous places, with an emphasis on the beauty and the importance of maintaining and protecting the wildness of the area. There will be pictures from the Paria/Vermillion Cliffs, Grand Staircase/Escalante, Cedar Mesa canyons and ruins, slot canyons near Page and Escalante and the national parks of Zion, Bryce, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands and Arches. In these sublime places, the red rock desert comes in all fantastic shapes, sizes and colors. And the rock is sometimes so luminous that light seems to glow or shine out of the rock, rather than just being reflected from it.<BR>
<BR>
I am a serious amateur photographer and inveterate adventurer. Having a love of wild places and things, I am constantly drawn back to the Colorado Plateau for its beauty, its wildness and its unbelievable variety of natural splendor. There are few places like it in the world. It is truly a place of spectacular mystery!<BR>

</td></tr></table>

<P><b>BACKGROUND:</b>

<P>On January 4, 2002 the Bush administration ordered the employees of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to make oil or gas development on federally managed land their top priority.  Since then over 2 million acres of land in Utah alone has had its protective status revoked and regulations have been put in place that allow for the construction of highways on these lands -- even through National Parks.  These policies have placed Utah's world class landscape at the center of America's wild lands policy debate.  Across the country lands equal to the area of Texas and Oklahoma combined have been opened to oil and gas development, logging, and mining.

<P>On June 28, 2004 the Bush administration announced its intentions to rollback protections for the remaining roadless lands in the National Forest system.  In direct opposition to the formal support of the over  2 million Americans the administration wants to make wilderness hunting, hiking, and fishing in the nation's last forest sanctuaries unavailable to future families in order to facilitate logging.

<P>Water is so important to the people of Wisconsin, that 2003 was officially designated as the "Year of Water." Throughout the year, all citizens had the opportunity to celebrate and reflect upon the vital importance of Wisconsin's bountiful water resources - all 15,000 lakes, 32,000 miles of perennial streams, 5.3 million acres of wetlands and 1.2 quadrillion gallons of groundwater. Even though the Year of Water has come and gone, the issues that drew our attention to this vital resource remain. Citizens of all ages still need the opportunity to learn more about the challenges facing Wisconsin's water resources and take steps to conserve and sustain these resources for ourselves and future generations.

<P><b>Stopping Wisconsin's Coal Rush</b>.

<P>In Wisconsin, we face big decisions about our energy future, decisions with impacts that will be felt for generations.  With two brand new coal plants on the way, several others on the horizon, and outdated dirty coal plants with no modern pollution controls that provide the bulk of our power, it is ever more urgent that we find a cleaner, safer energy future.  Learn how these plants affect your health and your community; cleaner, safer ways to power our future; specific efforts to clean up Wiscon Public Service Corporation's Green Bay Pulliam plant and how you can help.

<P>Jennifer Feyerherm and Bruce Nilles from Sierra Club's Midwest Office will present.  Jennifer is a Clean Air Specialist with the Great Lakes Program, working on the Wisconsin Coal Campaign.  Currently, she is working with local groups to clean up coal plants in Green Bay and Madison and turn back new coal in Wausau.  Bruce Nilles is an attorney working with the broader Midwest Coal Campaign, designing and implementing legal strategies and coordinating efforts in Midwestern states with a focus on Wisconsin and Illinois.
