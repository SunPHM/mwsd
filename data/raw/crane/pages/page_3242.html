Each year, David Loehr opens his James Dean Memorial Gallery free to the public, on the Thursday night before Fairmount Museum Days starts.  This year he got a nationally acclaimed set of old friends for the musical entertainment.  The Blue Moon Boys, out of Fort Wayne, Indiana, played on the grand front porch for all to hear.
<br>
This page will have some photos, but I have a camera that takes multiple shots, and I planned to catch Nic Roulette, their lead singer, in midair.  Alas, Nic had just had some surgery, so he couldn't jump!  Missed my chance.  Also missed a lot of photos of the band, because I was set up for the multiples that become animated gifs.  <a href="#linksbelow">See links below </a>for more band photos.<p>

We were astounded to find Phil Jones gracing our open house, as well as Anthony Michael Hall.  Phil, the CBS News White House correspondent, was grand Marshall of the parade on Saturday. He's a Fairmount High School alumnus!<p>

Enough words.  Let the photos begin!<p>

Jerry Sparkman on bass.  He smiles now! All that touring in the US and Europe has made him relax on stage,<p>

<img src="kenytee.jpg" height="289"  width="225"  border="0" alt="Kenny Taylor"><br>
Kenny Taylor, guitar and vocals.  Kenny is probably the best guitar player in Fort Wayne and beyond.<p>

<img src="simona.jpg" height="300"  width="287"  border="0" alt="Flava"><br>
An extraordinary makeover: Flava P. Simon with a beard that added ten years to his apparent and made him a dangerous, mysterious, intriguing man.  <p>

(Ancient pic of Nic Roulette.)<br>
None of my open house photos of lead singer Nic Roulette are useable, so I will have to learn animation shop and bring you the animated gifs.  Meanwhile, please enjoy innumerable previous Nic pics. (<a href="#linksbelow">Links</a> below.)<p>

We were lucky to have Naomi Yamada (on the right) come from Japan again this year.  She brough another Thousand Cranes for Jimmy's headstone.  She makes each origami bird herself, each year.  An amazing fan, whom we all cherish.<p>
