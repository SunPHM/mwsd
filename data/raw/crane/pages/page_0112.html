Mercer Award, Crane performed at the very first Cabaret Convention at Manhattan's Town
Hall and at three of the subsequent Conventions. She is recipient of BackStage's Bistro
Award for Outstanding Vocalist.</small> <br>
<br>
<small>A native New Yorker, she kicked off her performing career working in nightclubs and
cabaret rooms up and down the east coast, appearing with the last of New England's
&quot;big bands&quot; as well as performing in stock, off-Broadway and for the USO abroad.
With Ted Story, George Ferencz and Pam Mitchell, she co-founded and co-produced The
Impossible Ragtime Theatre (IRT), which came to be regarded as one of New York's most
acclaimed Off-Off Broadway theatres, producing over one hundred plays, a cabaret series
entitled &quot;In One&quot; and building four different stages. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Past Secretary of the Board of Directors of MAC (Manhattan Society of Cabarets and
Clubs) for seven years, currently a Friar, a member of the Society of Singers,
International Women in Jazz, MAC, NARAS and Women in Music. Crane Co-Chairs the Committee
which brought voice back to the 2 ton ancient bell, Ol' Jeff, hanging in the tower of the
Venetian Gothic Jefferson Market Library, belongs to the committe that restored the
Yorkville Clock and a long list of governmental and community groups; (*see: Civic
Projects ) among them Greenpeace, the Municipal Arts Society, Save the Village, the
Federation to Preserve the Greenwich Village Waterfront and Greatport and the Greenwich
Village Society for Historic Preservation. </small><br>
<small><br>
She is grateful that the scourge of AIDS has diminished in her world of Greenwich Village,
but misses the spiritual rewards of delivering meals to shut-in AIDS patients for God's
Love We Deliver and the weekly bedside singing on the AIDS Ward of St. Vincent's Hospital,
which she credits with helping to improve her &quot;contact&quot; with larger audiences.
&nbsp; Cynthia is a self-confessed &quot;black-sheep W.A.S.P. &quot; (ergo the title of
her first album) from a three-generation native New Yorker family. Her father's family
founded the Crane Oxygen and Ambulance Service (the first in New York) which, as part of
it's business, used to service the Ziegfield Follies with Oxygen to snort backstage (a
legal and &quot;hip&quot; thing to do in those days.) They even administered Oxygen to
Gargantua, the famous gorilla, when he was injured.&nbsp; </small><br>
