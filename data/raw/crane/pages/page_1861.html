  <font face="Arial" size=4><strong>Nature Guides for Iwokrama Forest, Guyana, South America</strong></font><br>

  We have created a digital publishing system for the nature reserve
  which produces online nature guides and pocket-sized printed guides
  from the same database of text and images. This project was funded by 
  the International Development Research Centre of Canada.<br>

   <font face="Arial" size=4><strong>Saving the Whooping Crane</strong></font><br>

    This online educational exercise allows biology students to 
    simulate population growth of the crane population under different 
    management strategies. The module is designed to teach population
    ecology and conservation biology principles. <br>

  <font face="Arial" size=4><strong>Shorebird Migration Monitoring Web site</strong></font><br>

 Researchers and estuary managers along the West Atlantic Flyway are
  tracking shorebirds during migration. 
 This Web site helps them share information about 
 flock characteristics, and also allows naturalists to submit observations online.
  Features include migration maps which are dynamically created from the database
  and show up-to-date flock positions. This project is funded by the National Oceanic
 and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
