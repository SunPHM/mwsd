      wreck</a>.&nbsp; Vis was a very poor and murky 5 feet.&nbsp; No great 
      surprise there after 20+ft waves from the storm, stirring up the 
      bottom.&nbsp; We thought that we try the reef for a second dive at a 
      chance at better vis and got a pleasant surprise.&nbsp; The <a href="../shipwrecks/dykes.html">Dykes</a> 
      had 20ft+ vis, just 4 miles inshore from the 120 Wreck.&nbsp; But it has a

      HB &amp;BH divers enjoyed one of the last great days before the Holiday   
      weekend and all this rain.&nbsp; We drove way south to a old barge for   
      spearfishing and mussels.&nbsp; Then our second dive was a very old   
      schooner.&nbsp; Vis was 30 foot or better and our divers bagged quite a   
      few fish, including a 10 lb fluke and lots of mussels and a few bugs.</p>  
      <p align="left"><b>Monday 25th.</b><br> 
      Well another forecast wrong.&nbsp; The calm 1-3 foot seas and SW wind  
      never seemed to show up.&nbsp; In it's place were 3-4 ft seas and the  
      occasional 5 to 6 footers.= with a steady South breeze.&nbsp;&nbsp; We  
      headed south to the <a href="../shipwrecks/crane_barge.html">Seaside Crane  
      Barge</a> and one of the <a href="../shipwrecks/hankins.html">Hankins  
      schooners</a> for some lobstering and spearfishing.&nbsp; They are always  
      great spots.&nbsp; They did not disappoint.&nbsp; Quite a few bugs and  
      lots of fish for every.&nbsp; we just about limited out.&nbsp; I think if  
      we stayed we could've easily caught our limit on lobsters and fish.</p> 
      <p align="left"><b>Saturday 23rd.</b><br>
      A group of crew headed out to dive on some offshore numbers, but rough 
      seas changed our minds on the 3 and 1/2 hour ride out.&nbsp; We settled 
      for digging on the <a href="../shipwrecks/emerald.html">Emerald or Frances 
      Wright</a> and were rewarded with artifacts, and some great 
      spearfishing.&nbsp; Vis was 30 feet but the South winds have really 
      chilled down the bottom water to below 50 degrees!<br>

      We headed out the inlet trying to decide what wrecks we dive today.&nbsp;  
      The divers of the HB &amp; BH group finally decided that spearfishing on  
      the reef presented more fun.&nbsp; We stopped at the <a href="../shipwrecks/cranford.html">Cranford  
      Ferry</a> and the <a href="../shipwrecks/brunette.html">Cadet</a>.&nbsp;  
      Everyone did pretty good spearing sea bass, a few tautog (blackfish) and  
      many 3-5 lb fluke.</p>

      made two great dives on the wreck of a clam boat: the <a href="../shipwrecks/beth_dee_bob.html">Beth

      3-4ft but mostly swells.&nbsp; We decided to do two on the Mohawk.&nbsp;  
      Vis was a 20-25 feet.&nbsp; Lots of fluke and a few lobsters.&nbsp; We  
      also found a couple of cases of whiskey bottles, but all were broken, but

      of the <a href="../shipwrecks/cranford.html">Cranford.&nbsp;</a> We 
      decided that with the forecast, staying inshore might be the best bet, so 
      did most every other dive boat out today.&nbsp; It got a little nicer by 
      mid-morning so we drove further offshore to the <a href="../shipwrecks/120-wreck.html">120 
      wreck</a> where conditions were much better (vis improved to 30 feet from 
      10 on the reef).&nbsp; Lots of lobster, sea bass and fluke!&nbsp; We've

      An open boat trip which the weather stopped us short on.&nbsp; The  
      forecast was for rougher seas, so we decided to dive an old favorite: the  
      Delaware.&nbsp; Vis was 10 to 20 feet depending where you were on the  
      wreck.&nbsp; Of course anywhere near the scooters it was in the 10 foot  
      range, but Billy Yeoman and Bud Hubert did find some sewing supplies  
      (buttons and brass pins)&nbsp; Helen Bilinski has always wanted a place on  
      the dive log, so she decided to go spearfishing.&nbsp; Take a look at her  
      day, none less than 3.5 pounds!&nbsp; Teamwork certainly pays-off.&nbsp;  
      Several divers told her where the fish were on their dives and Helen  
      picked them up!&nbsp; Nice shots!<img border="0" src="image-store/2003_helen_fluke.jpg" width="500" height="641"></p>

      had some great bottom conditions, even though a week of south winds 
      brought in some cooler water.&nbsp; Several lobsters were caught along 
      with lots of sea bass.&nbsp;&nbsp; We made another dive on one of the <a href="../shipwrecks/hankins.html">Hankins</a>

      many fish and good bottom vis.<br>

      New Diver Day for the Philadelphia Sea Horses.&nbsp; We traveled to the <a href="../shipwrecks/travis_tug.html">Travis  
      Tug</a> for our fist dive.&nbsp; An intact shipwreck is a great sight for  
      new diver.&nbsp; Vis was 20-25ft and two of the divers were treated to a  
      Mola-Mola swimming with them on their dive!&nbsp; We dived the <a href="../shipwrecks/delaware.html">Delaware</a>

      and the other on the <a href="../shipwrecks/dykes.html">Reef

      fish anyone can remember seeing in quite some time.&nbsp; Sea Bass  
      literally covered the wreck and sands surrounding the wreck.&nbsp;  
      Lobstering isn't as good as in past season, but the spearfishing is great,  
      so long as everyone observes size and limit restrictions.</p>

      first stop was the <a href="../shipwrecks/middle.html">Middle Barges</a>,    
      then we made two buoy dives, one to an old sailing ship or schooner barge    
      that we seldom get to see, aptly named the Old Barge, then over to the <a href="../shipwrecks/glory.html">Glory</a>    
      another schooner barge.&nbsp; These first 3 dives produced alot of Sea    
      Bass and a few bugs.&nbsp; We then moved over for a more conventional dive    
      by anchoring on the Brunette.&nbsp; This turned out to be a really great    
      dive.&nbsp; Vis was well over 50feet and would have been even better had    
      the sun been out!&nbsp; For the final dive of the day we dropped 5 divers    
      on small barge nearby for the fifth and final wreck dive.&nbsp; Divers    
      Rich Galiano and Denny Mace had a great day being the top fisherman,    
      shooting fish along with everyone else and posed for this shot of the days

      </b><u>Hunterdon Scuba</u>. We had a flat day to make two dives on the <a href="../shipwrecks/beth_dee_bob.html">Beth  
      Dee Bob</a>.&nbsp; Vis was respectable at 20-25 feet although the bottom  
      temperature was a brisk 47 degrees.&nbsp; Hunterdon is one of NJ's newest  
      dive shops and offers divers all levels of dive training and a complete  
      selection of recreational and technical dive gear along with great dive  
      travel trips.</p>

      Night Dive.&nbsp; <u>Professional Divers Shop</u> in Neptune waited over  
      an hour for the intense storms to clear but we had to cancel the night  
      dive due to severe thunderstorms that hung around.&nbsp; It isn't so much  
      the rain that matters but the cloud to ground lightning that makes it  
      unsafe to put divers into the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
    <p><b>Saturday 14th.<br>
    </b><u>HB &amp; BH Divers</u> made their first dives of the season, the  
    first dive on the <a href="../shipwrecks/delaware.html">SS Delaware</a> with  
    10 feet conditions on the bottom.&nbsp; One diver found a mostly intact  
    brass door key near the engine.&nbsp; The next dive was on the <a href="../shipwrecks/reef-sea_girt.html">Sea  
    Girt Reef</a> to the <a href="../shipwrecks/travis_tug.html">Travis Tug</a>.&nbsp;  
    We had to drive around abit to find an open wreck.&nbsp; The reef is being  
    well used by divers and fishermen.&nbsp; Vis was alot better here and  
    spearfishing was even better.<br>

    <b>Sunday 8th.</b><br>
    Open Boat.&nbsp; We tried digging the <a href="../shipwrecks/hankins.html">Hankins  
    wreck</a>.&nbsp; Several artifacts have come up over the past few years. and  
    we went looking for more.&nbsp; Vis was 10-15 feet.&nbsp; Lots of sea bass  
    for the divers who where looking for fish.<br>

    <u>Hunterdon Scuba </u>and the <u>MUD Club</u> (Metuchen Underwater Divers)  
    shared the boat today for two dives on the <a href="../shipwrecks/mohawk.html">SS  
    MOHAWK.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good vis (20ft)&nbsp; The water is still cool but  
    there are lots of sea bass on the wrecks and lobsters too, although most are  
    small or egg-bearing.&nbsp; The MUD Club is one of New Jersey's oldest  
    diving clubs and have been chartering Diversion II since 1986.</p>
