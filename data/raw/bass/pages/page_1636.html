<H3>Double bass (bass)</H3>

<P>
This is the largest and lowest-pitched bowed string instrument in use.  Double basses vary in shape and size more than almost any other instrument.  Of the smallest basses, some are little bigger than a cello, while some of the larger (full-size) instruments can have a body of anything up to about 140 cm in length.  The normal (three-quarter) size found in orchestras is about 115 cm.
</P>

<P>
It has four (or less often five) strings and sounds an octave lower than the cello.  In western art music it's best known for its contribution to the orchestra, where it supplies not only power and weight but the basic rhythmic foundation, and has also been used as a continuo instrument.  More rarely, the bass is heard as a soloist, in which field its surprisingly large repertory includes over 200 concertos.  
</P>

<P>
The instrument, normally played pizzicato (plucking its strings), is an essential member of jazz and dance bands;  in many countries it's used in military and concert bands.
</P>

<P>
Research into the evolution of the double bass reveals a tangled web of several hundred years' changes in the dimensions of the instruments and consequently in its stringing and tuning.
</P>

<P>
The earliest known illustration of a double bass type of instrument dates from 1516 but in 1493 Prospero wrote of "viols as big as myself."   Some fine basses date from the late 16th century and early 17th.  Telemann's unusual "Trillensymphonie" in D (1730) must be one of the earliest examples of a work using a double bass instrument as a soloist.
</P>

<P>
Little other solo music is known from the 18th century until the solo parts in Haydn's symphonies of the early 1760s;  then, in the four years from 1765, no fewer than 28 concertos appeared (by Vanhal, Zimmerman, Haydn, Franz Hoffmeister, Johannes Sperger and Dittersdorf).  In 1791, Mozart wrote his aria "Per questa bella mano" for bass and double bass.  This work was published in 1822-one of the first virtuoso double bass works to appear in print.
</P>

<P>
During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the bass was enjoying some popularity as a solo instrument.  Many of the virtuoso pieces from the Viennese school of that period, in view of the tunings required, were thought by early 20th-century authorities not to have been written for the bass at all.  Later research revealed that the instrument has in the past been tuned in some 40 or 50 different ways.  There are in fact numerous solo concertos from this period.
</P>

<P>
It was not until Domenico Dragonetti settled in London that the bass gained popularity in England.  Dragonetti's success was unique in that for over 50 years, no musical gathering was considered complete without him.  Not only did his fine performances win him recognition throughout Europe, but his kind amiable personality endeared him to the British public.  He counted among his friends Haydn, Beethoven, Liszt and many other composers.
</P>

<P>
It's hard to be certain when the double bass obtained a regular place in the orchestra. There was no double bass in the Paris Opera orchestra, for example, until the early years of the 18th century.  But court orchestras of the mid-18th century included double basses; usually they were more numerous than the cellos.  A modern symphony orchestra generally has at least eight.
</P>

<P>
Any principal orchestral player must attain a standard equal to that of the virtuoso soloist; advanced technique is required for most of the works of, for example, Schoenberg, Strauss and Stravinsky.  Some of the more exposed passages occur in Britten's "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra," Mahler's Symphony No. 1, Mussorgsky's "Pictures from an Exhibition," Prokofiev's suite "Lieutenant Kije," and Saint-Saens's "Le carnaval des animaux."

The double bass was used in ragtime orchestras and string bands from the 1890s.  It was present in many early New Orleans dance orchestras, and early photographic evidence suggests that the instrument was often bowed rather than plucked.  Although during the era of acoustic recording the double bass was often replaced by the tuba (probably because of its greater carrying power), in the late 1920s the double bass was established as the basis for the rhythm section, particularly in larger ensembles.
</P>

<P>
In many ragtime pieces and in early jazz the double bass would play on the first and third beats of the bar and occasionally in melodic interludes.  In the swing era it kept steady time with a "walking bass," a style epitomized by the work of Walter Page in Count Basie's band.  Like most bass players of this time, Page served primarily as a member of the rhythm section and took few solos.  The development of the instrument as a solo voice was largely the work of Jimmy Blanton (with Duke Ellington).
</P>

<P>
During the 1940s and 50s, players such as Ray Brown, Oscar Pettiford, Red Callender and Charles Mingus extended the application of bop style to the double bass.  Mingus began to break down the instrument's time-keeping role by placing notes before, on, or after the beat to vary the effect of the rhythmic accompaniment.  He also developed a highly individual solo style, and later in his career he frequently performed extended compositions and improvisations as an unaccompanied soloist.
</P>

<P>
By the 1950s, steel strings and improved amplification had largely eliminated the difficulty of producing sufficient volume on the double bass.  Players such as Charlie Haden, Jimmy Garrison, Dave Holland, Barre Phillips and Buddy Guy have explored harmonics, double stopping, percussive methods of producing notes, the use of the body of the instrument to make percussive sounds, and the possibilities offered by the section of the string between the bridge and the tailpiece.
</P>

<P>
Although the bass guitar was first introduced in 1951 the double bass continued to be the most commonly used bass instrument in the rock and roll bands of that decade.  In the early 1960s the bass guitar became the pre-eminent bass instrument in pop and rock music.  The double bass continues in use in traditional music, particularly of eastern Europe, and  in some styles of American Country music (notably in Bluegrass music).
