        Association of Rovinj in cooperation with Diver Sport Center marked the
        15th anniversary of environmental operations in the best possible way
        – by cleaning, and then fish-stocking the town harbour. “The Sea Remembers”
        operation coincided with two significant anniversaries – fiftieth since
        the foundation of the Tourist Association and hundredth since the marking
      of Rovinj tourism development. </p>

        Association of Rovinj, aware of the fact that preserved Adriatic is a
        legacy for the future, organizes cleaning of the coast, the sea and the
        sea bed, year after year. This year, we are marking the 15th anniversary
        of continuous sea-bed-cleaning operations, which we have achieved owing
        to cooperation with a number of athletes and members of Croatian and
        foreign diving clubs. We could not mark this imposing anniversary had
        the divers not been with us the whole time, and responded to the operation
        every time. </p>

      <p align="left" >This year, it is under the slogan “The Sea Remembers”,
        because it always pays us back hundredfold. And us from the Tourist Association
        remember your efforts over the years. Many thanks to all the participants
        who have directly or indirectly been included in cleaning of Rovinj sea
        and seaboard in these 15 years” – said Dano Crniæ, Director of Rovinj

        record number of 150 divers from seven European countries –Italy, Slovenia,
        Germany, Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Austria and Croatia
        - responded to the traditional environmental operation of cleaning the
        sea bed. They were supposed to clean the town harbour, and among various
        types of waste were a pistol and a bycicle wrapped up in algae. The waste
        has been taken out and left in nylon bags on the town quay, for citizens
        of Rovinj and vividly interested tourists to be proud of.

  the harbour was stock-fished with about a thousand units of sea bass fry. </p>
