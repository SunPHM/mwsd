              Identification</p>
            <p class="body"> The origional hand written label states simply - 
              "Panormo Model Double Bass Manufactured by Hawkes &amp; Son London 
              1910". The words HAWKES &amp; SON LONDON engraved at the bottom 
              of each of the two brass half plates on the pegbox and the large 
              (height: 3.0cm x width 2.1cm) capital purfilled letter "H" below 
              the back button confirm 100% that this is a top of the range Panormo 
              Model instrument. </p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Can you tell me a little bit about the instruments 
              that were manufactured by Hawkes &amp; Son?</p>
            <p class="body"> Yes we can. The instruments manufactured by Hawkes 
              &amp; Son during the latter quarter of the nineteenth century and 
              the first half of the twentieth century were often supplied to the 
              many army and military bands that existed especially in England. 
              There were three grades of instruments, namely Professor, Concert 
              and Panormo, that were based on the unsurpassable form of Vincenzo 
              Panormo`s instruments. </p>
            <p class="body"> All the models are characterized by their violin 
              outline, deep ribs and generous proportions. The Professor was a 
              flat back model with upper angle break, and often had outside linings, 
              while the Concert and Panormo were produced with full swell backs. 
              In addition there were some instruments that were manufactured in 
              France &#8211; Riviere &amp; Hawkes &#8211; based on an entirely 
              different model. </p>
            <p class="body"> Some instruments were made here in England but so 
              as to meet the huge demand for these robust and well-constructed 
              instruments a great majority were imported from Germany and France 
              - the Concert and Panormo models being superior in their choice 
              of timber, workmanship and finish than those of the Professor. In 
              1924 the four string Professor instruments were being advertised 
              at &pound;22, the four string Concert at &pound;26 and the four 
              string Panormo model was &pound;36. For the three string versions 
              of these same models prices were &pound;20, &pound;24 and &pound;32 
              respectively. The advert aptly proving that in England there was 
              still some demand for the three stringed instrument even at this 
              late date. </p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> So the "Panormo Model" is King?</p>
            <p class="body"> Yes it is. The Panormo instruments were made (Reputedly 
              by a man with a surname called Green &#8211; Hawkes &amp; Son did 
              a great job in keeping the names of their makers a closely guarded 
              secret.) entirely in England to an incredibly high standard. Just 
              take a look at this instrument - the choice of timber is absolutely 
              superb, the proportions are simply glorious, the scroll is masterful, 
              the peg box is generous, the brass machines are to the highest standard 
              of engineering (they are so, so smooth) imaginable and as for the 
              varnish is of quite an unsurpassable quality.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Recent history of this instrument.</p>
            <p class="body"> As a precaution measure The Contrabass Shoppe removed 
              the table from this instrument to make sure that both block areas 
              and all the cracks and edging are as secure and as structurally 
              sound as possible. While the table was off we found a pencil inscription 
              on the bass bar from the maker and restorer Mike Hart and on the 
              bass side upper back we found a very faint pencil inscription - 
              presumably from another restorer - "G. Blackburn Jan 1977".</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Highly Recommended</p>
            <p class="body"> The Contrabass Shoppe has known this instrument for 
              many years. It used to belong to a long serving member of The London 
              Philharmonic Orchestra for several decades of its life &#8211; then 
              some thirteen years ago we sold it on to a player in the Royal Philharmonic 
              Orchestra. The RPO bass section is renowned the world over for its 
              formidable sounding bass section - that&#8217;s got to be a good 
              enough recommendation in any bodies books as to the quality and 
              quantity of sound that this instrument produces. In addition to 
              serving its former owners proud throughout their professional careers 
              this instrument has proved to be quite an incredible investment. 
              With Panormo model instruments being as desirable as they are &#8211; 
              the investment opportunity is sure to continue.</p>
