        <p><strong>BPI&#8217;S GIANT SEA BASS DONATED TO BENEFIT STUDENTS</strong></p>
        <p><br>
          Black Pearls, Inc. / Kona Blue Water Farms has been conducting experimental 
          tank culture trials with the Hawaiian Giant Sea Bass at our Kona facility. 
          This fish is one of the most highly-prized food fishes in Asia. <br>
          BPI has been working with some of the leading chefs in Kona to increase 
          their awareness of this superb table fish. Keo Velasquez (head chef 
          at the Hokulia Resort restaurant), and Jean Hull (former head of the 
          University of Hawaii Center at West Hawaii Culinary Arts Program) were 
          both so enthusiastic about these Giant Sea Bass that they selected them 
          as a centerpiece in the &#8220;Christmas at Kona Village&#8221;, in 
          December, 2002. </p>
        <p>BPI donated over 40 of these fish, at between 3 to 4 lbs size, to this 
          event, which was held to raise funds for scholarships for the University 
          of Hawaii Center at West Hawaii Culinary Arts Program. <br>
          More information on the Giant Sea Bass is included below, with photographs 
          of the harvest, Keo preparing the fish, and the guests enjoying Keo&#8217;s 
          presentations. The response from the guests and the other chefs at the 
          event was tremendous.</p>

<h3><font color="000099">HAWAIIAN GIANT SEA BASS</font></h3>
<p>Farm-raised in Kona, in land-based tanks, by Kona Blue Water Farms</p>
<p><br>
  The Giant Sea Bass is native to Hawaii, but it is extremely rare around these 
  islands. These fish were reared in land-based tanks by Kona Blue Water Farms, 
  a fish farming company based at the Natural Energy Laboratory at Keahole Point, 
  Kona. <br>
  <br>
  This species is the largest member of the grouper family. In the wild, Giant 
  Hawaiian Sea Bass can grow to over 1000 lbs, and over 9 feet in length. They 
  range from Hawaii throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific region, as far west as 
  the Red Sea and South Africa. In the wild, the Giant Sea Bass feed on spiny 
  lobsters, mud crabs, fishes (including small sharks and rays) and juvenile sea 
  turtles. </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  Giant Sea Bass are one of the most highly-prized food fishes in Asia. They have 
  consequently been subject to heavy fishing pressure, and in most places they 
  have been wiped out by overfishing. <br>
  By developing culture techniques for this fish, and other species, Kona Blue 
  Water Farms hopes to turn the past history of decimation of reef fish into a 
  sustainable, environmentally-friendly industry. The company has also developed 
  culture methods for opakapaka, hapu&#8217;upu&#8217;u (Hawaiian grouper), kampachi 
  (Hawaiian amberjack) and mahimahi, and is applying for an offshore lease from 
  the State to farm these native species in the open ocean waters off Kona. <br>
