            <p class="innerheaders">How do you know that this instrument was made 
              in Mittenwald?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Well for a start the instrument bears a small 
              printed label that simply states "Handarbeit aus Mittenwald" 
              In a very tiny font "Made in Germany" is printed directly 
              underneath this. The second strong indication of origin is the tidy 
              workmanship and presentation which is typical for an instrument 
              of this quality that was made in the Mittenwald region in the years 
              that followed the end of the Second World War. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">What is most typical?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> The plumb-red varnish over a yellow ground 
              is most typical of the Mittenwald school. In addition the smallish 
              "three-quarter" size viol-shape and the use of outside 
              linings - to add strength and support to the edges - were commonly 
              used. Taking a look at the peg-box one will notice the original 
              machines - set on brass half-plates. Although very functional they 
              somehow don't have the weight and quality of machines that 
              one finds on decent quality instruments that were made an additional 
              fifty years or so earlier. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">So where exactly is Mittenwald?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Mittenwald is located at the foot of the Bavarian 
              Alps in the very south of Germany. Between the end of the 15th and 
              the 17th century Mittenwald prospered as it lay directly on the 
              lower trade route between Augsberg and Venice.</span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Isn't Mittenwald famed for its violin 
              making?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Yes it is. Mathias Klotz (1653-1743) returned 
              to Mittenwald in ca. 1685 and can be considered the founder of violin 
              making in Mittenwald. He ran a large workshop in which he trained 
              his three sons as well as many other violin makers from the area. 
              Today the town still has a violin making school and there is a museum 
              devoted to the evolution of stringed instruments and to old Mittenwald.</span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">So that's a very brief history of Mittenwald 
              but I'd like to know some more about the instrument.</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Well, we would like to describe the instrument 
              as being in mint condition - but for the fact that there is 
              one minor well-restored wing crack on the table - we'd best 
              describe it as being in very-near-mint condition. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Have you done anything to the instrument at 
              all?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Yes we've undertaken a full set up using 
              a top quality fingerboard and an Aubert bridge fitted with our incredibly 
              smooth brass adjusters. There is also a new sound post and quality 
              brass end-pin unit, a new top nut and a new bottom saddle. In addition 
              we felt that the sound and tone of the instrument could be improved 
              considerably by making some internal adjustments. Courtesy of M.J. 
              Bailey Luthier Ltd the neck has been reset to the correct angle, 
              the table has been regraduated and a new bass bar has been fitted.</span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Phew - all in all that was quite a bit 
              of work then?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Yes indeed it was. But in our opinion it has 
              been worth all the effort - for the instrument now sounds absolutely 
              fantastic. There is plenty of volume and tone of considerable maturity 
              and the re-shaped neck (I forgot to mention that earlier) feels 
              like a million dollars. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">What about Value for money?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> With restoration work amounting to &pound;1762-00
                 and the cost of the fittings amounting to &pound;660-00 - I'd
                  say that with a price tag of only &pound;7500-00 you definitely
                   are getting a lot of instrument for your money. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Summary.</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Of particular merit is the advantageous string 
              length (only 40.90in /103.8cm) the sound (well rounded) and the 
              condition (immaculate). Could this smallish instrument be exactly 
              what you've been looking for? I think that it could well be.</span></p>
