is a 1962 Fender jazz bass I recently bought on eBay. The body and neck
(refretted) have both been refinished but all the other parts are original
to the instrument. The tuners had been changed to Schallers but fortunately
the original Klusons were retained and included in the sale.</font></font></font>

slider switches were added to the pickguard in the '60's and it looks as
if the thumb rest was moved to above the strings at some point as there
are a couple of extra holes. The only other issue is that some of the screws
are not correct, but I hope to replace most of these with vintage originals.</font></font></font>

cured, the neck finish was flat sanded and buffed. You'll notice the edge
of the headstock on the 'circle' is slightly rounded, this was done on
the previous refinish. The bass had been carried around for years in a
(badly designed) home made case, the headstock edge rested against a hinge
that had a large bolt through it and this over time wore away the edge
of the headstock. When refinished last time, the damage was simply sanded
away and the result is the rounded edge you see here. Fortunately the classic
shape is still there...</font></font></font></td>

from swivelling anyway....?</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>So
there we are, one fully restored 1962 slab board Fender Jazz bass, refinished
in ultra thin nitro-cellulose. Some might be surprised by my decision to
go for a 10 out of 10 finish, or perhaps more correctly, a kind of 'closet
classic' look, I'm not sure why but I just felt that it would suit it better
than a distressed look. There are a few dings and knocks here and there,
marks that I didn't want to sand out, etc. so it's not totally 'new' looking.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>It
plays incredibly, and that sound.....I know it's a cliche, but it's pure
vintage jazz bass, roll off that neck pickup and you're straight into 'Jaco'
mode......awesome!</font></font></font>

<center><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+3>A
bit of history...</font></font></font></u></b></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Peter,
the previous owner, told me a bit about the bass when I spoke to him prior
to bidding. He bought the bass in 1967, it had the original sunburst finish
back then, the slider switches had already been installed in the pickguard
at that time and he tells me that they had never worked since the day he
bought it.</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>The
original sunburst finish was stripped in 1976, he was working in a band
with a lead guitarist who had a black guitar, this guitarist insisted that
the other guitar player and bass player should have white guitars to contrast
against his, hence the sunburst coming off and the white going on...</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>It
was at this time that the Kluson reverse tuners were changed to Schallers,
the originals were felt to be a bit sloppy (aren't they all...?), luckily
the originals were not thrown away and are now where they should be...back
on the bass!</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>The
original frets were replaced in 1981, other than a change of pickguard
(to a black one at some point), the bass remained unchanged until I got
my hands on it!</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Apparently
this very bass is pictured in Noddy Holder's autobiography, as Peter was
the bass player in one of Noddy's pre-Slade bands.</font></font></font>
