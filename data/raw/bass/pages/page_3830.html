<h3>This page is about having fun under water.
<br>Nobody does it better than Mel</h3>


<p>
     More than half a life time ago, in a place like Shangri La, I met
a guy that wanted to dive. He had done some snorkeling in the Bahamas
and wanted to try SCUBA. It might have been my suggestion, I do admit.
Well, he wasn't certified and I was fairly certifiable, so we went to
this spot I liked. Perhaps the dive spot was not the best for a beginner.
I finally decided that it was too dangerous even for me. This was
<A HREF="d_sc.htm">
Greyhound Rock</A> near Santa Cruz and it's easily about the most nasty
diving in California.

<p>     Well, the dive went fine and that was that... or was it? More than
20 years later, I went for an invitational dive on the Truth and who
should be there, but Mel. He said "now I are a dive nut". He was
telling the truth. Perhaps he defines a dive nut the best way it can be
done. Look at these pictures and tell me he doesn't have a great time
diving. He even got certified.<br>
     I can only tell so many
of his stories, but I know of a couple of doozies and there are a couple
of them as he told them to me, so they will be here along with some nice
pictures taken while he was funning.
<br><br>
     I always know that if I see his light at night and it is not moving
fast, go check it out. He's got a hold of something.<br>
<br>
     This is a different kind of page than most on my site. There is no
way that I can tell his stories the way I can tell mine, but they are
such great stories that I had to try.

     I was swimming at Long Point Catalina, when this school of about 20
Yellowtails went by. They sort of made a curve as they went past, so it
was an easy to get a good shot. The fish really fought, so I released line
from my reel. It turned around and went in shallow. I was worried that it
could get tangled in some kelp and get loose, so I grabbed the line and
worked my way up it. I saw the spear on the bottom ahead and figured that
I had lost the fish. It turned out that the spear had gone all the way
through it and the fish was still on the line, but it was a ways up above
the spear itself.<br>
     Another time near there, I shot a nice 10 pound Bonita, even though
it was really Yellowtail that I was looking for. Later, I was swimming with
the bait fish and sure enough some nice sized yellows went by. I shot about
a 15 pounder and it wasn't on the spear well, so I decided to swim in near
shore to deal with it. On the way, I passed over a Halibut, out in the open
on a rock in about 25 feet of water. I kept swimming a ways and then got the
Yellowtail off my spear and into the bag. Sure enough, when I went back the
Halibut was still there. It measured 27 inches.

     Then one night there was this Halibut in the sand, but I had no gun.
What could I do? I knifed it of course.

seahunt........I just got back from a killer trip on the Westerly to Santa 
Barbara Island. I feel compelled to brag. We caught a perfect break in the 
weather for both days. On the last dive of the trip I ran into Shel underwater as I 
exited a hole with my tank off. He signaled to me "where's your game bag?". I 
had left it on the boat. So I figured if I caught any lobsters I'd tie them up 
with a cord I keep in my weight belt as a fish stringer or else put them 
under my weight belt. I did just that. I ended up with 3 bugs tied in a bundle 
with the cord attached to my waist clip, 2 bugs on my stomach tightly pinned 
under my weight belt, and the last one ( a 4 pounder ) I just held by the 
tail with my left hand and let him cling to my left forearm with all his legs 
( which he did faithfully) until we got back to the boat. I passed up another 
4 or 5 legal bugs on the way back to the boat because I had nowhere else to 
put them! The guys on the boat were pretty amused with the sight of me 
returning to the boat looking like I was being attacked by a six-pack of 
killer lobsters. Obviously I had a great trip............... <br>
*****<br>
Later, he mentioned to me that he could have probably put one under 
his shoulder strap.
</p><hr><p>
     This is one story as he told it to me. This is the kind that you
remember.<br><br>

     I was diving at the east end rock quarry, just past the rocks,
over the sand. I was looking for bugs, when I saw a shark come out
of the haze. This is a spot that I regularly night dive and this was
a large Great White Shark. I moved over to the rocks and became part
of the reef. This was something to see as it swam to about 10 feet
away. It was grey and had the body flattened as it became the tail.
No question about what it was. It was looking at me, but had no
apparent interest. It was just went cruising along the reef. Hmmm.
time to relax and check out the reef right here.<br>
     I continued the dive and saw it again about 30 feet away as it
swam a bit off the reef. It was not something to follow.

Hi again guys.....This Bug was caught off the Raider Sat. on a ledge I called 
"8 lb Bug reef" due to the results of my first dive there 2 yrs ago. Now I 
might re-name it "9.5 lb Bug reef". Thanks to the good example of my 
friends Donna & Shel, The Big guy was released after the picture and was last 
seen swimming back to the bottom in a hurry. The other bugs caught that day 
weren't so lucky. Take care....Mel

Greetings from Labugman.......The Rapture was at it again this weekend. Kerry, Guy<br> 
and I went to Catalina for night and day diving. Mostly the usual stuff until a<br> 
dive on Saturday afternoon. I was seeing thousands of lobsters at this spot, all<br> 
shorts. I was enjoying them, totaly mesmerized by them. as I rounded a large rock<br> 
there was a hole in the rockpile next to it filled with a bugs face. The pictures<br> 
tell the rest of the story. It was a new personal best, 11.5 lbs. After the photo <br>
shoot he was let go, back to his harem. Lucky for various reasons wasn't he?<br> 
Take care.....Mel

Hi guys...  This is disgusting. I had more good luck at PV this weekend. Since Friday I got several more fish. One was 40.5 lbs and the other was 49.5 lbs. I weighed them at 22nd st landing. Here are some more pictures. I know they just make some of you hate me more. Sorry.......Mel

Hi Mike....I have some shark wrestling stories for you. The first occured several years ago on the backside of Catalina at a place aptly named Shark Harbor. While hunting for white seabass a soupfin shark swam under me. Viewing it only from above, I shot it thinking it was a seabass. When it turned I realized it was a shark. I pulled it in and grabbed it by the gills and wrapped my legs around its' tail end like a wrestler. It was squirming in my arms while I got my spear shaft back. a friend swam up and said " looks like you got your hands full". He was right.....Now this brings us to the other day. I'm diving at a local spot when I shoot a white seabass. I dispatch it with a knife to the head and start to put it on my stringer when it slips out of my hand and sinks to the bottom. I dive down to the 40 ft. bottom to get it and found it seemingly alive. How could this be? Well, a shark had it by the tail and was shaking it violently. His head was waving back and forth. It was a 4 to 5 ft. blue shark. I tried to grab the fish and pull it out of his mouth but the shark yanked it out of my hand before I could get a good grip on it and started to swim off with it. The thought had occurred to me that this shark was not normally a threat to bite a person but that many animals will bite if you're trying to take food out of their mouth.  At this point I needed to head back up for air. The excitement had brought my heart rate up. As I surfaced I saw that the shark had dropped the fish but was heading back for it. As I caught my breath at the surface I decided the fish was not worth the hassle of going back down after it. It wasn't a very big fish anyway. I let the shark have his feast and moved on. I've had enough with shark wrestling for now......Mel

<b>Hi Guys.....Just got back from my trip to Mexico tuna hunting at El Banco. We got hammered<br />
by the weather on the first day. Skip still managed to shoot an average one, around 100 lbs.<br /> 
I had many sightings but was not able to get a shot off at one. A couple of them must have been <br />
near 200 lbs! They were difficult to approach. I did manage to shoot and miss at a 40 lb wahoo.<br /> 
The water was so clear and the fish so big that it was hard to judge the distances. The next <br />
day we saw very few fish. A dozen commercial fishing boats had pulled in and were working the <br />
area. They had busted up the fish pretty good. I did manage to shoot and miss at a 200 lb blue<br /> 
marlin! That was very exciting! At first I thought it was a tuna. As I dove down on it I thought<br /> 
it was a shark, long and slender . Then I saw the bill and I knew it was a marlin. The next day<br /> 
the fishing boats were gone and the tuna were back. They were easier to approach from above than<br /> 
from the side. Finally I dropped down on one as a school came below me. I shot and landed my <br />
first tuna, a baby one by El Banco standards at 46.5 lbs. It was a blast and all I can say is <br />
"I'll be back".........Mel</b><br />

Tom & I went to San Clemente Island for a two day trip this weekend. On Sat. tom got a 20 lb WSB and that was it for the day although we spotted several times. Next day we dove several new spots Tom got from fisherman sources. At the last spot of the day I found a school of WSB out in the sand. I shot and lost one just before Tom came by. We dove the area together for awhile and Tom finally got one of them. I was diving down to a 35 ft bottom and croaking to bring them in. Finally 3 of them swam by and gave me a shot. I landed my only fish of the trip. A great ending to a wonderful trip.......Take care...Mel

On the second day, Mel again pulled the largest with Dale Lopez a close second. First day Mel got the largest and Carol Beck got the second largest
<br /><br />
October 11-12, 2005 was the Dr. Death Invitational on the Peace to Tanner Bank, Cortes Bank, and Santa Barbara Island. Twenty divers during the 2-day trip pulled two hundred and twenty five bugs. The first day the largest bugs came from Cortes Bank, both were in the high 4 pound range. The second day produced bugs over 6 pounds from Santa Barbara Island.

Mike.....This weekend I went night diving at Catalina with Tom Chung. We had an incredible, almost surreal experience as we accidentally landed in a squid run with phosphorescence in the water. We dove deep on the sand between 70 and 110 feet. There were thousands of squid everywhere and they followed us around attracted to our lights. As they wham they left lighted trails from the plankton in the water. I was able to snatch one by hand as he glided by me. He wiggled a little and then I let him go. Many of the squid were attached by their tentacles in a love embrace. There were dozens and dozens of dead squid lying on the bottom and guess who was there to eat them....Bugs....lots of them. They were there having their Thanksgiving feast. So were seals, angel sharks and a torpedo ray. There were probably halibut too but I didn't spot any.Back at the boat we were given a light show all night by the squid hovering around and the seals chasing them.They left trailers wherever they went. It was a starry starry night  and in the morning there were thousands of seagulls circling around the area. They too were going to somehow partake in this Thanksgiving feast. For me it was a feast for the senses that I'll never forget. Another reminder of why I love The sport of diving so much......Mel

Hi Mike...Just got back from diving Mexico. We didn't get the tuna we were looking for but I did land this nice Mexican Sailfish. He put up quite a fight. At first he dragged me across the  surface of the water for a while. Then He jumped completely out of the water right in front of our panga and spun like a spinner dolphin. In doing so his tail was wrapped with the shooting line. Shortly after that he pooped out and was easily pulled up to the boat.He weighed about 85 lbs.and is my largest fish to date. I went south after the monster tuna....I didn't think I'd end up " sailing"...Take care.....Mel

Mike....You're on for some bug diving the 17th. I Just had an awesome trip with Shel. We went to SBI on Friday night and tried some freediving for bugs. It was rough, lots of surge,bad vis and no bugs. We were both skunked. We anchored for the night and waited to do some damage with our nitrox tanks in the morning. We started at a cave I visit once in awhile. It has it's main opening at 90 ft. and angles up to about 60 ft inside. It has several holes in the ceiling big enough for someone to swim through. The anchor chain was draped across one of those hole and we went in. Right away I knew we had hit it good. There were bugs all over. The wall of the cave had one section that looked like it was hairy from the side....It was a mass of antenna. Shel and I went to work. We were busy. I quit looking for bugs near the end of the dive and exited through one of the portholes in the ceiling. The whole area was filled with bubbles which were leaking through the cracks in the rock.It was surreal. We both had our legal limit of course....Shel's bag had  20 (lbs) and mine 29 (lbs). We did some experimental dives after that but the memory of that cave dive will be something he and I talk about forever. See you soon....Mel
