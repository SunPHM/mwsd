<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Michael Praetorius (1571-1621)- </b></font> the inventor of the double bass in the 17 century.</p>
<p align="left">The instrument he created had five strings, and was over 8 feet
tall. His drawings of the instrument basically looked liked a very large violin
with sloped shoulders and a flat back.</p>
<p align="left">During the baroque period it had huge strings
that were impossible to play. If not for the invention of over wound strings, the
bass of today would not exist. The strings also made it possible to create a
smaller bass without messing up the sound. For instance, the bass of today is
only a 3/4 size.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Domenico Dragonetti (1763 - 1866) - </b>the first great
player of the bass. In fact he is one of the main reasons that the bass is still
alive today. To help him was his close friend Beethoven. He had many revolutionary
performances that showcased his talent and techniques. He was so well known that
many composers would see him next to the concertmaster. They did this so that he
could play the cello and violin parts as he saw fit.</p>
