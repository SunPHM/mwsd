        SHALLOW WATER BASS<br>

        In many areas of the Midwest, especially in the spring, largemouth bass can be found in shallow water.  And, much of the time, these bass will be biters.  Here’s how you can take advantage of this action.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <img border="1" src="../images/weed_bass.jpg" alt="Shallow Bass" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="225" height="191">First of all, be aware that these shallow bass are protected in some areas.  Be sure to check on regulations.  If chasing them is permitted, it is imperative to release any bass you catch.  They are in the shallows in preparation of spawning, and we need to make sure that they are released so they can spawn.<br>
        <br>
        Bays on the north side of the lake, canals, any area that warms up first will be the best spots to start.  Afternoons will usually be better than mornings, as the water will be warmer in the afternoon than in the morning.  Warm days will be more productive than cool days.  Simply put, the warmest areas will almost always have the bass that are more willing to bite.<br>
        <br>
        When fish are in shallow water we need to be quiet.  Shallow water fish can be very skittish.  If they detect the angler’s presence, they are probably going to be hard to catch.  Long casts will be very helpful and will result in better catches.<br>
        <br>
        Most anglers prefer to sneak into a suspected fish-holding area with an electric motor.  Shut the outboard motor off a good distance away from the area to be fished to avoid spooking the fish.  Minn Kota electric motors are very quiet and permit a silent approach.<br>
        <br>
        A couple of techniques will produce bass in the shallows.  Spinnerbaits are great in the shallows, and they allow an area to be covered quite quickly.  Sometimes a straight retrieve will be good, but much of the time it works well to employ a lift-drop retrieve.  When the bait approaches a clump of reeds or something else that the bass might be hanging out near, a slight delay of the bait will often trigger a strike.  It is important that the spinnerbait being used has a high-quality ball-bearing swivel that allows the blade to continue to turn as it falls.  The Pro-Model Reed-Runner spinnerbaits are great for this technique.<br>
        <br>
        The spinnerbaits will usually do a very good job.  However, it works well to show the fish a couple of choices.  One angler, probably the one in the bow of the boat, should throw the spinnerbait: The other angler should throw a Power Slug.  Power Slugs are plastic and designed to be fished slower.  Sometimes the bass are more likely to attack these plastic baits.<br>
        <br>
        The Slug should be slowly jerked around the cover.  The six-inch size is usually best, but in super-clear water, or if the fish are just bumping the six-inch size, try a four-incher.<br>
        <br>
        The strike will be pretty soft.  A white Slug is easier to see in the water, which will help detect strikes.  Often an angler will see the strike before feeling it.  Be sure to delay just a second before setting the hook.<br>
        <br>
        There are not many things better than spending a warm spring day in a shallow bay with biting bass.  Give it a try and you will find out why so many anglers look forward to this action.
