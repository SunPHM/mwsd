<p align="left">Todd joined Triple Threat
in March of 2001. 
Todd has been in bands since the age of 12 on drums
and on and off on bass since he was 18. "Drums were my first love.  
I tried guitar--but it never really took.  Then, in 1989, I
saw an amazing bass player who broke all the stiff bass player stereotypes--he transformed mundane 70's tunes into funk
wonders and made me think 'I wanna do that.'  Before I knew it, I traded
my guitar rig in on a bass rig." 

<p align="left">Todd jokes:  "My goal on either instrument is to rise
above the shackles of my race and help the rhythm section cut a groove
deep enough to swim in."</P>

<p align="left">Todd's bass influences include Tad Kinchla of Blues
Traveler,  Geddy Lee of Rush, friend and former bandmate
<a href="jimbio.htm">Jim Billmeier</a> (who would be mortified to know he was
mentioned in the same
sentence as Rush), and funk/blues master <a
href="http://www.samcockrell.com/">Sam Cockrell</a> (Chicago local).  On
drums, Todd was heavily influenced by  Neil Peart of Rush, but admits "I'm
feeling much better now."  Other heavy influences include Carter Beauford
of the Dave Matthews Band, Stewart Copeland of the Police, Dan Tomlinson
(tour drummer with Lyle Lovett), and John Von Ohlen of the <a
href="http://www.bluewispjazzclub.com/">Blue Wisp</a> Big Band in
Cincinnati, OH.  Prior to Brian joining Triple Threat, Todd would
frequently fill in on drums for half a set allowing Tony to sing lead,
with the keys player  covering the bass parts. Now, Todd only gets to drum on
acoustic
duo gigs as one of Dean's&quot;Drummers du jour.&quot;</p>

Random q/a with Todd:</b></font></P>
<P align="left">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="white">
  
Favorite drink: <b>Pint o' Bass (pithy, yes) and a water. </b><br>
  <br> 
  
Favorite TT original: <b>Into the Night</b>  Hey--Brian and I agree on something!<br>
  <br>
  
Favorite TT cover: <b>Popa Chubby's "Palace of the King" off <i>Booty and
  the Beast</i>.  Drivin, funky, scorchin Chubby-ness.</b><br>
  <br>
  
Favorite piece of musical gear: <b> "Bub," Peavey Cirrus 4 w/ a Bubbinga
  top.  I really like my Eden cabinet too....and my GK head.   Ah hell,
  I just like  GEAR!</b><br>
  <br> 
  
Most shameful piece of musical gear owned: <b>Oh that's easy because
  it's really shameful: music stand with chart book at the ready. While Dean remembers
  every song he's ever played since 8th grade, on bass, I can't remember anything
  we haven't played in the past 8 weeks...and our catalog is rather largish!</b><br>
  <br>
  
What motivated you to start in music?  <b>MTV and cable came into my home
  in the very early 80's. You know, back in their
  first year when they played music videos. Everyone looked
  cool--especially that little Italian drummer from Loverboy with all those
  drums around him on <i>Workin for the Weekend</i>.
  </b><br>
  <br>
  
What artist do you like that you feel really guilty about liking?
  <b>Duran Duran.  John Taylor is a monster bassist mostly obscured by the
  group's panty-moistening pop stardom in the 80's.  </b><br>
  <br>
  
If I were on a desert island, was smart enough to build a CD player and
  headphones from coconuts and palm leaves and fashion a solar panel to power
  it, and could only have 1 album to play in it, what would it be: <b>
  Popa Chubby  Booty and the Beast  (this answer changes weekly though)</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  
Most interesting experience had while peforming (music that is): 
  <b>At a Blues benefit at a home for the mentally challenged, seeing
  people dancing their hineys off while wearing soft helmets at 4pm in the afternoon--that was
  cool.  Followed closely by at that same gig, seeing a resident come
  into the gym with his pants down with another resident trailing behind
  him trying to pull his pants back up.</b><br>
  <br>
  
Song that changed your life and why: <b>Probably the first 4 songs by
  Rush off the Exit Stage Left live album experienced shortly after I
  took up drums.  Neil and Geddy set me in motion for being a bass/drum
  rhythm section maven. </b> <br>
  <br>
  
Dream car: <b>
  Still searching for it, but it gets 200MPG, has zero emissions, can hold my PA
  and
  bass
  rig,
  does
  0-60
  in
  5
  seconds,
  costs
  $1000, requires no maintenance, has a kickin sound system, and can't be broken
  into
  without
  mortally
  wounding
  the
  would-be thief. Oh and cup holders....lots
  of cupholders.</b><br>
  <br>
  What you actually drive:<b> 2001 Subaru Outback.  Chicks dig guys in
  glorified station wagons, yeah baby!  It does fit a lot of gear though....</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="white">Most frequently encountered musical
    question or request: <b>Freebird. I mean, in Chicago? We're closer to Canada
    than the Mason-Dixon line. You know, one day we'll play it--The whole damned
    thing. And keep playing it until the (invariably drunk guy trying to make
    his buddies laugh) that thought it'd be funny to yell &quot;Freebird&quot;
    pays
    us $100 to stop, or gets pummeled by others in the bar. News would spread,
    and this phenomenon might end. At least that's the
dream. Am I still talking? Really, I'm not this bitter. :-)<br>
    </b></font><font size="2" face="Arial" color="white"><br>
      Favorite clean/short joke: <b>A horse walks into a bar, walks up to the
      bar.  Bartender looks him up and down and says "Hey buddy, why the
      long face?"</b><br>
      <br>
      Name something about your bandmates that most people wouldn't guess:
      
      <b>Dean's a 3rd dan blackbelt, a former semi-pro baseball and football
      player, and   the only person I know that's busier  than I am.   Brian
      is the slammingest drumming middle  school health teacher I've ever met!  (Ask
      him all your STD questions.) Tony was once a Roman Catholic bishop before he
      discovered women.  Note: One of the prior 3 statements is false.   </b>

The FOTTers (affectionate term for the Friends Of
Triple Threat--or equally--Friends of Todd):</b>
<ul>
<li><a
href="http://www.toddh.net/music/">Toddh.net</a> Todd's personal page with
a delightful array of miscellanea
<li><a href="http://www.harlemavenuelounge.com/">Harlem Avenue Lounge</a>
Todd periodically drops into the HAL open mic on Thursdays in hopes of absorbing Mojo
from
some of Chicago's top Blues players. 
<li><a href="http://www.paulineyorkband.com/">The Pauline York Band</a>
Friend Jim Billmeier's current project--solid female-fronted blues trio!
Another HAL regular.
<li><a href="http://www.opalcandy.com/">Opal Candy</a> Friend Mike
Zatezalo's current project.  Great musicianship, edgy alt-rock.   Another HAL regular.
<li><a href="http://www.pistolpete.net/">Pistol Pete</a> - Blues guitar
wizardry.  See em with Chris Schach on bass and watch Pete's boys hang
on for the musical ride!
<li><a href="http://www.bigjames.com/">Big James and the Chicago
Playboys</a>  Wonderful Chicago Blues band.  Rock solid rhythm section
with Cleo Cole and CC on drums and bass.  Superb musicianship all
around and tasty horns for a bit of a Motown bent. 
<li><a href="http://borderlinechicago.com/">Borderline - Chicago Rock</a> A young
  band from my rather musical neighborhood that's got some mojo. I got to sub
  in with them on drums in Summer of 05 and
  that was quite a good time rockin out to the likes of Greenday and Ozzy and
  their solid originals.
