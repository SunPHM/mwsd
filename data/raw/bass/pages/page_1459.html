          <hr width="75%" noshade size="1" color="#91559F">
          <p class="feature" >Who are they?</p>
    <p><b>guitar and voice</b>&nbsp; Jonathon Fell<br>
    <b>bass guitar</b>&nbsp; Daniel Jennings<br>
    <b>drums</b>&nbsp; Rob Malton (early gigs featured Fake Ideal's Richard Whitlam)</p>
          <p class="feature">Where might you have seen them?</p>
    <p>They're cutting their teeth supporting bands around Doncaster and Sheffield. Recent
    gigs include the Tut 'n' Shive (Doncaster) and The Leopard (with Manchester lo-fi groups
    Donut Robot and b-fab.U.K.)</p>
    <p>Summer 1999 saw them reach the finals of Doncaster's Battle of the Bands, narrowly
    losing to punk firebrands Fake Ideal.</p>
          <p><img src="john.gif" alt="Mr John Fell on guitar and vocals" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="10" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="256">A 
            history lesson: back in the day John Fell ran around with indie-rock 
            types Thumper, while more recently Rob Malton did drum duties for 
            rockers Skyfall (see last month's spotlight).</p>
          <p class="feature">What they say about themselves.</p>
    <p>&quot;I'm trying to throw all the elements of music I love into what I write, and try
    to do something different with each song. Live, we're slowly getting there. The loud songs
    go down well, the quieter ones less so. I'd like to try to offer something new and
    'different' from the standard white-boy-rock-pub-band-fare. That'd be nice.</p>
    <p align="left">I confess I am a whore for a catchy tune. The kids love it. &quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> - John</b></p>
          <p class="feature">What I say about them.</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;For those who remember mid-nineties Doncaster stars Thumper, The
    Fontanelles formula of deceptively simple lo-fi indie thrills married to first rate
    songwriting will seem delightfully familiar. The link is guitarist, singer, songwriter and
    general creative powerhouse John Fell whose soft, melancholy vocals make Lou Barlow sound
    like that that guy out of Aqua.&quot;<br>
    <b>- Free Press, May 99</b></p>
    <p>&quot;And first in the firing line is the debut tape from new Doncaster band The
    Fontanelles...Freed from the pressures of pleasing a live crowd they seem more able to be
    themselves &#150; sometimes less immediate, but always more rewarding.</p>
    <p>&quot;Impatient types may choose to skip ahead to the scathing rock &#145;n&#146; roll
    of Permanent Record, the blasting scuzzy riffs of which most vividly remind the listener
    that The Fontanelles&#146; mainman is John Fell, former creative powerhouse behind
    should-have-been-big mid nineties types Thumper.</p>
          <p>&quot;Then again, those wanting to hear a little musical<img src="dan.gif" alt="Mr Dan Jennings on bass guitar" align="right" hspace="12" vspace="5" WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="259"> 
            progress may be more interested in follower Less Of The Four-Four 
            with its oddball excursion into dub bass weirdness. Between those 
            two poles there&#146;s tracks like the opener Slipped Away with its 
            surging lo-fi dynamics and tangy atmosphere of palpable desolation. 
            It&#146;s an acutely affecting song about those situations when three&#146;s 
            a crowd and &#150; whoops &#150; the third one is you.</p>
    <p>&quot;Should Have Know and The Man are quietly haunting takes on varieties of emotional
    devastation, while for a bit of light relief there&#146;s the equally bleak Too Old To Die
    which at least sets its misery to a rocking good late John Lennon-esque tune.</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;The prime Wedding Present scuttle of Overrated impresses with its
    steely guitar melodies, but for closer Out it&#146;s back to the depressive majesty that
    The Fontanelles seem to be staking out as their marvellous own territory. Nurse, pass the
    Prozac please. Make that a double.&quot;<br>
