<p><b><tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The piano has been in the same family
since the 1930s and has lived in New York and New Jersey. It has a period
style adjustable artist's bench with an embroidered needlepoint seat cushion
and wooden frame. The case is in good overall condition and is most likely
a shellac finish needed minor polishing and buffing to mask some minor
checking and cracking in the finish. There is a moving gouge on the left
side of the case which could use some minor attention. The case is reported
to be rosewood. Hammers and dampers are recently installed. It appears
that strings may have been replaced in the 1930s, however, there is no
documentation, thus it is possible the strings are original. Pedal assembly
needs minor adjustment. Ivories are in original, clean condition. Metal
plate has good color with minimal fading. Decals are intact and in excellent
condition. Soundboard is reported to be in excellent condition with no
major cracking. Bass tones are reported to be very powerful for this size
case and period instrument.</font></tt></b><b><tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></tt></b>

include action work, additional voicing, new strings and tuning pins, and

<hr SIZE=0 WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Vintage Chicks
have a special following... In some respects these Kool Kats are just downright
ornery when it comes to the perfect Chick. Blind Boone was ornery when
it came to his piano... A Steinway wouldn't do....couldn't take the pounding
he put on the action. Boone needed a tank... and his Chick was a Sherman
tank for the day. Chickering was once a prime contender with Steinway for
the concert stage in the 19th Century. Even Boone County Missouri's William
"Blind" Boone carried around his special tiger stripe oak concert grand
custom made to his specifications for his performances. No other piano
of the day could take the physical abuse of Boone's intense playing and
classical repertoire. When Boone played Liszt... he left pianos destroyed...just
like Liszt did.

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Few grand cases can be found in this
type of pristine original condition for under $20,000 in most markets.
Case detail, leg detail, and music rack ornamentation are very lovely for
this period instrument... a time when manufacturers were looking for ways
to make cases less ornate for a more modern 20th Century appearance to
appeal to a wider market.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><img SRC="Lyre.JPG" NOSAVE height=380 width=216><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Restoration
at a later date will probably include action work, new strings, possible
pinblock replacement and original sized pins, use of existing pinblock
and oversized pins, or pinblock boring and plugging, using correct sized
original pins. Soundboard will most likely be reusable at future restoration
without replacement but may need some minor attention. Case maintenance
appears to be relatively minor and the pristine ivories are an excellent
plus for original ivory enthusiasts. As always, interested parties are
always advised to get a second inspection or opinion as to the observed
condition on the instrument...and if you don't go see and play for yourself...
you could be missing out on one of the nicest Chick grand cases around
in a wood finish. The case is reported to be rosewood, however, closer
examination of the wood grain from the photos provided suggest that the
case may be some variant of mahogany... in either case...rosewood or mahogany...go
find one of these rascals at your local piano store or the five and dime.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

price, $1,500+- in shipping within the USA, and probably $5,000 to $10,000

investment today of $25,500+- to $30,500+- deferred. This is still under
the full restoration cost NYC prices of an 85 note Steinway O, Small A,
Large A (generally in the mid to upper $30s), or a B which is going to
run you about $40,000. There are more Steinways then Chicks of this era
