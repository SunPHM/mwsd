<br><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>Hello, my name is <a href="mailto:bassts@brevard.edu">Trent
Bass</a> and I am a second year student at Brevard College.&nbsp; I really
enjoy going to school here.&nbsp; Going to a small school was the best
decisions I made about going to college.&nbsp; At Brevard College one is
not just a number like at a major university; here we are able to become
more personable with our professors.&nbsp; In class all questions are encouraged
openly and often sparks open debates in class.&nbsp; Here in the science
department all of the professors are friendly and knowledgeable of the
material they teach.&nbsp; Due to the small class sizes hands on learning
is possible and promoted.</font></font>
<br><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp; MY special interest
is in the field of ecology.&nbsp; I am an ecology major and part of the
ecology club.&nbsp; I also have acquired an internship here in the science
department helping to with biology labs by teaching and prepping for lab.&nbsp;
I am soon to be a member of a biological society Beta, Beta, Beta.&nbsp;
By becoming part of this society it will help me get into graduate school
after I graduate.&nbsp; The one other title that I posses is a Peer Advisor
which is the person who is in charge of making sure everything is okay
where I live. I live in the dorms and make sure that things run smoothly
and keep people safe.</font></font>

Another aspect that is wonderful about coming to Brevard College is that
Pisgah National Forrest is my backyard.&nbsp; Being an ecology major I
naturaly love the outdoors and having a national forrest five minuets away
is great.&nbsp; I really enjoy going for hikes which clears the mind of
all the work that has to be done while in college.&nbsp; Also it is a great
way to get exercise while enjoynig what I am&nbsp;<img SRC="pics/bass_trenttopofcoldmnt.jpg" NOSAVE height=200 width=304 align=RIGHT>doing.&nbsp;
Backpacking is also one of my favorite things to do and the location of
this school enables me to backpack as much as I want (school work permitting).</font></font>
<br><font size=+2><font color="#3333FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My asperations
of the future are to graduate and attend graduate school.&nbsp; After attending
graduate school I hope to obtain a job doing reasearch of animals in the
field.&nbsp; If I could have a job following a group of animals recording
data that would be a dream come true</font>.</font>
