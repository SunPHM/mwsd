<b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;North Sulawesi is one of the 32 provinces</b> in the Republic of Indonesia, with its capital city being Manado (formely also called &quot;Menado&quot;). This region with an area of 1,533,698 ha
is located at 0&ordm;30"- 4&ordm; 3" North Latitude and 121&ordm;127" East Longitude.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the regional government system, North Sulawesi is subdivided into the Manado Municipality, Bolaang Mongondow District, Sangihe Talaud District and Bitung Municipality.
To the North this region borders on the Republic of the Philippines, Sulawesi Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Eastern part is on the Maluku Sea and the Southern side is the Tomini Gulf. The western part
borders Gorontalo Province which until the end of 2000 was a part of North Sulawesi and then became an own province.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain is extremely mountainous and hilly, stretching from Lembean - Wulur Mahatus mountain chain (in Minahasa) continuing to Mount Ambang- Mount Gambuta (in Bolaang Mongondow).
In Sangihe Talaud there are both active and extinct volcanoes, some towering 1,800 - 2,000 meters. Rich volcanic ash has blessed North Sulawesi with fertile lands; the highlands and lowlands
producing rice, coconut, clove, nutmeg, vanilla and vegetables. The plains produce rice and corn in Dumoga, Ayong and Sangkub (Bolaang Mongondow). Plateaus in Tondano (Minahasa) also produce rice and corn,
while Modoinding is know for its vegetables. Sangihe Talaud is recognized for its high quality nutmeg and Rumbia Trees (Sago Palm the source of a special flour for traditional cookies/snack).<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;North Sulawesi is also endowed with many lakes like Lake Tondano and Lake Moat. The rivers like Ongkag Mongondow, Ongkag Dumoga, Sungai Sangkub, Randangan, Bulia and others are utilized mostly for
irrigation of the ricefields. The Tondano River is used to generate electrical power for Manado and Minahasa regions.<BR><BR>

<a NAME="climate"></a>
<br><b><u>CLIMATE</u></b><BR><BR>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other regions in Indonesia</b>, North Sulawesi has a typical equatorial climate with two seasons: rainy and dry. Starting in September, cool Northwesterly winds pick up moisture while crossing the South China
Sea and arrive in the Sulawesi Sea, about November. The wet season lasts from about November to March, and the dry season April to October. The total number of rain days is 90-130 days with approximately 3.000 mm average annual rainfall.
The average temperature is 26 Celsius with the average humidity being 80%.<BR><BR>

<a NAME="flora"></a>

<br><b><u>FLORA &amp; FAUNA</u></b><BR><BR>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The great 19th century naturalist</b>, Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) was the first to observe that the Indonesia archipelago is inhabited by two distinct sets of wildlife.&nbsp; Wallace's Line, as this boundary is still known,
is drawn between Bali and Lombok and between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and continues South of the Philippines and North of Hawaii to mark the difference in the fauna and flora which belonged to the separate land masses in the last ice age.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Sulawesi is believed to have been isolated from both continental shelves and therefore has its own special flora and fauna. Although Kalimantan and Sulawesi are not separated by any significant physical barrier, birds
and mammals of these two islands are different. From the botanical standpoint the line is less apparent, Sulawesi's plants appear to be more closely related to those of other dry parts of the archipelago.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous to Sulawesi are the Anoa (dwarf buffalo), Babi Rusa (a wilds boar with tusks growing through the roof of its mouth), black tailless macaques, kuskus, maleo bird (which incubates its 250 gram eggs in mounds of soil warmed by sunlight,
hot springs or volcanic vents), tarsier (tarsius spectrum -world's smallest primate) with its head and body length of just 10 cm, brightly colored Red - knobbed Hornbill, etc. Many of these species may seen in Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve and Bogani
Nani Wartabone (formerly known as Dumoga Bone) National Park.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Several high-quality woods can be found in these two natural reserves, such as Ebony, Ironwood, linggua, gopasa, nantu, meranti, etc.&nbsp; Rattan and colorful orchids as well as various wild palms and other plant species grow in abundance in
the forest throughout the region.<BR><BR>

<br>&nbsp;

<a NAME="interest"></a>

<br><b><u>PLACES OF INTEREST</u></b><BR><BR>

<b>MANADO</b><BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Manado offers a variety of terrain with hills, volcanic mountains and scenic plateaus.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that Manado was inhabited in the 16th century and was called "Wenang". Later, in 1623 the name was changed to "Manado". Influenced by the foreign occupation, the culture reflects the outside influence. Urbanization of the people
from Sangihe Talaud, Bolaang Mongondow, Gorontalo and Minahasa has resulted in a diverse population and culture.<BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Manado's population is 342,264 people (1996). There are many places of interest in and around the city.<BR><BR>

<BR><b>BUNAKEN SEA GARDEN</b><BR><BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The world famous Bunaken Marine National Park, with an area 75.26 hectares, is located very close to Manado and comprises of 5 islands: Bunaken, Manado Tua, Siladen, Mantehage and Nain.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The superb diving and snokelling sites puts the Marine Park in one of the top 10 dive area of the world and is a mecca for seasoned and beginner divers alike. Wall diving offers a spectacular drop off 100's of meters deep
and the warm water is particularly inviting.<BR><BR>

including equipment hire and meals are extremely competitive.<BR><BR>

<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The original Minahasans</B> are said to originate from Lumimuut, who rose from the sea and gave birth to Tar. After many years separation,
mother and son met again. Not recognizing each other, they married and their descendants populated the region. Minahasan lands and languages were divided
by the god Muntu Untu at Watu Pinabetengan (the dividing stone), a carved rock on the foothills of Mount Soputan.<BR><BR>

Rice surpluses from Minahasa's volcanic hinterland made Manado a strategic port for European traders sailing to and from the spice island of Maluku. Spain
established a fort and Manado Rulers wanted their unruly and corrupt Spanish guests out, and appealed to the Dutch VOC in Ternate for help. The Dutch and
their Minahasan allies eventually gained the upper hand in 1655, built their own fortress in 1658 and expelled the last of the Spaniards a few years later.<BR><BR> 

The Dutch helped unite the linguistically diverse Minahasa confederacy, and in 1693 the Minahasa scored a decisive military victory against the Bolaang to the south.
Dutch influence flourished as the Minahasans embraced European goods and god. Missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were among the first attempts at mass education
in Indonesia, giving their graduates a considerable edge in gaining civil service, military and other positions of influence.<BR><BR>

By the mid 1800s compulsory cultivation schemes were producing huge crops of cheap coffee for a Dutch-run monopoly, Minahasans suffered from this &quot;progress&quot;,
yet economic, religious and social ties with the colonists continued to intensify. Minahasan mercenaries put down anti Dutch rebellions in Java and elsewhere,
earning them the name &quot;anjing Belanda&quot; - &quot;Dutch dogs&quot;.<BR><BR>

The Japanese occupation of 1942-45 was a period of deprivation, and the allies bombed Manado heavily in 1945. During the war of independence that followed,
there was bitter division between pro-Indonesian Unitarians and those favoring Dutch-sponsored federalism. The appointment of a Manadonese Christian, Sam Ratulangi,
as the first republican governor of eastern Indonesia, was decisive in winning Minahasan support for the republic.<BR><BR>

As the young republic lurched from crisis to crisis, Jakarta's monopoly over the copra trade seriously weakened Minahasa's economy. Illegal exports flourished
and in June 1956 Jakarta ordered the closure of the Manado port, the busiest smuggling port in the republic. Local leaders refused and Jakarta backed down.
Soon the Permesta rebels confronted the central government with demands for political, economic and regional reform. Jakarta responded to Manado by bombing
the city in February 1958 then in fighting in June.<BR><BR>

Manado prospered under Indonesia's new order, which implemented many of the economic reports (but few of the political reforms) sought by the Permesta rebels.
The city has a tolerant, outward-looking culture and it will be interesting to see what the future holds with the implementation of Regional Autonomy.<BR><BR>
