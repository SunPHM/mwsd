                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The first 
                mention of Angia (Angie) Jewell (Tom Bass's wife) is in the 1870 
                Audrain County, Missouri census when she was 13 years old. She 
                was living in the town of Mexico with her mother, Ellen Jewell, 
                age 35; sister, Mary, age 20; sister, Lottie, age 18; sister, 
                Phillis age 17; and sister, Emma, age 10. At this time, neither 
                Angie nor Emma could write but they could read.&nbsp; Ellen and 
                eldest daughter Mary had been born in Virginia. The younger four 
                daughters, Lottie, Phillis, Angie and Emma were born in 
                Missouri.&nbsp; This pinpoints the time that Ellen Jewell must have 
                been brought to Missouri as sometime between 1847 and 1850.&nbsp; It 
                is of interest to note that Angie's mother, Ellen was listed as 
                black and so was her oldest sister, Mary. However, Angie and her 
                other sisters who were born in Missouri were listed as mulatto.&nbsp;
                </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sometime in 
                the early 1880’s Tom had met a local Mexico girl named Mima 
                Johnson. Tom and Mima, were not married, but in1881 they had 
                twin boys who were named Ray and Ralph Bass. It appears that Tom 
                had little to do with the raising of the twins although they 
                were around Mexico. </span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">At some 
                point, Angie Jewell moved to St. Louis where she trained to 
                become a teacher.&nbsp; As a new teacher she then returned to Mexico 
                in the early 1880’s. On September 20, 1882, Tom  married 
                Angie at the Second Baptist Church, Mexico, MO. After marrying 
                Tom, Angie took over his business correspondence, money, and 
                bookkeeping. Angie was well educated and by Tom letting her help 
                she could put her creativity and her education to work to 
                develop their business. Tom only had a third grade education. 
                Angie taught her husband to read, and helped him with 
                mathematics and spelling.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help of Angie’s teaching he 
                became an excellent writer.&nbsp; Letters written by Tom show 
                beautiful penmanship as well as good spelling and grammar.</span></p>

                until August 10, 1897, that they had a child - a boy named Inman 
                Thomas Bass. Tom and Angie had been married at least 15 years 
                before Inman was born. Inman was their only child.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 1900 
                census showed that Tom, Angie, Inman, Jessie (Tom's brother), 
                and Emma (Angie's sister) all lived on West Whitney Street in 
                Mexico.&nbsp; Jessie was 24 years old, having been born in February 
                1876. Emma Jewell’s birth date was recorded as November 1864.&nbsp; 
                Both Tom and his brother were described as horse dealers and 
                Emma was a seamstress. It was also noted that Tom’s real estate 
                was free of any debts.&nbsp; All were able to read and write.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 1900 
                Census showed Mima Johnson, the mother of the twins, living in 
                Mexico. She was listed as a servant for the Joseph Barth 
                family.&nbsp; In that census, Mima listed her birth date as December 
                1839 and said that she had had no children.&nbsp; That obviously was 
                not correct.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Mrs. Angie 
                Bass joined the Second Baptist Church in Mexico in 1917 under 
                Rev. G. W. Wright. Tom also was a faithful member of his 
                church.&nbsp; In addition, Tom also made donations to the Log 
                Providence Church in Boone County near his boyhood home.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">By the 1920 
                census, Mima Johnson lived with her son Ray Bass in Mexico. 
                Ray’s age was listed as 36, which was probably incorrect and 
                Mima’s was 60. Ray was apparently the only one of Tom’s sons who 
                had an interest in training horses.&nbsp; However, he was limited by 
                the loss of one hand.&nbsp; Ray was said to resemble his father.&nbsp; He 
                kept a scrapbook to record the winnings of his father’s show 
                ring competitions. Ray died in 1939.</span></p>
                <p class="MsoNormal">
                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">The 1920 
                census shows that Ray’s twin brother, Ralph, was living at 402 
                Fifth Street in Moberly, Randolph County, Missouri.&nbsp; Living with 
                him was his wife, Carrie, and five boarders.&nbsp; During the 1920's 
                Ralph was a special chef for the Official’s car on the Wabash 
                Railroad. He was considered to be one of the finest chefs in the 
                trade.</span></p>

                <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Inman Bass 
                did not share his father’s interest in horses.&nbsp; He enlisted in 
                the U. S. Army at the age of 21, listing his occupation as 
                undertaker.&nbsp; His height was five feet nine inches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inman 
                remained in the army and received his honorable discharge on 
                March 30, 1922.&nbsp; Sometime during his military years, Inman had 
                married as the 1920 census lists Inman’s wife, Freda, and they 
                were living with Tom and Angie.&nbsp; Following his discharge from 
                the military, he enrolled in the Sweeney Auto School in Kansas 
                City. Little is known about Inman during the 1920’s.&nbsp; However, 
                by the early 1930’s, Inman was at the Fulton State Hospital. He 
                died there on March 17, 1932. He was buried in Elmwood Cemetery 
                in Mexico.</span><span style="font-family: Arial"><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]><font size="1">[1]<![endif]></font></span></a><font size="1">

                had died, Ralph Bass was the only survivor. Ralph regretted that 
                Angie never had a relationship with the twins. In fact, they 
                were not mentioned in any of the many Tom Bass obituaries.&nbsp; 
                Ralph once said that, “he was proud to be the son of the world's 
                greatest horsemen.”&nbsp; Ralph died of suffocation during a fire in 
                December 1962. Firemen tried to revive him but they had no luck. 
                At that time, had been working as a butler for Mrs. W. W. 
                Greenland of Moberly, Missouri. </span></p>
