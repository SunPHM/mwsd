<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">OK...for everyone who moaned about Tom Petersson's 
  8-string bass below being on the 12-string site...here is a 12-STRING THUNDERBIRD!!! 
  Even the few who griped about the 8-string DID say that they sure wish there 
  was a 12ver like it. Well, guess what? THERE IS!!! And at 12StringBass.COM we 
  NEVER use photoshop tricks to make up basses that really do not exist, since 
  those would be pretty hard to play, no? This FB12 (again, Hamer uses a &quot;Firebird&quot; 
  model code to designate even the basses, although they are traditionally considered 
  &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;) has the same three-pickup configuration as the FB8 
  below (PBass-Humbucker-Humbucker) and also has the same 3-toggle switch and 
  3-knob layout as Petersson's 8-string. The blueburst sure sets it off!! A true 
  stunner of a 12ver.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">No its not a 12-string bass, but its the
next best thing!&nbsp; Number 1 of 1 Hamer T-Bird 8-string made for Tom
Petersson in 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>So....This is the infamous one-of-a-kind Hamer FB-4 (don't ask me why it's a
Firebird code # when technically it's a Thunderbird since it's a bass) made for
Tom Petersson in 1990...used in the Cheap Trick video...on the Concrete Blonde
tour, etc. Confirmed the SN#&nbsp; with Hamer...it's the real thing.
<p>Bass DID come originally from Hamer with two Gibson Thunderbird pickups (a
'64 and a '66; nickel/chrome) loaded in it that Tom supplied them. The guy I got
it from swapped them with two newer black Gibson Thunderbird ones because the
older ones' magnets were going and the output weak (have the correct 64/66 in
the case.) That T-Bird logo on it is also just a heat transfer one the other guy
added...I was going to take it off but it sort of looks cool, so it's staying
for now. And yes, it plays and sounds great...although it has the Petersson
three output jacks/three volumes/three on-off switch wiring (no onboard tone
control, meant to let the 3 amp rigs do that.)
<p>Oddly enough, the only Hamer guitar I currently have is a custom '89
Chaparral in the identical custom color...&quot;Cherry Metal Flake.&quot; How's
that for a cool coincidence? The guitar says it's embarrassed to be posing in a
photo for a bass board...but I told it to shut up and smile</p>

<p align="left">I received these pics of a 1990 Hamer, apparently it was built
for Elvis Costello's bassist but he didn't like it so it was sold to and
customized for Chip Znuff. Weird headstock, (same as the 8-string Hamer
Thunderbird Tom used in the 80s which, as you all know,&nbsp; Jon Maye now
owns)&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus it has the Chaparral body style but Hamer says they
started making these in 1992.&nbsp; The guy who just bought it is an acquaitance of Chip.<br>

job! It's 30¸&quot; scale, the neck is ebony with the boomerang inlays AND red LEDs 
at the flip of a front mini toggle. The extra panel on the back is for the LED 
circuit. Electronics: One custom triple coil Bartolini with a toggle to split / 
combine coils for single / double / or in-out phase. I believe the body is not a 
normal Scepter, perhaps it's a shaved down and cutaway custom. On the headstock 
is the original owner's name, Willie Basse of the LA band Black Sheep. GREAT 
bass, I LOVE IT !!!&quot; </font></span></p>

were going to fix it by planning the neck and regretting it....until the tech
snapped the truss rod...then they said too bad...nothing we can do; and left me
high and dry. I called Kim at Hamer and explained what happened, and he said
they would see what they could do, so I sent it to them. to make a long story
short; when I got it back 6 months later it was like brand new...paint, new
double truss rod neck, but it was thin like the original!!!&nbsp; It cost about
$800 but if you add that to what I paid for it to begin with, it still cost a lot
less than what a used USA Hamer 12 was going for and is a pretty unique bass.
The OBL humbuckers are wired with push/pull pots so I get series/parallel
switching on each pickup, series is meaty and parallel is clear with a
single-coil attack and clarity -without any hum. it has an EMG exb
control..which isn't intended for use with passive pickups, but absolutely kills 
on this bass!</font></p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="3">These basses were those used by Pete Comita
on tour when he took over for Tom Petersson. &nbsp;Most notably from the
Chicagofest and SNL appearances. &nbsp;Both are short scale basses, single truss
rod, with MANY lacquer coats (much thicker finishes than those used on most
Hamers I have seen from this time). Interesting features are &nbsp;the B12S a
preamp and LED on the face, and the Hamer logo used on the bass is sort of
unique in that the &quot;r&quot; is in lower case, which I have only seen this
logo used on the &quot;prototype&quot; first Hamer Vee bass that Jol Dantzig
built for himself.<br>
<br>
The standard bass has a smaller body (not quite a 3/4 size, but still much
smaller than a &quot;normal&quot; standard guitar or bass). Wired for separate
output jacks for each pickup. Also has the pre-amp and LED on the face. &nbsp;Interestingly,
in very small script, between each of the stripes are the individual letters
that spell out &quot;Pete Comita&quot;. &nbsp;On the headstock under the logo it
says &quot;spacematic&quot;.  Both basses have held up very well over time,
they sound killer and the necks have remained straight and true. &nbsp;I have
had the B12S since the late 80's so when the opportunity came to get his
&quot;brother&quot; &nbsp;I wasn't going to pass up the chance to reunite the
two. &nbsp;Many thanks go to my collector friend for scoring the bass directly
from Pete Comita.</font></p>

  </span>the reps at the Fernandez office and was told that this was one of only
  3 basses originally manufactured &amp; imported to the U.S. prior to the
  official release of the APB-8 model (which later became the Gravity series a
  few years ago.)&nbsp; It was supposedly built sometime between 92-94 and they
  told me that the other ones were owned by Robert Trudjillo (Ozzy Osbourne,
  Infectious Grooves, Suicidal Tendencies, etc·) and the 3<sup>rd</sup> one
  was damaged in transit to the U.S. and now resides in the Fernandez
  offices.&nbsp; Also has gold hardware and different headstock insignia than
  the new models.&nbsp; The last pic is of the Hamer and Fernandez

Hamer had in his desk. They are unmarked. Jon plays this bass in the &quot;She's

differently than most: the 1st string is a low E string, the 2nd is an A string

were taken in the spring of 1991. As you can see from the photos, it has four
control knobs instead of the usual three. I custom ordered this bass from Hamer
with stereo wiring, two EMG EXB expanders, and a one-piece curly maple top.
Shortly after receiving it I swapped out the EXB circuits for BTC
circuits<span lang="en-us"> </span>instead, finding the loudness boosting effect of the installed EXBs less
versatile.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">I sold this bass in 1996 when I purchased my
black B12L. Although I prefer the B12L, I wish that I would have kept the B12S,

beauty perspective I much prefer the cherry transparent B12S.</font></p>

instruments remain stock but for a few &quot;personalizations&quot;. I've
installed Schaller straplocks, heavier string gauges, and lowered the rear
pickups down flat. I consider the Acoustic 12 to be far superior tonewise to the

Tony picked this baby up on eBay which can be a great place to find 12vers
such as this!</font></font></p>

 I found these photos on eBay&nbsp; This <strong>B12S</strong>
is unique in many ways.&nbsp; It has a set of custom pickups installed as well as
non-standard control knobs and toggles/ switches and the body has an uncharacteristic
&quot;tapered&quot; edge.&nbsp; A highlight for B12S owners to note is the case actually
fits this B12S.&nbsp; As most B12S owners know Hamer ships current custom ordered B12S's
with the standard BC-1 case which is made for the long scale B12S Chaparral.</font></font></p>

 Though Scott does not own these
12vers he found and submitted the photo to be cataloged here. Pete Comita (short time
12ver bassist&nbsp; fill in for <strong>Cheap Trick </strong>in the 80's) played one as
did the bassist in Cinderella.&nbsp; Note the two different styles of headstocks, the <strong>distinctive
Split &quot;V' </strong>headstock on the left found on the <strong>B12L Chaparral</strong>
/<strong> B12S</strong> models and the <strong>B12A style </strong>headstock on the right.</font></font></p>

 <strong>Note:</strong> This was
supposed to be the second Tom Petersson style bass created by Hamer so it was given no
official brand name. &nbsp;&nbsp;You can read about Ron's one-of- a- kind 12ver in the
reviews section. (see Hamer B12A Reviews)&nbsp; The photo on the right (submitted by Ron)
is Tom Petersson with his first B12A which he employed during the Dream Police Tour.
&nbsp; Notice the similarities between Tom and Ron's original B12A.</font></font></p>
