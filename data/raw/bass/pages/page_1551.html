<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FF9933">This photo was
submitted by Chris Matthes and was taken at Cheap Trick's show on 21 Jan 2001 at
the <b>9:30 Club</b> in Washington, DC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom is being presented with
a T12SBP T-shirt.&nbsp; Here is an excerpt from an email&nbsp; I received from
Chris that best describes the events of that night...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I walked in the door 5 minutes ago, but wanted to
give you a quick update:&nbsp; Got to the sound check right at 5:30, just as they
were finishing up. Rick &amp; Bun E. were walking out the door, and they were
still tweaking Tom &amp; Robin's levels. Tom came to the wings where I was and
said &quot;hi&quot;.&nbsp; I introduced myself, gave him a quick run-down about
the site and presented him with the shirt and your letter/picture in a sealed
envelope. He said he'd definitely wear the shirt, and was genuinely appreciative
for it. Very cool!&nbsp; While Harmony Riley (the opener, Rick N's sons play
drums/guitar) were sound checking, Tom went back up behind the Bass cabs and put
the shirt in his overnight bag. he opened the letter and I watched him read the
entire thing.&nbsp; Carla (Dragotti , CT's road manager) came to take him and
Robin to dinner, and he thanked me again as he passed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">I was also&nbsp; invited to the After Show
upstairs with the band and 8 other people. It was a nice, small informal setting
outside the dressing rooms, and I got to talk to Tom for at least 10 minutes
sitting down on a couch.&nbsp; He seemed very flattered by the letter, and said
that he will DEFINITELY check out the page. I mentioned that you had been
conducting a few interviews and recently spent a few hours talking to Paul and
Adrian Chandler.&nbsp; I said that it would be great to see him on the page, and
that that would be the ultimate (no Hamer pun intended) for that site. He said
that things are crazy for the next few weeks, but he'd consider it. I think that
you could have a good shot with that one! Tom was very easy to talk to, and I
think he'd be a great interview subject. I managed to get one picture of me with
Tom, holding up my 12 string bass page shirt ( I took it off so it would show up
in the photo!). That'll be coming your way along with the others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Thanks for the inspiration, and I'll be in touch
soon - it's gonna be a long day at work tomorrow, but totally worth it!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Have a great week,</font></p>

better than these. The one photo shows me newly acquired 1986 Hamer B12S that
you have a picture of on your website.&nbsp; It really is a &quot;<font color="#FFFF00"><b>Yellow

Whats better than tuning 12 strings?......tuning 36!!!)</font></p>
