<h3 align=left>III. Special Features of the Y-Unit.</h3>

<P align=left>It is true that all those who have fought for freedom during the
Korean War - both those in the regular military units and those in irregular
units - had one thing in common - the defense of our nation.&nbsp; However, the
latter group had special unique features that the regulars did not have.

</P><P align=left><b>(1) Unit members.</b> 
</P><P align=left>With the exception of a few radiomen, all members of the
Y-Unit were
anti-Communist youth from North Korea.&nbsp; Not only that, they had fought actively
the Communists in North Korea until they came down south, and thus they had
combat experience and a strong proven will to fight the Communists. They had the common
goal of liberating their home towns on their own strength and were highly
motivated. 
</P><P align=left><b>(2) Special Training.</b> 
</P><P align=left><img border="2" src="../KOREA/yondo.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="235">Key members of the Y-Unit received advanced training at a
secret US military special forces training center at Sigazaki (Kanagawa Prefecture,
Japan). The training lasted 3-4 months.&nbsp; Special training facilities were
set up at Young-do and the unit members received not only the standard military
training but also special operations training.&nbsp; They received special
instructions on weapons, explosives, parachuting, naval tactics, and so
on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

from rubber boats towed to points near the coast.&nbsp; The partisans were
ferried to their target areas by US destroyers assigned to the CIA.&nbsp;

</P><P align=left><b>(3) No Pay, No Benefits.</b> 
</P><P align=left>The Y-Unit members received no remuneration, no pension, no
veterans benefit at all. The main reason why this was so was that receiving any
monetary compensation from the US CIA would have made them hired hands -
mercenaries of a foreign power.&nbsp; The Y-Unit members were volunteers
fighting the enemy on their own will with no thought of compensation or reward,
which would have tarnished their image and self-esteem.&nbsp; The US CIA
accepted this sense of honor and limited itself to providing logistics and tactical
support, and left personnel administration to the Koreans themselves. 
</P><P align=left><b>(4) No returning to the base.</b> 
</P><P align=left>It was an unwritten code of ethics amongst the Y-Unit members
to keep on fighting, once landed in North Korea, until the UN forces
returned.&nbsp; There was to be no returning to the safety of the home base
until the war is won and over.&nbsp; In effect, being sent to North Korea was a
virtual death sentence because there was little hope of winning the war.&nbsp;
In spite of this, every member of the Y-Unit was eager to be sent north.&nbsp;
Such was the morale and patriotic dedication of the members. 
</P><P align=left><b>(5) Close cooperation with the UN forces.</b>

December&nbsp; 1950 to November 1952 as a transport for the landing of partisans

</P><P align=left>The US Air Force dropped the members and supplies.&nbsp;
Likewise, the US Navy helped infiltrate the members into North Korea.&nbsp; In
addition, the members radioed enemy targets for US warplanes, and sea-borne
raiding parties of the Y-Unit operated with US warships for nearly a month at a
time. 
</P><P align=left><b>(6) Wide-area&nbsp; operations.</b> 
</P><P align=left>The Y-Unit's operational are covered much of North
Korea.&nbsp; It encompassed the vast regions of North Hamgyong, South Hamgyong
and northern regions of Kangwon provinces as well as the coastal regions of
North Korea. The land branch of the Y-Unit conducted guerrilla warfare deep in
North Korea, while the sea-borne units raided coastal installations of the
enemy. Thus a puny army of the Y-Unit managed to tie down several combat
divisions of he enemy in the rear area.&nbsp;
