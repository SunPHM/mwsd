  month of March came in like a lamb. Some good catches were made
  during the warm spell. Okeechobee's bass were preparing to go
  on the beds to spawn on the March full moon. A cold front which
  brought our morning temperatures down in the low 40's and one
  morning it was a very chilly 37 degree moved the bass off the
  beds and shut down the fishing. The forecast for the rest of
  this month is expected to be excellent. We should not have any
  more cold fronts until next winter - I hope...</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<BR>
  Lil Anthony has talked of nothing else since we have been home.
  We weren't <BR>
  able to fish the lake or even to boat on it, but that's Mother
  Nature and if <BR>
  she decides to have a drought there's not much anyone can do
  about it.<BR>
  Randy was our guide. We could not have asked for a better one.
  We <BR>
  also had the privilege of meeting his father. You would do well
  to always <BR>
  keep those two on your payroll, they are both fantastic. I can't
  express to <BR>
  Randy enough thanks for the absolutely wonderful two days he
  gave us. When we <BR>
  venture your way again to drop a line, it would be a privilege
  to have Randy <BR>
  or his father to be our guide.<BR>
  The weather was beautiful. We let Lil Anthony catch the fish.
  We set <BR>
  lines out and then let him real them in. I learned how to use
  a bait casting <BR>
  reel also. I'm looking forward to picking one up for myself now.
  Randy still <BR>
  probably hasn't gotten all the bird nest out yet that I created.
  7 fish were <BR>
  caught the first day , 8 the second day. Lil Anthony finished
  up the second <BR>
  day with a 4 pounder followed closely with his trophy 6 1/4 pound
  bass. <BR>
  I'll just end this e-mail by saying that when we were leaving
  I asked Lil <BR>
  Anthony &quot;It was a great trip wasn't it&quot;? And he replied,
  Dad it was a perfect <BR>
