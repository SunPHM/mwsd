With agony, aggression, and anger as their fuel, these three guys from the deep south call upon their rich influences from the sludge/doom Gods, and beat it, rape it, and conform it into their own brand of dirty southern metal called Severed Sanity. The epoch of the band began in the year 2000 when Chris and Sean met and found a mutual interest in the same genre of brutal music which prompted them to begin jamming together.  They were both very interested in Thrash metal at the time, but when Chris bought Crowbar's "Broken Glass" album, their motives and direction took a different turn. Then in March of 2002, after two whole years of jamming and cultivating their interests together, the two met Rusty, a local guitar player. Rusty showed the same taste and passion for music that Chris and Sean harbored, making him a welcome addition to the group. Thus with a fleshed out lineup, and an injection of confidence, the three plan on taking over the world with their own brand of Southern Sludge, and hope that fans of the genre will accept them as their new found brothers.
