<p><font size="+2">Spring 2001, somewhere in the pacific..................</font><font

<p><font size="+2">I had already shot a 18lb fish, and the boat moved to another
spot.&nbsp; It dropped me off about 300 yards away from where it would anchor,
and I was to look for halibut in the sand.</font><font size="+2"></font> </p>
<p><font size="+2">The water was 61 degrees, about a clear 20 foot visibility.&nbsp; 
I had just descended when I heard a bunch of noise, not really croaking, maybe
their tails as they all moved in unison.&nbsp; As I slowly rose to the surface,
I saw a wall of fish coming towards me, not unlike a wall of sardines, except
these were all BIG fish.&nbsp; I dropped the gun and slowly grabbed my camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I took a little chance that the fish would spook, as I wound the disposable
underwater camera.&nbsp; The fish began to circle...............</font><font

<p><font size="+2">First it starts with a feeling in your gut, you can feel 
the presence of the fish......... Sometimes you can hear them, sometimes you
can feel them.</font> </p>

<p><font size="+2">As they draw closer, you can see their eyes looking at 
you, you scan the school looking for the big fish.&nbsp; The smaller fish 
are all over 35 pounds, and are they closest ones.&nbsp; They are now only 
8 feet away, and circling......</font> </p>

<p><font size="+2">There were over 100 fish in this school, most in the 35-50 
lb range, but there were some HUGE fish on the outside of the circling fish
that were very impressive in size, much longer than the others.</font><font

<p><font size="+2">In retrospect, I was glad that I had already filled my 
limit, as I am not sure that they would have come in that close, or that I
would not have spooked them away with my actions, hunting them as opposed 
to watching them.&nbsp; I would have missed this unbelieveable sight.</font>
