<p>In our neverending search through the 'net for All Things Bass, occasionally we come across the truly unusual, the actually inventive and stuff that is just plain different enough that we think you would like to know about. 
</p>

<p>Wish Bass is a small company with very much of a hands-on approach to building some unusual looking instruments. The most striking aspect about Wish Bass is not so much the looks, or the woods, the hardware, the electronics, although they opt for some pretty wild and organically imaginative lines, it is the fact that Steve Wishnevsky, the owner of Wish Bass, strives to give his customers a good, solid no-frills bass for in and around $300 US!  Now these are not mass produced line basses, these are pretty well built one at a time by the luthier himself.</BR CLEAR="left"></P>


<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="../../fretboard_lin.gif" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="15"></P>




<P><B>Bass Inside: </B>In a world where it is not a far stretch to find custom-built basses for up to 10,000 US and most special projects hovering between four and six thousand bucks, $300 grabs your attention. How does he do it and better still, why does he do it for so little?
</P>

<P><B>Steve: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">I avoid 'luthier supply' places like the plague, and deal with furniture supply places as much as possible. It is a difference of philosophy. Perfection is very expensive... 85% of perfection is easy. Most of the price on an instrument is finish and perfection.</FONT></P> 



<P><B>Bass Inside: </B>Many of the more expensive luthiers state they are just covering costs, that the profit margin is pretty close to the expenses.
</P>


<P><B>Steve: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">Actually they are telling the truth. Most instrument makers lose money. 
</FONT></P>

<p>I thought that to keep your costs low, it might be that you bulk-buy your 
woods, but in fact are occasionally using some pretty exotic woods here.
</p>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I'm just lucky with a great supplier nearby, Wall Lumber Co., Quality Hardwoods and Plywoods ForThe Craftsman. Also, North Carolina has about ten times as many local woods as all of Europe…four different habitats in this state. </FONT></P>

<P>You quote wood prices at believable rates, while some of the luthiers I have spoken to give the impression that wood is more costly than gold. Do you also bulk-buy the electronics and hardware as well?</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I buy wholesale, but not in large quantities.  Good lucky with that. To me it's like the difference between Henry Ford and Ettore Bugatti... Ford is still in business. Bugatti made the greatest cars ever, and lost money on every one. In America, the guy was Duesenberg. Top-end hand work, labour of love, and working at a loss. 
</FONT></P>

<P>You mention that "Our basses are designed to maximize the acoustic 
coupling between the strings and the neck/body wood". Can you tell us a 
bit about that acoustic coupling, what is meant by that in your basses, and 
how does it differ from other luthiers (to your knowledge)?</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Simple. I keep as much metal off the bass as possible, especially between the strings and the body. The body only lets the strings vibrate in certain ways. Different densities of material vibrate at different  harmonics. By keeping it all simple, keeping the densities similar, I let the strings vibrate with the widest range of harmonics. In America we have a vulgar motto "K.I.S.S."  Keep It Simple, Stupid. </font></p>

<p>You also say " Our basses minimize the metal and electronics in between your hands and the amplifier, letting you control your tones instinctively, instantly, organically".  So, do you feel that the electronics and the metals distance the player from the 'real' sound? 
</p>
  

<P><FONT COLOR="black" face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4"><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="wishbasses.jpg" HEIGHT="360" WIDTH="270" alt="Wish Bass"><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="360"><FONT COLOR="blue">To the extent that they limit the possible vibrations of the string.  Obviously the magnets of the pickups suck energy from the strings, so that one-pickup basses actually sound better, and have more sustain. They have fewer different tones, but the one tone they have is more responsive.  Neck rods damp vibrations and so on. Some top end guys refuse to use Epoxy, saying they can hear the difference, and then put metal bridges on their instruments. If you have a jazz guitar, with a wood adjustable bridge, and change it for a metal adjustable, you will hurt the sound. If you replace the adjustable with a one-piece carved wood one, it will sound better.  
</br clear="right"></FONT></P>

<P>Your statement, "We make the most comfortable bass in the world", in what way do you mean it, weight, balance, neck shape? And how do your basses differ from others builders? 
 </p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Perhaps an over-statement. I have a bigger neck, which helps finger leverage, and helps eliminate Carpal Tunnel and similar problems, and I try to make most designs hang at a 45 degree angle to the body for less strain on the left elbow. 
</FONT></P>

<P>You have a lifetime guarantee on your basses. Does this cover the electronics and hardware as well? </p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I don't manufacture those parts, but I will replace them if defective. 
</FONT></P>

<P>What would you say your goal or objective is with regards to your basses and your customers? What are you aiming to achieve here? </p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Trying to make a living. The furniture industry in North Carolina is being murdered by our government. I have no lofty goals outside of providing decent instruments for the working musician. The average guy in America makes a few hundred dollars a year on music, perhaps a few thousand if very lucky. There is no need to spend a year's pay for a new instrument. I like to play different stuff, to keep my interest up, and I will not pay over a thousand dollars for a different axe. 
</font></p>

<p>You mentioned that you are a craftsman of the Appalachian school of lutherie. Can you tell us a little about that school or approach and how it differs from the usual approach? 
</p>

<p><FONT COLOR="blue">They made instruments because they had no access to 'store bought' instruments. They made what they needed with what they had, with little regard for 'what should be'. Local materials of course. I think Europe has been civilized for far too long to get a heart-felt appreciation of the kinds of things isolated people can do, if necessary.  Folk Art, you dig? 
</FONT></P>

<P>Your build-time from order date to completion is only two months. What in 
your methods gives you the ability to do this so quickly? Most luthiers 
need at least three to five months. </p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I make an instrument every day or so. Usually I ship five a week. I try to keep 30 or so going at any one time and do batches of ten or so in every stage of production. I use abrasives as much as possible, and work ten+ hours a day seven days a week. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Looking at the hardware on the bass, what were your reasons to not set up the standard bass with treble and bass controls?  Can the customer have these installed if they want them? </p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Sure, it is a ten dollar option for each control. Most people never touch the tone control, so I don't put one on. Every dollar I save in production means ten dollars I don't have to charge. </font></p>

<p>Is the J-bass pickup specially wired or of a special quality to allow the 
bass to sound good using only the pickup and no treble or bass boost? </p>


<p><FONT COLOR="blue">Nope, Off the shelf Korean pickup... It's the wood that sounds good, not the pickup.  But the modern pickups are pretty damn good, even the cheapies. 
</font></p>

<p>You feel you are able to make a good quality, good sounding and individual bass for your customers at these low prices and still make a profit, make it worth your while. To be candid here, that is a fine philosophy. However, why have you not brought the prices up to even the $750 range. They would still be very low cost and frankly, you would make bigger 
bucks. In other words, am I correct in saying that this must be working for you or you wouldn't do it for so long? </p>

<p><FONT COLOR="blue">I let the market, e-bay, set my prices. If the economy was better, I would charge more, but things are not great here in the USA. </FONT></P>

<P>Do you have standard models that folks can choose from? Any new designs or models coming out in the next year? </p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">There are ten or twelve different models, and people send me new designs every month. Sometimes I use those models for my own, after modification. I have worked out methods of making any shape without retooling, which is very important in keeping my prices down. </P>


<P>If you want to know more, get this book, "A Hot-Bed of Musicians" by Paula Anderson-Green. It has a lot about the people I learned from...  </FONT></P>

<P>In reading up on this article I came across a lot of satisfied customers of Steve's. These are not high-end basses, but they are not trying to be. They endeavour to give the regular bassist, someone who might play 2 times a week to 2 times a month, an affordable and reasonable quality bass. </p>
