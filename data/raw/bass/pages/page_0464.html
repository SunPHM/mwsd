						<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There are two fish sanctuaries in Trout Lake, specifically set up to protect high quality smallmouth bass spawning areas. One is on the south side of <a href="doc6.htm#Camp_Island">Camp Island</a> and the other is on the western side of <a href="doc6.htm">Poplar Island</a>. The Filions, on behalf of the Trout Lake Conservation Association, have been surveying bass nesting densities in these control areas, with snorkeling gear, for the last several years. Their research shows that both sacntuaries have suffered an important decline in nesting density (see graph). Starting in the spring of 1997, the Nipissing Bass Masters Association (recently formed) will be helping out with the survey work. Their help is greatly appreciated.</font></p>

Ironically, bass tournaments have popularized angling for bass and, although these are live release tournaments, the idea of catch and release bass fishing is still slow catching-on by the average angler and the resource is suffering.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">On this point we need a common front of public education if we are to maintain the Trout Lake bass fish stocks. PLEASE PRACTICE CATCH - AND - RELEASE bass fishing. The <a href="fisher.htm">life history</a> of smallmouth and largemouth bass make them particulary subject to overharvesting.</font></p>
						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">A third smallmouth bass high quality spawning site has been identified as suitable for sanctuary status (only during the spawning period). We will need the support of everyone in order for the MNR to give this area (south side of <a href="doc6.htm">Hemlock Island</a>) sanctuary status.</font></td>
