<h2 align="center" class="dots">Sarah Hope</h2>

<p>Seasoned <b>cabaret performer</b> and well-known Peninsula <b>drama teacher 
  </b>Sarah Hope is a Bay Area native with New York creds and a sassy &amp; romantic 
  sensibility. Locally well-known as a <b>singer-actress</b> who warms up intimate 
  venues, Hope honed her chops in New York and abroad to emerge as a performer 
  of astonishing <b>versatility, charm </b>and pizzazz.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a teenager, Hope owned the stage at Castro Valley High School, then took 
  off for the Big Apple, where she graduated with honors in Musical Theater from 
  NYU&#146;s Tisch School of the Arts. In addition to theatrical roles, European 
  cabaret and a Saturday Night Live! appearance, Hope was featured in a dynamic, 
  one-woman show, Forever Yours, at Manhattan&#146;s Don&#146;t Tell Mama cabaret. 
  Her sell-out performances of <b>witty monologues</b> combined with <b>lush renditions</b> 
  of popular standards resulted in an extended run.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back in the Bay Area, where her family resides, Hope has since performed in 
  Beach Blanket Babylon and put together two new cabaret shows, <a href="past-performances.htm#forever">Forever 
  Yours</a>, at Piaf&#146;s in San Francisco and <a href="past-performances.htm#wonderfullife">A Wonderful 
  Life</a>, also at Piaf&#146;s, a two-person outing with her brother, performer 
  <a href="#liebowitz">Matthew Liebowitz</a>. Noted the SF Chronicle, &#147;Hope 
  presents a <b>fresh, ing&eacute;nue appeal</b> with just the right <b>sass and 
  pizzazz </b>&#150; think Nicole Kidman crossed with Drew Barrymore.&#148; Hope 
  and Liebowitz have since taken their shows on the road, performing at San Francisco&#146;s 
  Plush Room, in Palm Springs, and in various private clubs and hotels throughout 
  California.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> As if a full-time acting career weren&#146;t enough, Hope also founded and 
  runs <a href="http://hopemusicaltheatre.com" target="_blank"><b>Hope Musical 
  Theatre</b></a>. This after-school and summer camp program, taught by Hope and 
  run according to the rigorous standards of her own New York training, has during 
  the past three years introduced over 1,000 elementary school children to the 
  joy of acting in musical classics like &#147;Annie,&#148; &#147;Peter Pan&#148; 
  and &#147;Oliver!&#148; In just three years, Hope Musical Theatre has become 
  bywords for high quality among Peninsula parents. Hope herself enjoys a reputation 
  as a <b>multi-talented and well-loved</b> performer and teacher.</p>

<img src="KimberlyHinkley.jpg" width="212" height="300" align="left"> <h2 align="center" class="dots">Kimberley Hinkley, Pianist</h2>
<p>Kimberley Hinkley began her musical studies at the age of four with Beatrice 
  C. Roberts, in Castro Valley. Her love of music quickly grew as she got older 
  and she developed interest in song-writing. <b>At the age of 9, she composed</b> 
  her first piece, &quot;Beyond the Roses,&quot; which received <b>excellent reviews</b> 
  in a statewide competition. While continuing <b>piano studies and competitions</b>, 
  she became interested in singing, playing the guitar, and becoming a more well 
  rounded musician.<br>
  <br>
  She developed skills as an accompanist with the Bishop O'Dowd chorus, performing 
  her original song, &quot;If We Smile&quot; at their liturgical services. While 
  in high school she also wrote an <b>original score</b> to Shakespeare's &quot;Twelfth 
  Night&quot; which she performed with the Bishop O'Dowd drama team in the spring 
  of 1999. After graduating that June, she studied classical piano at CSU Hayward 
  with internationally known pianist Ellen Wasserman, but still wanted to keep 
  her musical &quot;adventures&quot; diverse. One day she received word that a 
  local production of The Sound of Music, set to open in two weeks, had just lost 
  their Liesl, and Kim jumped right on in, delivering a smashing performance while 
  working her way into the local theater circuit. Recently, Kim was the musical 
  director and lead mariachi for a community theater production of &quot;La Posada,&quot; 
  in which she arranged and taught the music to the performers and lead the ensemble 
  through the performances.<br>
  <br>
  Kimberley currently <b>teaches piano</b> to students in the East bay and has 
  played throughout the bay area at weddings, parties, liturgical services and 
  musical productions. She feels very lucky to know the Liebowitz duo and blessed 
  to have Matt as her voice teacher and both of them as her partners in musical 
  adventures! She sends love to her family, including her nephew, Max.</p>

  Hood, Bass Player</h2>
<p>Born and raised in San Mateo County. I came from a musical family and started 
  playing the Violin at the age of seven. Though it was not quiet me so when I 
  was fifteen I followed in the steps of my father by becoming a bass player. 
  I've been playing in musicals since I was 17 years old. I was the principle 
  bass player in the Peninsula Youth Orchestra for three years while attending 
  Carlmont HIgh School. I am currently a student at Cal State University, Hayward, 
  where I am a music performance major. I am currently a teacher and performer 
  with the Fremont Youth Orchestra. I play in a jazz combo, the Ohlone Symphony 
  Orchestra, and a local ska band. So I guess you could say I love to play all 
  types of music. As long as I'm playing, I'm happy.</p>

degree from the Peabody Conservatory of Music and has recorded and performed many

the Gatehouse in Palo Alto, or at Cafe Borone's in Menlo Park when it first opened. 
Mark has also brought live music to CalTrain stations, and written and performed 
electronic accompaniments to silent movies at the Stanford and Castro Theatres
