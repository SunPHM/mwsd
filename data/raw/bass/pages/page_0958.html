Adams has grown to be the most popular mainstream Canadian rocker of the
late '80s/early '90s, but as this is a bass guitarists' website the question
has to be "Yes, but is he legitimate?" Bryan Guy Adams was born on 5 November
1959, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. He's unquestionably popular, and he's
unquestionably a talented singer songwriter and six-string guitarist.</font></font></b>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In a review <b>in the </b><i>Beacon
Journal</i> Pete Chakerian s<b>aid 'No matter how much integrity or heart
they seem to possess, pop rockers never get a fair shake. Even before the
grunge and indie-rock trend taught the masses that success was lame, rock
critics have been getting paid to professionally chide the pop genre. But
follow those hated critics home one night after work. They're the first
people to put on an old sweater, eat comfort food and watch reruns if they've
had a bad day. Digressions aside, Canadian rocker Bryan Adams might be
all of these things. Comfortable, like your favorite T-shirt and jeans.
Simple, like vanilla ice cream. Easy, like Sunday morning. But he's a crowd
pleaser that can keep the hits coming and the people smiling. This ``Peter
Pan of pop'' did just that last night when he breezed into the Palace Theater.
After nearly a four-year absence from the North Coast, Adams' delivered
a veritable, two-hour <i>tour de force</i> -- generously laden with rollicking
summer songs and gooey, heartfelt ballads. At times, it went down more
like soft-serve than your favorite homemade variety of vanilla. But the
minimalist approach -- stark staging, bare musical arrangements, Adams
fronting a trio in lieu of his usual band -- gave the show a solid, undeniable
vibe. ``Hello, Cleveland,'' Adams announced early on. ``My name is Bryan.
Remember me?'' Backed by longtime bandmates Mickey Curry (drums) and Keith
Scott (guitars), he then tackled a hearty, 26-song setlist. Adams also
tackled bass-playing duties himself, an arrangement that yielded mixed
results... But most importantly, Adams and his compatriots had a good time.
And so did the crowd.' Hmmm. Mixed results.</b></font></font></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>With a career spanning over
20 years and worldwide album sales that rival the biggest recording artists
in the world, Bryan Adams's "I'm just the bass player in the band" attitude
seems rather simple,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compared to his career achievements,
but that's just how he is.</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="ba-bass1.jpg" VSPACE=5 height=400 width=300 align=LEFT><b><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In
a interview for Marshall amps he said "Bass has become my passion and it
all stems from making records and Keith buying me a Beatle bass to mess
around with for my birthday a few years ago. We tour now as a power trio
cuz it's a blast. We've trimmed down the arrangements to the point of silliness,
but I'm not interested in going back to the large ensemble just yet. We're
having too much fun at the moment. It took me some time to get my head
around singing and playing bass, but I have it fairly together now. Jody
my sound man, laughs at me, because he says I would never have hired a
bass player with one year of experience. and he's right! But my naiveity
towards the instrument is working, it's like playing in a new band." </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
Marshall artist news we're informed that on his most recent tour Bryan
used four VBA400 heads on top of four AX 4x10 bass cabinets and four BX
2x15 EV bass cabinets.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Music Reporter Bartley
Kives reviewed Bryan's January 2000 Winnipeg concert: "For most of the
show, Adams played the bass guitar, switching to a six-string only for
light arrangements of songs such as the ballad Everything I Do I Do It
For You, the mid-tempo On A Day Like Today and a gentle version of Straight
From The Heart. "Keith really is the star of the show. Forget about the
bass player," Adams joked. Yeah right, Bryan. As much as I expected to
despise you and your mercilessly unhip show, I have to admit the simple
rock schtick does look good on you."</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I saw Bryan Adams in concert
in Adelaide, Australia in March 2000. I was watching Bryan's playing and
was surprised to see him working away on simple runs and mainly thumping
out root notes of chords. Of course we came to see Bryan and hear him sing
our favourite songs, but the lesson for me was "lots of volume, keep up
a steady bass beat, and it doesn't have to be complex to work." Bryan and
the band seemed to really enjoy the show. The guys were laughing and smiling
and really got off on what they were doing. The show was a bit shorter
than I'd expected but the amount of energy was amazing. Those three guys
were putting everything they had into their work and gave us a show I'll
remember for a long time to come!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So is Bryan Adams a great
bass guitarist? No way! His bass playing was at best basic, but it worked.
He's legit.</font></font></b>
