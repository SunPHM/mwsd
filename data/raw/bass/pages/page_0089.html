biologists to describe the white bass fishery in Texas. However,
the state's original striped predator fish is still full of spunk.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>By Allen Tarvid</B></FONT></P>

<P>Half a dozen boats were drifting
in a loose group as fishermen in them glassed the surrounding
open water with binoculars. Suddenly one pointed and yelled,&quot;There
they are!&quot;</P>

<P>Engines cranked and boats jumped
on plane toward a moving circle of frothing water. Thirty yards
upwind of the surfacing white bass, the boats chopped their engines.
Trolling motors clunked into position before the boats settled
in the water and whirred at top speed toward the leaping shad
and thrashing whites. Lures arced through the air even before
the boats were in casting range, in hopes of fooling stragglers
at the edge of the school. As the casts reached the school, rods
bent almost instantly.</P>

<P>This scene has been repeated
for countless Texas fishermen, and it never fails to stir the
blood. White bass have provided light-tackle thrills for accomplished
anglers and first-time fishing excitement for all members of fishing
families for as long as Texas reservoirs have existed. Other species
are stealing most of the limelight these days, and marauding schools
of whites are teaching shad to fly without many spectators. </P>

<P>There are more than 60 reservoirs
with white bass size records published, and even more with populations
of the feisty fish. Choosing the best one in your area can be
tough. A Texas Fish &amp; Game&reg; canvassing of the state's
district fisheries offices, however, uncovered the lakes currently
offering the hottest white bass action.</P>

<P>The top white bass lake in
the Texas Panhandle is Lake Meredith, just north of Amarillo.
The Canadian River doesn't support a spring run, and summer is
the best time to fish the lake. Meredith's water temperatures
seldom climb above the mid 70s, so it doesn't suffer from hot-water
summer doldrums.</P>

<P>Moving southeast to the Abilene
area, Lake Sweetwater gets top honors with Lake Leon, near Eastland,
a strong runner-up. Anglers introduced whites to Lake Leon, where
the fish now approach 4 pounds. Lake Graham has good numbers of
fish, and Lake Brownwood is also worth trying. Lakes Brownwood
and Leon also offer spring run action.</P>

<P>Farther south, near San Angelo,
Twin Buttes Reservoir is usually a hotspot. However, the water
level has been dropped 20 feet for dam repairs that are expected
to take a couple of years. Boats can still be launched at two
ramps, but care must be taken while moving around the lake. The
growing white bass population at O.H. Ivie Reservoir, east of
San Angelo, makes it a better white bass fishing destination.
It's a young lake, and records are continually being broken.</P>

<P>In Southwest Texas, Falcon
Reservoir near Zapata is probably the best white bass lake. Water
levels are down at this writing, and gill netting is in full swing
on the Mexican side of the lake, but fishing can still be good.
San Ygnacio, up the Rio Grande from Falcon, is a popular spot
to launch and chase white bass.</P>

<P>In North Central Texas, Lake
Weatherford is a standout. It's producing good numbers of fish,
and in the most recent net surveys 96 percent of the fish were
keeper-size or larger. Lake Bridgeport showed the second-highest
number of white bass in the area; 75 percent of the fish netted
there were legal size or larger. Ray Roberts, Lavon and Texoma
also made good showings. Lake Texoma's white bass fishing is getting
better every year, even with competition from its super striper
population.</P>

<P>The Elm Fork of the Trinity
River above Ray Roberts is a great place to try during the annual
spring run. Anglers without boats can gain bank access to nearly
all of the creeks above Ray Roberts at road crossings.</P>

<P>Lake Arrowhead near Wichita
Falls is another North Texas lake with good numbers of healthy,
fat fish, and whites over 3 pounds are not uncommon. The white
bass populations in lakes tend to cycle up and down, but Arrowhead
has remained high for about the last four years.</P>

<P>Moving slightly east, Lake
Tawakoni near Greenville is a top lake. It doesn't host much of
a spring run, but a lot of windy-point spawning occurs in the
main lake. Much of the white bass population never seems to leave
the lower end.</P>

<P>Cooper Lake, just north of
Sulphur Springs, is probably second best in the area. Its population
is still expanding, but good-sized, fat, healthy fish are showing
up with greater regularity.</P>

<P>Pat Mayse Lake near Paris also
has a good population, and has consistently produced good catches
of whites.</P>
