<b><font color="#663300">In the mid-’80s I had traded video equipment for
the earlier version of the Roland synth the G-303 -- from friend and fellow-musician
Ken Storie...but soon after I traded in this system for the "new improved"
700 series. The G-303 is the only guitar I have ever traded or sold, but
the cost of the new system (well over $4000) forced me to part with it
as a down payment. Before trading it in I removed the b-bender and Bigsby...
and re-installed the Bigsby onto my Gretsch Country Club. Ever since this
early experience with guitar synths I've had a fascination for them. I've

In the late '70s / early '80s&nbsp; the Roland Corporation pioneered innovative
developments in the field of guitar synthesis and they have been improving
on this technology ever since. I entered the world of guitar synthsizers
in the early '80s via the GR-300 system and have been intrigued by them
ever since - so, even though there have been many attempts at guitar synthesis
over the years, this website is devoted to those I am most familiar with:
the Roland line.

<br><a href="http://www.code404.com/synths/roland.html"><img SRC="gr500.jpg" height=379 width=337></a></center>
The GR500 system in.1978 was Roland's first attempt at guitar synthesis.
It consisted of the guitar controller (GS500), a 24-way cable and the synthesizer
unit (GR500). The Ibanez-made guitar was based on the Gibson Les Paul shape
but with more controls and different pickups.

<br><img SRC="gr100.jpg" height=235 width=309></center>
Roland released a second generation of synth systems in 1980 - the GR-100
system. This included three types of guitar controllers in many different
finishes: the G505 - a&nbsp; Tele style with three single coils, the G303
- a Gibson SG derivative - and the delux version, the G202 with dual humbuckers
was a Strat-shaped cross between the G505 / G303 and the G808. All of these
controllers could operate the GR100 or the later GR300 synthesizer units
via a 24 way cable.
<p>This system generally did not track well, forcing the guitarist to play
slowly, deliberately and precisely.

<p>The blue GR300 has six VCOs (one per string) that are controlled by
the string pitches as well as hexa-fuzz plus an LFO, tuning presets and
some control over the attack of each note. The decay of each note is controlled
by the way you play the guitar and this makes the system far more versatile
than it first appears. As one of the sound sources on this unit are now
true VCOs then a few new techniques become available. First it is now possible
to apply vibrato to open strings, secondly each string can now produce
two notes (one from the divided pickup and one from a VCO). The pitch of
the VCO's can be offset by two preset controls that can be selected by
footswitches. Envelope attack can be slowed down and the strings that will
have a synthesized tone on them can be individually selected. There is
a compression on / off switch but unfortunatel the infinite sustain of
the GR500 was dropped. Many of these functions can be selected by footswitches
and the state of these are indicated by LEDs that flash if the function
is off or steady if the function is on.
<p>The guitar controllers for the GR300 were the same range that were offered
for use with the GR100. The controls on the guitars now allowed control
of VCF frequency and resonance, guitar / synth balance, oscillator / hexa-fuzz
selection and LFO on / off through the use of two concealed touch plates.
All this was achieved on guitars that looked very conventional, however
examination of the back of the guitar shows that there is a large amount
of electronics inside it.
<p>Released at the same time as the GR300 system was a bass guitar synth,
the GR33B, with G33 and G88 controllers. The system worked in a similar
manner to the GR300, although the pitch presets were replaced with better
envelope controls.
<p>The improved tracking of the GR-300 combined with the GK1 and BK1 pickups
offered clean and fast tracking which allowed guitarists much more versatility
in their playing. The system is still considered one of the greatest guitar
synths ever manufactured despite the limitations of the synthesizer engine
due to its minimal filter and envelope settings. Both Andy Summers and
Robert Fripp have praised the G303 guitar as a perfect marriage of the
guitar with synthesizers.
<p>One of the things that made the GR300 and GR33b guitar and bass units
so playable and attractive to guitarists was the series of controllers
Roland offered. Controllers include a number of models that were fashioned
after popular guitars by major companies. All actual guitars were manufactured
by Hoshino Inc otherwise known as Ibanez.
<p>After the perfect tracking of the GR300/GR33b series Roland went on
to create new floor units that were a huge leap forward in their synthesis
technology. Unfortunately they also abandoned the tracking system that
made the 300/33b such a useful and playable instrument. These silver monsters
are great synths but the tracking systems inside them is mediocre compared
to the previous generation.
<p>The G33 and G88 bass controllers had exaggerated double cutaway bodies.
An actual Fender P-bass type body was also available for a while. Roland

<td><b>PROGRAMMABLE GUITAR SYNTHESIZER UNIT</b>
<br>The GR-700 the highlight of the GR Guitar System-was developed by concentrating
Roland’s experience and technology gained producing synthesizers. It is
a compliantly new instrument, which combines the advantages of both the
electric guitar and the keyboard synthesizer. It ensures the expressiveness
of the electric guitar plus the flexibility of the keyboard synthesizer.
The GR-700 features all the elements for sound creation that a keyboard
synthesizer should have. The DSG (Digital Sound Recognition) system allows
the GR-700 to convert the guitar sounds into the synthesizer sounds without
losing delicate picking nuance, which only the guitar can produce.</td>

<td><b><font size=-1>Sound Memory</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>The GR-700 can memorize up to 64 different sounds (eight
sounds in eight banks). Memorized sounds can easily be recalled by simply
pressing pedals. It is much easier to operate than an ordinary effects
board. The number of the recalled sound is indicated on a large display
and can be easily seen even on stage. In addition, the accessory M-16C
memory cartridge provides 64 more sounds and is convenient for data editing.
You can rearrange the sounds in the order you want for on-stage or studio
performances. The Cartridge touch pad selects the GR-700unit’s memory or
the M-16C cartridge memory. Thus the GR-700 provides a total of 128 different
sound which can be fully used even during performances. The M-16C memory
cartridge can also be purchased separately so that you can form a library
of you own sounds.</font></td>

</table></center>

<p><b><font size=-1>Creation and Modification of sound</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>The Edit function allows you to create new sounds. It
also allows the memorized sound to be temporarily modified even during
a performance. A modified sound can then be memorized as it is. To modify
a memorized sound, first choose the parameter you wish to modify using
the Edit Map. Then recall the parameter by pressing the proper Number pedals,
and change the value or status of the parameter using the knob on the guitar
controller. When the optional PG-200 Programmer is used, it allows you
to quickly modify the memorized sound or to easily create a new sound.</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>String Selection</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>The String Select function makes the most of the GR-700&uml;s
advantages. By using the Voice, Hold, Pitch Bend, and String Select (1
to 6) touch pads, each of synthesizer sound, hold function, and pitch bending
can be assigned to any individual sting. The Voice touch pad is used to
select the strings to which synthesizer sounds will be applied. For example,
you can assign the synthesizer sound to only the fifth and sixth strings
and apply normal guitar sounds to the other strings. The Hold touch pad
is used to select the strings to which the hold function will apply. The
hold function operates while the Hold pedal is depressed. By applying the
hold function only to the fourth, fifth, and sixth strings, you can play
solo on the first, second, and third strings accompanied by chords played
with the fourth, fifth, and sixth strings. The Pitch Bend touch pad is
used to select the strings whose pitch will be controlled by the FV-200
Volume Pedal connected to the GR-700. The functions provide you with completely
new playing styles that have never been realized using only a keyboard
synthesizer or electric guitar.</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>Dynamics</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>The Dynamics function allows the guitarist to control
the synthesizer sound by his picking force. The volume and tone color of
the synthesizer sounds will change in proportion to the picking force.
When the DOC’s are controlled, the depth of the modulation, achieved by
controlled one DCO with another will change to create more impressive sounds.
When the VCFs are controlled the depth of the ENC. Modulation will change.
In other words, the depth of the "auto wah" effect will change, When the
VCAs are controlled the volume of the synthesizer sounds will change according
to the picking force. You can preprogram whether the dynamics function
works or not individually for the DCOs VCFs and VCAs.</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>A Complete Chromatic Scale</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>The Chromatic function enables the GR-700 to produce
complete chromatic scales that only keyboard instrument can produce. The
pitch of the synthesizer sounds shift chromatic mode. So even when you
play phrases using guitar techniques such as bending, sliding, and vibrato,
these phrases will sound as though they were play on a keyboard instrument.
The Chromatic function can be turned on and off by simply touching a touch
pad. You can enjoy call and response of the keyboard sounds and guitar
sounds by yourself. The GR-700 also features a Chorus effect that produces
thick, broad sounds. By combining the Chromatic function and the Chorus
effect, an extremely realistic organ sound can be obtained. Both the Chromatic
function and the Chorus effect can be individually programmed for each
memorized sound.</font>
<p><font size=-1>MIDI</font>
<br><font size=-1>The GR-700 features a MIDI Out jack. By connecting the
GR-700 with another MIDI-equipped instrument, such as Roland’s MKS-10,
30, or 80, you can control the connected instrument by playing a guitar
controller.</font>

<p>The G707 was noticibly different from the others as it added a stabilzer
bar running from the top of the neck to the bottom. This was created supposedly
to defeat "dead spots" on the guitar where a neck might not send full tracking
info to the floor unit. The G707 came in three colors: Silver, Red, and
Black. The G707 was a great guitar in it's own right and I often use my
