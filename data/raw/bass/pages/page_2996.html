There is a growing interest among fly fishermen in 
traveling to the Amazon, but many are discouraged by 
a series of doubts, like where and when to go, what 
fish species will be encountered, what tackle to use, 
what precautions to take, etc. We hope this two-part 
article will clear up this and other doubts about fly 
fishing in this fantastic region of the planet.<p>

<h3>The Amazon Rainforest:</h3>
The Amazon is the biggest portion of Rainforest in the 
world, with over 6 millon square km, spreading through 
Brazil, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, 
French Guyana, Suriname and Peru. In this immense jungle 
you will find the biggest diversity of ethnical groups 
and Indian languages in the American Continent, the 
argest rivers in the world, the biggest and most varied 
biodiversity, etc. Just to give you an idea, in the 
Amazon Basin alone there are more fish species than 
in all the Atlantic Ocean, and there are still hundreds, 
maybe thousands of species yet to be discovered. The 
same holds true for insects, birds and amphibians.<p>

<dd>  
The potential of both chemical compounds and gene 
compositions of plant and animal species yet to be 
discovered or studied can provide precious new sources 
of food, cures for diseases and many other benefits 
which are still unforeseen by Man. Many of these benefits 
are already known by indians. For instance there is an 
indian tribe who uses a certain species of ant to treat 
poisonous snake bites. They purposely put the ants over 
the wound and let them sting it, and that apparently 
cures the negative effects of the snake poison.<p>

<dd>
Underneath the Amazon there is also a countless wealth 
in the form of oil fields that together occupies an area 
the size of Europe. The oil is just now starting to be 
explored by the Brazilian Government and everyone hopes 
that this exploration will be done in an enviromentaly 
correct way.<p>

<dd> 
The Amazon River is so huge in volume of water that 60 
miles offshore from its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean you 
still navigate over fresh, muddy water. That is how the 
Amazon River was first identified by the spanish explorer 
Vicente Yanez Pinzon, who called it Mar Dulce (fresh 
water sea) in the 15th. century.<p>

<dd>
Contrary to what was believed back in the 70’s, the Amazon 
Rainforest is not the lung of the world, as it produces 
as much oxygen by photosynthesis as it absorbs. On the 
other hand the forest provides an invaluable service to 
the planet by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide 
and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere as well as 
regulating the distribution of rain in half of Latin 
America. The build-up of carbon dioxide and monoxide 
on the atmosphere is the main cause of the increase 
in Earth’s temperature, so you can say that the Amazon 
is the "air conditioner" of the planet.<p>

<h3>Traveling to the Amazon:</h3>

<dd>
Traveling to the Brazilian Amazon from North America or 
Europe is pretty easy as there is a direct flight connection 
to Manaus from Miami. The Brazilian Government requires a 
tourist visa from Canadian and US citizens, as well as most 
European countries. The visa can be personally issued in 
any Brazilian Embassy, present in most big cities of North 
America. You may want to choose to fill-out the visa 
application form available to print from the internet 
and send it through regular mail. You can also contact 
your local travel agency and they should take care of 
the paperwork.<p>

<dd>
Most anglers coming to the Amazon for the first time 
are usually very worried about the dangers from the 
jungle. In reality the dark water rivers are a very 
safe region of the Amazon, tropical diseases are nearly 
non-existent and there is really no need to take 
precaution about that. The region is free of biting 
insects too, making for comfortable living conditions. 
The only thing you should worry about a little are 
stingrays, so when wading or taking a dip at the river 
be sure to shuffle your feet instead of stepping, just 
like the guys on the saltwater flats do. The sun can 
also offer some danger for very sun-sensitive persons, 
so it’s important to use strong sun screen and wear 
good quality tropical clothing.<p>

<dd>
The language spoken in Brazil is portuguese, but on 
a good trip option, your english speaking host will 
meet you at the airport and stay with you throughout 
the trip. Another good reason to look for trips with 
hosts that stays with the group during the whole trip, 
and not just while in the city.<p>

<dd>
Brazil is a country in relatively good economic and 
political stability. Its local people are very friendly 
toward tourists and always willing to share a bit of 
their rich culture.<p>

<h3>Where to go:</h3>
The biggest peacock bass are not in every river of the 
Amazon, instead they can only be found in certain rivers 
mainly in central Amazon. These rivers are characterized 
by its dark, acid water and many marginal sloughts and 
lakes, the ideal habitat of Cichla temensis, the largest 
peacock bass species.<p>

<dd>
There are basically two main watersheds within the Amazon 
Basin where you can find this peacock bass, these are 
the Rio Negro to the north and the Rio Madeira to the 
south. The tributaries of these rivers is where the 
biggest peacock bass in the world comes from, specially 
from the Rio Negro watershed.<p> 

<dd>
Rio Negro means "Dark River," which is very aptly named. 
Its water is very dark in color and usually free of biting 
insects as they can not reproduce in the acid water. Manaus, 
the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon and the gateway 
to peacock bass fishing in Brazil, is situated on its banks. 
The two main kinds of water from the Amazon can be observed 
when the Negro and Solimões Rivers meet to form the mighty 
Amazon River, only a few miles from Manaus. The Negro with 
its dark water and the Solimões with its muddy water. The 
two different waters don’t mix for 8 miles, running alongside 
like two different rivers within one huge river.<p>

<dd>
Unfortunately nearly all easily reached locations have 
been fished-out by either sport and commercial fishermen 
and that is why it is today very important to travel to 
very remote areas in search of unexplored rivers where 
big peacock bass are abundant and aggressive. These 
unexplored rivers usually have some kind of natural 
barrier that prevents easy navigation, like shallow 
rocky areas or rapids. Some are even too sinuous and 
this avoids access with float planes as they don’t 
have areas large enough to land.<p>

<dd>
The headwaters of the tributaries are usually the least 
known and explored areas, and that is where the most 
succesfull fishing trips happen today. For the fly 
fisherman these areas are also much better than the 
areas downriver because their lakes are shallower and 
smaller so the fish are more easily attracted to flies. 
Anglers can also sight-fish a lot of times in these areas.<p>

<dd>
Look for outfitters who provide trips to these remote 
locations if you are serious about catching big peacock 
bass on fly. Facilities may not be top-class but it’s 
perfectly suited for the angler with an exploring mind 
and spirit of adventure.<p>  

<h3>When to go:</h3>

<dd>
Choosing the right time to go can mean the difference 
between success and total failure. Peacock bass fishing 
depends a lot on low water levels because during the 
flood season, when waters may rise over 40 feet, the 
baitfish swims into the flooded forest and the peacock 
bass follow them. Fishing during this time is completely 
unproductive.<p>

<dd>
The best outfitters carefully track and study weather 
patterns and changes when planning their fishing season 
in an effort to fish on the right places at the right 
time. It’s not always easy since it may vary 
significantly and there are many variations according 
to certain areas of the Amazon. Basically the dry season 
starts to the south of the Amazon River by June and goes 
on until October, moving slowly to the north until reaching 
the rivers north of the Amazon River from late August to March.<p>

<dd>
This means that the Rio Negro watershed, where the
biggest peacocks come from, is  generally fishable 
from September to March according to the specific 
region within this huge watershed.<p>



<h3>Fish Species:</h3>
Peacock Bass are the most abundant gamefish in the rivers 
of central Amazon. Even though there are other gamefish 
species in these rivers, the peacock bass is the focus 
of nearly all anglers coming to this area. They are not 
nearly remotely related to the largemouth bass of North 
America, instead they are cichlids, a huge family of fish 
species common in Latin America and Africa.<p> 

<b><i>Speckled Peacock Bass:</b></i> This is the largest 
of all peacock bass species, reaching sizes of nearly 30 
pounds. Of course a fish of that size is very rare. On 
good, remote locations they average 10 to 18 pounds, 
with bigger fish always around. This is still under 
scientific discussion, but it’s generally accepted 
that females have spots and males have three distinct 
dark bars and a yellowish coloration, as well as a hump 
on top of the head during mating season. They are very 
aggressive and territorial and will strike topwater flies 
with a vengeance. Most people who have fished for it agrees 
that they show the most spectacular and ferocious topwater 
strike of all fish. Everyone who enjoys casting topwater 
flies among varied structure for big fish must go peacock 
bass fishing in the Amazon at least once in a lifetime. 
Their fight is brutal and they always seek structures 
to cut or wrap the line.<p>

<b><i>Butterfly Peacock Bass:</b></i> This is a smaller 
peacock bass species, but very abundant. There are 
actually two species of what is wrongly called 
butterfly peacock bass. One of them is the true 
butterfly peacock bass, with three big blotches 
on the side, and another species, which shows 
dark uneven bars and a more yellowish coloration. 
Both are quite small on average, but may reach sizes 
up to 13 pounds.<p>

<i><b>Traira:</i></b> A very aggressive fish with 
sharp teeth and a powerfull jaw. They strike just 
about anything that moves close enough to it and 
are very abundant on the shallow areas. They average 
2 to 4 pounds and are fun on light rods, as well as 
an important food source for large peacock bass. 
These fish are very pre-hystoric looking and it 
is believed they come from ancient times.<p> 

<b><i>Arawana:</b></i> The arawana is a famous fish 
among aquarium hobbyists because of their unusual, 
snake-like  appearance. They are quite aggressive 
and will strike a variety of patterns. Once hooked 
they put up a good fight, with jumps and runs. A TV 
documentary on a British channel became famous by 
showing the scene of an arawana jumping out of the 
water to get a bug on an overhanging three in the 
flooded forest. This shows that they have great eyesight.<p>

<center><img src="bgjacunda.jpg" width="447" height="227" alt="Jacundá" border="0"></center><p>

<b><i>Jacundá:</b></i> This beautifull fish is known 
in the aquarium hobby as pike cichlid. Despite their 
small average size they are very strong and aggressive 
and very fun on light fly rods. They come in many varied 
colors.<p> 

<b><i>Piranha:</b></i> There are mainly two species of 
piranhas in the dark water rivers. The black and the 
silver. The black piranha is the biggest one, reaching 
10 pounds or more. They can be aggressive but nearly 
never against people. There is a lot of myth around 
piranha attacks and it’s just not true. They can only 
be dangerous when locked in a small lagoon where no more 
food is available, otherwise they won’t bother with you 
at all and you can swim at the river without worrying. 
Catching them on flies is not the easiest thing, which 
is pretty good because they destroy the fly in a heartbeat 
with their sharp, scissors-like teeth.<p>

<dd>
There are many other fish species in the black water 
rivers, like oscar, apapa, bicuda, pacu, arapaima and 
giant catfish.  <i><b> ~ Octavio</i></b><p>
