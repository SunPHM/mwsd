an overcast July Morning I meet Bob Woodbury, an angler from Salt Lake City, at
his downtown San Diego Hotel. Bob is about to embark on his first experience
fishing for bay bass on San Diego Bay. We drive across San Diego Bay via the
Coronado Bridge and pick up a rental skiff at Glorietta Bay. After a brief
lesson in casting shooting heads, we motor over to the bridge that brought us
across the bay. After drifting and casting for awhile Bob makes a cast near one
of the bridge support pylons. After a few short strips he feels a sudden
resistance like he<img border="0" src="images/baybassdoughooked.jpg" align="right" width="252" height="152">&nbsp;
has snagged bottom; then his rod tip begins to dance. The
fish he has hooked puts a deep bend into his fast action 8-weight and after a
spirited battle, he brings the fish to hand. The size of the fish - or rather
its lack of size amazes him. It's only about ten inches long. Bob has just met
his first “Grumpy”, more commonly known as the Spotted Bay Bass. Over the
next couple of hours we catch another thirty or so bass and a few other species.</p>

bays, estuaries, lagoons, and other sheltered waters along Pacific Coast of
Southern California and Baja California, including the Sea of Cortez, provide
excellent light tackle fishing for basses and other species. San Diego Bay is a
prime example of these fisheries. Little known outside of southern California
yet easily accessible to short and long term visitors to the greater urban areas
of San Diego and Los Angeles, they're ready made for the fly angler with only a
few hours to fish.</p>

joined by the Barred Sand Bass and the Kelp or Calico Bass. When these fish are
found together Spotties will dominate the back bays with the Sandies and Calicos

not flamboyant in coloration like many other gamefish, Spotties, Calicos, and
Sandies are attractive in there own special way. Spotties have brown or tan
backs with cream to golden yellow sides and are covered with black spots. They
possess a nice set of small, sharp teeth and numerous spines, including one on
each gill plate that has surprised many an angler. Spotties reach a size of
about 5 lbs. but the ten to fourteen inch fish are the most common. In southern
California waters such as San Diego Bay, they will be found around structure
such as pilings, docks, channel edges, eel grass flats, and the aforementioned
bridge pylons. In some areas, especially in the Sea of Cortez, they may be taken
from the beach, particularly near rock formations. I have caught a couple in the
surf from San Diego area beaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">B</font><font SIZE="4">arred
Sand Bass have brownish-green backs with bars of the same color running down
creamy tan colored sides. There are some small yellow spots on the face and gill
plate below the eyes. Like
Spotties, Sandies have a set of dorsal spines. Their teeth are not quite as
sharp as the Spottie's. As their name implies, these fish are often found
around sandy bottoms; however, they will also be caught over the eel grass flats
and around man-made structure. Sand Bass run to about ten pounds but the larger
fish are usually taken in the ocean. Five-pound fish, while not common, are
caught in southern California bays. Ten to fourteen inch fish make up the bulk
of the catch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">K</font><font SIZE="4">elp
Bass, also known as Calico Bass by California anglers, are most commonly found
around kelp forests and near shore reefs. In bays they will be found around rock
piles, channel edges, wrecks, breakwaters, docks, and other man made structure.
Calico bass have brown backs with white or cream blotches, blotchy tan and light
golden tan sides, and a creamy white belly. As with its cousins, the Calico is
armed with dorsal spines and small sharp teeth. Calicos reach about fifteen
pounds in the ocean but tend to run on the small side in the bay.</p>
<p><b>Handle With Care</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">C</font><font SIZE="4">aution
is warranted when handling these fish. A firm thumb grip on the lower jaw is
usually the best way to grab a fish to remove the fly. Anything less than a firm
grip will result in some chafing - and sometimes cuts - on the thumb. I always
mash the barbs on my hooks to facilitate the release of the fish. I can often
just grab the fly and rotate the hook out without touching the fish.
Occasionally a fish, especially Spotties, will clamp its mouth shut with the
entire fly in its mouth. If I need to grab a fish to remove the fly I will try
to grab in from the belly behind the pectoral fins (watch out for the gill plate
spines on the Spotties). A set of needle nose pliers can usually be used to
convince the fish to open its mouth. Attempting to insert the pliers with a
slight pressure to the lips usually does the trick.</p>

<p>Their neighborhood -covering the water</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">S</font><font SIZE="4">uccessfully
angling on my home water of San Diego bay requires that the angler adapt his or
her tactics to each type of structure and tidal situation. Tides determine the
best fishing times. Incoming tides are generally the most productive but don’t
ignore the outgoing tide. I have had some excellent fishing at the top of the
tide but the bottom has rarely been as productive. The best fishing usually
coincides with the greatest tidal swings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">P</font><font SIZE="4">erhaps
the easiest areas to fish successfully are eel grass flats in three to twelve
feet of water. The grass flats tend to produce best during the second half of
the incoming and first half of the outgoing tide. At this time fish will be
lying right on the grass waiting to intercept baitfish and crustaceans being
swept by the current. Fish will also be found on edges of the flats. The fish
are often very aggressive during this stage and strikes will often be jolting.
Often I've had my running line ripped from my hands when my mind wandered. You
to remain alert though, since some takes will be light - nothing more than a
loss of contact with the fly. Although takes will come on the sink, I always
cast with the goal of getting the fly right down to the grass - if I am not
occasionally bringing up some salad I am not swimming my fly deep enough.
Strikes will sometimes come as the fly is pulled free from the grass.
Incidentally, the only species of fish that I have ever caught on a fly fouled
with vegetation is the Spotted Bay bass. This has happened on numerous
occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">I</font> <font SIZE="4">usually
drift with the wind and the current over the flats but I will occasionally
anchor. Casts can be made the direction of the drift, perpendicular to the
drift, or anywhere in between depending on the depth of the water and speed of
the current. San Diego bay has large expanses of grass flats that can be
effectively drifted regardless of the wind or current direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">W</font><font SIZE="4">hen
anchored, I will place the boat over the flats near a channel edge where the
current is running parallel to the channel. In this situation I make a
quartering cast up-current and just beyond the edge. I then let the fly sink and
sweep along the edge, retrieving just enough line to maintain contact with the
fly. Strikes will comes as the fly drops over the channel edge and is swept
along in the current. A an effective tact conventional gear anglers use is to
cast and retrieve deep diving crank baits over the grass with a stop and go
retrieve. Fly anglers can mimic this with a foam wiggle bug and a fast sinking
line.</font></p>

the grass flats may provide the easiest fishing, visible structure provides the
most obvious fishing location. In fact, I usually advise newcomers to fish the
bridges since they will put you in the vicinity of flats, deep channels, and
hard structure. Within the developed bays of southern California such structure
is usually man-made: rock retaining walls,<img border="0" src="images/baybasscastbreakwater.jpg" align="right" width="256" height="157"> breakwaters, jetties, piers pilings,
docks, moored boats, bridges, and wrecks. I find it difficult to pass up making
a few casts to such structure until I determine a particular item as generally
unproductive. More often than not they are productive at some point during the
tidal sequence. Fish are often found tight to such structure during slack water
period but a bit looser when the tide is moving. Fishing around visible <img border="0" src="images/baybasssboatsmarina.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="157">
structure often produces the greatest variety of species during an outing as
numerous game fish are drawn to the baitfish using it as cover. When casting to
visible structure I usually count my fly down to the bottom, perhaps
interjecting a strip or two, while remaining attentive for light strikes. If the
fly reaches my predetermined count (depth) I <img border="0" src="images/baybasscastdock.jpg" align="left" width="251" height="147"> will then commence a full retrieve.
Most strikes come on the sink or after the first couple of strips. When casting
to moored boats I take care to not strike the boat with my cast; most owners are
not enamored with anglers blasting their investment with lures or lead eyed
flies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/baybasscastbreakwater.jpg" align="left" width="256" height="157"></font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">R</font><font SIZE="4">ock
walls deserve some special consideration because there are distinctly different
types. The first type is rock retaining walls constructed to prevent erosion.
These walls often end not much deeper than the low tide mark, if that low. They
are usually adjacent to sand or grass flats. Fishing such walls is usually a
waste of time. Instead, concentrate on the flats and channels that the walls
abut. Deeper retaining walls, breakwaters, and jetties on the other hand provide
a haven for myriad sustenance for gamefish. Casts right along the rocks will
often result in jarring strikes, especially during the rising and falling tide.
When fishing from<img border="0" src="images/baybassfishingwall.jpg" align="right" width="254" height="149"> shore without backcast room, one can
<img border="0" src="images/baybasshookup.jpg" align="left" width="251" height="151"> employ the saltwater
equivalent of high stick nymphing. Just make a short roll cast up-current with a
fast sinking line and weighted fly and follow the swing with the rod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">T</font><font SIZE="4">he
deeper water and channels provide a bit of a challenge to the fly fisher: The
conventional angler can use lead jig heads to get his lure down but the fly
angler has to rely on sinking lines and drift management to score consistently.
Some channels will be fifty feet or deeper but fortunately we do not usually
have to resort to fishing this deep. Hungry bass will move up in the water
column to feed on schools of baitfish as they move through with the tides, often
right to the surface. Although large bass and halibut can be hooked near the
bottom of the center of the channel, the edges are usually the most productive.
This typically means fishing in water ten to thirty feet deep. It is often
necessary to cast a fast sinking line down drift (ahead of the drifting boat) in
order to allow time for the line to sink before the boat passes it's entry point
and begins to drag it upward out of the strike zone. Depending on the desired
depth, the retrieve can be initiated at any point at or beyond where the fly
entered the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">F</font><font color="#000000" size="4">i</font><font SIZE="4">nally,
bait receivers are worthy of the angler’s attention. Constructed and operated
to service the general public and the sportfishing fleets, bait receivers
attract all sorts of wild life looking for an easy meal from spilled or
discarded bait. This includes birds, sea lions, and game fish. Sometimes cold,
sometimes hot, it is usually worth your time to make a few casts around the
receivers - you never know what you might hook up.</p>

far the best fishing platform is a boat of some type. Boats will generally
provide the greatest range and flexibility. Float tubes or pontoon kick boats
can be employed in protected waters and are especially useful around marinas.
The float tuber needs to be aware of the wind, tides, and boat traffic. Wearing
bright clothing will help make you visible to boaters and a whistle is a handy
warning device. A proper personal flotation device should be considered standard
gear. Failure to carry one could be harmful to your wallet as well as life since
the Coast Guard or Harbor Police on San Diego and Mission bays will cite tubers
without one. Kayaks are gaining in popularity too and are perhaps the best
platform for fishing the channels surrounded by shallow grass and mud flats such
as those found in the southern reaches of San Diego Bay. Whenever fishing from a
watercraft, it pays to keep your eyes moving about as if your head was on a
swivel because you will be sharing the water with other craft from dinghies to
Aircraft Carriers. Not everyone operating these vessels is as attentive as they
should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">S</font><font SIZE="4">hore
and wade fishing opportunities are minimal in San Diego Bay but there are a few
beaches that may be fished in this manner. There are many inviting looking rock
embankments but for the most part it is difficult to make long enough cast to
hit productive water from these locations.</p>

bass feast on a cornucopia of tasty critters including anchovies, smelt, shrimp,
mussels, crabs, and marine worms. Our flies should be chosen to imitate these
food items. If I were limited to one fly for bay bass, it would be a <img border="0" src="images/baybassflies.jpg" align="left" width="231" height="164"> size four
chartreuse and white Flashtail Clouser Minnow that is about two and a half
inches long including the flash tail. It is fun to use other patterns of course
and a host of them are productive. Standard Clouser Minnows, Deceivers, Alfs,
Flashtail Whistlers, Sar-Mul-Macs, Sea Habits, Woolly Buggers, crab patterns,
shrimp patterns, wiggle bugs, and spoon type flies are just a small subset of
the patterns that will work.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">C</font><font SIZE="4">hartreuse
is always an excellent color choice but others include all white, blue/white,
green/white, gray/white, red/white, red/yellow, and rust/orange. All patterns
seem to be improved in their efficacy with the incorporation of some<img border="0" src="images/baybassfliesfatal.jpg" align="right" width="272" height="148"> flash. Fly
sizes range from a one-inch long pattern tied on a size 8 hook to a 5-inch long
pattern tied on a 3/0 hook. I hesitate to use flies on a hook smaller than size
four since the fish often inhale them but I occasionally do. Larger flies will
catch fewer fish, but the average size of the fish will increase. Conventional <img border="0" src="images/VarietySMMs.jpg" align="left" width="174" height="143">
anglers often use five-inch long plastic swim baits with deadly effect and a
large Flashtail Whistler, Deceiver, Spinster or Sar-Mul-Mac can best approximate
these lures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">F</font><font SIZE="4">ly
delivery: Five- to nine-weight rods will do the job nicely. At the lighter end
of the scale, the five-weight will be ok for most of the smaller bass. It will
be a bit light if you are fortunate enough to tie into a really large fish, like
<img border="0" src="images/RichJhalibut.jpg" align="left" width="172" height="279">
maybe a legal size halibut, white sea bass, or barracuda. At the other end of
the scale a nine-weight will be a bit heavy most of the time but it is ideal for
handling lead core lines used for plumbing the depths or working fast currents.
A seven-weight is a good all around choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">A</font> <font SIZE="4">system
of interchangeable shooting heads provides the most versatility in a fly line
system for bay bass fishing. I like to use standard heads with a 3- to 4-inch
per second (ips) sink rate, 5- to 6-inch rate, and a lead core head made from
Cortland’s LC-13 (about 8 ips) for deep presentations. A coated shooting line
like Scientific Angler’s Master Saltwater shooting line in the .035”
diameter is a good all around shooting line for bay work. A monofilament
shooting line like Amnesia® is useful for deeper presentations since its
smaller diameter permits quicker penetration of the water column. While not
actually shooting heads. special sinking lines with incorporated running lines
such as the T and TS series from the Teeny Nymph Company and similar lines from
Cortland, Rio, Orvis, Scientific Angler’s may also be used. Additional reels
or spools will be necessary however, if different densities are needed. Ten or
thirteen foot sink tip lines have limited applications over the flats in shallow
water. Rarely can a floating line be employed as most of the action is below the
surface, even when baitfish are being pushed to the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">L</font><font SIZE="4">eaders
can be kept short and simple. A four-foot length of 8-, 10-, or 12- pound test
monofilament looped directly to the end of the fly line is sufficient. I use a
Bimini knot to form a doubled line that is then formed into a doubled loop with
a surgeon’s knot to create an end loop for the leader. This is probably
overkill for this type of fishing but I make leaders and tippets ahead of time
so they will be available for any type of fishing. I will usually not replace a
leader until it is cut back below 24”. Bay bass do not seem to be leader or
line shy. It is important to monitor the condition of the leader as rocks,
pilings, and the teeth of the bass will abrade the leader. Most flies perform
better if attracted with a loop knot such as the Duncan Loop or Non-Slip Mono
Loop Knot.&nbsp; If you wish to keep it simple, just tie a Surgeon's loop into
one end of a 6-foot length of 20 pound mono and loop it to your head.&nbsp; Any
good loop knot, such as the Non-slip Mono loop will suffice for attaching the
fly.</p>

bass, and most of the other species that you may catch incidentally, are not
dragsters. Most will be hand stripped to the boat. Accordingly,&nbsp; high cost&nbsp;
reels are not necessary. Almost any well made reel with a solid drag mechanism,
either disk or click type, will suffice and will last a long time with proper
maintenance.</p>

<p>Other Good Stuff</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">A</font> <font SIZE="4">host
of assorted accouterments are useful when pursuing bay bass: Navigational charts
are indispensable for quickly identifying potentially productive areas. Charts
exist for most southern California bays. Even if you don’t own one, it
doesn’t hurt to get a look at one. A depth finder will help quickly identify
unseen structure and schools of baitfish. I use a Fishing Buddy from Bottom Line
on rental skiffs. A drift sock or drag chain is helpful in slowing down your
drift in breezy conditions even when renting a boat. Some anglers like to tape
their thumbs to avoid a serious case of “bass thumb” that often is the
result of a successful day. I like to carry some sort of instant hand sanitizer,
like that sold under the Purell label. Also included is a small first aid kit
containing packets of antiseptic to treat those inevitable&nbsp; spine
punctures. If barracuda are around it is nice to have wire for bite traces.
Surflon, from American Fishing Wire Company, is a fantastic coated
multi-filament wire that you can tie standard knots with. Although costly, it is
very easy to work with.</p>

<p>When To Fish</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">A</font><font SIZE="4">s
already discussed, tidal movement plays a large part in fishing success. Fishing
can be productive at any point during the tidal phase. However, to summarize,
the best fishing will be generally be during the second half of a rising tide
and first half of a falling tide. Usually the greater the difference between the
high and the low, the better the fishing. <b>[Editor's note: these types of
tidal swings occur on new and full moon periods - Spring tides]</b>. Catching
and releasing fifty fish on the last half of a rising tide is not unusual during
the summer with half that total being about average. Smaller counts are to be
expected during other phases. Skunks are rare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">T</font><font SIZE="4">he
wind will usually come into play at some time during the day. On southern
California waters the prevailing wind is from the west or northwest. During the
late spring and summer, mornings will often be calm but the breeze will begin to
build as the day progresses. On San Diego Bay this will typically be around
11:00 a.m. The breeze will usually peak at 10-15 knots and then subside at
sundown. Accordingly, morning, evening and even night provide optimal
conditions. Fishing at night can sometimes be quite magical with the lighted
skyline in the background. On a highly developed water like San Diego Bay it
never really gets dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#FF0000" size="5">D</font><font SIZE="4">uring
the fall through early spring the wind is much less predictable in both
direction and intensity and it pays to heed the weather forecast. Despite the
less predictable weather, fishing during this period may be productive at times.
Colder water makes the fish a bit more sluggish but they can be enticed to eat a
fly. The eel grass flats are usually less productive at this time with most of
the best fishing coming from along the transitional zones between the flats and
the deepwater channels. This is the time when&nbsp; leadcore shooting heads
really shine.</font></p>

most fly anglers think of saltwater fly fishing they fill their heads with<br>
images of slashing bluefish, brilliant bonefish flats, leaping tarpon,&nbsp; or<br>
stripers wherever they're found.&nbsp; However, in southern California we have a
fantastic, convenient,&nbsp; saltwater fishery right in our own front yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;
San Diego Bay and other regional waters provide&nbsp; conveniently located and
productive angling venues with a variety of species for both novice and
experienced anglers, alike.&nbsp; These bays and their myriad species are all
well suited for the visitor with a few hours, or for locals with time for
exploration.&nbsp; It is a fishery that welcomes the fly angler with plenty of
room and incredible fly-rodding opportunity.<br>
