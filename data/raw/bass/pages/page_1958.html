[The following information is taken from several articles written by ASW director David H. Green and originally published in our customer newsmagazine <I>Chrestologia</I>. This material has been revised and expanded since that time and is presented here in order to provide some basic information and guidance to trumpet players considering the purchase of a rotary valved instrument.]
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For over twenty-five years, Antique Sound Workshop has 
provided a large selection of high quality baroque trumpets and other 
historical brass instruments to our customers. We have also been importing 
rotary valve trumpets from several European makers such as Monke and 
Ganter for professional orchestral players wishing to use these instruments 
in their work, although we have until recently been somewhat apologetic 
for the high prices and variable quality which seemed to be characteristic 
of these instruments. Some ten years ago, however, we introduced an 
outstanding new line of modern rotary valve B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpets made 
by the Bavarian workshop of <A HREF="dotzauer.htm#trpts">Josef Dotzauer.</A> Professional response to 
these instruments has been extremely enthusiastic, and we have furnished 
a large number of these instruments to leading orchestral players 
and educational institutions. 
<P>
Modern rotary valve trumpets are still widely used today in Germany and Austrian 
orchestras in place of the piston valve instruments more commonly used in France and the United 
States. While rotary valve trumpets are not strictly speaking historical but rather contemporary 
brass instruments, American trumpet players have in recent years increasingly been 
using these instruments for all of the Austro-German classical and 
romantic repertoire from Mozart and Haydn to Bruckner and Mahler, 
often at the insistence of European-born and trained conductors who prefer the tonal qualities of these trumpets. While the use of rotary valve instruments is certainly not historically accurate 
for the classical and early romantic natural trumpet orchestral literature, 
many conductors and players seem to feel that the tapered attack and 
warmer tone quality of these instruments is better suited to the modern 
performance of natural trumpet parts than the more brilliant and incisive 
piston valve instrument. There is no question, however, that the rotary 
valve trumpet is the stylistically appropriate <I>and</I> historically 
authentic instrument for the late 19th and early 20th century Germanic 
repertory. Recordings and American tours by leading European ensembles 
such as the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonic Orchestras have clearly demonstrated the superiority 
of these instruments for that literature. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Response and Tone Quality</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
American players, accustomed to the rapid and accurate response of 
the piston valve trumpets on which they have built their technique, 
frequently have difficulties when first performing on rotary valve 
instruments. The "feel" is quite different, and the response 
and tonal properties require some adjustment of one's playing technique 
and style. These problems are further aggravated by the fact that 
many of the rotary valve trumpets generally available are poorly designed 
and/or made. Many orchestras have acquired sets of instruments by 
leading custom makers such as Monke or Ganter at very high prices 
and have been disappointed in the quality of these instruments in comparison 
to the best piston valve trumpets, on which much more research and 
development has been done in recent years. 
<P>
The first step in coming to terms with the rotary valve trumpet is to understand that it is a completely different instrument in virtually every respect. The response of a rotary trumpet, by design, is very different than that of a piston valve instrument. The acoustical design of the instrument 
favors a more tapered attack and decay of each tone and encourages a 
more fluid, legato, or vocal tonal production which is ideal for romantic 
music of a lyrical nature. The rounded edges of the beginning and 
end of each tone allow better blending with the other brass sections 
of the orchestra in chordal passages such as are found in Bruckner; 
they also permit natural trumpet parts of the classical and early 
romantic literature to be played at a full volume without sticking 
out of the orchestral texture. The German rotary valve trumpet should 
be considered different than and complementary to the French piston 
valve instrument. They are by nature two different instruments for 
two different types of music and styles of playing, each having its 
own unique properties and strengths, each suited to a particular type 
of literature. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Bore Size and Volume</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Austro-German rotary valve trumpets have in general a much smaller bore than the piston valve instruments commonly in use in the United States. This does not, however, mean that rotary valve trumpets are necessarily less free-blowing. We suspect that many American orchestral 
players have had experience only with poorly designed or produced 
instruments which were stuffy or unresponsive. Bach-Selmer 
B<SUP>b</SUP> piston valve trumpets have bore sizes as follows: medium bore, .453", 
medium large bore, .459", large bore, .462"; most other American-style 
piston valve trumpets have similar bore sizes. By comparison, our 
<A HREF="dotztrpt.jpg">Dotzauer rotary valve trumpets</A> in B<SUP>b</SUP> have a bore size 
of .429", which is much smaller. This does not mean, however, 
that these instruments are small in tone or volume; a comparison of 
bore size alone is virtually meaningless, since it is only one factor 
in the overall acoustical design of the instrument. For example, rotary valve trumpets 
have much larger and heavier bells, have less conical and therefore more cylindrical tuning, have a larger bore mouthpipe, and are often made 
of gold brass rather than the yellow brass used for most piston trumpets. 
An American trumpet with a bore of .429" would indeed have a small, 
thin sound, but the rotary valve instrument provides a much larger 
tone while affording the advantages in efficiency, response, and accuracy 
of a smaller bore instrument.
<P>
Just recently, a number of European rotary trumpet makers (including Dotzauer) have introduced somewhat larger bore models, typically about .441", in an apparent attempt to accommodate players whose primary performance experience has been with piston trumpets. The mouthpipes are also altered to permit the use of mouthpieces with backbores originally designed for piston trumpet use. Such instruments may well ease the learning curve for piston trumpet players, but they have the disadvantage of sounding less like traditional European rotary trumpets and more like piston trumpets. We are happy to offer such "hybrid" trumpets to those customers who prefer this type of instrument but feel strongly that the original standard-bore rotary trumpets are more authentic and therefore preferable for those players having the patience and persistence to learn how to play them properly.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Mouthpiece Selection</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The mouthpiece receiver on a rotary valve trumpet has the same taper 
as on an American trumpet, so there is usually no problem using a standard 
or custom American mouthpiece and getting acceptable results immediately. 
However, the very different acoustical design of the instrument will 
probably lead the discriminating professional player to experiment 
with slightly different cup, throat, and/or backbore designs in order 
to match the instrument to the individual player and obtain optimum 
results. Most players are better off staying with their standard mouthpiece until they have become familiar with the rotary valve instrument. However, some custom mouthpieces have non-standard backbores designed to compensate for the design problems of specific makes and models of piston trumpets; such mouthpieces can produce less than ideal results on rotary valve trumpets. Futhermore, C trumpets in general, both piston and rotary valve, require different mouthpieces with different backbores than B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpets. Many of the intonation and response problems frequently encountered by players of C trumpets are in fact caused by the use of inappropriate mouthpieces that have been designed for B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpet use. We recommend that purchasers of Dotzauer rotary valve trumpets at least try the mouthpiece supplied with the instrument, which is well-matched to the instrument and guaranteed to provide excellent tone, response, and intonation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Water Key Function</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The water key on the rotary valve trumpet has an acoustical function 
in addition to its more obvious purpose of eliminating accumulated 
condensation. The long lever allows the key to be opened by the little 
finger of the right hand while the rest of the hand is in playing 
position on the valves. Opening the waterkey improves the response 
and security of certain notes in the high register, such as written 
high d''' above the staff, and gives the player additional insurance 
in getting these notes accurately. This technique is extremely useful 
in certain exposed passages such as the octave fanfare leap to concert 
high c''' in the Richard Strauss <I>Sinfonia Domestica</I>, which 
more than one fine player has nicked in the heat of a performance. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Third Valve Triggers</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some players have remarked that they would prefer their rotary valve 
trumpets to have third valve slide triggers, such as are common on 
professional quality American piston valve trumpets to correct the 
sharpness inherent in valve combinations in the low register. The 
fact of the matter is, as some more astute players have been quick 
to point out, that one does not really need the trigger mechanism 
on these instruments. The acoustical 
design of rotary valve trumpets is such that the pitch center of the 
tone on these instruments is broader and more flexible than on a piston 
valve trumpet, where the notes tend to "lock-in" more rigidly. It is thus possible to simply aim slightly lower for 
the low register tones such as written g and d' that require combination 
valve fingerings and still produce a full, well-centered, in-tune 
note. This is part of the playing technique of the instrument and 
considerably less trouble than operating a third valve slide. Experienced 
players quickly pick up the habit so that it becomes second nature 
and many players trying these instruments for the first time make 
the occasional slight correction instinctively. We strongly feel, 
therefore, that the third valve trigger is not really necessary; we can, however, 
custom order rotary valve trumpets with such a trigger if desired 
or retrofit an instrument with one if the player decides that he needs 
one after using the instrument for a while. The Dotzauer professional model goldbrass instruments come equipped with a third valve trigger but can be special-ordered without one if desired. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Rotary Trumpets in C</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The C piston trumpet was originally a lighter, brighter, more transparent 
instrument introduced after the First World War by French and Belgian 
makers at a time when the B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpet was the tonal standard 
for virtually all other national schools of playing. Over the past 
several decades, however, many American players have adopted the C 
trumpet as their standard orchestral instrument, regardless of the 
instrument called for by the composer; they prefer the greater accuracy 
and security of the C instrument, particularly in the extreme high 
register. Makers of piston valve trumpets have tried, with varying 
degrees of success, to accommodate the needs of orchestral players 
by producing C trumpets which attempt to combine the tonal weight 
and projection of the B<SUP>b</SUP> instrument with the accuracy and security 
of the C trumpet. 
<P>
Some of the earliest American C piston trumpets were produced by simply 
shortening large or medium-large bore B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpets; this design 
short-cut resulted in instruments which were not optimized for performance 
at this pitch and had severe intonation and response problems. Typical 
of these instruments were the Bach Selmer trumpets: although the B<SUP>b</SUP> 
models were very decent, the C trumpets had all sorts of design problems 
which could be remedied only by extensive and expensive custom modifications, 
such as replacing the tuning slide with a B<SUP>b</SUP> slide, replacing 
the mouthpipe with one of more suitable taper, and often replacing 
the bell as well. Some recent attempts at C trumpet design by other 
makers have been more successful, primarily because makers have belatedly 
realized that it was necessary to design a completely new instrument 
from scratch, rather than to modify existing B<SUP>b</SUP> designs. 
<P>
The relatively few German makers who produce C rotary valve trumpets 
seem to have experienced similar design problems. Not only do their 
instruments have intonation and response difficulties, they lack the 
characteristic warmth and depth of tone which, for most American players, 
is the sole reason for using these instruments in the late 19th Austro-German 
symphonic repertoire in place of the piston trumpet. Although we have 
occasionally obtained custom-made C rotary trumpets for those customers 
who insisted on having one in addition to the B<SUP>b</SUP> instrument, 
we have not until now been able to endorse the C instruments very 
enthusiastically. We have felt that the essential tone quality of 
the rotary trumpet is that of a narrow bore B<SUP>b</SUP> instrument and 
that the C trumpets lacked the fullness and richness of tone characteristic 
of the B<SUP>b</SUP> instruments. 
<P>
A few years ago, we began negotiations with Josef Dotzauer 
to produce a C rotary valve trumpet to our specifications, one which 
would parallel the development of the newer American C piston trumpets 
and address the requirements of the American orchestral player. Specifically, 
we wanted a C rotary trumpet which would have the dependability of 
the C instrument without sacrificing the richness of tone, power of 
projection, and accurate intonation and response of the Dotzauer B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpets. After considerable design experimentation 
and the building of many prototypes which were tested by leading professional 
players, we are now proud to announce the general availability of 
the new Dotzauer rotary valve C trumpet to our customers. 
<P>
This remarkable new instrument has the exact same .429" bore size 
as the B<SUP>b</SUP> rotary trumpet. Since, however, the bore size is 
larger in proportion to the overall length of the instrument as the 
B<SUP>b</SUP>, this had to be compensated for by a completely different 
mouthpipe and a bell branch terminating in a smaller flare. Although 
the bell flare and the remainder of the bell branch are traditionally made in two separate pieces and fused together, it 
was found that superior response could be obtained in both B<SUP>b</SUP> and C instruments by making the bell in one piece. This procedure is slower and more 
costly, but it is one of just many reasons why Dotzauer trumpets are superior.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Standard and Heckel Models</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Antique Sound Workshop now offers a total of four different standard bore B<SUP>b</SUP> 
and C rotary valve trumpets by Dotzauer for immediate delivery 
to our professional customers. The former Standard Model B<SUP>b</SUP> and C trumpets were 
made in yellow brass, had traditional (non-Uniball) valve linkages, and no waterkey. These models have since been discontinued in favor of the deluxe model, which is also made in yellow brass but has more elaborate nickel silver slide stockings and braces, Unibal valve linkages, and a water key. The top-of-the-line professional model is made of goldbrass, has all of the features of the deluxe model plus solid nickel-silver valve casings, and also has a third valve trigger mechanism.
<P>
Each of these models can also be equipped with a engraved nickel-silver Heckel garland on the bell which is not only decorative but also serves to darken the tone and increase the resistance and projection of the instrument. Normally, we stock mostly instruments with the Heckel bell, although we occasionally have instruments without and are happy to special-order these if desired. The Heckel versions are only slightly more expensive than the standard models. 
<P>
The relative performance characteristics 
of the standard bore yellow brass and goldbrass models, with and without Heckel bell, may be easily seen from the following table:

<H3>Low F Trumpets</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have also added to our inventory rotary valve orchestral trumpets 
in low F. These instruments represented the final stage 
of development of the eight-foot length trumpet of the baroque and 
classical periods and were the standard trumpet used in the late 19th 
and early 20th century orchestra before the now-common half-length 
B<SUP>b</SUP> and C trumpets came into general use. Comment on the then-new 
short trumpets was not universally favorable, and many conductors 
and players criticized the lack of authentic trumpet tone quality 
of the half-length instruments.
<P>
Trumpet historians have recently concluded 
that the low F orchestral trumpet, together with its less-common companion 
in E<SUP>b</SUP>, was in fact the last true member of the historical trumpet 
family and that modern half-length trumpets, with their mixture of 
cylindrical and conical bore tapers (American-style piston valve trumpets 
have an average of 29% cylindrical tubing exclusive of valve slides, 
21% conical tubing exclusive of the bell branch, and 50% in the sharply 
conical bell branch) are in fact a hybrid of trumpet and cornet design 
and represent a new type of instrument which is a radical departure 
from the true trumpet family. As with any type of innovation, there 
was a trade-off of priorities, both for better and for worse. The 
newer four-foot instruments provided greater security in the upper 
register than the older eight-foot pitch instruments for the less-accomplished 
players of that day, but at a considerable sacrifice in tonal quality 
and musical properties. 
<P>
The use of B<SUP>b</SUP> rotary valve trumpets for the late romantic Austro-German 
repertoire and the earlier natural trumpet literature has become extremely 
widespread among American orchestral players in the last decade or 
so. We suspect that the reintroduction of the low F trumpet will be 
the next logical step in the revival of the authentic performance practice 
of late 19th and early 20th orchestral trumpet playing. The level 
of playing technique as well as the design skill and quality control 
of trumpet makers have increased substantially in the last one hundred 
years, and present-day players can bring a much greater degree of 
accuracy and control to the F trumpet than was common in the late 
nineteenth century. 
<P>
The low F orchestral trumpet is not the same instrument as a contralto F trumpet; 
they are two different instruments for two different purposes. The 
so-called contralto trumpets pitched in low F or E<SUP>b</SUP>, as well 
as bass trumpets pitched in low D, C, or B<SUP>b</SUP> are of much larger 
bore sizes. Whereas there are bass trumpet parts in the late Wagner 
operas and the works of a few later composers, contralto trumpets 
have never found general acceptance as an orchestral instrument. They 
do, however, have some utility in trumpet or brass choir music. The 
true orchestral trumpet in low F, on the other hand, 
is a narrow bore instrument with the same musical flexibility and 
solo properties as the shorter trumpets and in addition has a much 
richer and fuller tone, a more complex, burnished quality. 
In fact, the Dotzauer low F trumpets have exactly the same .429" 
bore diameter as their B<SUP>b</SUP> and C rotary valve trumpets! The 
overall length of the tubing, however, is about half again as long 
as the B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpet, affording better projection with a darker, 
richer overtone structure as well as accurate response and greater 
pitch stability. 
<P>
Those musicians who have never seen an F trumpet before are always 
amazed to find that, on first glance, it appears to be a B<SUP>b</SUP> 
trumpet, having the same bell size and physical length. Only by looking 
closely at the longer valve slides and extra tubing can one see that 
it is designed to play at a lower pitch. It bears the same relationship 
to the B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpet as the F side of a double horn does to the 
B<SUP>b </SUP>side. A double F/B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpet would be ideal, but the 
additional size and weight would make it clumsy and tiring to hold, seeing as 
it is not held in the lap like a double horn. We suspect 
that some et players might develop a "double horn" technique, 
playing most passages on the F trumpet and switching to a B<SUP>b</SUP> 
instrument for occasional high register work. 
<P>
The full length F trumpet was the preferred instrument of players 
and composers from the invention of the valve trumpet up until about 
the time of the First World War. If one looks at the symphonies of 
both Sibelius and Vaughan-Williams, for example, the earlier works 
specify F trumpets and the later ones B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpets. Richard 
Strauss, who used the F trumpet extensively in his scores, notes in 
his 1904 revision of the Berlioz <I>Treatise on Instrumentation</I> 
that, at that time, first players were generally using B<SUP>b</SUP> trumpets 
and second and third players were using F trumpets, regardless of 
the score notation. Clearly the turn of the century saw a transitional 
phase during which both types of instruments were in use either interchangeably 
or simultaneously. Once one has experienced playing the Franck Symphony, 
the Wagner <I>Parsifal </I>Prelude, Strauss's <I>Tyl Eulenspiegel</I>, 
or the Sibelius Second Symphony on an F trumpet, the tonal limitations 
of the short length trumpets for this late romantic literature become 
readily apparent. 
<P>
A further, albeit less authentic use of this instrument would be for 
a modern-instrument performance of the solo trumpet part 
of the <I>Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 </I>of J. S. Bach. This writer 
has for over twenty-five years maintained that this part was supposed 
to sound an octave lower than it is customarily played today. A number of 
performances in recent years, starting with a recording supervised 
by the British musicologist Thurston Dart shortly before his death 
more than twenty years ago, have in fact been done precisely that 
way, although with the substitution of modern horn for trumpet. The 
use of the low F orchestral trumpet would in fact keep the work in 
the provenance of the trumpet world, provide a tonal quality closer 
to that of the same-length baroque F trumpet, and restore the proper balance and 
octave placement of the four solo parts as well. We suspect that many 
trumpeters will continue to play the solo part in the higher octave 
simply because it represents a macho <I>tour de force</I> for the 
accomplished player; musically sensitive players and conductors, however, 
may well wish to opt for a performance which places a premium on musical 
values rather than exhibitionism.

<H3>Fl&uuml;gelhorns, Posthorns,<R>
and Herald Trumpets</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We also now have in stock several models of <A HREF="dotzflug.jpg">rotary valve fl&uuml;gelhorns</A> 
in B<SUP>b</SUP> by Josef Dotzauer. They produce both a standard size instrument and a shorter, smaller-belled <A HREF="dotzkuhl.jpg">Kuhlo model fl&uuml;gelhorn,</A> which has a tone quality and response somewhere in between a full-sized rotary valve fl&uuml;gelhorn and a B<SUP>b</SUP> rotary valve trumpet. The brass band, jazz, and studio players who have tried these instruments have pronounced them greatly superior to piston valve fl&uuml;gelhorns from various makers. They have a uniformity of response, accuracy of intonation, easy-speaking high register, and will accept standard trumpet shank mouthpieces; we can also get replacement mouthpipes with receivers for American-style short-shank flügelhorn mouthpieces. Players will find these instruments ideal for the extensive lyrical solo fl&uuml;gelhorn passages in the Ninth Symphony 
of Vaughan-Williams and Stravinsky's <I>Threni,</I> as well as the 
<I>flicorno</I> parts in such scores as Respighi's <I>Pines of Rome.</I> 
The famous extended posthorn solo in the Mahler Third Symphony is 
also frequently played on fl&uuml;gelhorn (or sometimes even less correctly 
on cornet); the Kuhlo model flügelhorn is actually a much better choice for this passage. Please note, however, that we also have in stock fine 
posthorns in B<SUP>b</SUP> with three rotary valves, which are the ideal
instrument for the latter work as well as the posthorn solo passages 
in the Mozart<I> Posthorn Serenade,</I> K. 320 and the sleigh ride 
<I>German Dance</I>, K. 605, No. 3. The <A HREF="dotzauer.htm#trpts">Josef Dotzauer 
fl&uuml;gelhorns,</A> like their trumpets, are available in both the deluxe yellow brass model and a gold brass professional model with third valve trigger mechanism; the posthorns are available only in yellow brass, wrapped with either imitation or genuine green leather.

<H3>Tenor and Bass Trumpets</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The bass trumpet in D, C or B<SUP>b</SUP> is required for the Wagner Ring 
dramas and for a number of contemporary scores as well. The instrument 
is usually assigned to a utility member of the trombone 
section and is typically disliked by many players in spite of the wonderful 
solo passages assigned to the instrument. Again, we suspect that this 
attitude stems not just from a lack of familiarity with the instrument 
(the Wagner Ring is certainly not standard repertory at many of the 
world's opera houses) but also from the trauma of having to play exposed 
solos on an instrument that is all too often unresponsive, lacking 
in tone quality, and problematic in intonation.
<P>
Josef Dotzauer, in addition to their extremely wide assortment of 
other brass instruments, also produce an excellent professional quality 
<A HREF="dotzbtrp.jpg">rotary valve bass trumpet</A> in B<SUP>b</SUP> which is capable of truly musical 
results. This instrument is extremely compact in design, well-balanced 
in distribution of weight, and produces a true bass trumpet (as opposed 
to tenor horn or trombone) tone quality. The rotary valves are precision 
built and operate effortlessly, affording the player outstanding response 
and an excellent legato even in the low register. Josef Dotzauer also produces 
a tenor trumpet in low B<SUP>b</SUP> which has a smaller bell and bore size than the bass trumpet. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Piccolo Trumpets</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition to their standard B<SUP>b</SUP> and C trumpets, as well as their low-pitched instruments, the Dotzauer workshop also produces an excellent and very reasonably priced <A HREF="dotzpicc.jpg">rotary valve piccolo trumpet</A> in B<SUP>b</SUP>/A.</A> These instruments are very similar in appearance to the piccolos made by the East German Scherzer workshop, but they are more consistent in quality and uniform in tone. They provide excellent intonation and a relatively full tone that avoids the nasal quality common to many other piccolo designs. They have four valves, as do most professional piccolos; the fourth valve, operated by the right little finger, is available either with a lever in-line with the other three valves or a longer, offset lever, to compensate for the shorter length of the little finger. We usually keep just the offset model in stock, but are happy to get in-line instruments on special order for customers preferring that style of instrument.

<H3>Rotary Trumpets in Jazz</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The jazz trumpet players who have visited our exhibits at the New 
York Brass Conference or the ITG Conferences in the past two decades, 
many of whom had never played a rotary valve trumpet before, have been 
greatly impressed with the jazz potential of these instruments. The 
greater fluidity and warmer tone quality, the shorter finger movement 
and greater ease in operating the uniball linkage of the rotary valves, 
and the accurate yet tapered response attack have earned these instruments 
much favorable comment among some of the most accomplished jazz artists 
in the country. This crossover between the jazz and symphonic schools 
of brass playing is indeed a heartening and healthy trend. A number 
of prominent jazz artists have purchased rotary valve trumpets and fl&uuml;gelhorns
from us and are using them regularly in their club and studio work.

<P>
<H3>The Future of American Trumpet Playing</H3>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The audition lists for most American orchestras, both major and minor, 
now generally require several excerpts to be prepared and played on 
rotary valve trumpets. An informal survey of several friends playing 
in the trumpet sections of major American orchestras seems to indicate 
that some orchestras are now using rotary valve instruments a good 
50% of the time. We have no doubt that, within the next five to ten 
years, more players will also be using the orchestral F trumpet as well 
for the substantial body of late nineteenth century music specifying 
that instrument. The F trumpet is also clearly a better choice for 
the classical and early romantic trumpet parts in F, E, E<SUP>b</SUP>, 
D, and C, since it can be "crooked" down to the other keys 
by the valves and then actually played as a natural trumpet. 
<P>
Let's face it, the days when an orchestral player could make do with 
only one or two instruments are past and gone forever. Today's orchestral 
player is expected to be equally proficient on a wide variety of instruments 
from the B<SUP>b</SUP>/A piccolo through the high G, F, E<SUP>b</SUP>, and 
D trumpets, the standard C and B<SUP>b</SUP> instruments, both piston 
and rotary, and in the near future the low F orchestral trumpet as 
well. The younger conductors now coming to the fore are generally 
better informed and more musically sensitive than many of their predecessors, 
much to the relief of the long-suffering orchestral player; they are, 
however, also making much greater demands upon their players as well. 
The end result, we hope, will be more flexible orchestral musicians 
and better performances. While a few players will undoubtedly grumble 
about having to "keep up" an increasing number of instruments, 
the best of today's younger orchestral musicians seem to have no problem 
doing all of this and doing it better than the preceding generation 
of players, which had fewer instruments and far less literature to 
master. When one considers the increasing number of players who are 
now also playing natural baroque trumpet as well, it is clear that 
the profession has come a long way in the past two decades. 
<P>
The price of a custom-made rotary valve trumpet is always going to 
be higher than a massed-produced piston valve trumpet, due to both 
the complexity of construction, the amount of handwork required, and the cost of the valves themselves. 
In comparison to a French horn with similar rotary valves, a rotary 
valve trumpet seems much more reasonable in price. We urge you to try one of these excellent rotary valve trumpets by <A HREF="dotzauer.htm#trpts">Josef Dotzauer</A> in 
your studio and concert hall at no obligation whatsoever. If you do 
not agree that these instruments are the finest available and substantially 
superior to any rotary valve trumpet you have ever played in spite of their extremely low prices, you may 
return it to us via UPS after one week's trial for a full refund.
