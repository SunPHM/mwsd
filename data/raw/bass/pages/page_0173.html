  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Starting in the 
    Detroit shop of O. F. Berdan, Henderson N. White dreamed a dream of truer, 
    finer band instruments. His repair work and daily contact with musicians taught 
    him the weaknesses of the instruments then used. And his musician's instinct 
    could not be content with their imperfections. </font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Setting himself 
    to the task of making that dream come true, Mr. White soon gained more that 
    a local reputation. Learning always from band masters who visited that little 
    shop in Detroit; studying in every spare moment; and experimenting always; 
    it wasn't long before other cities heard about him. </font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When McMillin's 
    Music Store of Cleveland needed a competent man to take charge of their repair 
    work they turned to this young student. </font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the dream urged 
    Mr. White on. After five years with McMillin he branched out into a partnership 
    with C. H. Berg. During this time the company sold imported instruments and 
    ran a very effective repair shop. The shop was located on 13 woodland Ave 
    and was very small. In 1893 Mr. White became sole owner of the business and 
    then the realization of the dream was close at hand. </font></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For in 1894 the 
    first &quot;King&quot; trombone came from Mr. White's tiny workshop. But it 
    wasn't &quot;just another trombone.&quot; Building into it all that he had 
    learned, blending knowledge with the love of accomplishment, that first trombone 
    was a revelation to the musical world. And with help from <a href="King/hn%20white%20&%20edna/thomas%20king.jpg">Mr. 
    Thomas King</a>, a local trombone player who helped Mr. White perfect his 
    invention. What developed was radically different from the then prevailing 
    models in bell, bore and mouthpipe, the &quot;King&quot; Trombone was acclaimed 
    by band men everywhere. The first famous musician to play this new trombone 
    was <a href="King/Bio%20pages/Al%20Pinard%20%20Famous%20King%20Promoter%201911%20Large.jpg">Al 
    Pinard</a>, who did his best to get others to try a &quot;The King&quot;. 
    From 1894 to 1908 each trombone slide was actually made by <a href="King/hn%20white%20&%20edna/hnmaking%20trombone.jpg">H. 
    N. White</a>. Band Players loved the King trombone because the slide was finer 
    and smoother and lighter in action than any other. With this success Mr. white 
    soon ran out of space, and moved the operation to 1870 East 9th Street, in 
    the Erie Building.</font></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="King/hn%20white%20&%20edna/hugh%20white.jpg">Mr. 
    Hugh E. White</a>, brother of H. N. White came to the company in 1903 to organize 
    a credit department for the efficient handling of accounts, and later moved 
    into the Vice President's position (leaving in 1940’s). The H. N. White Company 
    was one of the first to extensively advertise and offer credit purchase plans. 
    Then in 1904 <a href="King/hn%20white%20&%20edna/fa%20reynolds.jpg">F. A. 
    Reynolds</a> became Superintendent of the factory floor. </font></p>

    with the highest quality, and build each instrument acoustically correct. 
    Starting in 1909 Mr. White made the &quot;Department of Acoustical Research&quot; 
    and purchased (what is thought of as) the worlds largest set of tuning bells. 
    Every instrument in production would spend time being developed, and looking 
    for the smallest of improvements. Mr. White never started production on any 
    instrument unless the new design was a vast improvement in both tone and quality.</o:p></font></p>

    time in 1908 King began importing Evette &amp; Schaeffer saxophones and selling 
    them as a less expensive alternative to American made saxes. Then in 1910 
    Carl Fisher Instruments became sole distributor of Evette &amp; Schaeffer 
    saxophones and Mr. White was forced to look elsewhere. Mr. White chose to 
    import V. Kohlert saxophones while he built up the King facilities to enter 
    into his own production of saxophones. Finely around 1916 Mr. White began 
    producing his own saxophones and by 1925 he introduced a new series of horns 
    eight (C soprano, straight and curved Bb sopranos, Bb saxello, Eb alto, C 
    melody, Bb tenor and Eb baritone) horns made in Cleveland. From 1917 to 1918 
    the entire production of saxophones was made for the government during World 
    War I. Saxophones produced during the War are engraved with U. S. or some 
    other type of engraving which tells which branch of the military it went to. 
    (U. S. N. =Navy, U. S. M. C.=U. S. Army Quartermaster Corps) These saxophones 
    featured many new improvements by King associate <a href="/King/Bio%20pages/h%20e%20dreves%20page%202.jpg">Mr. 
    Henry Dreves.</a> The most interesting of these improvements was the introduction 
    of the King &quot;Saxello&quot; in the early 1920's. The saxello was a curved 
    neck and a bell tipped at a right angle on a straight soprano.</font></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some time during

    Mr. White bought the Cleveland Musical Instrument Company. The Cleveland Musical 
    Instrument Company was formed in February of 1919 and was known for their 
    Cleveland Trumpet. The Company was successful for awhile and at one time employed 
    fifteen people. But as frequently happens with new companies, overhead and 
    expenses were too great for the volume of business they could command. For 
    two years The H. N. White Company made instruments for Cleveland to help fill 
    back orders. Mr. White saw the Cleveland brand as the perfect fit to cover 
    the growing school band market which demanded high quality instruments at 
    a low price. The Cleveland brand, along with American Standard were marketed 
    to marching bands and schools. Both were about 40% less in price than a &quot;King.&quot;</font></p>

    going to the the Cleveland symphony. On March 17, 1932 Mr. White Married a 
    third time to Edna Richert a then department store gown buyer. The two of 
    them had a love of music and theater. Edna had a child from a previous marriage 
    named Cathryn and Mr. White quickly adopted the precocious eleven year old. 
    (As a side note, Dr. Frank Simon would visit from Cincinnati and stay with 
    Mr. and Mrs. White and during this time he taught Cathryn how to swim). Cathryn 
    played Clarinet (a King Silver bell) and each summer she was sent to band 
    camp at Cedar Point. During the 1936 Summer a picture was taken of the entire 
    band (with Cathryn) and H. N. White could not resist the opportunity to put

    forward with its planned program of making a wider variety of musical instruments. 
    In 1934 King stringed instruments were introduced with the <a href="/King/King%20Ads/string%20bass.jpg">big 
    Bass Viol</a>. This was followed in 1936 with the King Cello. In 1938 Mr. 
    White created the silver-lined clarinet and finished developing the <a href="/King/My%20Trombones/Trombonium%20front%20Lable.jpg">Trombonium</a>. 
    The Trombonium was a valve trombone designed to be used in school bands and 
    orchestras. Also in 1934, The H. N. White Company became the first musical 
    instrument manufacture to offer group life insurance to all of its 152 craftsmen. 
    The policy was of the contributing type with the premium payments being paid 
    by both employer and employees.(1)</font></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1936 F.A. Reynolds 
    left King to start his own short-lived company. Early Reynolds instruments 
    closely resemble King instruments with few if any improvements over the original 
    design. In the late forties Mr. Reynolds sold his company and eventually Reynolds 
    was owned by Norlin.</font></p>

    1940 at the age of 65 Mr. H. N. White died suddenly. During his remarkable 
    career as a designer and manufacturer of musical instruments, Henderson White 
    redesigned twenty eight instruments. Mr. White made a huge impact on the manufacturing 
    of musical instruments, because of his passion for high quality perfect sounding 
    instruments. </font></p>

    Then in the middle of 1941, Mrs. Edna White took control of the company as 
    President just as World War Two started.</font></p>
