<h3> Honeymoon </h3>
<h3>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">
<ul>
   First, we were dropped off by     <a href="pict/hon1.jpg"> Matthias and
Trude. </a>  A few hours later<br> we were in <a href="pict/hon2.jpg"> Nice. </a> Just as a proof - 
<a href="pict/hon3.jpg"> Erin </a> and  <a href="pict/hon4.jpg"> Thomas </a> in Nice.. <br>
We really liked the ancient <a href="pict/hon5.jpg"> buildings </a>, where we also met somebody from 
Michigan, who took     <a href="pict/hon6.jpg"> this picture. </a> 
   We then drove to <a href="pict/hon7.jpg"> San Miniato </a>,     a small
town in  <a href="pict/hon8.jpg"> Tuscany. </a> Several    day-trips brought us,
 e.g, to this <a href="pict/hon8a.jpg"> guy. </a>   Erin also found a very, very old 
<a href="pict/bass.jpg"> bass. </a>   Here is a nice picture of <a href="pict/hon9.jpg"> Erin.
 </a> <br> We returned to <a href="pict/hon10.jpg"> Nice, one more time, </a>   and then took off 
for a day in     <a href="pict/hon11.jpg"> Amsterdam </a>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">
<ul>
It took a while - but then <a href="pict/DCP_0011.JPG"> Lucas </a> was born on March, 22 2002. We love the
little guy - <a href="pict/DCP_0074.JPG"> who </a> <a href="pict/2002-05-230017.jpg"> wouldn't </a>. 
He is growing so fast. He always has his thumb
with him, even on his favorate <a href="pict/DCP_0816.JPG"> swing </a>.. He loves to dance and show off his
skills. <br>

<h3>Maria Pauline </h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size="4">
<ul>
Then, it only took a very short while - and <a href="pict/DCP_0851.JPG"> Maria </a> was born on July, 21
2003. She is soo..<a href="pict/DCP_0884.JPG"> cute </a>, look at her... She has a louder voice than her brother,
and needs less sleep. Those could be good things - in a few years... Her
mom likes to <a href="pict/026_23A.JPG"> dress her up </a>.
