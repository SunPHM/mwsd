<p align="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Half day fishing along the famous
La Jolla Kelp Bed is an outstanding way to have a great day of fishing within a relatively
short distance from the harbor. Yellowtail, bonito, bass, barracuda and a wide variety of
bottom fish all call this area home. This is a perfect trip for both the young and old!
&nbsp; A 3/4 day trip increases the potential fishing area and adds to the diversity of a
trip.</strong></font></p>

San Diego and approximately six miles into Mexican territorial waters. The Coronados
consist of four rocky islands located right on the edge of the continental shelf. Roving
herds of hungry yellowtail, barracuda and bass await the anglers in the near island
waters. Just west of the islands it is not uncommon to find the &quot;big boys&quot;
feeding!</strong></font></p>

fish with live sardines or anchovies as the tuna crash through the chum line behind the
boat. The action is often hot and heavy as this is the most intensive and exciting fishing
to be had on the coast!</strong></font></p>
