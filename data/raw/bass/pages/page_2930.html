Charter fishing rates and charter fishing prices are somewhat variable due to the range and multiplicity of sport fishing opportunities so convenient to Panama fishing. To take full advantage of the varied types of sportfishing charters and several different gamefish species abundant in Panama fishing, it is essential that a good <a href="http://www.panamafishingandcatching.com/intro.htm"target="_blank">sport fishing guide</a> provide the diverse charter fishing equipment, instruction of angling methods and boats necessary. I usually try to tailor Panama Fishing and Catching charter rates and charter fishing prices to the client&#8217;s expectations therefore client input is essential when determining the charter fishing rates and sport fishing charter prices for a sport fishing trip. The client&#8217;s satisfaction and Panama fishing goals are paramount considerations to formulating one to ten day charter fishing trips. Some anglers are only able to go charter fishing one day while on other business here in Panama while others come to Panama to solely go charter fishing for several days and target specific gamefish. For instance a client may want several days of varied inshore and offshore fishing while in Panama. One day at Lake Gatun on a sport fishing trip Peacock Bass fishing another day on the Bayano River for a sport fishing trip for Tarpon fishing or Snook fishing and another few days on a offshore sport fishing trip for pelagic gamefish species and maybe fly fishing, popping or plug casting in shallow water close to island points, jutting volcanic rock structures, beaches and bays.<img src="charter/2beach.jpg" alt="Beach bumming fishing trips" width="272" height="188" border="2" align="right"> Obviously this cannot be accomplished by a sport fishing guide with a single sportfishing boat or without diverse and specialized sport fishing tackle. The framework of a charter fishing trip can be as simple as a client just wanting to get on the water and catch anything for the few hours he has free that day or as involved as targeting giant tarpon on a fly or deep sea fishing trips of rare pelagic game fish for world records. Communication and advanced planning between the captain and his charter client are the keys to a successful charter fishing trip and figuring Panama fishing charter rates and sport fishing charter prices. These days this is easily accomplished via email or telephone and a client should have a precise picture of what to expect and what charter fishing price to pay on his charter fishing trip long before actually getting on the boat. To reserve most charter fishing trip dates a 50% deposit of the Panama fishing charter rates is required usually 30 days in advance, especially during specific gamefish &#8216;runs&#8217; or seasons. Below is a general Panama fishing charter rates and sport fishing charter prices outline using some of the variables that should help give a good indication of what your tailored Panama charter fishing trip costs or charter fishing prices should be:

<strong>Nearshore Charter Fishing-</strong> Panama fishing charter rates of $400.00 a day are tailored for two anglers on sport fishing trips along the coastal waters of Panama Bay with veteran sport fishing guides - grouper fishing, snapper fishing, snook fishing, corvina fishing, chicken dorado fishing, Sierra Mackerel fishing, jack creavalle fishing. 1 &#8211; 10 miles out around several beautiful beach spangled tropical islands such as Taboga, Tabogilla, Chama, Tarapa etc. utilizing a custom 24-foot center console Super Panga powered by a 60 hp Yamaha outboard that cruises at 30 mph.<img src="charter/3onthewater.jpg" alt="Wooden Panga Old-time Sport Fishing Trips" width="288" height="178" border="2" align="left"> Panama charter fishing trip costs or charter fishing prices include ground transportation (20 minute drive) for two to and from most Panama City hotels, ice, bottled water, bait, soft drinks, fuel, 1st class fishing gear, (mostly Penn &amp; Shimano rods &amp; reels and some custom rods), use of lures &amp; tackle etc. and all Panama sportfishing guide costs. The necessary items you might want to bring along include a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, camera, a bathing suit if you plan to swim at the beaches, towel, whatever you may want to eat or snack on, beverages other than soft drinks and water, any special lures you want to try, fly fishing gear etc. Panama fishing charter rates are for 7 to 8 hours of angling with a sport fishing guide, actual times depending on the tide and how early we start the day.<br> 
The word &#8216;Panga&#8217; is a Spanish term for &#8216;small boat&#8217; usually not used when describing a yacht or a ship. That said, in many cases a person on a larger more expensive cruise ship or yacht will often point out a smaller although equally opulent yacht as a &#8216;Panga&#8217;. 
<br> 
In Central and South America Spanish settlers first used the term to describe native dugout canoes or &#8216;bongos&#8217;. These dugout boats with the same long narrow sea worthy design are used by indigenous peoples all over the 3rd world for coastal transport and commercial hook &amp; line saltwater fishing trips. Some of these wooden boats were over 40 feet long and 10 feet wide allowing them to navigate long distances on offshore fishing trips for extended periods at sea. In the early 1970&#8217;s some local commercial fishing boats in Mexico, Colombia and Panama were produced out of fiberglass that resembled the old wooden &#8216;Pangas&#8217;. <img src="charter/4superpanga.jpg" alt="Super Panga Charter Fishing" width="224" height="230" border="2" align="right">Most of these had a pronounced deep vee from bow to stern that made them heavy and tipsy with an inefficient horsepower to load capacity ratio. In the late 1970&#8217;s and early 80&#8217;s the Japanese designed a similar fiberglass boat with something of a modified vee for export to 3rd world countries as coastal commercial offshore fishing boats. These boats were long and somewhat narrow compared to American fiberglass sportfishing production boats. They had a sharp entry at the bow that tapered back to a flat-bottomed aft section. These were extremely fuel-efficient and had a very good horsepower to load capacity ratio. These saltwater fishing Pangas were notably seaworthy, stable and easy to maintain, could safely go far offshore fishing and drew little water in the shallows. The only drawback was when overpowered they became squirrelly at speeds over 35 mph and at cruising speeds they weren&#8217;t as maneuverable as a &#8216;production&#8217; boat. Since then the Panga designs have improved strikingly and many are locally custom built center consoles specifically for sportfishing. They are a great boat for coastal saltwater fishing, are remarkably economical, roomy and unusually stable under heavy loads in rough seas when on offshore fishing trips.</P>

<p align="justify"><strong><img src="charter/5haciendaview.jpg" alt="Hacienda View" width="360" height="236" border="2" align="left">Offshore Fishing Charter-</strong> Minimum of 3 days. Panama fishing charter rates and charter fishing prices vary depending on the type of sport fishing charter (&#8216;<strong>bare boat</strong>&#8217; to &#8216;<strong>all inclusive</strong>&#8217;), the sport fishing boat used, the area fished and the number of days, but generally Panama charter fishing trip costs are from $850-$1850 a day.<br>

 A &#8216;<strong>Bare Boat Fishing Charter</strong>&#8217; Panama charter fishing trip costs and charter fishing price includes only the sport fishing boat, the Captain, Panama sport fishing guide costs and 1st class sport fishing equipment (mostly Penn, Fin Nor &amp; Shimano rods &amp; reels or custom rods) and is geared for anglers offshore fishing or deep sea fishing around the <a href="http://www.panamafishingandcatching.com/2-gulf.htm"target="_blank">Perlas Islands</a> in the Gulf of Panama for more than 2-3 days for Cubera Snapper fishing, Big Grouper fishing, Blue marlin fishing, black marlin fishing, sailfish fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, yellowfin tuna fishing, big eye tuna fishing, amberjack fishing, roosterfish fishing, Sierra Mackerel fishing, snapper fishing. Lodging (not included in the charter fishing price) is available at Hacienda Del Mar Resort on San Jose Island <a href="http://www.haciendadelmar.net" target="_blank">www.haciendadelmar.net</a> or at one of the Contadora Island hotels. Contadora is about 30 miles from Panama City and San Jose Island is about 50 miles offshore, both have very reasonable prices for airline services if you prefer to fly. Hacienda del Mar is a unique family owned resort situated on San Jose Island, a privately owned remote virgin jungle tropical island. San Jose Island has a <a href="http://www.panamafishingandcatching.com/unsung.htm"target="_blank">legendary sportfishing history</a> dating back to before Zane Grey popularized it in many of his deep sea fishing stories. I consider this area to be the best in the Gulf of Panama for all manner of saltwater fishing gamefish. <a href="http://www.panamafishingandcatching.com/unsung2.htm"target="_blank">San Jose</a> is a large island by Central American standards (15,000 acres) with rivers, waterfalls, over 50 beaches, 100 km of naturalistic all weather roads for touring, unique abundant island wildlife and a 1000 meter airstrip. <img src="charter/6haciendapool.jpg" alt="Hacienda Pool" width="275" height="182" border="2" align="right">San Jose Island has never been settled or inhabited except in WWII by a small U.S. military outpost. Hence the island, the wild life and the surrounding waters are marvelously as pristine and primordial as you are going to find anywhere in the world today. There are only 14 cabins available on the whole island as the owners are fanatical about keeping San Jose in its original natural unspoiled state. Service, accommodations, prices and amenities are excellent. The breathtaking views and the peerless ambience are unsurpassed in the western hemisphere. Re-supply of ice, fuel, beverages, water and other essentials is necessary for deep sea fishing trips after a few days and is more economical at the islands than either flying or boating it out there. I am a professional sportfishing Captain/guide and do not involve myself in earning commissions from hotel bookings or saleable items at resorts I recommend to my clients. I can however procure special discount rates and practical prices for my clients because of my frequent business relationships with many of these establishments. Although the client actually pays directly for deep sea fishing trip essentials I handle the loading of the boat, the fueling at the marina, recommend what is needed for the offshore fishing trip and the most economical places in Panama City to purchase whatever a client may want to take along on his offshore fishing trip.<br>
  An &#8216;<strong>All Inclusive Fishing Charter</strong>&#8217; Panama charter fishing rates and sport fishing charter prices are tailored for a 3 day or more deep sea fishing trip offshore for Cubera Snapper fishing, Big Grouper fishing, Blue marlin fishing, black marlin fishing, sailfish fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, yellowfin tuna fishing, big eye tuna fishing, amberjack fishing, roosterfish fishing, Sierra Mackerel fishing, snapper fishing. Basically the charter fishing price includes almost everything anglers may need - Sport Fishing Boat, Captain, mate, Panama sportfishing guide costs, 1st class saltwater fishing gear, (mostly Penn, Fin Nor &amp; Shimano rods &amp; reels or custom rods) bottled water, soft drinks, ice, bait, fuel, use of offshore fishing lures &amp; tackle etc. Charter fishing prices do not include snacks, alcoholic beverages, special food items or lodging. Things to bring along include sunscreen, hat, change of clothes, camera, bathing suit, towel, personal hygiene items, favorite deep sea fishing lures, fly fishing gear, alcoholic beverages, snacks etc. If you are interested in a saltwater fishing trip of more than 3 days then I recommend combining the &#8216;all inclusive&#8217; Panama fishing charter rates for the first 3 days with the &#8216;bare boat&#8217; Panama charter fishing rates for the remaining days of the offshore fishing trip and thereby saving on the overall charter fishing price.</P>

<p align="justify"><strong><img src="charter/7annacapri.jpg" alt="Anna Capri Sport Fishing Charter Boat" width="306" height="219" border="2" align="left">24-foot Anna Capri</strong>- &#8216;Modified vee&#8217; side console open fisherman powered by a 175 hp Intruder Evinrude outboard that cruises at 35 mph with a top speed of 45 mph. Comfortably handles 2-3 anglers deep sea fishing for large pelagic game fish - Blue marlin fishing, black marlin fishing, sailfish fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, yellowfin tuna fishing, big eye tuna fishing and popping, plug casting, trolling or fly fishing close to the offshore islands in shallower offshore fishing waters for a varied host of shelf pelagic and shelf demersal game fish species - Cubera Snapper fishing, Big Grouper fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, amberjack fishing, roosterfish fishing, Sierra Mackerel fishing, snapper fishing. This is what I refer to as my &#8216;personal boat&#8217; as I customized the design and layout specifically for deep sea fishing the Perlas Islands. The Anna Capri &#8216;modified vee&#8217; is legendary as a fast, maneuverable, bulletproof boat that draws little water but is capable of handling rough seas safely while on offshore fishing trips. I built in a walk-through windshield and sliding cabin bow deck for plug casting or fly fishing close to rough-water rocky island points or offshore fishing of Sailfish, Marlin and Dorado. The side console was moved far forward sacrificing the cabin sleeping area and converting it into a &#8216;dry hold&#8217; that packs lots of saltwater fishing gear safely away from the elements. This left a huge wide-open cockpit perfect for deep sea fishing trips involving the fighting of big fish on stand-up gear. I also made it unsinkable with a spacious outboard aft bait station and increased the fuel capacity by 50%. As form ever follows function this boat&#8217;s Spartan layout and practical profile are great assets when hooked up to the &#8216;fish of a lifetime&#8217;. A solid no-nonsense sportfishing boat appreciated by novice and veteran anglers alike.<br>

<p align="justify"><strong>24-foot Formula</strong>- Deep vee cuddy cabin powered by a Mercruiser stern drive cruises at 30 mph with a top speed of 40 mph. Readily handles 2-3 anglers on saltwater fishing trips for monster pelagic gamefish - Blue marlin fishing, black marlin fishing, sailfish fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, yellowfin tuna fishing, big eye tuna fishing and trolling near the offshore islands for diverse shelf pelagic and shelf demersal gamefish - Cubera Snapper fishing, Big Grouper fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, amberjack fishing, roosterfish fishing, Sierra Mackerel fishing, snapper fishing.<img src="charter/8formula.jpg" alt="Formula Sportfishing Boat" width="360" height="216" border="2" align="right"> Formula Thunderbird is considered the &#8216;Cadillac&#8217; of boats because they are structurally overbuilt for heavy seas and normally come equipped with an overwhelming array of luxurious creature comforts. The deep vee design carves its way cleanly and easily through rough water at cruising speed while on deep sea fishing trips and is at home in any sea. No sense in worrying about bad weather if you are hooked up to a long hard fighting gamefish on this boat. I did however customize this boat somewhat for sportsfishing so don&#8217;t expect to find any velvet cushions, full-length mirrors or bubble baths. The cuddy cabin sleeps two comfortably and securely. This is a great boat to take far offshore Panama fishing for large pelagic migratory gamefish or for close in saltwater fishing next to surface jutting volcanic rock seamounts where rough water predominates.<br>&#8216;<strong>Bare Boat Fishing Charter</strong>&#8217; Panama charter fishing rates - $850 a day.<br>&#8216;<strong>All Inclusive Fishing Charter</strong>&#8217; Panama charter fishing rates  - $950 a day.</p>

<img src="charter/9gradywhite.jpg" alt="Grady White Sportfishing Boat" width="460" height="184" border="3" align="left">
 <p align="justify"><strong>26-foot Grady White</strong>- Broad beam &#8216;deep vee&#8217; walk around cabin powered by brand new twin 200 hp Yamaha outboards, cruises at 35 mph with a top speed of 45-50 mph. Comfortably handles 2-4 anglers on deep sea fishing trips for all manner of pelagic game fish - Blue marlin fishing, black marlin fishing, sailfish fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, yellowfin tuna fishing, big eye tuna fishing and saltwater fishing such as trolling, popping, plug-casting or fly fishing for a wide array of shelf pelagic and shelf demersal game fish - Cubera Snapper fishing, Big Grouper fishing, dolphin fishing, wahoo fishing, amberjack fishing, roosterfish fishing, Sierra Mackerel fishing, snapper fishing. The innovative design of this boat lends itself exceptionally well both for offshore fishing trips and for close in island saltwater fishing trips. This is the boat I have changed the least because it really didn&#8217;t need any tweaking. Grady White makes an almost indestructible hull that planes easily in rough water. It positively glides through heavy seas and has very little tendency to list when a lot of weight is shifted from one side to another. This boat sports a large unobstructed, stable cockpit that can effectively accommodate four anglers Panama fishing. The walk around layout allows for plug casting or fly fishing to be efficiently and safely executed from the large sunk-in bow platform. The walkways are ample permitting quick mobilization from the cockpit to the bow platform when the fishing guide sights tailing Sailfish or busting bait. The cabin adequately sleeps two to three persons and there is plenty of room outside for those like me who prefer sleeping under the stars on deep sea fishing trips. This is a wonderful boat for extended offshore fishing trips in the Gulf of Panama especially around the &#8216;explosives&#8217; fishing zone beyond the continental shelf drop-off.

Here the inimitably built Super Panga really shines. The Bayano River's winding characteristics; fast current, extreme tides, shifting sandbars, submerged logs, rocks, underwater gravel banks and other obstacles require a unique craft to effectively fish it. The bulletproof hull and remarkable design of this custom made Super Panga enables safe and easy navigation to areas where other boats simply can't go. The outstanding 'four wheel drive' functionality of the boat and shallow draft capability allows angling in areas normally inaccessible to most sport fishing guides when the bite is on. The generous length and open deck blueprint permit two anglers effortless plug casting or fly fishing opportunities independently of one another, an important consideration when targeting large fast running acrobatic game fish on Panama fishing trips. The Super Panga's custom flat running design and low freeboard allows unaided landing or releasing of fish from any part of the boat. It is the perfect boat for Bayano River sportfishing charters especially for two anglers, any more and it becomes crowded and a little cozy for tarpon fly fishing or sight casting snook with the long leaders necessary to catch these unforgettable game fish.

Once on the water the Panama sport fishing guides travel along the shipping channel carved out of virgin tropical jungle and past Barro Colorado Island operated by the Smithsonian Institution to secluded Peacock Bass fishing hotspots.

Since this fishing charter rate is fashioned to suit all clients including those already in Panama, the charter fishing prices do not include transportation from the airport to Panama City or lodging while in Panama City.

The upper coast of Colon is predominantly inhabited by descendants of black runaway slaves (Cimarron), Kuna Indians, Embera-WauNaan Indians and campesino settlers - which encompasses nearly all of the original Panamanian cultures. The coast is made up mostly of Caribbean reef structures and long white sand beaches bordering true rainforest jungles and wild estuary zones. Lodging is Spartan but clean, safe and comfortable. Most lodging is usually right near a beach or expansive shallow reef structure that affords wonderful opportunities for flats fishing, surf casting, fly fishing and night reef walking with a flashlight to catch spinney lobster or daytime hunting of small octopus. The local people are friendly and warm. The local cuisine varies from spicy coastal seafood dishes unique to the &#8216;Cimarron&#8217; culture to regular table fare of meat and potatoes. This is a remote, sparsely developed area similar to what famous tourist centers like Belize and Cancun must have been like 40- 60 years ago.

  Descendants of Spanish settlers to the New World populate the Azuerro Peninsula of Panama and their culture reflects this heritage. This is a lightly populated area devoted to cattle ranges and small farms. Almost no other industry exists and these rural country folk are friendly, genuine and curious towards foreign sportfishing enthusiast. This is an area where everyone is happy to see and meet you. There is almost no crime in this homespun Spanish &#8216;cowboy&#8217; like culture. The lodging is basic but clean and comfortable. Local hotels are usually comparatively substantial concrete buildings with several large rooms having two very nice double or queen sized beds, a bath/shower, hot water and air conditioning. Local restaurant menus are limited to simple beef, pork and seafood dishes accompanied by rice and local vegetables. There are no preservatives or food coloring in the food, as it is all natural and fresh!<br>
