              concern to the ship's Dive Director, Andy.&nbsp; Andy told us that

              smaller liveaboards usually take divers to.&nbsp; They use it for
              check-out dives as it's only a little over two hours from shore
              and gives people a chance to get wet before the awesome diving on
              the outer Ribbon Reef.&nbsp; Andy encouraged us to let him know
              what we thought after tomorrow's dives and not to judge the GBR
              diving by this spot alone.&nbsp; <a href="../Images%202004/AusFishsm.jpg"><img border="2" src="../Images%202004/AusFish.jpg" alt="wpe26.jpg (75911 bytes)" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="218" height="164"></a>He

              site was one of the most popular for day boats and it's where most
