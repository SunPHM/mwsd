      <p>The Stones' second Australasian tour was even bigger than
their first. They had just returned to work after what had been their
longest break since the band's formation in 1963. Their popularity had
soared since their previous tour, and by the time they arrived Decca
had released 13 singles, six EPs and four LPs in Australia. On the
first tour, promoter Harry Miller had been extremely stingy with the
band's freight allowance and had insisted that they not bring their own
amplifiers to cut down costs. This time around the band were in a far
stronger negotiating position and they brought 72 pieces of luggage and
102 pieces of equipment.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The tour was another double bill, this time supported by <a
 target="_blank" href="http://freespace.virgin.net/the.searchers/">The
Searchers</a> -- the bill was laster described by Searcher Frank Allen
as "a combination as weird as teaming Vlad The Impaler with Mother
Theresa". Following the tour, the Searchers' original drummer Chris
Curtis decided to leave the band to start a career as a producer and
songwriter and his place was taken by John Blunt. Curtis went on to
produce records for Paul and Barry Ryan and later played a part in the
formation of Deep Purple.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The '66 Far East tour came hot on the heels of the Stones'
latest single, <span style="font-style: italic;">19th Nervous Breakdown</span>,
released on 4 February in the UK. It was another transatlantic smash,
gaining rave reviews and reaching #2 in both the UK and the USA. On 11
February the band left the UK and travelled to New York, where they
promoted the new single with an appearance on <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Ed Sullivan Show.</span> They
performed <span style="font-style: italic;">Satisfaction </span>and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">19th Nervous Breakdown</span>, followed by
a duo performance of <span style="font-style: italic;">As Tears Go By</span>
with Mick and Keith. This was also the Stones' first colour broadcast
on US television.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The tour was relatively uneventful, although Brian caused a
minor stir by using the word 'Christ' during a radio interview. The
doorman at the Wellington Dominion Theatre was quoted about damage to
the theatre there:<br>
      </p>
      <p class=clsQuote>"When The Beatles were here seats were damaged. This was worse
than The Beatles -- several seats were pierced by stiletto heels."</p>

      <p>At the Sydney press conference, two NSW university students
from <a href="../press/tharunka.htm"><i>Tharunka </i></a>magazine were 
among the reporters. Paul Sleeman
interviewed Jagger, chatted about instruments and music, showed him the
new $1 bill (Australia had officially introduced decimal currency two
days earlier) and talked about Prince Charles' stay at Timbertop school
in Victoria. "They were delightful, just delightful," recalled Andrew
Strauss, who accompanied Sleeman and took photographs. Later that day
the band performed for a Bandstand special at TCN-9 studios. It is not
known whether the recording of this performance still exists.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While in Melbourne Mick Jagger was given copies of the new
Australian music magazine <a href="../print/go-set.htm"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Go-Set</span></a>,
and he was reported to have been favourebly impressed. In Adelaide,
while relaxing around the hotel pool, the band had a memorable
encounter with a young female fan who willingly revealed some extensive
tattooing beneath her bikini bottom, including a red devil tattooed
onto her&nbsp; pubic area, which became a source of much amusement
within the band in weeks to come. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Mick was interviewed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Disc</span>
magazine on 26 February, and revealed that while in Australia the band
"got stoned a couple times" and attended a party given by "some DJ"
(possibly Ward 'Pally' Austin?) which Mick described as "a gas", and
also mentioned that the group had to stay onstage at each performance
until the police came to help them get away.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Bill Wyman's diaries, the tour grossed $59,136
for the Stones. Remarkably, the Stones' management team earned only
slightly less than their clients -- UK agent Tito Burns received $5913,
managers Allen
Klein and Andrew Loog Oldham were paid $5321 and the the Stones earned
$7063 each after expenses, although Wyman recorded that the band did
not receive the payment at the time. The delay in payment is reputed to
have been the reason why Keith Richards punched out Harry M. Miller
when he met him at a club in London later that year.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After the tour Wyman and Jones headed to Los Angeles, while
the other members holidayed briefly in Fiji. The group reconvened at
RCA Studios in Hollywood in March for three days of recording with
famed session player and arranger Jack Nitzsche. The tracks recorded
included some of their very best from this period -- <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Lady Jane, Out Of Time, Paint It, Black,
Stupid Girl </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Under My
Thumb</span>. These songs,
which represent for many the zenith of Brain Jones contributions to the
band, were released on their next LP, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Aftermath</span>.<br>

      <p>There was a remarkable postscript to the 1966 tour
almost 40 years later. During the tour Bill Wyman played a&nbsp;
semi-acoustic Vox V248 'Teardrop' bass. This distinctive instrument
appeared in several Stones concert photos and film clips from 1965 and
early 1966 -- including their <i>Top of the Pops</i> appearance on 3 
February 1966, where they performed <i>19th Nervous Breakdown</i> -- and it is
also believed to be the bass that Bill played on <i>Satisfaction</i>.</p>

      <p>Vox had a close relationship with both the Stones and The
Beatles and both groups used Vox amplifiers extensively on tour and in
the studio. The Stones were also noted for their frequent use of the
distinctive Vox guitars and basses and Brian Jones was often
photographed playing his famous trapezoid-shaped white Vox Phantom
guitar. The V248 bass was the new semi-acoustic version of Vox's famous
Mark IV
(V224) solid-body teardrop bass. It was marketed as "The Wyman Bass"
because Bill had agreed to endorse the new line, and the Wyman Bass was
only Vox guitar to be inscribed
with an endorser's name. On 5 February, just before
the Far East tour, Jennings Musical Instruments (makers of Vox guitars
and amps) gave Wyman a new Thomas organ as an advance payment for his
endorsement.</p>

 style="width: 220px; height: 200px;" alt="Bill Wyman bass"
 src="images/bass.jpg">Unfortunately, Bill's Teardrop bass was stolen 
 after their Wellington shows on 28 February. It remained in New Zealand 
 and reportedly passed through a succession of 'owners' before being given 
 to New Zealand musician Nick Sceats in the 1980s, in lieu of payment for 
 a recording session. Sceats kept it for about fifteen years, but he was 
 recently alerted to the possible Wyman connection. As a result, he contacted 
 Bill through an internet fan site, and Wyman confirmed that it was indeed 
 his long-lost Teardrop bass, and it was returned it to him shortly before
Easter 2004.</p>
