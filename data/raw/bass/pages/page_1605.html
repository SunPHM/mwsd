<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I've had a
lot of fun with the guitar over the years. This page chronicles a
few of the many memorable musical experiences the guitar has
brought me. It actually all started at age 13 when I took up
5-string banjo lessons and discovered that I had a knack for
&quot;pickin' them strings.&quot; After we moved back to
Pittsburgh, one of my banjo teachers turned me on to guitar since
there wasn't a whole lot more he could teach me on banjo.
Throughout high school and college I dabbled in both banjo and
guitar, but my musical &quot;career&quot; really took off during
graduate school with the formation of the acoustic music /
bluegrass group &quot;The Acoustic Effect&quot; (click on thumbnails for larger
images):</font></p>

Dana brought the beautiful sounds of the Cello to the group. <br>
At times this necessitated that we play while seated, which of
course made our music <br>
seem very serious!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Eventually
-- as folks graduated and moved on -- the &quot;Acoustic
Effect&quot; began to wind down. Around this time I became
fascinated with nylon-string classical or &quot;fingerstyle&quot;
guitar -- particularly with the compositions of guitar guru David
Qualey (see links info at bottom of page for more information
about David Qualey). I eventually got good enough to start
playing for people in appropriate venues: house guitarist at
UConn's &quot;Mirror Lake Cafe&quot;, several wedding ceremonies
(BarbraJeane and Jim, Rose and Sean, Patty and Chris), guest
musician at the Schenectady Unitarian Church, and various
performances at member concerts given by the Capital District
Classical Guitar Society.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">After
moving to the Albany area, I got involved with another acoustic
music / bluegrass group. After going through a variety of
forgettable names, we eventually settled on
&quot;Heartwood.&quot; We typically just got together one night a
week for some fun jamming, but also had a number of opportunities
to play for people: Candlelight Coffee House at the Utica
Unitarian Church, Schenectady Carrot Festival, CRD Family Picnic,
and several other low-key venues. We also recorded a cassette
tape titled &quot;Prehistory&quot;, which is now incredibly
difficult to find (all 10 copies have already been given away).

now that I'm a grown-up I don't get much chance to play guitar,

stuff, along with a bit of Leo Kottke and some Hawaiian Slack-Key
fingerstyle guitar. Here are a few links to some relevant pages:</font></p>

face="Comic Sans MS">Allan Alexander is a phenomenal classical
guitarist / lutenist. He performs every Friday night at the
Allegro Cafe in Troy, NY (call ahead to make sure he is playing).
He seems to be able to play just about anything, and he has also
composed quite a few beautiful pieces of his own. Allan also
creates arrangements: his solo guitar arrangement of
&quot;Pachelbel's Canon&quot; is awe-inspiring, to say the least.
He has at least two recordings available (my favorite is titled
simply &quot;Guitar and Lute&quot;) and has published many of his
