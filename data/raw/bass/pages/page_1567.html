<p>Hey Y'all!
<br /><br />
A quick reminder ... as we wrap up October, we have been nominated for a
CEA award (Cincinnati Entertainment Award) for Best Country Band by City
Beat Magazine. The winners are decided by YOUR VOTES, so please take
just a second and vote at www.citybeat.com/cea . The deadline to get your vote
in is Wednesday, October 27. The awards ceremony is Monday, November 22
at Old St. George Church in Clifton, OH. We really appreciate this
year's nomination. Muchas Gracias! Also, don't forget, we wrap up the
month with the band raisin' hell at the Knotty Pine on the 27th & 29th
and then heading up to Clearlake, Iowa for a big show with Montgomery
Gentry at the Surf Ballroom on Saturday the 30th. Git amongst it!
<br /><br />
Now, on to November ... we'll be jammin' non-stop all month long with
lots of acoustic shows and some really cool stuff featuring the whole
band. We get things started on November 1 kicking off my Monday night
acoustic series at Mingle's in Milford, OH from 9-1. I'll be firin' up
there every Monday in November with the exception of the 22nd to attend
this year's CEA awards. My new home on Tuesday nights is at Rythms in
Lockland, OH from 8-12. They've got good eats, cold beer and an
extensive selection of premiere whiskeys, so we've been gettin' along
real good. Stop in on a Tuesday and check it out.
<br /><br />
We have lots of cool stuff with the band this month, kicking things off
at The Best Damn Bar in Town (fka Miamitown Lounge) in Miamitown, OH on
Friday the 5th from 10-2. Then me and the Snatch Wranglers are packin'
up and headin' out to do some honky-tonk hell-raisin' at Who Care's Bar
& Grill in Brookville, IN on Saturday the 6th. We hope to see y'all out
at two of our favorite honky-tonks.
<br /><br />
We'll be hittin' the road for a few dates with Outlaw Country Legend
David Allan Coe!! We kick things off at 8 Seconds Saloon in
Indianapolis, IN on Wednesday the 17th, then return to Coyote's in
Louisville, KY on Thursday the 18th and wind up in our own backyard at
Annie's in Cincinnati, OH on Friday the 19th. All shows start at 8:00
and tickets are available at each club. Don't miss the chance to catch
us and DAC back in concert together for the last time in 2004. In other
DAC related news, Jon E. Finn, who is DAC's guitarist and a great friend
of mine has released his new solo album "Scars From a Worn Out Atlas"
which includes his version of a song I wrote "Lyin' Next to You." Be
sure and pick up a copy of Jon's CD and support our brother. We can't
wait to get back with DAC and all our friends and lay an ass-whoopin' on
Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. OH HELL YEAH!!
<br /><br />
As if the shows with DAC ain't enough for one week, we roll back into
the Bada Bing in Mason, OH (fka Merida's) on Saturday the 20th. Fresh
off three shows with DAC, we'll have the whole band all fired up and
kickin' ass all night long.
<br /><br />
We wind up November with one of the biggest parties of the year -- the
Knotty Pine Thanksgiving Eve Wild Turkey Day Bash on Wednesday the 24th.
This party gets bigger and badder and more off the hook each year, so
come on out and tear it up with us so you can be good and hung over when
you visit your kin folk on Thanksgiving Day. We'll finish the weekend at
the Pine on the 26th and 27th, just to make sure we got y'all good.
<br /><br />
As for acoustic shows this month, in addition to Mondays at Mingles and
Tuesdays at Rythms, I'll be returning to The Pike (fka The Yard) in
Woodlawn, OH on Thursday the 4th, for an early show from 7-10. I'll be
at the Kiatta Saloon in Okeana, OH from 8-12 on Thursday the 11th and
Rodeo's in Bright, IN from 8-12 on the 21st.
<br /><br />
Check our web site at www.dallasmoore.com  for all tour dates and show
times. Believe it or not, more shows are actually in the works to
squeeze in for November. I think we're gonna have to start havin' 8 days
in a week if we're ever gonna git any loafin' time! Til next time, y'all
raise hell and slang gravel!

See ya down the road,<br />
