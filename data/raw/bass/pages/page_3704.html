        <p> <b>BLACK SEA BASS</b> (<i>Stereolepis gigas</i>) 
        <p><img src="images/blackbass.jpg" width="200" height="113">
        <p>This giant fish grows to 7 1/2 feet and up to 560 pounds and lives 
          to 70 years of age. Found near rocky caves, ledges and near kelp beds 
          at depths from 20 to 150 feet, they are truly awe-inspiring when seen 
          underwater. Now off-limits for fisherman and divers, these fish once 
          close to extinction are making a comeback. Black Sea Bass change sex 
          from female to male as they mature into adults. They are curious and 
          intelligent animals that range from Humboldt Bay to the Gulf of California. 
          Black Sea Bass are usually found at the Aquarium in tank number 21.

<b>BLUEBANDED GOBY</b> (<i>Lythrypnus dalli</i>)

<p>

<img SRC="images/bluegoby.jpg" WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="200" ALT="(Picture of a bluebanded goby)">

        <p> With a bright orange-red body and three to nine electric blue vertical 
          stripes, the bluebanded goby seems to glow with the fluorescence of 
          a neon light. <i>Lythrypnus dalli</i> belongs to the family Gobiidae, 
          a group of small fish with an estimated 2,000 species occurring worldwide 
          in both fresh and saltwater environments. Recognized by an elongated 
          robust body and two dorsal fins, males have longer dorsal spines and 
          a suction-like disc that is formed by the connection of its pelvic fins. 
          Bluebanded gobies can often be seen hanging upside down in caves at 
          depths of 20 to several hundred feet. Their range is from Morro Bay 
          to the Gulf of California, and their abundance on Santa Catalina Island 
          is the reason they are also referred to as the "Catalina Goby". This 
          attractive crevice dweller rarely ventures far from its rocky habitat, 
          darting in and out of holes only to capture small planktonic food, attract 
          a mate or vigorously defend its nest using its brilliant colors to remind 
          intruders of its strong defensive instincts. Having these characteristics 
          makes the bluebanded goby a perfect candidate for Cabrillo Marine Aquarium's 
          territorial fish display tank. Bluebanded Gobies are usually found at 
          the Aquarium in tank number 16.

<a NAME="halibut"></a>

        <p> <b>CALIFORNIA HALIBUT</b> (<i>Paralichthys californicus</i>) What 
          appears to be a flying carpet with fins and a white underside rippling 
          about the reef, then gliding to the bottom to disappear in the sand 
          is likely a halibut. It is characterized by having both eyes located 
          close together on the upper side of the animal's body, a strangely twisted 
          mouth and a dorsal fin that grows forward on the fish. Their main defense 
          mechanisms against predators are their ability to change colors to match 
          the color of the ocean bottom and to quickly bury itself in the bottom 
          sand. Being carnivorous, halibut feed on smaller fishes and crustaceans. 
          Found from the British Columbia to the upper Gulf of Mexico in depths 
          to 300 feet, some grow to lengths of 5 feet and weigh up to 80 pounds. 
          They are a highly prized eating fish. Halibut are usually found at the 
          Aquarium in tank number 22.

<b>GARIBALDI</b> (<i>Hypsypops rubicundus</i>)


<p>

<img SRC="images/garibald.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="147" ALT="(Picture of a garibaldi)">

        <p> The Garibaldi, a damselfish, is one of the most colorful fish in Southern 
          California waters. A spectacular bright orange, it is easily visible 
          as it "sculls" in and around the holes and crevices of the kelp forest 
          floor where it is usually found. It is in an almost constant state of 
          activity as it defends its territory against potential "land grabbers" 
          or as it searches for the small, sessile sponges and bryozoans that 
          make up a good portion of its diet. During the springtime the activity 
          level climbs even higher as the male begins the all-important task of 
          nest building. Carefully he clears everything but the most stubborn 
          calcareous material and a small, elliptical patch of red algae. Once 
          the nest is completed, the amorous male begins searching for one or 
          more females. Rushing about his territory, he charges and challenges 
          any of his kind. Challenges consist of loud, thumping noises made by 
          the grinding together of teeth far back in his throat called pharyngeal 
          teeth. Eventually a female will dart past him as he charges her and 
          will hover above the nest. In an increasingly high state of excitement, 
          he will join her to fertilize the 15,000 - 80,000 eggs she lays. Her 
          job done, he drives her off to guard the nest during the two to three 
          week period it takes the yellowish, capsule-like eggs to develop.

<img SRC="images/gari-juv.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="147" ALT="(Picture of a juvenile garibaldi)">

        <p> Young garibaldi have very distinct, iridescent blue markings over 
          the head and body which gradually fade and disappear when the fish reaches 
          maturity at about six inches. Garibaldi grow to about 14 inches in length 
          and live to be about 15 years of age. Garibaldi are usually found at 
          the Aquarium in tank numbers 16, 21, 33 and at the touch tank.

<a NAME="kelp"></a>

        <p> <b>KELP BASS</b> (<i>Paralabrax clathratus</i>) Easily recognized 
          by the calico white spotting on the back and sides, kelp bass prefer 
          kelp beds and seaweed flats in near-shore rocky areas from Washington 
          to Baja California. Larger kelp bass are found to depths of 150 feet. 
          Growing to lengths of about 28 1/2 inches, they are good eating and 
          considered an important sport fish. Kelp Bass are usually found at the 
          Aquarium in tank numbers 21, 33 and at the touch tank.

<b>LEOPARD SHARK</b> (<i>Triakis semifasciata</i>)


        <p> <img SRC="images/leopardshark.jpg" WIDTH="294" HEIGHT="150" ALT="(Picture of a leopard shark)"> 
        <p> These active, fast-moving, nomadic sharks with a leopard-like pattern 
          roam inshore sand flats and rocky areas in schools. Feeding on fishes, 
          crustaceans and innkeeper worms, they move in a snakelike fashion. Growing 
          up to 6.5 feet, they do not appear to be aggressive sharks and are not 
          considered dangerous. They give live birth and the females often stay 
          in warmer bays while the young are still developing. Often sought by 
          commercial fisherman as food fishes, they range from Oregon to the Gulf 
          of California. Leopard Sharks are usually found at the Aquarium in tank 
          numbers 21, 35 and at the touch tank.

<a NAME="moray"></a>

        <p> <b>MORAY EEL</b> (<i>Gymnothorax mordax</i>) 
        <p><img src="images/moray.jpg" width="200" height="152">
        <p>Down between the rocks in shallow waters from Point Conception south 
          to Baja California resides the California Moray Eel. The moray can reach 
          lengths of five feet. It is usually very timid and will withdraw into 
          a crevice when approached. It is commonly seen with red rock shrimp 
          with which it shares a symbiotic relationship. Uniquely adapted to its 
          environment, the moray has a long slender body. The mouth opens to pull 
          in more water. Its skin is tough and leathery and is coated with a mucous 
          film, providing protection from the jagged edges of rocky reefs. The 
          eel's sleek body lacks scales, gill covers, and almost all fins, presenting 
          a smooth surface to back into tight hiding spots. The moray eel is an 
          effective predator. Its sense of smell is well developed. Interestingly, 
          the moray eel's favorite prey, the octopus, has developed a chemical 
          in its jet-black ink that temporarily disables a moray's sense of smell. 
          The unfortunate octopus that is not quick enough to escape rarely gets 
          a second chance. The dagger-like teeth of the eel angle backwards, the 
          better to grab and retain its prey. The teeth are also hinged and lock 
          into position when pushed forward, enabling the eel to firmly grasp 
          even the most slimy fish. Local moray eels are not dangerous to divers 
          if left alone. Moray Eels are usually found at the Aquarium in tank 
          numbers 18 and 33.

        <p> <b>OCEAN WHITEFISH</b> (<i>Caulolatilus princeps</i>) Found usually 
          in fairly deep rocky offshore banks off the Channel Islands in southern 
          California, the ocean whitefish grows to lengths of 3 feet. They are 
          characterized by a small mouth and long blue-and-yellow-striped dorsal 
          and anal fins, and yellow-tinged pectoral and caudal fins. The ocean 
          whitefish is a popular fish for sport fishermen. Ocean Whitefish are 
          usually found at the Aquarium in tank number 21.

<a NAME="opaleye"></a>

        <p> <b>OPALEYE</b> (<i>Girella nigricans</i>) Commonly found in kelp beds, 
          rocky reefs and piers to depths of 65 feet, these territorial fish are 
          olive green with 1 to 3 white or yellow spots located below the dorsal 
          fin, have a beautiful opal blue eye and grow up to a length of two feet. 
          Their color can change when feeding or as part of aggression. Opaleye 
          feed on algae and animals found on rocks. In the spring they gather 
          in dense schools in shallow water to spawn. The eggs and larvae are 
          free-floating. Known predators include sea lions and sport fishermen. 
          Opaleye are usually found at the Aquarium in tank numbers 21, 33 and 
          at the touch tank.

<a NAME="pile"></a>

        <p> <b>PILE SURFPERCH</b> (<i>Damalichthys vacca</i>) Characterized by 
          a dark bar on its silvery gray sides and a spot below the eye, pile 
          surfperch grow to a length of up to 17 inches. They are found in schools 
          around reefs, kelp beds and piers from Alaska to Baja California. They 
          are frequently seen around pilings and hence the reason for their name. 
          Pile surfperch are often observed feeding on small mussels, barnacles, 
          clams, limpets and crabs. Young pile surfperch have also been seen picking 
          parasites from other fish. Pile Surfperch are usually found at the Aquarium

<a NAME="rainbow"></a>

        <p> <b>RAINBOW SURFPERCH</b> (<i>Hypsurus caryi</i>) The rainbow surfperch 
          is distinguished by the rusty-orange bars flowing down its back, the 
          iridescent blue and orange horizontal stripes running from head to tail 
          and the black spot behind the upper jaw. Mostly a solitary fish, it 
          is found swimming over rocky bottoms in tidepools to as deep as 130 
          feet between northern California to northern Baja California. They only 
          seem to gather in clusters in the fall during breeding and grow to 12 
          inches in length. Rainbow Surfperch are usually found at the Aquarium 
          in tank numbers 21 and 27.

<a NAME="rockpool"></a>

        <p> <b>ROCKPOOL BLENNY</b> (<i>Hypsoblennius gilberti</i>) Growing to 
          almost seven inches, the rockpool blenny has a distinct notch in its 
          head just behind the eye and as a result is sometimes referred to as 
          the "notchbrow blenny". Although a frequent visitor in the intertidal 
          and subtidal areas, it is found in depths to 60 feet from Point Conception 
          to southern Baja California. The male guards the egg cluster until they 
          hatch. Their main defense from predators is their ability to change 
          color and finding shelter in holes or a crevice in rocks. Rockpool Blennies 
          are usually found at the Aquarium in tank numbers 10 and 19.

        <p>Salema are often seen in large schools milling over and among rocks, 
          in the kelp, around docks and piers from Monterey Bay to Peru. Growing 
          up to 10 inches in length, they have six to eight orange-brown stripes 
          running down their blue-green body. Their upturned mouth is ideally 
          suited for plankton feeding. Juveniles are usually found in late summer 
          and usually feed on amphipod crustaceans. Salema are usually found at 
          the Aquarium in tank number 24.

        <p>Found in kelp beds and rocky reef areas, sheephead grow up to 3 feet 
          in length and can live up to 50 years of age. A member of the wrasse 
          family, sheephead change sex from female to male during maturation (at 
          about 1 foot in length or 8 years of age). Males are identified by their 
          black tail and head while females are all red. Males are very territorial 
          and are often observed chasing away any smaller males. Large males often 
          have 10 to 15 females within their territory. Sheephead feed on sea 
          urchins, mollusks, lobsters and crabs using their prominent canine teeth 
          to pry and crush. Their pharyngial teeth continue crushing as they swallow. 
          Considered very good eating, their numbers have declined drastically 
          off southern California. Sheephead are usually found at the Aquarium

<b>SHOVELNOSE GUITARFISH</b>  (<i>Rhinobatus productus</i>)

Shovelnose guitarfish are found on sandy bottoms in bays, near seagrass beds, and near rocky reefs from Central California to the Sea of Cortez.  Sometimes only its eyes are visible above the sand.  During the day it buries itself in the sand and hunts for its food at night.  It likes to eat worms, clams, crabs, and some fishes.

It is characterized by having a flat body with a skeleton made of cartilage and an elongated nose.  Breathing is accomplished by pulling water in through its spiracles located on its back.

          caves and crevices along the coast and offshore channel islands from 
          Monterey Bay to Mexico. When sedentary, this shark has muscles by its 
          gill to pull in water. Harmless and sluggish, the swell shark can inflate 
          its stomach with water when disturbed. Being nocturnal, it emerges at 
          night with its catlike eyes to forage for fishes and crustaceans. However, 
          it also often feeds by simply opening its mouth wide and letting fish 
          swim in. The female lays a purse-shaped egg case which hatches in about 
          ten months. Swell Sharks are usually found at the Aquarium in tank number

          rays, related to sharks, live on soft sand or soft mud bottoms from 
          Central California to Baja California. Thornback rays have flat, rounded 
          bodies with a skeleton made of cartilage, three rows of "thorns" on 
          its back, and gill slits on the bottom of their head. They eat worms, 
          mollusks, crabs and shrimp. Thornback rays bear live young hatched from 
          eggs that are held inside the mother's body. Thornback Rays are usually

          kelp beds, and piers from Vancouver Island to the Gulf of California. 
          The top smelt is not a true smelt, it is a member of the silverside 
          family which includes grunion. They grow up to 14 1/2 inches. They are 
          often seen jumping from the water as they attempt to escape from larger 
          fishes such as jacks or mackerel. Spawning occurs in the spring and 
          summer in shallow water. Eggs are adhered to red algae by the female 
          where they are then fertilized by the males. They are fished commercially, 
          especially around San Francisco. Top Smelt is usually found at the Aquarium 
          in tank numbers 21 and 27.

        <p> <b>WHITE SEA BASS</b> (<i>Cynoscion nobilis</i>) As one of the larger 
          croakers, the white sea bass (not a true bass) will grow to 5 feet in 
          length and weigh up to 20 pounds. They are commonly found in schools 
          over rocky bottoms and in or around the kelp from Alaska to southern 
          Baja California. They are characterized by a gray blue to-silver body. 
          Feeding occurs midway in the water column on red pelagic crabs, squid, 
          anchovies, sardines and other small fish. A prized sport fish, populations 
          of white sea bass have been dramatically reduced since the 1950's. Recently, 
          hatcheries raising white sea bass have been started up in Southern California 
          in the hope of increasing local populations. Some of the white sea bass 
          in Cabrillo Marine Aquarium tanks are from these hatcheries. White Sea 
          Bass are usually found at the Aquarium in tank number 21 and at the 
          touch tank.

        <p> <b>WOLF EEL</b> (<i>Anarrhichthys ocellatus</i>) Growing over 6 feet 
          long, wolf eels are usually found in crevices and holes of rocky reefs 
          and wrecks from the Aleutian Islands to southern California. Their powerful 
          canine teeth and stout molars allow them to feed on fishes and hard-shelled 
          organisms such as mollusks, crabs, and sea urchins. Wolf Eels are usually 
          found at the Aquarium in tank numbers 21 and 33.
