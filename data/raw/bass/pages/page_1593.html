   Basses have been getting the epoxy treatment 
here for about 25 years, originally inspired by ideas expressed in a '77 BP 
interview with the late great Jaco Pastorius*. Fretboards are defretted, inlaid 
and carefully prepared. The most professionally trusted, highest grade 
<STRONG>epoxy</STRONG>  is applied using techniques developed 
over years of R&amp;D. This is not a poured on nor sprayed finish! Multiple
layers are each sanded and polished to a mirror gloss. The result is a clear, extremely 
hard, smooth and uniform fretboard surface that will last a lifetime. Edges will 
not delaminate. Low action is possible. The resulting tone is articulate and harmonically rich
with good sustain. This is the  best way to preserve your fretless for a long time 
and allow the use of any string type without fear of damage to the fretboard. </FONT></P>

<P align=left><FONT size=3><A href="padilla.html"><FONT size=3><STRONG>Xavier Padilla Delgado:</STRONG></FONT></A> "The effect epoxy produces in the sound, for a first timer 
 like me, is amazing: everything is brighter and all details 
come out clearer. As an instrument, I feel like the bass becomes more 
sensitive. Vibrato, which is essential in fretless playing, becomes more responsive, as if 
the rotating movement of the finger upon the string was now better 
"heard" by the neck. I would say that with epoxy coats on the fingerboard 
a fretless electric bass still gets a woody sound, but with a new element 
that brings it closer to that of a grand piano." (Mr.&nbsp;Padilla Delgado&nbsp;is currently touring, writing and 
recording with the Gipsy Kings.)</FONT></P>

    <LI>
    <DIV align=left>   To determine if your fretted&nbsp;neck 
    is a good candidate for a fretless conversion, flex the neck when 
    the strings are off. If you can flex it visibly to the naked eye with 
    little effort, it&nbsp;may not be strong enough to provide stability as a fretless with 
    close action. An unstrung neck with no truss rod tension should be fairly 
    straight. I can level out necks to certain degree.  </DIV>
    <LI>
    <DIV align=left>Maple and rosewood fretboards make the 
    best conversions. Harder woods such as ebony, pau ferro and wenge, as well 
    as older and poorly refretted necks,&nbsp;tend to chip out when frets are 
    removed. They will however be good looking after fillers are applied, but 
    additional labor charges may apply. Synthetic fretboards may have problems 
    that will be dealt with on a individual basis.</DIV>
    <LI>
    <DIV align=left>  A word about <STRONG>Nuts</STRONG>: In 
    order to surface the epoxy properly, the nut must be removed. Often it will 
    not come out without breaking, and is difficult on already fretless basses 
    because the&nbsp;nut material&nbsp;under the grooves is so thin 
    (esp.Fenders). Years of aging glue, use of the wrong glue,&nbsp;sweat and 
    finish refuse to allow it to release despite my gentle coaxing :-). I 
    install new <STRONG>bone or plastic</STRONG> nuts and custom shape them to 
    replace and improve upon the old one. This service is 
    around $45 for 4-strings, $55 for 5 strings, and $65+ for 6 
    or more strings. <STRONG>Graph Tech,&nbsp;Tusq, Delrin&nbsp;and

<P>"This neck is playing wonderfully! Your sanding work not only saved this 
neck, but brought it to perfection = There are no uneven spots and the radius 
seems very consistent throughout. I'll stress that the neck is playing great, 
and much better than before. I setup the trussrod almost straight and it gives a 
very good low action. I should say first that I've never played before a 
fretless bass with an epoxied fingerboard. The effect epoxy produces in the 
sound, for a first timer like me, is amazing: everything is brighter and all 
details come out clearer. As an instrument, I feel like the bass becomes more 
sensitive. Vibrato, which is essential in fretless playing, becomes more 
responsive, as if the rotating movement of the finger upon the string was now 
better "heard" by the neck.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now realise that in 22 years 
or so of bass playing I've never come across a neck so well prepared for playing 
as this. I've been playing it now for about four hours since yesterday, and it's 
like I've never played a fretless before and didn't know what a pleasure it can 
be. Only for this you have dramatically influenced my life. I would really like 
that great fretless players (like Pino Palladino), you know, really famous ones 
(not like me) become your customers as well. "<BR><STRONG>Xavier

<P align=left> "Harris, The epoxy fretless conversion you have done for me is beyond any 
  expectation I had. Thank you for giving me back a truly <U>great</U> 
  instrument. I'm just now able to put her down long enough to write you, a day 
  and a half after getting her back!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Your workmanship is the definition of impeccable. In one of our previous 
  communications you said the fretline inlays were "totally factory". I'm sorry 
  to disagree Harris, they are better than factory. You removed the frets 
  perfectly and not a gap or miscut can be seen in the beautiful Maple inlay. 
  The bone nut you made rivals those I've seen on the finest Jazz boxes. The 
  kicker of it all though is the HGT epoxy coating. The application of the 
  coating to the fingerboard, as well as the blend to the lacquer on the neck, 
  is flawless.<br>
  I have owned a neck-through, ebony fingerboard fretless instrument for 
  years. It's a fine instrument with fantastic tone but I am here to testify 
  that there is more "wood", more sweetness and more make you wanna holler growl 
  in my bolt-on HGT epoxy fretless conversion than old "Bessie" ever had. The 
  epoxy provides a surface that allows all manner of articulation to speak 
  clearly. The tone is even in all positions and the epoxy surface produces 
  ringing sustain compared to a bare wood fingerboard. Plucking at the neck with 
  the neck pickup favored gives a killer upright bass vibe while plucking down 
  at the bridge with the bridge pickup favored gives......well uh, you know - 
  and let me say I think <B><U>he</B></U> would have seriously dug it. With the 
  epoxy I am even able to get a convincing "Yes, I have frets!" tone, something 
  I've never been able to do with the bare wood bass. You have 
  produced a process that I feel provides the ultimate fretless performance. The 
  epoxy coating is not only beautiful to look at, it is a complete, utter joy to 
  play upon as well.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't found the words to thank you properly. 
  Please know my deep appreciation for your artistic skill and that I will 
  treasure this instrument the rest of my days."&nbsp; Best Regards,<br> <STRONG>Don 
  Wiggins</STRONG> , Scottsdale, Arizona: Fender Jazz Bass circa '77, full

<P align=left>"Hey Harris, I finally got the neck on the body today, and it 
sounds amazing. It plays beautifully and sounds even better. I can't 
wait to get it into the studio. This bass finally sounds like a fretless 
does in my head, and the way a fretless should,&nbsp;plenty of added tone and 
dimension came through after the epoxy. I can't thank you enough, and I 
promise as soon as I can I'll send you pictures and recordings. All my best 
and thanks," <br><STRONG>Jackson Eppley</STRONG>, Alabama, bassist for Lava/Atlantic recording

<p align=left>"Well, congratulations, Mr. Harris.  You succeeded in keeping me up all night playing 
my new fretless, so now I'm struggling to stay awake at work this morning.  Even after waking up late 
this morning, I managed to play the thing a little while longer, making me extra late.  I just 
couldn't put the thing down.  I was able to get the action lower than was ever possible before, 
and still not get a pinched tone.  It's amazing how much more responsive the fingerboard feels.  
It also looks great!  I like the uniformed blackness of the ebony.  I can't wait to show it off 
at my church this weekend.  I was afraid that I'd have to take some extra time to get reacquainted 
with playing fretless after not touching one for a few weeks, but all the playing time I'm getting 
with it is sure to fix that.  I'll be sure and send everyone I know your way!  
Thanks again!"<br>

<P align=left> "I just wanted to say a big "THANK YOU!!".  I'd have written earlier 
but I've been spending a great deal of my spare time with my HG Thor-transformed 
fretless.  What a beautiful voice it has now!  I was blown away when I got it 
back by the appearance of the epoxy and the subtle fretlines but the tone absolutely 
took my breath away.  As good as it sounded with my Carvin nickel roundwounds on it, 
I took your suggestion and put some Roto (RS665LC) stainless steel rounds on it, which 
gave me even more of that elusive mwah that I've only heard players like Jaco, Mark Egan, 
and Pino Palladino achieve.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I'd have a bass 
that sounded like that and, now that I've experienced it first hand, I just can't stop playing!  
Pre-Thor conversion, I used to play 30-45 minutes every other day.  Since getting my fretless 
back from you, I've averaged at least 2 hours/day -- and I want more!!!<br>
 
This wonderful conversion is worth far more to me than the price I paid for your 
excellent craftsmanship.  It's transformed my playing and given me a whole new 
appreciation for subtlety and expression in my technique, as I can now hear the 
articulation so much better.  I had mentioned to you that, by necessity, this 
fretless would be a working bass.  Now I'm torn between wanting to show off this 
work of art and wanting to keep it out of smokey bars!  Of course, I'll *have* to 
gig with it - something that looks and sounds so incredible just can't be hidden away!<br>
 
Sorry for all of the gushing but I had to let you know how truly satisfied I am.  
Without a doubt, this was the best equipment investment I've made in my 33 years 
of playing bass.  Now I have only to enjoy it and live up to the potential of this 
fine instrument which, oh darn, means I'll have to practice even more!<br>

my fingers slide into the right spot much easier than the neck with factory 
finish. It seemed with that original finish, there was a great deal more

summer... The bass the neck is attached to is a 1998 Fender American Deluxe Jazz 
Bass. It has the active electronics, lighter tuners and 22-fret 
neck. The epoxy neck is simply smooth and fast. After a few days on 
it and dialing in the setup, the fretted felt painfully cumbersome to play 
again... the hardness of the epoxy coupled with some stiff roundwounds 
(currently DR Lo-Riders, 45-105s, I'd use a lighter gauge but that's the only 
gauge the stores in the city stock) gives the bass a killer midrange growl that 
really cuts through any band. The sound has been improved immensely. The 
neck is beautifully done and I get many compliments on its looks and sound, and 
if anyone I know were looking to get a neck done, I'd send them to you!"<BR>

<FONT FACE="Symbol"><P ALIGN="left"><FONT face="Times New Roman">If you have actually read all this so far and find yourself 
at the bottom of this ridiculously long page, I have a treat for you. In 1982, 
I had the great pleasure to meet Jaco Pastorius and his Word Of Mouth 
band members at a practise space in Manhattan. I was there making a recording with 
my NYC friends. After about an hour of recording I took a cigarette break&nbsp;in the 
outer hall. There across from me was&nbsp;the&nbsp;seated and sunlit orange haired head of Jaco 
himself and his&nbsp;mates standing around him. Nervously I approached him and said: "Hi. 
You're Jaco right?" (duh...) He says: "Yah man" with great big 
smile only Jaco could muster,&nbsp;and he introduced me to his band members. He&nbsp;said 
they were bone-ing up for the Blue Note gig that night. I nodded in 
approval with an awestruck smile only I could muster.&nbsp;Then he said in a very earnest and 
interested way, eyes beaming at me: "So what do you play?" After recovering from the momentary 
shock of having one of the greatest musicians on the planet ask me that, 
I said that I play guitar,&nbsp;with a humble "its nothing" inflection. Quickly changing the 
subject,&nbsp;I told him that I "really dug" his work with Weather Report and Joni. 
He simply smiled and nodded. There was one of those short awkward moments of 
silence when you are standing face to face with a legend that seems like and 
eternity, and I took that opportunity to say "Great meeting you" to which he 
responded quite careingly "Yah, you too man". That's when my legs turned me around 
and I split in a gesture of giving the guy some space. That recording of ours 
turned out&nbsp;fairly well inspired and when we were done he was gone. I 
consider myself fortunate to have had this honest and pleasant encounter, especially in 
the light of some of the stories that have painted him a negative light. 
I&nbsp;know in my heart I met the real and&nbsp;gracious Jaco, and any other 
behavior he may have allegedly displayed publicly or otherwise may have simply been 
the result of a common and ironically now easily treatable condition. His body 
of work is a testament to his genius and hard work, and I am honored to offer 
this service which helps keep alive his unique and groundbreaking methodology on 
the bass. Enjoy! -HG THOR</FONT></P><FONT face="Times New Roman">
