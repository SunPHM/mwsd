<p>An enigmatic
instrument, the enourmous string bass always has a sort of mystery about it.
The largest instrument of the violin family, the string bass has four strings and is taller and wider than
most adult men. The dark, breathy sound of the instrument when bowed may conveys images 
straight from horror films, while a jazz lick plucked on a bass is irresistably cool.
 Besides the sound it makes, the string bass is different from most other instruments because of the
 sheer strength it requires to play it. For one, repeatedly pressing down on thick 
bass strings hard enough to touch the fingerboard stiffens the arms and quickly callouses the left hand fingers.
However, these callouses are practically nothing compared to the rock hard skin made by plucking as hard as possible
 on steel bass strings. Of all the violin instruments, none is so physically strenuous to bow as the bass, and 
there is something to be said about lugging the giant around everyday. &#147How do you carry that thing?&#148 is a question that
 people often confront me with. That&#146s no secret: basses look much heavier than they actually are, and by balancing it over a shoulder, using the 
handles on the carrying case, or by using a specially designed wheel that fits on to that &#147stick-thingy&#148 on the bottom called an endpin. Bass players 
either sit on a tall stool to play, or stand, the former preferred over the latter in hours-long concerts. None of this, however, explains the great mystery of the violin family:
&#147How do they know where to put their fingers?&#148<p>

The answer is in the practice done long before the concert. You see, if you 
look on a younger string player&#146s instrument, you&#146ll notice that there 
are tapes running up and down their fingerboard. With enough practice, the player knows where these tapes are without looking, and soon they start to wear off, or
the player takes them off himself. Personally, I prefer to have a few tapes on my bass that mark the basic &#147home positions&#148 of the instrument. 
The rest of the notes I simply have a good idea of where they are in the first place, and my fingers push approximately in those spots because they&#146re used to it.
One of the most interesting things you&#146ll see a string player do is use vibrato. This is when they shake their hand on the instrument to give a more human &#147wah wah&#148 sound to their 
playing. For the bass, vibrato comes mainly from the elbow, and is a slow, wide movement. One way to get the feel of it is to raise the left hand slightly above your head, and pointing the elbow outward. Then put the elbow
in the nearest door jamb. Then grasp your right arm with your thumb and forefinger, and, keeping the elbow and hand up, gently rocking the forearm up and down. That&#146s basically it. If you are interested in playing a bass, 
hopefully you&#146re also planning to join a school orchestra, which will let you use their basses. Otherwise, fork over about $2,000. The best way to learn both bowing and plucking tecniques is by enlisting a private instructor, but 
anyone who uses a method book designed for plucking or can play an electric bass should&#146nt have a terrible time learning how to pluck, since the notes are the same, and the plucking technique is easy to learn on your own. The range of a bass is normally from the fourth C below middle C to the first G below middle C, though 
the bass is sometimes played higher than this for flashy solo work.    </font>&nbsp;
