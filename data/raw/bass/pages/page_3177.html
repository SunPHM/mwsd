          </span>&quot;I like the competition aspect of the tournaments,&quot;
          Shenep said. &quot;I enjoy being on water, fighting the elements and
          figuring out what works and what doesn't.&quot;<o:p>

          </span>To effectively compete, Shenep said anglers must be prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Anglers need a map of the fishing area -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>in the case of this competition Green Bay (the body of water
          adjoining Lake Michigan) -- as well as talking to local fishermen,
          visiting with bait and tackle store owners and pre-fishing the water
          body to learn the best places to fish and the best bait to use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          </span>Shenep said in lieu of talking to a local fishermen he
          partnered with someone who knew Green Bay well. That came in handy
          when they had to navigate waves about 12 feet high, about as tall as a
          single-story house.<o:p>

          </span>Shenep said the support he received from the Lord and the local fishing group, the Sparta Black River
          Bassmasters, also was key to his success.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The Bassmasters scheduled their fishing tournaments so he and
          several other NCO Academy personnel could participate in their
          off-duty time between course cycles.<o:p>

          </span>Practice time also includes fishing at Fort McCoy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Shenep said fishing for large<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>mouth bass is a quiet diversion for personnel who need a break
          from the time demands of their busy working schedule.<o:p>

          </span>&quot;I do fish on the North Flowage, Squaw Lake and the
          Sandies, especially Big Sandy Lake,&quot; Shenep said. &quot;My
          grandfather and father took me fishing, and I also take my kids out
          fishing every chance I have.&quot;<o:p>

          </span>Shenep, who breaks into a big smile at the mention of the word
          bass, became a B.A.S.S. Federation member in 1999 when he was at
          stationed at Fort Riley, Kan. He finished second in a club

          </span>&quot;Bass fisherman need confidence and a good attitude,&quot;
          Shenep said. &quot;They also need to keep a sharp hook, fresh fishing
          lines, and, for the weedy conditions around here, I like to use a
          plastic worm.&quot;<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
