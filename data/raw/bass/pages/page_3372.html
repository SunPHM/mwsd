<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black sea bass, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Centropristis
striata,</i> are found from Cape Ann, Maine to Cape Canaveral, Florida.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is a small population of black sea bass found in Long Island Sound,
with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>greater numbers occurring in
the western end of the sound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/bsbadultweb.jpg" width="247" height="194" align="left">
</span>Black
sea bass are associated with pilings, wharves, wrecks, reefs and oyster beds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are managed under the Summer Flounder, Scup and Black Sea Bass
Fishery Management Plan&nbsp; (Amendment 9), 1996.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
1997, David Nelson began working with black sea bass at the Milford laboratory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That same year, black sea bass were spawned naturally at the Milford
laboratory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the first time
this species had been successfully spawned in vitro<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>without the use of hormone injections (IU human chorionic gonadotropin or
luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the spring of 1998 the fish were again spawned naturally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In both years, hatch of the embryos was low and survival was poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>From 1999 to 2001 adult female black sea bass had to be injected with
luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hatch of embryos and survival of larvae was poor. In
May of 2002, black<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>sea bass were
spawned naturally at the Milford laboratory by David Nelson and Dean Perry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Adult fish were conditioned by photothermal manipulation, which involved
letting the seawater temperature to naturally decrease to 10<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">°</span>C
and turning <img border="0" src="images/bsblarvaeweb.jpg" align="left" width="256" height="171"> the lights off above the tanks that held the fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The seawater temperature was maintained at 10ºC by mixing ambient
seawater with heated seawater. This caused the fish to go into a torpid state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When ambient temperature reached 10º C, the heated seawater was turned
off and lights above the tanks turned on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
day/night cycle was initially set on a 10 h light and 14 h dark schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fish remained at this temperature and photoperiod for 1 month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The seawater temperature was allowed to increase<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>naturally over eight weeks and the photoperiod was gradually increased,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>until the seawater temperature was 18<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">°</span>C
and a photoperiod of 15 h light and 9 h dark was reached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Spawning began at this point and continued daily for 5 weeks. Eight
females<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>produced an average of 100
mls of eggs per day with 1 ml equal to 1,000 eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Aliquots of these eggs were placed into a recirculating seawater system
at 32ppt salinity, 20<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">°</span>C,
<img border="0" src="images/bsbtankweb.jpg" align="right" width="256" height="171">where
greater than 90% of them hatched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larvae were fed a daily diet of
rotifers, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brachionus plicatilis,</i> for 2
weeks and then weaned onto brine shrimp, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Artemia
salina</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The fish were fed <img border="0" src="images/bsbdryweb.jpg" width="258" height="172" align="left"> brine
shrimp daily for 3 weeks, with feedings of pellet food introduced during the
second week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The black sea bass
were completely weaned to a pellet food when they were 6-weeks-old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Survival of this cohort of fish has been very good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We estimate that we now have approximately 700-800 juvenile black sea
bass that<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>continue to grow at a fast rate, 4.9 mm/week,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>and are eating a larger size pellet food every couple of weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>We plan to move these fish to grow-out tanks where we will closely
monitor feeding times and amounts, and growth rates.<img border="0" src="images/bsbjuvweb.jpg" align="right" width="256" height="171"></p>
