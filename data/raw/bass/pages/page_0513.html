    <p align="left">For this year's Shadowmania event at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley
    Green, Bruce opted to adopt the same successful formula which had served so well in 1998.<br>
    <br>
    Shadowmania'99 started early in the afternoon at about 3pm&nbsp; and once more, it was the
    Reflections from Norway who started off the events with their rousing rendition of
    'Shazam'. This group had impressed us all last year and gave a performance which confirmed
    their talents and also showed how much they had developed in the preceeding 12 months
    playing a succession of Shadows hits before finishing with a medley of Quartermaster's
    Stores/Red River Rock.<br>
    <em>(The Reflections set: Shazam,The rumble, The wild roses, Brazil, Zambesi, Sweet
    dreams, Find me a golden street, Temptation, Tales of a raggy tramline, Perfidia,
    Rodrigo's guitar concerto, The Saturday Western,Round and round, Quartermaster's stores /
    Red river rock)</em><br>

    <br>
    <img src="GS3.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="300">After the Reflections came Guitar Syndicate who gave us a
    very polished performance, entertaining us with their wit and humour as well as some very
    accomplished playing in a variety of styles from Chu Chi through to Slaughter on Tenth
    Avenue including a change from Fenders to Burns. A particular favourite of mine being
    'Riders of The Range'. This event was also the first time when I have seen THE ACT
    THROWING FRUIT AT THE AUDIENCE! (Banana man - nobody seemed to mind).<br>
    <em>(Guitar Syndicate set: The miracle, Chu chi, Deep purple, Spring is nearly here, The
    third man, Return to the Alamo, Sleepwalk '98, Turn around and touch me, I wish I could

    <p align="left"><img src="youngstar.jpg" alt="youngstar.jpg (16302 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="266">As
    last year, the afternoon session was concluded with Patrick Terrett introducing &quot;The
    Young Ones&quot; guitar competition which featured budding young guitarists aged from 12 -
    15 playing along to UB Hank backing tracks...I wish I could play my guitar as well as
    them. Also featured in this session were Zoe McCulloch and Nick Kellie with their fine
    duet, 'Jessica'.<br>

    During the intervalfor refreshments, we were again treated to &quot;Shads on the
    box&quot;, Bruce's&nbsp; compilation of very rare Shadows TV and promo footage showing on
    the video screens. Great seeing them play songs like Mary Anne, and great tunes like The
    Rise &amp; Fall of Flingel Bunt. Original TV performances in TV shows like
    &quot;Crackerjack&quot; playing FBI and Man of Mystery. And so much more.... What a pity
    this archive isn't likely to be see a comercial release!<br>
    <br>
    A surprise arrival during the interval as a guest in the audience was Tony Meehan making a
    rare&nbsp; appearance in Public for the first time in ages. Tony, being recognised almost
    immediately, was surround by hoards of autograph hunting admirers. also in the audience
    Tornadoes drummer and session man Clem Cattini.<br>

    The evening session kicked off with a very polished performance by The Rapiers, a really
    great band who aside from performing some great Shadows instrumentals showed their vocal
    talents with several songs including &quot;I want you to want me&quot; and&nbsp;
    &quot;Baby My heart&quot; and also instrumentals like &quot;Saturday Night at the Duck
    Pond&quot; and a superb version of&nbsp; &quot;Raining in my heart&quot;, finishing off
    with their spectacular &quot;William Tell - at the gallop&quot; a feast for both the ears
    and the eyes which defies description.<br>
    <em>(The Rapiers set: Shadoogie, Dance on, Saturday dance (v), Driftin', Be bop a lula
    (v), Saturday night at the duckpond, Baby my heart (v), Theme from a filletted place, I
    want you to want me (v), Bossa roo, That's the way it goes (v), Rainin' in my heart, Don't

    After a short interval, during which&nbsp;Tony Meehan was again much in demand for
    autographs, Bruce Welch's Moonlight Shadows came on stage, welcomed by the capacity
    audience of over 1000 from all over the World, with&nbsp; Phil Kelly on Lead, Cliff Hall
    Keyboards, Alan Jones on bass and Bob Watkins on drums. The first number was&nbsp;
    Chattanooga Choo Choo followed by The Rise &amp; Fall of Flingel Bunt, The Breeze &amp;
    I,&nbsp; Foot Tapper, Wonderful land, Atlantis, Gonzales, Blue sky blue sea blue me,
    Shadoogie, Theme for young lovers etc.<br>

    <br>
    <img src="Jetlead.jpg" alt="Jetlead.jpg (18990 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="250">Jet Harris made a
    great guest appearance again this year and played his top ten hits &quot;Scarlet
    O'Hara&quot;, &quot;Applejack&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;Diamonds&quot; before switching to bass
    for his showpiece solo &quot;Nivram&quot; and the number which started everything,
    &quot;Apache&quot;, Once again, the audience showed how they love Jet by giving him his
    customary standing ovation.<br>

    After Jet had left the stage, Moonlight Shadows continued with Somewhere skillfully played
    by Phil Kelly's skillful rendition of the beautiful tune &quot;Somewhere&quot; from
    &quot;West Side Story&quot; following this by changing the tempo completely with the
    furiously-paced &quot;The Savage&quot; before Barry Gibson joined the team on stage to
    take over the lead duties for Riders in The Sky, Sacha, and Cliff Hall's feature
    &quot;Time is Tight&quot;.<br>

    <img src="DWhite2.jpg" alt="Danny White.jpg (13633 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="375">For the vocal
    break this year, Bruce had enlisted the aid of vocalist Danny White who joined the
    Moonlight Shadows on stage to present a Cliff Richard soundalike session, treating us to
    several early Cliff &amp; The Shadows hits such as&nbsp; &quot;The Young Ones&quot;&nbsp;
    Willie and The Hand Jive etc. and joining Bruce for the Eurovision special &quot;Let me be
    the one&quot;<br>
    <i>(Moonlight Shadows vocal set featuring Danny White: The young ones, Willie and the hand
    jive, The next time, Medley: Summer holiday/Please don't tease/The day I met Marie(v) Let
    me be the one, On the beach, I could easily fall in love with you</i>)<br>
    <br>
    After Danny's spot, Bob Watkins took the spotlight for his speciality, &quot;Little
    B&quot;. It is impossible to praise this too much - Brian would surely have approved. <br>
    <img src="../Shadowmania/BobW1.jpg" alt="Bob Watkins" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="360"><br>
    Following &quot;The Deer hunter&quot; and &quot;Equinoxe&quot;, the show was concluded
    with the traditional rousing finale FBI (&quot;non-hooligan&quot; version).<br>
    <img src="MShadows.jpg" alt="Moonlight Shadows.jpg (31354 bytes)" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="333"><br>
    It is impossible to fully convey in words the atmosphere of the event, you would have to
    be there to feel the mood, the atmosphere, the enthusiasm, the friendship. Our thanks must
    go to Bruce, the other musicians, and everyone else who made the occasion possible and
    such a success. Bruce's program notes indicated that he hopes to repeat the event again
    next year so watch out for SHADOWMANIA 2000.</p>

    held on Friday 28th May,1999 LAKESIDE HOTEL, FRIMLEY, SURREY</p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="3">Around 100 people enjoyed a very entertaining
    Social Evening, listening to live Shadows Music being played by twenty excellent
    guitarists who were all very keen to take the stage and provide the musical entertainment
    for the night. Playing live, along to their various backing tracks were; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 30px">Ian White, Peter Morse and John Goacher from Middlesex, <br>
    Ian Harper from Scarborough,<br>
    Richard Cowling from Filey, <br>
    Stuart and Rob Smith from Bristol,<br>
    David Martin from Newark,<br>
    Ian McCutcheon from Leamington Spa,<br>
    Roy Cresswell and James Argyle from Wolverhampton, <br>
    Jon Malcolm from Torquay,<br>
    Peter Donald from Newbiggin by the Sea,<br>
    Tommy Bird, Tony Arrowsmith, Brian Bowman, Tony Kindlan,and Brian Hopkinson from Newcastle
    Upon Tyne.</p>
    <p>The evening was compered in a very easy-going, informative and humorous style by two
    members of the Shadowcasters Band, Martin the Drummer and Chris the bass player who had
    travelled from North Yorkshire with their other band members Dave, lead guitarist and
    Jimmy on rhythm guitar, for the weekend. All the guitarists played to a very high standard
    and the audience was treated to a variation of Shadow&#146;s numbers ranging from the ever
    popular to the more obscure.<br>
    <br>
    Present also on the evening were several foreign visitors who included Jan A Flatby and
    Dag Johnson with their wives. These, we discovered, are the organisers of the very
    successful Shadows Festival in Norway which they have been organising since 1997, and
    attracts several hundred fans and has many Shadows-type bands playing.<br>
    <br>
    The many Shadows fans present were very pleased to welcome in the audience, Jet Harris,
    his wife Janet, and Alan Jones who attended the gathering and very kindly signed
    autographs and had photos taken with the fans. A further bonus for the guitarists playing
    was that they had the opportunity to perform in the eyes and ears of ex-Shadow members
    which really was the &#145;icing on the cake&#146;.<br>
    <br>
    Everyone agreed that this first Shadow&#146;s Social Evening had been a real success and a
    good appetiser for Bruce Welch&#146;s Shadowmania taking place at the Lakeside Country
    Club the next day. Requests were made to arrange another similar event for next year with
    suggestions to make it even longer, allowing for more playing time and varied items of
    entertainment. </p>
