I get a lot of calls for replacement rubber tips for the unique Kay and Engelhardt endpins. They are 1/2" shafts, which is unusual in the upright bass world, and for years, when the tip wore out, I bought boxes of crutch tips. They work, but they really don't last that long, so I was always in search of a better solution. For a quickie, you can pick up 1/2" rubber tips at most hardware stores. But I have some alternative suggestions.<br><br> 

But first, an opinion... if you are in an environment where the floor can be sacrificed, removing the rubber tip and <i>digging in</i> with the point can be a good thing for your sound, to couple with the floor. They aren't pointy by accident! In some cases, however, such as a hollow stage with a flexible floor, it may make it more boomy, which may or may not be a good thing.<br><br>

<img src="http://www.eclecticbass.com/faq-rubbertips-point.jpg" width="196" height="139" border="0" align="left" alt="" hspace="7" vspace="7">If you have a contemporary Engelhardt, the endpin may have a crossbar that prevents you from losing the pin inside the bass, as shown in the photo at left. Consider cutting or grinding them off so you can put the pointy end inside the bass and the blunt end outside. Your rubber tips will last a lot longer. Alternatively, some metal washers or a metal disk can be placed inside the tip so the sharp point won't pierce the rubber tip.<br><br>
<br clear="all">
My solution for a more robust tip is a simple and inexpensive (cheap Bob!!) one. The larger the tip, the more rubber, so I went to a local hardware store and bought TWO types of tips.<br><br>
<img src="http://www.eclecticbass.com/faq-rubbertips.jpg" width="498" height="297" border="0" alt=""><br><br>
<ul>
	<li>a 1/2" (13mm) Vinyl Furniture Tip (Ace Hardware ACE 5015623 or equivalent)</li>
	<li>a 5/8" (16mm) Rubber Straight Tip (Ace Hardware ACE 51239 or equivalent)</li>
</ul><img src="http://www.eclecticbass.com/faq-rubbertips-final.jpg" width="174" height="256" border="0" alt="" align="right" vspace="7" hspace="7">The tip shown between the packages in the photo is the original Engelhardt rubber tip, which you can see is smaller. The rubber is also softer.<br><br>
First, slip the slim vinyl 1/2" tip on the pin, and then force the 5/8" rubber tip over it, as shown in the photo at right. This results in a much more robust tip that lasts 2-3 times longer in my experience. I've seen these same tips at other hardware stores, usually in a four-pack, and I seem to remember they ran around $4-6 a pack.<br><br>
<br><br>
Hope this helps!<br><br><img src="http://www.eclecticbass.com/bobsig.gif" width="50" height="27" border="0" alt=""><br><br>
Addendum- Adam Tervort suggests checking out the rubber tips used for drum hardware, as they are made of a more durable rubber. <i>Your suggestions are welcome, too!</i>
