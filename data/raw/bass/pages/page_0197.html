  An Excellent Game Fish</font> </h2>
<p> <font color="black">By Michelle Stripling</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> One of the most impressive game fish because of their 
  immense size, stripers are fast becoming popular fish in Georgia. Stripers, 
  or striped bass (<i>Morone saxatilis</i>), are similar in appearance to white 
  bass except for their more prominent stripes, or black-brown longitudinal lines, 
  that run down the length of the fish and their more slender appearance.</font> 
</p>
<p> <font color="black"> In their native range, which includes Georgia's coast, 
  stripers enter the coastal streams and rivers during their spring spawning runs 
  where they may travel as far as 100 miles upstream to spawn, searching for areas 
  with rapids and strong currents. Unlike trout, which lay their eggs in a gravel 
  bed, stripers don't make beds, but spread their eggs in a water column The current 
  of the river is critical for the eggs' survival. If the current slows, the eggs, 
  which are suspended in the water, will settle to the bottom, become silted over, 
  and die. Because of this, dams interfere with the spawning efforts of stripers. 
  For spawning to be successful, the eggs have to flow in the current for approximately 
  40 hours until the eggs become hard and float on the water's surface.</font> 
</p>
<p> <font color="black"> Stripers found their way into the Chattahoochee north 
  of Lake Lanier after they were stocked in Lanier and began moving up river. 
  The population on the lower section of the Chattahoochee was originally released 
  in West Point Lake.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> </font> <font color="black"> Unlike other possible predatory fish like largemouth 
  bass, stripers can survive in cold water. While the colder trout waters have 
  deterred most predatory fish from reaching and impacting the Chattahoochee's 
  trout fishery, stripers haven't been deterred. </font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> Stripers will prey on trout. In fact, many striper fishermen 
  in Lanier use live rainbow trout fingerlings for bait because of the stripers' 
  preference for the young fish.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> The DNR is currently getting public input on the possiblity of stocking striped bass into West Point. Stripers continue to be stocked in Lake Harding (also called 
  Bartletts Ferry Lake), however. The numerous dams between that lake and the 
  trout fishery in Atlanta prevent any stripers from moving up that far and endangering 
  the trout.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> Stripers, which are more active at night, will feed on 
  whatever is plentiful at the time. In the Chattahoochee below Morgan Falls Dam, 
  stripers feed on a lot of crayfish, but they will eat anything that comes in 
  their path including shad, carp, and trout. Stripers tend to hang out in the 
  cold water refuges of the river's tailwaters or near wastewater effluents of 
  sewage plants where shad can often be found. In reservoirs such as Lake Lanier, 
  stripers are often found in deep waters and feed heavily on shad.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> Stripers are an excellent game fish because of their 
  size and are a popular game fish of Lake Lanier, says Jimmy Jacobs, author of 
  <i> Trout Fishing in North Georgia</i>. </font> </p>
<p> <font color="black">"Hundreds of stripers in the 20- to 30-pound range are 
  caught in Lanier each year.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> Stripers have become a glamour fish, because nowhere 
  else in the state can you catch fish that size," he said.</font> </p>
<p> <font color="black"> Despite the fact that stripers are also found in the 
  Chattahoochee, few anglers go after them there. It may be due to the fact that 
  night fishing is limited on the river. Anglers fishing for catfish in the Chattahoochee, 
  however, will catch stripers sporadically.</font> </p>
