<img border="0" src="Chicago5.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="400">Most 12-string bass players I have spoken to generally
agree that the optimum rig for a 12ver is a multi-amp setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp; Tom Petersson's live rig features a
trio of amps: one for the lows mids and highs.&nbsp; The output from each of the three
pickups is sent to three <font color="#FF8000"><strong>Nady 701</strong></font> wireless
systems: each of these feeds a multi-switcher that dishes out the signals to the amps.
&nbsp; The low-end signal from the neck pickup is sent to a DI Box that drives a <font
color="#FF8000"><strong>Rickenbacker Transonic Head</strong></font> and a <font
color="#FF8000"><strong>2x15</strong></font> cabinet.&nbsp; The mid-range signal is routed
through a <strong><font color="#FF8000">MESA/ Boogie V Twin tube pre-amp pedal</font> </strong>w/
a tremolo stomp box&nbsp; feeding&nbsp; a<strong> <font color="#FF8000">Vox AC-30 guitar
head</font> </strong>and two more<strong> <font color="#FF8000">Rickenbacker Transonic
2x15's</font></strong>.&nbsp; The output of the bridge pickup is routed through a <font
color="#FF8000"><strong>Dunlop Rotovibe peda</strong>l</font> which is then
&quot;crunched&quot; by a <font color="#FF8000"><strong>Hiwatt master-volume head </strong></font><font
color="#FFFFFF">slamming two</font><font color="#FF8000"><strong> Rickenbacker Transonic
4x12s</strong></font>.&nbsp; This rig is just&nbsp; one of a few different amp trios
combinations used by Tom Petersson.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">For those of us fortunate enough to be able to afford
and enjoy one of these &quot;<strong>ultimate 12ver rigs</strong>&quot; there is nothing
like it. (By the way...I'm not one of them.)&nbsp; If you are fortunate enough to have
seen Cheap Trick live in recent years, you know that Tom definitely knows how to maximize
the tone of his 12-string bass. He is definitely the master! (As well he should be since
he is credited as being the inventor of the 12-String Bass! (see <strong><a
href="newpage11.htm">Origin of the 12-String Bass</a></strong>)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you need such a complex rig to enjoy your 12ver?
&nbsp; Actually its not a matter of how complex but rather how good the rig is.&nbsp; A
major concern regarding a 12-string bass rig is that the low frequency demands of a 12ver
are deceiving.&nbsp; There is so much high frequency information (form the octave strings)
distracting you from the fact that there is a significant amount of low-end being
generated!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard of fuses being blown on power amps that were not up to
the task.&nbsp; 12vers are definitely<strong> much</strong> harder on rigs than other
basses.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">If you are feeling a little over-whelmed now, don't
worry.&nbsp; There are plenty of easy &quot;rig&quot;<span lang="en-us"> </span>solutions to bring out the maximum
tone of your 12ver.&nbsp; Here are just a few of the recommendations/ solutions I have
come across querying other 12ver players.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">First and foremost get a <a href="sansamp.htm"><strong>SansAmp
Bass Driver DI</strong></a> to split and/ or affect the signal(s) going to these rigs.
&nbsp; In my opinion...this box is an indispensable 12ver &quot;tone&quot; tool!&nbsp; Get
the adapter, you will be using it 24/ 7!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00" size="3">1. As far as combos/ cabs go, one of
the most&nbsp; recommended rigs is a <strong>High Quality 4x10</strong> combo/ cab coupled
with a <strong>High Quality 1x15</strong> combo/ cab (<strong>200 watts+</strong>). The <strong>1x15</strong>
handles the lows/ mids where the <strong>4x10</strong> can handle mids/ highs/ shimmering
quality of the octave strings.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00" size="3">2. Another option would be a good (<strong>1x15
or 1x12</strong>) Bass Combo (for the lows) used with a good Guitar (<strong>1x12</strong>)
Combo (for the mids and highs). The clean channel&nbsp; can be turned all the way down and
the gain channel set for really heavy distortion.&nbsp; Turn the bass knob down as well.
&nbsp; This eliminates those low-end frequencies that would normally destroy a guitar amp
speaker.&nbsp; All you want to have grinding is the mids and the highs producing that
highly sought after GROWL!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00" size="3">3. If you can only afford to go with a
single bass combo, the unanimous choice seems to a <strong>High Quality 4x10</strong>.
&nbsp; The <strong>4x10's</strong> will create a little more low-end while increasing your
speakers chance for survival by <strong>100%</strong> over a combo such as a <strong>2x10</strong>.
Also it is a very good compromise giving you enough of the sonic spectrum to work with
allowing the 12ver to produce very respectable tone. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">To be fair however, there can be a
downside to multi-amp setups.&nbsp; Running through a multi-amp setup (other than for you
own enjoyment) can sometimes be pointless unless you are playing in a 1200 seat
theatre.&nbsp; In most clubs, house soundmen give you a direct or miked signal and that's
it!&nbsp; Unless you are touring the larger theatres/ venues, no one in the audience will
hear your multi-amp setup except for yourself and your crew will curse you and want too
much money!!! Assess your own situation/ needs when choosing your rig! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Regardless of what rig you choose<strong>, ensure</strong>
you disconnect the horn(s)/ tweeter(s) if applicable.&nbsp; The 12ver has its own tweeters
built in (the octave strings). Disconnecting them will achieve a smooth snarl on the high
end when adding distortion (Drive on the SansAmp).&nbsp;&nbsp; Horn(s)/ Tweeter(s) can add
a nasty &quot;scritchy&quot; element that is a lot like the quack/ skritch of Piezo
pickups.&nbsp; This is definitely detrimental to achieving the desired classic tone of a
12ver.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Another good piece of advice is to find an amp that
sounds good on its own!&nbsp; Anything you do to modify or improve the tone of your 12ver
will only be as good as that foundation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">A final note.&nbsp; Be careful when employing a large
bass rig.&nbsp; The low-end from a large/ powerful rig &quot;blossoms&quot; several feet
out from the stage.&nbsp; When you hear a lot of bass around you while on stage, that is
usually a sign that there is way too much out front.&nbsp; This is definitely the case
with a 12ver!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Remember all this advice comes from experienced 12ver
players.&nbsp; However nothing is stopping you from modifying/ changing any of these
recommendations to suit the tone you want to achieve.&nbsp; Use the above information as a
guideline in addition to your own preferences and you should get the tone/ sound <strong>you</strong>
are searching for.</font></p>
