Wooden Ships: Iron Men</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike 
many of my courses in Naval Science, the classes on Naval Warfare were the most 
fascinating.&nbsp; With advancing science, the weapons of modern warfare were 
becoming technically interesting.&nbsp; The technology used in mines was also 
advancing.&nbsp; Unlike older mines that detonated on contact, newer mines had 
sensors that could gauge the size or proximity of ships passing nearby, and 
detonate only when the proper signal configuration was achieved.&nbsp; Others mines 
might count the ships passing overhead, and detonate only after a predetermined 
number of passes had been recorded.&nbsp; These mines were all invisible from the 
surface without special detection devices.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
wartime, minefields could be laid out along coastal waters, harbors or rivers to 
discourage the passage of ships.&nbsp; Blockade of a harbor could be achieved with 
mines alone.&nbsp; As passive devices, mines remain submerged well after hostilities 
end, and pose serious threats to commerce until they are cleared from the 
waterways.&nbsp; Clearing mines was the task of the minesweepers, a small vessel 
tailored for the job.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-indent: 0.5in">
<font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">The Hamilton County was a minesweeper 
tender designed to provide support for an assortment of minesweepers.&nbsp; By 
January 1956 when I reported aboard, the Navy had developed a minesweeper which 
had all the bells and whistles needed to sweep mines and avoid being blown up in 
the process.&nbsp; The following picture shows three sweepers, the Warbler (MSC-206), 
the Widgeon (MSC-208), and a third sweeper alongside the Hamilton County well 
prior to our deployment to the Western Pacific.&nbsp; The ships had only been in 
service for a few months, and had the latest in minesweeper warfare technology.&nbsp; 
Most of the sweepers and the Hamilton County were subsequently home-ported in 
Sasebo, where they served the Navy’s needs for the next 15 years.&nbsp; They were the
<i>cat’s whiskers</i> in minesweepers at the time.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These 
sweepers originated the popular notion of <i>wooden ships and iron men</i>.&nbsp; The 
ships were designed to present a minimum magnetic signal, compared with metal 
hull ships.&nbsp; Their engines and associated equipment were built with nonmagnetic 
alloys wherever possible.&nbsp; Degaussing cable was used to neutralize the magnetic 
influence that could not be eliminated.&nbsp; For example, consumable goods in tin 
cans were stored in permanent places aboard ship.&nbsp; After they were used, the 
cans were washed, returned to the original boxes, and placed on the same storage 
shelves to avoid altering the ship’s magnetic characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the cooks 
failed to follow these rather explicit instructions, the result could blow the 
ship out of the water.&nbsp; This made the ship’s cooks extraordinarily attentive.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With 
their dangerous mission, it was essential that the ships, hulls, and all onboard 
equipment be tested for the ability to withstand water-born explosions, as may 
occur while actually sweeping for mines.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the flagship for minesweepers, the 
Hamilton County was to oversee the testing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-indent: 0.5in">
<font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">To prepare for testing, we loaded a dozen 
yellow mines on the main deck, ordered the helicopter to come aboard, and for 
the first and only time in a year and a half, the Admiral, Commander Mine Forces 
Pacific Fleet, came aboard with his staff to witness the testing.&nbsp; Once 
everything and everybody was aboard, we left for a remote island in the Catalina 
group off Southern California.&nbsp; As we were steaming into Catalina, the below 
picture shows the dozen yellow mines waiting to be used, the HUP-2 helicopter 
strapped to the deck, and Catalina Island dead ahead of the ship’s bow.&nbsp; We were 
about to find out exactly how sea worthy these little wooden ships and their 
iron men would be.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
anchored in a large protected cove to begin preparation for the testing.&nbsp; It was 
never quite clear exactly how the one minesweeper (MSC) designated for the 
testing was selected from among many.&nbsp; The admiral may well have asked for 
volunteers.&nbsp; Had they known that the crew would be aboard the ship as the mines 
were detonated, they might have had second thoughts about volunteering.&nbsp; As most 
MSC captains were Annapolis graduate JG’s, they may have stood in line for the 
honor.&nbsp; In any event, one minesweeper and many of its crew were all aboard, at 
anchor a considerable distance from the admiral and the rest of us on the 
Hamilton County when the fireworks began.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
above is a schematic of the minesweeper (MSC) at anchor, while the yellow 
circles represent the mines placed at various distances and depths from the 
ship.&nbsp; Testing required the better part of a day, beginning early in the 
morning.&nbsp; Initially the most distant mine was detonated.&nbsp; Following each 
detonation, the crew on the minesweeper would check the ship for damage, making 
special note of anything that might be moved by the shock.&nbsp; The initial 
explosion may have been 150 yards from the ship and 30 feet below the surface.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After 
the ship was checked, the next nearer mine was detonated, and the routine was 
repeated.&nbsp; This went on throughout the day until all twelve mines had been 
detonated.&nbsp; The last few charges were designed to provide a lateral shock to the 
side (abeam) of the ship, and the final blast was almost below the ship’s hull, 
providing vertical thrust.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By and 
large, the remote explosions did little more than produce waves and a rocking 
motion commonly experienced by everything that floats.&nbsp; From about 50 yards and 
closer, items that were not securely fastened to the ship were moved by the 
jolt, but the little wooden ship was amazingly sturdy.&nbsp; The final few jolts were 
extraordinary in their impact on both the wooden ship and the iron men, with the 
men being the more resilient.&nbsp; On visual during the final explosion, the little 
ship appeared to be raised about four feet above its former waterline before 
settling back into the water.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There 
was no major damage to the wooden hull of the ship, although the main engines 
were reportedly knocked loose from their shipyard alignments.&nbsp; Virtually 
everything that could be moved, jostled, or knocked over, was moved, jostled, or 
knocked over.&nbsp; After a brief period of adjustment by the iron men, the little 
ship returned from the testing site on its own power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sea worthiness was 
beyond question following this brutal series of tests.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test 
was not without its surprising outcome.&nbsp; The first detonations produced almost 
no visible consequences.&nbsp; The last few explosions produced hundreds of stunned 
fish in the cove.&nbsp; When the testing was over, the LCVP used to move men and 
equipment during the test was used to gather in the fish that had been stunned.&nbsp; 
For the better part of a half hour, the crew of the LCVP gathered fish until the 
bottom of the boat was covered with fish.&nbsp; Then it returned to the Hamilton 
County.&nbsp; The following picture shows the admiral on his only stay aboard the 
Hamilton County (left) and Captain Weatherby (right) struggling to hold two of 
the larger three fish which were captured in the exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brightly 
colored black and orange fish, I was told, is a sheep’s head, while the larger 
gray-brown fish is a sea bass.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle"><font face="Georgia" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because 
the cooks on the ship reported to me first, they asked if I would like some of 
the sea bass to take home.&nbsp; I said a small portion would be fine, enough for two 
meals.&nbsp; They filleted about two pounds and froze it for taking home.&nbsp; This was a 
fitting and delicious end of our testing.&nbsp; The fish was great and the wooden 
ships were amazing, but the iron men had earned their name and their 
reputation.&nbsp;</font></p>
