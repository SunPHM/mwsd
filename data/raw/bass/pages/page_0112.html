	We have some excellent bass fishing here.  I fish a lot of the lakes,  rivers, and reservoirs in the area and have a lot of fun doing it.  Some of my favorites include Roanoke Rapids Lake and Roanoke River, Tar River Reservoir, Gaston Lake, and Kerr Lake. I try to avoid the more popular places like Shearon-Harris Nuclear lake and Jordan Lake because of the crowds.  Even in early spring these lakes are extremely busy.

We start in late February and fish for pre-spawn bass until the stripers arrive in good numbers in early or mid April.  

<FONT COLOR="BROWN"> In pre-spawn <FONT COLOR="BLACK"> we fish a jig and pig, rattletraps, and spinnerbaits.  The water is cold and usually very dingy or downright muddy.  The water was so muddy last spring that when you pulled your bait out of the water it left a hole!  On good weather days we do well. The weather is full of cold fronts this time of year and those days are tough.  The picture (left) is me holding a fat 5 1/2 pounder caught on a rattletrap. <BR CLEAR="LEFT">
We generally fish flats that have a depth of 4 to 6 feet and that have some type of cover.  In the rivers we fish close to the mouths of feeder creeks and try to look for the same depth 4 to 6 feet of depth with cover that is near the channel.

<I><FONT COLOR="BROWN">In post spawn </I><FONT COLOR="BLACK"> things are much different.  We fish topwaters early and late, spinnerbaits and soft plastics on the bottom do well, and of course the ole rattletrap again.  The hotter it gets in the summer, the more likely you are to find some schooling bass.  This is fun as heck!  We cast to the jumps using everything but the coffee cup and some days we have a ball!

We throw pop'rs, rattletraps, super flukes, and shad assassins. We catch a lot of fish.  They don't generally have the size like the spring fish but they are fun.
