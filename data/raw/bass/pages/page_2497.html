<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font point-size="12">Gary Jeffery, owner
of Right Bite Baits, fishes for both.&nbsp; Landing this 3 lb. bass on
Greer’s Ferry Lake was “almost” as much fun as when he and his fishing
partner, Ric Cothren, won the Governor’s Trophy and Ranger Bass Boat in
the Spring of 2002, using bass fishing lures from Right Bite Baits.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font point-size="12">Gary started Right
Bite Baits in 1992 and initially focused on making spinner baits and buzz
baits for his fishing buddies and a few local tackle shops.&nbsp; From
that, the business has grown to where he currently supplies retail bait
and tackle shops in 25 states and Canada. Right Bite’s plastic fishing
lures are made here in Northeast Arkansas.&nbsp; Our commitment to our
customers has never wavered.&nbsp; Our goal is to provide the best quality,
best selection, and best price possible.&nbsp; VMC Hooks, McCoy Mean Green
Line, Tube and Worm Rattles, Lead Heads, Fish Attractants and Dye are among
the many other items available. Each product is tested and measures up
to Right Bite Baits rigorous standards.</font></font>
<p>Great pride is taken in the quality of all our fishing lures. Gary is
the type of person who pays attention to detail -- both when fishing, and
of course, in making his artificial lures. All of our spinner baits are
hand made to order, using only the finest materials. They are also available
in a variety of weights.&nbsp; All Right Bite plastic baits come in a large
assortment of colors, several sizes, and are all salt impregnated.&nbsp;
He knows that while there is no substitute for skills learned through experience
while fishing, the next biggest factor is probably the bait or fishing
lures you are using.
