        Dinner at the Sonoda house. Frank's famous Chilean Sea Bass (ok, we KNOW 
        it's on the endangered species list but we only eat it as a treat = $15.99 
        a pound!). Frank pan seared it so there was a light crust on the outside, 
        and then steamed it. Then it was topped off with his delicious asian dressing. 
        Sooooooo good!<br>
        <br>
        This has got to be one of my most favorite things to eat in the whole 
        world! This is why i have a whole page dedicated to the meal.<br>

        Stu served a chardonnay with the fish. I usually don't care for chardonnay
