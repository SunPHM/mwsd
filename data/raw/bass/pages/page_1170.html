					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Regal Dobro Bass is an import that offers immuculate craftsmanship, tremendous volume/tone, and easy playability (similar to an electric bass because of the thin body). I've been very impressed with mine and wouldn't trade it for any other available acoustic bass. Gibson used to manufacture a Dobro Bass, but for some reason, they discontinued them. This is the only Dobro bass that I know of as being currently available. It possesses tremendous volume, projection and bite. The tone and projection is dependent on the spun cone and spider bridge giving it a natural amplification that no other acoustic bass can match.</font></p>

						Hi Suzie, I just got the dobro bass today and it arrived all intact!!<br>
							
						
						You and your people are very nice to work with, we had some shipping delays<br>
							
						
						and some confusion on the delivery time but it worked out.<br>
							
						
						I never would have thought of purchasing a Korean made instrument, especially<br>
							
						
						for my kind of music(bluegrass,country)but after hearing the bass on the net <a href="page319.htm">(through the video samplers)</a><br>
							
						
						and checking out the Washburn, and the Dean, and several fretless acoustic<br>
							
						
						basses(not standups) made here in the USA the dobro bass blows them away.<br>
							
						
						Our application is simple in the fact that we need a beginner's bass and<br>
							
						
						this fits real well for us. The last thing you want is a person learning to<br>
							
						
						play bass dragging a standup around and booming wrong notes all over the<br>
							
						
						festival grounds, theres enough of that already. I have miked it<br>
							
						
						acoustically and also thru the mixer board running to a subwoofer ,really<br>
							
						
						booms out and fits pretty well with my acoustic electric guitar and<br>
							
						
						drums,digital horn,etc. It will however not compare to a standup and the<br>
							
						
						traditional sound that a standup gives, but for sitting around and jamming<br>
							
						
						and learning the basic bluegrass bass parts it serves well.<br>
							<br>
							
						
						Thanks<br>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2001</b> Just wanted to drop a note saying that I got the Regal Dobro Bass this morning and it is sweet. I have an Ovation Celebrity Acoustic Bass and do like it a lot even if I do blister up my fingers and get a lot of fret rattle trying to keep up with an acoustic guitar. I've tried many other basses, and they just don't do it. However, the dobro bass has it's own sound, and I love it. I never play with a pick, so I was worried the dobro wouldn't have the bite I wanted with my fingers. No worries now, it is everything and more. It was just what I was looking for. Thanks, John<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Sat, 14 Oct 2000</b> Dear Mickey, Love my new Regal bass, thank you for making it possible, and thanks for the gig bag. I'll send pictures as I get started on your FOLK OF THE WOOD sign. Thanks again, Ken Hall<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Sat, 2 Sep 2000</b> Mickey, The bass dobro arrived yesterday. There were no problems and I am quite pleased with it. It's much lighter to pack around than my stand up and will work well in small jams. Did Al Williams of Calton Cases contact you? I also gave your E Mail address to Chuck Shifflett the luthier I know.Thanks, it has been a pleasure doing business with you.<br>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Fri, 3 Dec 1999 </b>Mickey, Thanks for all your help in getting my new Regal Dobro Bass.&nbsp;I play acoustic guitar and am hoping to get one of my daughters interested in playing the bass to accompany me.&nbsp; I began looking for an upright bass because I wanted an acoustic sound, but they were just too big and hard for them to play.&nbsp; The Dobro Bass is the perfect alternative.&nbsp; It has great tone and is loud enough to play without an amp.&nbsp; Now they just have to get it away from me! Thanks again, Rodger Eckhart</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1999</b> Mickey, I got the guitar case for my dobro bass. Thank you for all of your help. I have enjoyed playing the bass. It sounds great! Paul Pitterle</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Wed, 14 Jul 1999</b> The bass is great.&nbsp; It's loud and I'm enjoying it.&nbsp; Thanks.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Tue, 2 Nov 1999</b> The bass is great and I am enjoying playing it. Thanks. Tom</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Thu, 24 Feb 2000</b> I've seen your testimonials page, so I figured sine I had an honest thought, I'd relay it. I've been shopping around for an acoustic bass, I took my old one to a pawn shop cause I hated the thing, I didn't even want to see it. So while shopping, I ran across your website, and it looked like what I wanted, for a lot less than I was thinking, Well I got the thing last night and had a blast for about four hours. Excellent craftsmanship, and yes the sound is what I was looking for. Especially since I so like to slap and pop, there is a great bite when I do that. Thanks, fellas.<br>
