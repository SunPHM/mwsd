important instrument in the world of 12-string basses.&nbsp;For many of us, when Doug 
Pinnick picked up the 12-string bass it changed the way we looked at&nbsp;the 
instrument&nbsp;and expanded what we thought it was capable of musically. He played 
this bass on several albums until he had Hamer make a long-scale 12 for him just 
prior to the <b>Dogman</b> sessions. It appeared in the videos for &quot;It's Love&quot; 
and&nbsp;&quot;Black Flag&quot; and traveled the world on several tours.</font></p>
