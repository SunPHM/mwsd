<h2>Native Shoal Bass: Unique Habitat Conditions Foster a Popular Fishery</h2>
<h3>by Michelle S. Davis. Photos by Richard T. Bryant.</h3>
<p> <img src="/georgia/flint_river/creature_feature/graphics/fly_fishing.jpg" width="300" height="205" align="right" border="2" alt="Fly fishing in the rocky shallows is a popular method for catching shoal bass. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_T_bryant@mindspring.com">Tentatively 
  I inched forward, one foot after the next plunging into swirling currents. Underneath, 
  my feet struggled to gain footing in the shifting rock floor of the river bottom. 
  Even in shallow water, the unstable rocks pitched with every step, and the swiftly 
  moving stream struggled to carry me downstream. </p>
<p> We were wading across the Flint River in middle Georgia at Sprewell Bluff 
  State Park in search of shoal bass. Armed in borrowed waders much too large 
  for me and boots that were a half size too small, I looked awkward as I made 
  my way across the river with my fishing rod held out in front of me. I felt 
  strangely akin to an astronaut walking on the moon, due to the buoyant feel 
  of each step through the water in my bulky clothing and heavy boots. </p>
<p> The sounds of the rapids and the view were soothing though and took my mind 
  off my clumsiness. Magnificent sheer cliffs, for which the park is named, frame 
  the river in this section. Subtle hues of browns, tans, and greens stretching 
  toward the sky create quite a backdrop for the Flint River winding its way through 
  the gorge. One might easily mistake the view for a scene out of the north Georgia 
  mountains as opposed to the Piedmont.</p>
<p> The river is equally beautiful, with a series of cascading shoals. Deep, dark 
  pools are interspersed with stretches of clear water tumbling over rocks of 
  various sizes. The river is wide here with water swirling, dividing, and joining 
  once again between the two banks. </p>
<p> We were on an expedition to fish for shoal bass, the trophies of the Flint. 
  The November day was beautiful with moderate temperatures in the low 60s. Not 
  a cloud marred the perfectly blue sky, and a recent day's rain hadn't been enough 
  to muddy the river, as is sometimes the case. </p>
<p> We were wading the shoals of the Flint because shoal bass, as their name implies, 
  are typically found in the shoals, rapids, and riffles of streams. While most 
  fish, such as the largemouth bass, prefer the calmer water in the pools, shoal 
  bass primarily occupy fast-moving water. </p>
<p> The only waters in which shoal bass are found are in Georgia, eastern Alabama, 
  and north Florida, where they are native to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint 
  (ACF) river system. Within their range, they are most abundant in the Flint.</p>
<p> <img src="/georgia/flint_river/creature_feature/graphics/fish.jpg" width="300" height="196" align="right" border="2" alt="The shoal bass (Micropterus cataractae) wasn&#146;t designated as a separate species until two years ago. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_T_bryant@mindspring.com">Because 
  shoal bass spend their days fighting the currents of the shoals, they are strong 
  fish. That endurance translates into a good, acrobatic fight when hooked at 
  the end of a line, and is sure to entice even the most experienced angler.</p>
<p> "They're fighters," said Jimmy Jacobs, author of <i>Bass Fishing in Georgia</i>, 
  who happened to be my guide for the day. "One of the oddities of this fish is 
  that big ones take a fly and dive real quick. They try to get under the rocks."</p>
<p> With that knowledge in hand, I was ready to catch a fish. After we had waded 
  downstream a ways to locate some of the "better looking" shoals, we began making 
  our rhythmic casts into the water. </p>
<p> "You want to cast into the fast-moving current," instructed Jacobs. The swirling 
  currents of the rapids are the ideal spot to catch a shoal bass. We cast again 
  and again, wading up and downstream and from left to right. </p>
<p> We didn't have much luck though, and by the end of the day, I was casting 
  into the pools, up against the underside of rocks-anywhere I thought a fish 
  might be hiding. Once again, I was fishing on a day when the fish weren't biting. 
  In fact, we only caught three fish that day, a pitiful creel number for more 
  than five hours of fishing. </p>
<h3> The New Fish on the Block</h3>

  </b>Though anglers like us have been reeling in shoal bass for many years, the 
  fish was still unofficially named as recently as two years ago. In fact, the 
  fish had not been designated as a separate species. Informally, some experts 
  had recognized its existence as a new bass. As early as 1940 a scientist named 
  Dr. Carl Hubbs had theorized that this fish was its own distinct species during 
  his research on black basses. Fishermen also acknowledged the shoal bass as 
  a separate species. </p>
<p> "Shoal bass were broadly recognized as early as the 1940s, but there weren't 
  very many specimens around," said George Burgess, an ichthyologist and Coordinator 
  of Operations at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. "The 
  panhandle region and southern Georgia were still the 'country,' so the sort 
  of mainstream ichthyologists hadn't spent a lot of time looking there."</p>
<p> <img src="/georgia/flint_river/creature_feature/graphics/spotted_bass.jpg" width="300" height="112" border="2" align="right" alt="Anatomically, the shoal bass (Micropterus cataractae) on top is similar to the spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus punctulatus) on bottom. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_T_bryant@mindspring.com">Those 
  studying the bass groups were reluctant to describe the fish with the presence 
  of so few specimens. "Nobody had enough material," said Burgess.</p>
<p> Not until the 1990s did two Florida scientists step up to the task. Burgess 
  teamed up with Jim Williams to conduct the research necessary to describe the 
  fish, finally completing their work in 1999.</p>
<p> One of the reasons Burgess felt compelled to write the description of the 
  shoal bass was to ensure some protection for the fish. Loss of habitat in both 
  Florida and Georgia was posing a serious threat to this bass that relies on 
  such a specific type of riverine habitat. Only when the fish had a scientific 
  name could it be designated a threatened species and properly protected. Without 
  an official name, the fish could risk disappearing forever. </p>
<p> As a result, Burgess and Williams began the long process of scientifically 
  describing a fish. They spent the next five to six years collecting specimens, 
  counting scales, taking measurements, describing color patterns of juveniles 
  versus adults and more. They also went back through published reports of feeding 
  habits and reproductive activity of similar fish. They discovered publications 
  where fish listed as a spotted or redeye bass were actually a shoal bass, and 
  they were able to uncover some useful information that was already researched.</p>
<p> When it came to naming the fish, Burgess and Williams decided to keep the 
  common name of "shoal bass" since it had been known as that since the early 
  1970s. (Some also know the fish as the Flint River smallmouth in Georgia or 
  the Chipola bass in Florida.) The scientific name they chose was <i>Micropterus 
  cataractae</i>. <i>Cataractae</i> is drawn from the Latin word, <i>cataracta</i>, 
  meaning waterfall. The name became official once they completed a written description, 
  which was peer-reviewed and published in a technical journal.</p>

    </embed> 
  </object>The shoal bass is unusual not only because of the many years it went 
  unnamed, but also because it can be found only within the ACF basin in the southeastern 
  United States. According to Burgess, such a limited range is not unique to the 
  shoal bass.</p>
<p> "It's not unusual to have a species like this relegated to one single drainage 
  system," said Burgess.</p>
<p> Experts don't know exactly where the first shoal bass originated and whether 
  it then expanded up- or downstream. What they do know is that the bass relies 
  primarily on limited habitat, riverine habitat with shoals, for its existence. 
</p>
<p> The native range of the shoal bass stretches from southeast Alabama into northwest 
  Florida and Georgia. Its range in the Peach State is limited to the drainage 
  of the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers. Shoal bass, sometimes referred to as 
  shoalies, occur throughout the entire Flint River system; however, they are 
  concentrated in the shoals of the Flint, such as those at Sprewell Bluff in 
  middle Georgia, where the river appears extremely healthy and capable of supporting 
  a productive fishery. </p>
<p> Mary Freeman, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has been 
  studying conditions of fishes and habitats in the shoal section of the Flint 
  River from Flat Shoals to Snipe Shoals. </p>
<p> "We don't have many rivers that have shoal habitat like the Flint," she said. 
  "We've lost a lot of shoal habitat to big hydro-powered dams. Most of the shoals 
  on the Chattahoochee were destroyed by impoundments. </p>
<p> "What astounds me about the Flint is how good the habitat looks in that section 
  from Flat Shoals, to Sprewell Bluff, and Yellow Jacket shoals. Even during the 
  summer drought, when the water was very low, the fish were abundant."</p>
<p> Though the river's headwaters begin in an urban area, near Hartsfield International 
  Airport as a matter of fact, the waterway supports a whole range of native fish, 
  including shoal bass, minnows, the rare Halloween darter, and even mussels, 
  Freeman said.</p>
<p> Shoal bass continue to be common in the Flint farther south, as well, where 
  the river takes on a different appearance than that of its headwaters. </p>
<p> "We have a popular and productive fishery in the lower Flint as well," said 
  Fisheries Biologist Matt Thomas of the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division (WRD) 
  Fisheries Department. "Contrary to popular belief, we do have shoal habitat 
  in this lower section of the river. Most of the Flint River in this area has 
  the typical limestone bottom and outcropping. The water is not falling as quickly 
  as in the northern section of the Flint, but it is a little bit deeper. Shallow 
  shoals are not as prevalent, but there are definitely shoals."</p>
<p> The lower section of the Flint has a somewhat different appearance from its 
  headwaters because it lacks the fast-moving shoals that are characteristic of 
  the Flint in its headwaters. Outcroppings of rocks are common in the lower Flint, 
  however, and that is where shoal bass are usually found.</p>
<p> Shoals are the preferred habitat for the shoal bass, however, they can and 
  will occur in other areas, says Jacobs. "They don't have to have shoals, but 
  they do need rocks," said Jacobs.</p>
<p> In the southern reaches of the Flint, shoal bass occur south of Blackshear 
  Dam from Albany almost all the way to Bainbridge. Some of the tributaries in 
  this area also harbor the fish. In addition, shoalies are occasionally found 
  in the headwaters of Lakes Seminole, Chehaw, and Blackshear.</p>
<p> In other areas of the ACF basin, shoal bass aren't quite as prevalent, although 
  they are believed to have once occurred in abundance throughout the system.</p>
<p> "They aren't found throughout the ACF any more," said Burgess.</p>
<p> Like so many other wildlife species throughout Georgia, the shoal bass has 
  fallen victim to loss of habitat. Dredging and damming of rivers ruined habitat, 
  erasing shoals from the streams to allow for barge traffic and power plants. 
  As the shoals disappeared, so did the shoal bass, leaving the vast majority 
  of the population limited to just one river, the Flint. The Chattahoochee River 
  is a prime example of how habitat loss can affect a fishery.</p>
<p> "Because of man's impacts, the Chattahoochee population certainly has been 
  reduced to the point of being at most incidental. Shoal bass occur only in a 
  very few places due to impoundments on the river," said Les Ager, WRD Regional 
  Fisheries Supervisor. "There is a reasonable population in the headwaters, but 
  between Lake Lanier and West Point very few shoal bass exist. Once below West 
  Point, there is very little riverine habitat, due to dams."</p>
<p> Jacobs agrees with Ager. He has found shoal bass in the Chattahoochee from 
  Helen on downstream to the dam, but "they're not what I would call common in 
  that part," he says. In the headwaters, "shoal bass receive a lot of competition 
  from spotted bass coming out of Lanier."</p>
<p> Ager has found that in areas where the shoal bass are less abundant, such 
  as in the Chattahoochee, they seem to occur almost exclusively in the shoals, 
  as opposed to in the Flint where the population has dispersed into areas devoid 
  of typical shoal habitat.</p>
<p> Only one other area in Georgia contains shoal bass, though the fish aren't 
  native to that river. In 1975, shoalies were introduced into the Ocmulgee River, 
  the upper drainage of the Altamaha system, and can be found today in the shoals 
  of that river just below Lake Jackson. They exist in some of the main tributaries 
  there, as well.</p>
<p> In Florida, shoal bass exist in the Apalachicola River and the Chipola River, 
  a tributary from the west. Even there, the population has changed dramatically 
  over the years.</p>
<p> "There was continuous distribution at one time, but now there is only a remnant 
  population just south of the dam on the Apalachicola and the middle section 
  of the Chipola," said Burgess.</p>
<p> The installation of the Jim Woodruff Dam at the Georgia/Florida border changed 
  the look of the Apalachicola, Flint, and Chattahoochee rivers there, limiting 
  the shoal bass to a 6-mile area downstream of the dam.</p>
<h3> Natural History</h3>
<p> The shoal bass is considered a black bass, those members of the sunfish family 
  (Centrarchidae) that get the largest, said Ager. Included in this group are 
  the largemouth, spotted, redeye, smallmouth, Suwannee, Guadeloupe, and shoal 
  bass. Six of these seven black bass occur in Georgia, more than in any other 
  state in the country. Only the Guadeloupe bass, which is native to Texas, is 
  missing from Georgia's waters.</p>
<p> The most distinguishing feature of the shoal bass is the dark vertical bars 
  running the length of the body. The red eye is another obvious feature, as well 
  as the round, dark spot that appears toward the base of the tail. Scale color 
  varies from pale olive green, to dark olive green, to even black at times. Three 
  lateral dark bars can be seen on the side of the head across the cheek. </p>
<p> Shoal bass reach sexual maturity at age three and spawn in the spring, generally 
  from April to June of each year. </p>
<p> "It's a common misconception that shoal bass spawn earlier than other bass 
  species. They probably spawn later," said Ager. "Anglers think it occurs in 
  February or March, but it's actually the first of May."</p>
<p> Males use their tail to dig out saucer-shaped nests in course gravel beds 
  out of the main current. The male fish boldly guards the nest. In fact, males 
  do most of work, with the female's role basically limited to laying the eggs. 
  A single nest contains an average of 10,000 eggs, though the range varies from 
  as few as 5,000 to as many as 22,000.</p>
<p> Shoal bass are stronger than many other fish and that may be the cause for 
  their acrobatic leaps when caught on the end of a fishing line. This characteristic 
  is accounted for by the habitat in which this fish has evolved to survive. "The 
  shoal bass has to be strong to make a living," said Ager.</p>
<p> Despite their strength, shoal bass are one of the smaller bass species, averaging 
  lengths of a mere 9 to 12 inches, and an average weight of 8 ounces, said Jacobs. 
  Some individuals will reach 16 to 18 inches, however. </p>
<p> "Any larger than that and you're talking about a trophy fish," said Jacobs.</p>
<p> David Hubbard caught Georgia's state record shoal bass, an 8-pound, 3-ounce 
  fish, in the Flint on October 23, 1977. That fish was also the world record 
  for many years before being beat by Carl W. Davis who caught an 8-pound, 12-ounce 
  shoalie from the Apalachicola River in northern Florida on November 11, 1995.</p>
<p> Shoal bass are like other warmwater predators and are very versatile, feeding 
  on whatever is most abundant in that location or season. They typically feed 
  on a variety of other fish, invertebrates, and crustaceans. Young fish feed 
  mostly on insects, but once they reach 6 inches or larger, they begin diversifying 
  their diet.</p>
<p> "One misconception of anglers is that crayfish are real important because 
  anglers often find crayfish in the stomachs of the bass," said Ager. "The truth 
  is that crayfish just don't digest as quickly, so one found in a bass may have 
  been there for a week or more."</p>
<p> Steve Golladay with the Joseph W. Jones Ecological Research Center discovered 
  an abundance of crayfish in one of his studies on stomach contents of fish. 
  He compared different species of fish and found that the shoal bass consumed 
  more crayfish than the other species. He also found an abundance of a Dobson 
  fly larvae, which lives under rocks in shoals.</p>
<p> "Shoal bass are the largest predator on the shoals; they're unique in that 
  respect," said Burgess. "They are like the southern trout, found in riffle areas 
  that are more characteristic of trout streams in northern climates. The difference 
  is they grow larger than most trout."</p>
<h3> Comparisons to Other Bass </h3>
<p> Native bass species of the Apalachicola basin include the shoal, redeye (<i>Micropterus 
  coosae</i>), and largemouth (<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>) basses. The fourth 
  bass species to occur in the system is the introduced spotted bass (<i>Micropterus 
  punctulatus punctulatus</i>).</p>
<p> Despite the similarities in appearance between the bass species of Georgia, 
  there are several ways to distinguish between them. Shoal bass have been historically 
  confused with the redeye, even though they don't occur in the same rivers. Redeyes, 
  also known as Coosa bass, are only found in the Coosa River system. Still, anglers 
  have a tendency to call any fish sporting a red eye a "redeye."</p>
<p> "Traditionally everything has been called a redeye in the Chattahoochee," 
  said Jacobs. There is even a fish in the Savannah River system that is commonly 
  called a redeye. It may soon be designated as yet another species of bass that 
  most closely resembles a shoal bass. There's also a panfish in the mountains 
  known as a rock bass, which is called a redeye by some, said Jacobs.</p>
<p> Despite the variety of common names and the confusion it generates among anglers, 
  shoal bass are actually very different from redeyes. First of all, they don't 
  have the red brick coloration on the tail fins that is indicative of a redeye. 
  The tail fins of a shoalie are clear with a hint of green. Secondly, redeyes 
  are missing the dark spot at the base of the tail that is apparent on the shoal 
  bass. Redeyes, being the smallest of the black basses, are also smaller in size 
  than shoalies. </p>
<p> When compared to largemouths, the difference is in the fins, jaw, and eyes. 
  For one thing, shoal bass have smaller mouths. In addition, the dorsal fins 
  of the shoal bass are connected, unlike those of the largemouth, and their jaw 
  line stops before it reaches the eyes. Only the shoal bass has the red eyes. 
  The color patterns of the two fishes are also strikingly different. The largemouth 
  has a dark lateral bar across the body, while the shoal bass sports vertical 
  bars. Largemouths are predominately green, with white and silver accents, while 
  the shoal bass is much darker. Largemouths are also simply larger fish and are 
  found in different areas of the river, for the most part.</p>
<p> It is possible to turn up a largemouth every now and then in a shoal, however. 
  "The largemouth is not a real current fish. He's not going to fight the current 
  but will be found in a bend, in the slack water," said Jacobs.</p>
<p> Anatomically, the shoal bass is most like the spotted bass. Differences include 
  the typical absence of a tongue patch, a small spot of teeth that occur in the 
  middle of the tongue, in the shoal bass. (Variances do occur in this one characteristic, 
  as we found during our fishing trip on the Flint. One of the shoals we caught 
  had a tongue patch along with all of the other characteristics indicative of 
  a shoal bass.) Additionally, spotted bass are missing the characteristic dark, 
  vertical bars found on the shoal bass. </p>
<p> Spotted bass are not typically found in the same areas inhabited by shoalies 
  though they both favor similar habitats. Shoalies are thought to be the dominant 
  fish and typically don't share space with spotted bass. Spotted bass are also 
  larger fish, averaging 25 inches from head to tail.</p>
<p> In the Flint River, a bass pulled out of the river is one of two species, 
  a largemouth or a shoal bass, so the distinction should be easy to make. Above 
  Lake Lanier on the Chattahoochee River, a bass could be either a spotted or 
  a shoal.</p>
<h3> Fishing for Shoal Bass</h3>
<p> <img src="/georgia/flint_river/creature_feature/graphics/big_bass.jpg" width="300" height="197" align="right" border="2" alt="Kyle West proudly holds a prize shoal bass. Photo by Richard T. Bryant. Email richard_T_bryant@mindspring.com">Fishing 
  for shoal bass has become quite a popular sport. The shoals of the Flint are 
  hot spots for anglers, especially on weekends in the spring. Sprewell Bluff 
  State Park is one of the best fishing locations because of its easy access. 
  Big Lazer Creek Wildlife Management Area (WMA) is another. The Flint borders 
  one side of the WMA, and access is easy via the WMA road. In addition, the creek 
  on the WMA also has a good population of shoalies and is worth checking out. 
  It borders another side of the WMA for several miles. Big Lazer is not an optimum 
  location during low water situations or in the dead of summer when fishing is 
  not as good.</p>
<p> Most of the Flint's other shoal sections occur on private land. Anglers must 
  have permission to access the river from the land; however, they can fish those 
  sections if they're drifting the river. Yellow Jacket Shoals located between 
  Sprewell Bluff and Hightower Shoals is one of those areas, but the class III 
  and IV rapids in this area are not typically approached with an open-deck canoe. 
  The remote shoals are worth the effort it takes to reach them, however, for 
  some excellent opportunities to land a nice-sized shoalie. </p>
<p> Farther south is Snipe Shoals. The fishing rights to these shoals are leased 
  by Cane River Outfitters. Anglers must check in with the outfitters before accessing 
  this stretch of the Flint.</p>
<p> Another honorable mention in terms of shoals is located not on the Flint but 
  on the Chattahoochee. Factory Shoals found in Sweetwater Creek State Park is 
  a relatively unknown spot for catching a shoal bass. The creek feeds into the 
  Chattahoochee and has a nice population of shoalies.</p>
<p> "You'll catch probably as many spotted as shoals, but you will turn up some 
  shoal bass in these waters," said Jacobs.</p>
<p> While the shoals of the upper Flint receive the majority of fishing pressure, 
  fishing for shoalies on the lower Flint has picked up over the past three to 
  four years, reported Thomas. Even anglers from the Piedmont area have been traveling 
  south to sample the action. They're catching large fish, too, weighing 5 pounds 
  and up.</p>
<p> "The last couple of years starting with 1999, we've had good year classes. 
  Some of the difference may be due to supplemental stocking," said Thomas.</p>
<p> The lower Flint is the only section of river where shoal bass are stocked. 
  When WRD fisheries managers first began stocking the lower Flint, they alternated 
  each year between a section of river above and below Albany. They had hoped 
  to determine differences in the year classes between river sections, but the 
  big flood of 1994 wiped out their data. </p>
<p> During the last two years, WRD has concentrated its stocking efforts on a 
  32-mile section of river between Lake Blackshear and Albany. WRD is currently 
  conducting research to determine the contribution of stocked fish to the population. 
  Approximately 50,000 1- to 2-inch fingerlings are released each spring. The 
  fish are grown at the Cordele and Dawson warmwater fish hatcheries run by WRD.

<p> When fishing for shoal bass, the most common method is fly-fishing in shoal 
  areas. On the lower Flint, most anglers resort to a spinning rod, although fly 
  rods are gaining in popularity. Thomas says many of the fly-fishermen there 
  attempt to tie flies that resemble small crayfish. Spinning rods are effective 
  when using a combination of crayfish imitations, worms, and other lures.</p>
<p> April and May is the best time to fish for big fish. "It's the easiest time 
  to catch them," said Jacobs. "But water levels are often too high and too muddy. 
  You can get a lot of small fish in the summer, but you also get low water and 
  bright sunshine."</p>
<p> Our fishing efforts on our November trip were thwarted by sunny skies and 
  daylight hours. We fished from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. and had a difficult time 
  locating the fish and getting them to bite. Shoal bass tend to congregate under 
  rocks in the middle of the day to escape from the sun, making it difficult to 
  locate them and entice them to take a lure. </p>
<p> "A shoal bass holds tight against the rocks and avoids the light," said Jacobs. 
</p>
<p> In cases where they have the option, they also move into deeper waters, further 
  decreasing our odds of reaching them.</p>
<p> There is a minimum length requirement for shoal bass on the Flint River. All 
  shoal bass taken home from the Flint must be at least 12 inches. </p>
<p> When fishing for shoal bass, wading is probably the best method. A number 
  of anglers float the river when shoal bass fishing. For years, Jacobs, like 
  many others, thought you had to float the Flint to fish for shoalies. Wading 
  is actually more effective to fish in the rapids. When float fishermen hit the 
  shoals, they generally take their rods out of the water to maneuver themselves 
  through the rapids with their oars. They then put their fishing rods back in 
  the water when they clear the shoals. This process, while protecting them from 
  capsizing during the ride, results in them missing the majority of the fish 
  that are hanging out in the rapids. Anglers who are wading don't have that problem, 
  and they can easily access the rapids without racing past them and the fish.</p>
<p> Fishing the lower Flint requires other methods, due to the difference in habitat.</p>
<p> "It's such a different thing once you get on the lower waters," said Jacobs. 
  "You don't have wadeable shoals, and it's mostly boat fishing."</p>
<p> Fly fishermen are making their way into the lower Flint waters, though, and 
  taking advantage of the shoal bass fishery there.</p>
<p> The previous drought years may have had a small detrimental effect on the 
  shoal bass population. According to Ager, there have been less fish in the shoals 
  over the past few years. He attributes it to consecutive years of drought or 
  the "equivalent to a smaller river." One year of drought wouldn't have produced 
  such an effect, he said, but several years can.</p>
<p> Still, the opportunities to catch a shoal bass are very good. And the areas 
  they occupy on the Flint are stunning enough to warrant a trip, whether you 
  really want to catch a fish or not. </p>
<p> This newest of the black bass family with all of its unique characteristics 
  makes it the finest fish of the Flint and worth protecting for future generations.</p>
