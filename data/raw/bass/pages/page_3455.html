<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000"><strong><a name="Regardless">Regardless </a>of What TONY Tells The Fisherman Magazine, <br>
This fish was caught on one of the Many Charter Trips I ran on<br>
<big>The Jersey Giant</Big><br>
</strong><small>out of the Belmar Marina</small><strong> </strong><small>Basin</small><strong><br>
</strong> </font><strong><br>
This was a SPECIAL 12 hour 50 mile wreck trip I had set up. We were really looking for
Pollock on this trip but they were not to be found. We did hook up with some tremendous
Sea Bass and Ling Fishing. The Departure Time was 5:00 AM and the Weather was Calm but
Foggy, the first stop we were supposed to make was already occupied by another Boat so we
moved further Offshore. We anchored up in about 150 feet of water&nbsp; and started picking at the
Sea Bass and participating in the our Giant pass time. Fishing was good and all aboard
were hooking up and bringing in some nice fish, Even John Cicone&nbsp; and Hank were able
to catch fish. As we were really getting into our Pastime, we noticed Tony pulling in what
looked like an old Tire, He had also thought he had a tire or piece of the Bottom as he
was Cranking like Mad just to get the rig up to the surface. Low and Behold this Sea bass
comes flying out of the water and is being dragged on the surface. As we all start yelling
for Tony to take it easy, he realized that it was a fish and slowed down. When this fish
was boarded, the color of it was amazing, the Blue Hue and the Hump were Bright. After
admiring this beautiful fish, it was weighed on the Boat Scale. The fish had weighed in at
Over 8 and 1/2 pounds. John the Owner of the Jersey Giant Looked up the records for Sea
Bass and realized that this fish was a State Record for the 20 lb. Mono Class. <small><small>(Ask
Tony to tell you why he is holding that Pole in the Picture)&nbsp; </small></small>After
Docking Tony and I made our way to the Tackle Shop and had the Fish Officially weighed. I
found out then that unless one takes special precautions, that a fish naturally will lose
some weight. Although this fish lost about 6 oz's, It still was a RECORD for 20# Class
fishing. As we went to leave the Tackle Shop, Tony was informed that he would have to
LEAVE the Fish and a <font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000"><u><em>Line
Sample from The Pole He Had Caught it On</em></u></font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">. I believe Tony almost opted to say the heck with the record, in order to
bring this fish Home. Tony has been to many Dinners and Award Ceremonies due to this
record Breaking Fish! The Thanks that we received from Tony for all of this is His telling
a popular magazine that he had caught it on a Trip He had planned from work!!&nbsp; </font></p>
