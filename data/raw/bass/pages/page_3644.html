<h1>History of Giant Sea Bass Fishery</h1>

<h2>by Steven J. Crooke</h2>

<h3>California Department of Fish and Game</h3>

<p>Excerpted from:<br>
<i>California's Marine Resources and Their Utilization</i>.<br>
(Davis, University of California, 1992).</p>

<p> </center> Commercial fishing for giant sea bass (<i>Stereolepis
gigas</i>) in California has occurred since 1870 and a sport
fishery has existed since 1895. In 1982, the California State
Legislature <a href="laws.html">banned commercial fishing for
giant sea bass</a> (except for the current one fish per trip
tolerance for gill net boats), while the California Fish and Game
Commission has banned sport landings from California waters.
However, the Commission has allowed anglers fishing in Mexico to
land two fish per trip.</p>

<p> The commercial fishery fro giant sea bass initially targeted
southern Californian fish but moved south into Mexico as local
populations declined. Off Mexico, the fishery occurred along the
coast between Cape Colnett and Magdalena Bay as well as on the
offshore banks of lower Baja California. Early commercial
fishermen relied on hand lines to catch fish, but later shifted
to gill nets as the resources declined. Landings have ranged from
a high of 861,498 pounds in 1934 to a low of 3,666 pounds in
1983. During 1931, over 254,000 pounds were caught in California
waters, the highest year on record for the local fishery. Mexican
production reached 807,746 pounds in 1934, the highest year for
foriegn-caught landings. landing weights are for
&quot;cleaned&quot; fish, since commercial fishermen behead and
eviscerate the fish immediately after capture.</p>

<p> During the early years of the sport, most activity took place
at Santa Catalina Island. Anglers generally fished from small
charter vessels, but some fish were landed by beach fishermen.
most fish were taken incidentally in directed fisheries for other
species, although some anglers did target giant sea bass. Fishing
for giant sea bass was considered boring because bites were
infrequent. Since this outweighed the excitement of an
anticipated hook-up, directed effort on giant sea bass was small.</p>

<p> With the expansion of commercial passenger fishing vessel
(CPFV) fleet following World War II, sport fishing for giant sea
bass expanded to include all the offshore islands and banks, as
well as most of the mainland coast south of Point Conception.
Most fish were still taken incidentally to other species,
although some directed effort occurred during summer when giant
sea bass formed spawning aggregations.</p>

<p> With the advent of long range CPFV trips to Mexico, the sport
fishery moved south, much as the commercial fishery had done
earlier. During the late 1960's and early 1970's, long range
boats advertised summer &quot;black sea bass specials&quot; to
Mexico. They were very successful (50-100 fish per trip) until
the local stocks were reduced to a level where anglers no longer
found it worthwhile to fish for them.</p>

<p> Landings of giant sea bass from Mexican an California waters
reported to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) on
CPFV logs have varied between 13 and 816 fish per year. The
highest figure was recorded in 1973 during the &quot;black sea
bass special&quot; era, while the lowest landings were recorded
during 1983, the first full year of the moratorium. most fish
landed on CPFV's weighed less than 80 pounds, although fish over
500 pounds have been taken. Within California, the vast majority
of fish weighed less than 30 pounds, while those taken in Mexico
are in the 60 to 80 pound range.</p>

<p> Divers have played an active role in giant sea bass fishery.
Originally, they would free dive, but switched to SCUBA diving
after World War II. They were especially adept at exploiting
spawning aggregations, since skilled divers had no trouble
approaching the fish. Additionally, once they found a spawning
aggregation, some tended to return on a daily basis until most of
the fish had been taken.</p>

<h2>Status of Biological Knowledge</h2>

<p>Limited information exists about giant sea bass, as the
species has never been the subject of a direct study. The data
that exist have been collected in conjunction with other
investigations. One individual, the late John E. Fitch, is
responsible for most of the current biological knowledge.</p>

<p> Giant sea bass range from Humbolt Bay on the north to the tip
of Baja California on the south. They are also found in the Gulf
of California, more often in the northern half. Within
California, fish are commonly taken between Point Conception and
the Mexican border. Catches north of point Conception are rare.
Adults tend to prefer rocky bottom habitats located next to kelp
beds. They are also commonly found in 110 to 150 feet of water
adjacent to areas where the bottom drops away quickly. Juveniles
are usually found in and around kelp beds as well as sandy bottom
areas, generally at depths of 40 to 70 feet.</p>

environment</a></h5>

<p>Giant sea bass are the largest resident marine bony fish in
California. They grow to seven feet five inches in length. Fish
up to 563 pounds have been recorded from the sport fishery, and
commercial fishermen believe that 600-pound fish exist. They have
been reliably aged to 75-years old (a 435-pound specimen). The
age of the 563 pound fish was not determined, but may have been
90 to 100 years old.</p>

<p> </p>

<h5><a href="morph.html">the morphology of the giant sea bass</a></h5>

<p>Spawning takes place between June and September. Females start
to mature at seven to eight years of age and all are spawning by
the time they are 11 years old. Large females are capable of
producing enormous numbers of eggs. The ovaries of a 320-pound
fish contained an estimated 60 million eggs. While spawning,
large fish will form spawning aggregations and remain together
for one or two months. During this time they are especially
vulnerable to skin divers and less so to hook-and-line fishermen.</p>

<p> Small fish feed primarily on inshore species such as
anchovies, sardines, and squid. Larger fish also feed on these
species but their diet consists primarily of larger food
organisms. Pacific mackerel, bonito, ocean whitefish, midshipmen,
stingrays, white croaker, small sharks, crabs, spiny lobsters,
and mantis shrimp all have appeared in the stomachs of adult
fish. Predation on giant sea bass is confined to man, marine
mammals, and some of the larger sharks. Older fish usually are
heavily parasitized.</p>

<h2>Status of Population</h2>

<p>Giant sea bass populations off California, and probably those
off central and northern Baja California, appear to be depressed.
Because of this, giant sea bass cannot be taken off California by
recreational anglers. Commercial fishermen are limited to one
fish per trip if taken incidentally in gill or trammel net
operations. However, fish are still landed by sport anglers
fishing south of the border. Mexico has expressed an interest in
protecting giant sea bass. Legislation by Mexico could offer
total protection by fall of 1992.</p>

<p> Since 1983, sport anglers have reported catching and
releasing increasing numbers of giant sea bass. The trend appears
to indicate that juvenile fish are increasing in abundance and it
may soon be possible to reopen, strict size and catch limits
would be necessary to prevent overfishing. The minimum size limit
for giant sea bass should be 48 inches (60 pounds), the size at
which all females are spawning. Spear fishing for giant sea bass
should also be prohibited during the spawning season (June
through August).</p>

<p></center> Young giant sea bass in the 30 to 60 pound range
have proven to be particularly vulnerable to capture in nearshore
gill and trammel nets. Passage of recent State Constitutional
amendment prohibits these nets in southern California nearshore
waters after 1993 should help to conserve the sub-adult
population and may hasten the recovery of the giant sea bass
stock.</p>
