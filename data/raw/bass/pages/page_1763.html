            <p class="innerheaders"> <span class="innerheaders">I see that this 
              instrument has a magnificently carved lions-head for a scroll. What 
              is it?</span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> </span><span class="body">Yes 
              the scroll is absolutely magnificent. Yes the instrument as a whole 
              is truly mouth-watering in terms of its form, proportions and detail. 
              Yes this is indeed a truly glorious French instrument in every respect. 
              So stop keeping me in suspense - who do you think made it? Well 
              unfortunately our instrument is not labelled or dated so this is 
              not such an easy question to answer without a good deal of detective 
              work. Our first thoughts lent towards the merger of Parisian makers 
              - Gand and Bernadel &#8211; who worked around the third quarter 
              of the nineteenth century. Rather like a trademark - a detailed 
              and well-executed lions-head scroll adorns a high proportion of 
              Gand and Bernadel contrabass instruments. Now however we're pretty 
              sure that this instrument dates some time after their 21 year (1866-1887) 
              partnership and is made by one of their followers.</span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">How do you deduce this?</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> We have compared our instrument 
              to photos of a classic Gand and Bernadel instrument that is held 
              at the Paris Conservatoire de Musique (for whom Gand and Bernadel 
              were luthiers) and there are several stylistic differences - but 
              the main clues in ascertaining the period of our instrument can 
              be found on the peg box. Firstly this instrument was made as a four-string 
              instrument (By 1865 the use of the three string instrument in France 
              had almost completely faded away). Secondly the tuner-heads are 
              made from bakelite &#8211; an early form of brittle plastic - which 
              was first introduced around 1905. Thirdly our instrument received 
              a neck graft at some stage of it's life by a member of the Calow 
              family of Nottingham, England. We know this for sure &#8211; because 
              inside the peg box is the brand Calow, Nottingham. </span></p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> There were three members of the 
              Calow family strongly associated with bass making who lived and 
              worked in Nottingham. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Which one do you think it was who did the 
              neck graft?</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> According to The Universal Dictionary 
              of Violin and Bow makers by William Henley [Amati Publishing Ltd 
              1973]</span></p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">William Calow (1847-1910) &#8211; collected basses 
                and specialized in making them.</li>
              <li class="body"> Thomas Calow (1868-1905) &#8211; son and pupil 
                of William. Assisted father in repairing. Committed suicide at 
                37 by hanging himself with a bass string.</li>
              <li class="body"> Francis William Calow (1884-1925) - son, pupil 
                and successor of William. Many instruments stamped 'Calow Nottingham'</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> Although any of the three Calows 
              could in theory have executed the work on this instrument - on balance 
              - because of the use of a name brand and the extremely fine condition 
              of the instrument - one must favour the work as being down to Francis 
              William and estimate the instrument to be between 1910-20 when the 
              use of bakelite was much more common. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Interesting points to ponder or research</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body"> Re: Complication of date estimate - It is 
                known that many instruments emanating from the workshops of Gand 
                &amp; Bernadel were completed in both unvarnished and varnished 
                state and stored - unset-up. Some were set-up at a later date 
                - others were sold on to other shops or traders abroad.</li>
              <li class="body">Because this instrument is fitted with 
                a Calow neck graft and we know that Calow died in 1925 - we can 
                safely assume that the instrument has spent most of its life in 
                England. Could the instrument perhaps been made to order by one 
                of the Calows?</li>
              <li class="body">What is the average age of a bass requiring 
                a neck graft - 10yrs, 20yrs, 50yrs or more? What if a new instrument 
                had been fitted with a long (E-flat or E) neck and a player couldn't 
                get use it - he may only agree to purchase or use the instrument 
                on condition that the neck be changed. Hmm.</li>
              <li class="body">Re: Establishing a date by means of the 
                tuners. Bakelite was invented in about 1905 but an early celluloid 
                had already been in use since 1868.</li>
              <li class="body">Which workers were employed by Gand &amp; 
                Bernadel? Who succeeded Gand &amp; Bernadel?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="innerheaders">Instrument Description:</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> The model of this instrument looks 
              every bit as if it were a violin - only on a much larger scale. 
              The outline is near perfect in its symmetry. The highly figured 
              timber used for the two-piece back, ribs and scroll shows a flaming 
              that runs almost horizontally. The spruce table shows a wonderful 
              straight grain that narrows from a medium width at the edges to 
              fine at the table centre. Purfilling is - as one would expect - 
              precise. Varnish - a golden red-brown oil over a yellow ground - 
              with a slight craquelure to its surface is nothing short of spectacular. 
              </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Sound quality:</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> Understated - the model is good, 
              the arching is good, the thicknesses are good and by golly the sound 
              is good too. Projection and purity of sound with distinct tonal 
              qualities are definitely what this instrument are about.</span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Summary:</p>
            <p class="body"><span class="body"> With an instrument of this quality 
              - it will only be a matter of time before we see another example 
              and be able to pinpoint the exact maker. If you're an orchestral 
              player, a jazz player, a soloist, a collector or an investor seeking 
              a master-bass then look no further than this fine French instrument.
