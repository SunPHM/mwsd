The second part of this unique video focuses on Mel Russ wreck fishing for double-figure pollock and cod in the English Channel. There's plenty of action and a lot to learn as fish after fish hit small pirks and jelly worm. ‘Sea Angler - The Video!’ brings Britain's most successful sea angling magazine alive in your own home.<BR><B><BR><A HREF="javascript:top.newchoice('Sea Angler The Video','BFS009','','',12.99,1,0,0)"><IMG ID="Shop@ssistantInsertNewChoicePicture4.07" HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=52 SRC="./Buy_Direct_Button.gif" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=0  name=AC_INC4_261498></a><!-- Shop@ssistant InsertNewChoice 4.0 by Ingo Fischer (http://www.apollon.de) -->BFS009 &nbsp;  45 mins&nbsp; &nbsp; £12.99<BR><BR><BR><SPAN STYLE="font-size: small;">SEA ANGLER -  The Sequel!<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-size: x-small;">We did it and we'll show you how..</SPAN>.</SPAN><BR><IMG ID="Picture5" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=116 SRC="./seaanglersequel.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=12 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=0></B>The first Sea Angler video was such a soar-away success they produced another, ‘Sea Angler - The Sequel’, directed by television's John Wilson and supported by a star cast, including editor Mel Russ, the magazine's technical guru Neil Mackellow and our small-boat expert, Dave Lewis. This video is different from the last one in that it teaches you how to boat and shore fish through practical experience, rather than by direct tuition.<BR>So come and join the crew as they boat fish off the glorious Jersey coast for bass, black bream, turbot and ray, then switch to the rocks and floatfish for garfish.<BR>There's plenty of laughs, lots of action and mountains of on the spot instruction as rods bend and fish after fish smile for the camera!<BR><B><BR><A HREF="javascript:top.newchoice('Sea Angler The Sequel','BFS010','','',12.99,1,0,0)"><IMG ID="Shop@ssistantInsertNewChoicePicture4.01" HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=52 SRC="./Buy_Direct_Button.gif" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=0  name=AC_INC4_555498></a><!-- Shop@ssistant InsertNewChoice 4.0 by Ingo Fischer (http://www.apollon.de) -->BFS010 &nbsp;  60 mins&nbsp; &nbsp; £12.99<BR><BR><BR><IMG ID="Picture2" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=119 SRC="./Sea_Angler_Mastercast.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=12 ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=0><SPAN STYLE="font-size: small;">SEA ANGLER - Mastercast!</SPAN><BR></B><I>“You have never seen casting like this before, I promise!”</I> - <B>Neil Mackellow.</B> <BR>If you only ever buy one casting video, make sure it's ‘Mastercast!’  <BR>The thousands of readers who bought the hugely successful ‘Sea Angler: The Video’ have pleaded with Sea Angler Magazine to make a more in depth casting video. So the best tutors have produced the best casting video and here it is.<BR>Directed by John Wilson, it features Neil Mackellow demonstrating off-ground casting and all steps in between, right up to a full blooded tournament pendulum.  With the camera mounted on a high vantage point, look down on Neil as he performs cast after cast in fantastic slow motion.  From this unique angle you are able to see exactly how he handles the rod to produce those world-class casts.  He also strips a popular beach multiplier, showing in unique detail how to re-tune it for optimum performance on the beach with a combination of oils and brakes. Sponsored by Zziplex, ‘Mastercast!’ includes exclusive footage shot inside the Zziplex factory where we talk to Terry Carroll about the material and equipment used to make some of the best fishing and casting rods in the world. <BR><B><BR><A HREF="javascript:top.newchoice('Sea Angler Mastercast','BFS011','','',12.99,1,0,0)"><IMG ID="Shop@ssistantInsertNewChoicePicture4.02" HEIGHT=31 WIDTH=52 SRC="./Buy_Direct_Button.gif" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=0  name=AC_INC4_910498></a><!-- Shop@ssistant InsertNewChoice 4.0 by Ingo Fischer (http://www.apollon.de) -->BFS011 &nbsp;  60 mins&nbsp; &nbsp; £12.99<BR><BR><BR><SPAN STYLE="font-size: small;">SEA ANGLER - Cod!<IMG ID="Picture4" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=116 SRC="./Sea-Angler-Cod.jpg" VSPACE=0 HSPACE=12 ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER=0></SPAN><BR></B>Television personality John Wilson introduces the fourth Sea Angler video, bringing you the very best in cod fishing.<BR>In this hour-long special we show you how to catch the nation's favourite fish afloat and along the shore, using a variety of baits and methods that are guaranteed to bring you success.<BR>The action covers inshore dinghy fishing with Dave Lewis, who shows viewers how to up and downtide in fast currents with big flowing baits.&nbsp; Champion caster, Neil Mackellow, travels to Scotland to fish the Fifeness coast and explains what gear and bait you need to fish along the shore.<BR>Back afloat, editor Mel Russ goes cod fishing with jelly worms and scores as 15lb-plus fish come up through 200ft of water.
