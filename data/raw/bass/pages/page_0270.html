          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/Bass_Hobson.jpg" width="200" height="264" align="right" alt="Bass Hobson" hspace="20">Hi 
            everyone, my name is Bass Hobson and I'm a 17-year-old student at 
            Brighton Secondary College, Melbourne, Australia. I am writing this 
            piece to let you all learn a little more about this teenager who's 
            been sent off to the end of the earth. Going to Greenland is definitely 
            the chance of a lifetime and I'm really excited about having such 
            a contrasting and culturally enriching experience. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So how does a student from 
            a beachside suburb down under end up on an expedition in Greenland 
            &#151; of all places? I guess I owe it all to my biology teacher, 
            Miss Rosy Loro, who is both an amazing teacher and great friend. When 
            the organisers of the expedition asked all the schools in our region 
            to nominate students to apply, she put my name forward. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've always had a passion 
            for science, which is part of what they were looking for. My lifelong 
            ambition is to study medicine &#151; I think it stems from my love 
            for both people and the physical world. In secondary school I've taken 
            an active role in leadership endeavours and have had the great privilege 
            of being Form Captain, House Captain and a member of my college's 
            Student Representative Council. I'm also a member of the athletics, 
            swimming and cross-country teams, and I love tennis, running and skiing. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Applying for the expedition 
            meant filling out huge application forms and writing a two-page essay. 
            My parents and I attended an information evening where we were introduced 
            to the organising committee and to the teachers who would be leading 
            the expedition. Then it was back home for a nervous wait as to my 
            application results. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was tough wait. When 
            I received the news that I'd made it to the next round it was an absolute 
            relief. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next 
            Wednesday I would have to attend a panel interview, write an essay 
            on an unknown topic, and present a speech as to "What it means to 
            me to be an Australian". Geez! What the hell do you write for that? 
            So the computer became my new best friend, and for several days I 
            slaved over that bloody 5-10 minute speech. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That Wednesday was both 
            one of the best and worst days of my life. You see, you could not 
            possibly find another person in the entire world who is more utterly 
            afraid of public speaking than I. I walked into that interview with 
            sweaty palms and a quivering voice &#151; which somehow, with everything 
            I had, I managed to hide. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To my absolute surprise, 
            I tackled all three requirements with confidence and somehow withheld 
            the contents of my stomach. I came out smiling and strangely calm. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, on the Friday, I 
            was ushered into an office with Miss Loro and given the news that 
            put one of the biggest smiles on my face of all time. I was in!</font>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Then the preparations 
            started.</b> The eight students and three teachers on the expedition 
            were sent on a series of team-building activities. Firstly, there 
            was the high ropes course &#151; highly enjoyable, but inspiring many 
            of us to take out a will. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also went sailing and 
            rockclimbing, attended the <a href="http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/planetarium/">Planetarium 
            at scienceworks</a>, had sessions at <a href="http://www.dar.csiro.au/">CSIRO 
            Atmospheric Research</a>, and acquired our Level 2 first aid certificate 
            &#151; you know, for those sticky situations! </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="img/bassoutfit.jpg" width="225" height="382" align="right" hspace="20" alt="Marshmallow or Michelin?">One 
            of the more exciting pre-expedition trips was to the <a href="http://www.antdiv.gov.au/">Australian 
            Antarctic Division</a>, based near Hobart, Tasmania, where we were 
            fitted out with the polar gear that would protect us from the Arctic 
            weather. All I can say is, "Marshmallow Man" from Ghostbusters! </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We met with people who 
            had experienced exactly what we were about to, but at the opposite 
            end of the globe. There were biologists, physicists, geographers &#151; 
            who each had in their heads a bottomless pit of information about 
            the diverse aspects of polar research they had devoted their lives 
            to. Very inspiring. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dog sledges are the usual 
            form of transport in the region of Greenland where the expedition 
            is based, implying the need for both physical and mental fitness. 
            The idea of using this mode of travel really excited me &#151; however, 
            my New Year's resolution to exercise more seemed to lapse fairly quickly. 
            Will this be my undoing, whilst running after a speeding team of huskies 
            at minus 30 degrees? That remains to be seen!</font></p>
