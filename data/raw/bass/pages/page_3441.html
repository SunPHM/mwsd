<h2 align="center">Brazilian Aquaculture</h2>
<p align="justify">
Aquaculture in Brazil until recently has been of relatively little importance globally.  More recently, 
due to increasing demands on wild stocks of popular species, more attention has been turned to 
commercialise operations to meet local, and more recently, international demands. </p>
<h3 align="center">Amazonian Redtail</h3>
<p align="justify">The Amazonian Redtail, under massive pressure from wild capture fisheries was an ideal fish for 
consideration by the aquaculture industry.  <img src="cages5.jpg" align="right" alt="Cages">Culture of this species has largely been a success in some areas of the
Amazon region, alleviating pressure on wild stocks to such a degree that restocking programmes from the farm,
plus the availability of farmed product for local markets have both brought the fish back from 
the edge of extinction.  The species is farmed in earth pond, cage and extensive lake systems, offering flexible production options 
in a controlled system with no environmental impact.  In co-operation with fish farms in Brazil, Superfresh have been able to 
commercialise this species to a level which makes it available to a global market, offering a high quality 
sustainable product farmed without comprimising the species or its environment.</p><br><br>
<h3 align="center">Tambaqui</h3>
<p align="justify">Tambaqui farming has occurred across Brazil for many years now.  The fish are ideal for a farming environment, growing quickly in 
earth ponds or cage systems, to produce a great tasting, unique product. <img src="pond1.jpg" align="left" alt="pond"> Again, such farms, once controlled with correct management
will remove some of the pressure on wild stocks, and offer a product of consistent quality and flavour.  Farms under Superfresh are provided
with fry from hatcheries using hypothisation techniques, so giving year round production capabilities.  Growing on facilities are monitored regularly, 
ensuring the best water quality is available.  Consequently, there are no disease issues with Superfresh farmed tambaqui.  Using in house facilities, pellet formulation
optimises this species' unique flavour and texture.

<h3 align="center"><b>Sea Bass and Bream</b></h3>
Fresh farmed Sea Bass and Gilthead Bream are produced from our Aquaculture sites <img src="bassfarm2.jpg" align="right" alt="bass farm">
in Greece. the product is farmed to the highest standards in the crystal clear waters of the Aegean Sea.
