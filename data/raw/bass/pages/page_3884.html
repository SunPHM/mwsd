<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Since IUU fishing is only
worthwhile if a market exists for the product, the quantity of product
traded should provide an indication of the catch. However, the analysis
of trade in Patagonian Toothfish is complicated by a variety of factors.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="tooth3.jpg" HEIGHT=305 WIDTH=270 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Patagonian
Toothfish is traded under a variety of other names including Bacalao de
profundidad (Chile), Butterfish (Mauritius), Chilean Sea Bass (the USA
and Canada), Merluza negra (Argentina), Mero (Japan) and R&oacute;balo
(Spain). Moreover, some of these generic names are used to describe other
fish species. The variety of names can, deliberately or unintentionally,
allow Patagonian Toothfish to bypass regulatory measures and compromise
the accuracy of trade statistics. Even in those countries that have specific
trade codes for Patagonian Toothfish, the variety of trade names leaves
the way open for misclassification. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Other factors include the
lack of specific market codes in a number of significant trading countries,
the extent of re-exporting and the application of conversion factors for
various product forms. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Trade data are presented
for the period 1998-2000. Data prior to 1998 are considered too inaccurate
to allow meaningful analysis. The completeness of the data, while improving
with the introduction of the CDS and HCDCS codes, remains an impediment
to comprehensive trade analysis. It is expected that data provided by the
CDS will have a major impact on the availability of meaningful trade data
for Patagonian Toothfish in the future.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Imports</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Japan and the USA are recognized
as the largest consumer markets for Patagonian Toothfish with Canada and
the EU also significant. Patagonian Toothfish is a highly valued restaurant-quality
food fish that competes with Black Cod Anoplopoma fimbria (also known as
Sablefish) on the North American and Japanese markets. The price of Patagonian
Toothfish is sensitive to landings and changes in the price of Black Cod
as well as overall economic conditions in importing countries and relative
changes in Yen and USD exchange rates (ISOFISH, 1999). </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The average value (USD/kg)
of imports of Patagonian Toothfish into the major markets of Japan and
the USA varies considerably between the markets and inter-annually (<B><A HREF="table5.jpg" TARGET="new">Table
5</A></B>). However prices on both the Japanese and US markets have increased
in recent years. The recent increase in price is likely to reflect, at
least in part, the decline in supply of Patagonian Toothfish as IUU fishing
fell from the peak of the mid-90s. The average value of frozen fillets
into the USA increased by 85% between 1998 and 2000 and other frozen product
by 66% over the same period. The average value of Japanese imports of both
fillets and other frozen product peaked in 1999, but fell by around 13%
in 2000. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Canadian, EU, Japanese
and US markets imported a total of nearly 30 000 t of Patagonian Toothfish
products in 2000 (<B><A HREF="table6.jpg" TARGET="new">Table 6</A></B>).
Japanese imports comprised over 55% of the total. Frozen product, reflecting
the deep-sea nature of the fishing fleets involved in catching Patagonian
Toothfish, accounted for 97% of imports. Imports of fresh Patagonian Toothfish
into Canada and the USA consist largely of headed and gutted product (Anon.,
1999; Contreras, 2000). </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>CCAMLR Members provided 73%
of the imports of Patagonian Toothfish products into these markets in 2000.
Other significant suppliers included Belize, China, Mauritius, Namibia,
Portugal and the Seychelles. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>China has emerged as a significant
supplier of Patagonian Toothfish products to the Japanese and US markets.
These two markets imported over 3600 t of Patagonian Toothfish from China
in 2000, predominantly in the form of fillets (<B><A HREF="table6.jpg" TARGET="new">Table
6</A></B>). Japan imported two-thirds of the fillets, reflecting the presence
of a number of Japanese-owned processing plants in China. Since China is
not a known catching country, it is believed that its involvement is by
way of importing, processing and re-exporting Patagonian Toothfish. Available
trade data (<B><A HREF="table7.jpg" TARGET="new">Table 7)</A></B> demonstrate
that China imported product from Chile, Australia and France in 1999 and
2000. It is also understood that China imports Patagonian Toothfish from
Japan for processing and that this processed product is subsequently re-exported
back to Japan. It has not been possible to quantify the extent of this
re-export trade between Japan and China. As a result the trade analysis
may include some double counting of Patagonian Toothfish product between
these two countries. China's participation in the CDS should help to clarify
the extent and nature of this trade. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Exports </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The latest export data available
for this analysis are provided in <B><A HREF="table 7.jpg" TARGET="new">Table
7</A></B>. Of the main catching countries identified in <B><A HREF="figure2.jpg" TARGET="new">Figure
2</A></B>, export data for toothfish products were available to TRAFFIC
for Chile (at various levels of aggregation for 1998-1999), for EU Member
States (2000) and for Australia (1999 and 2000). </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Lack of resources precluded
investigation of the availability of toothfish export data from Argentina,
China, South Africa and Uruguay, and the acquisition of the most recent
trade data from Chile. However, a proportion of the trade by these countries
is, nevertheless, included in the analysis through the import statistics
of Canada, the EU, Japan and the USA. The data omitted relate only to exports
to markets other than these.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimating World Trade
</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimated world trade in
Patagonian Toothfish for the period 1998 to 2000 is presented in <B><A HREF="table8.jpg" TARGET="new">Table
8</A></B>. It is not possible to quantify the overall impact of the anomalies
in the trade analysis to determine whether the estimates are more likely
to under- or over-state world trade. On the one hand, re-exports and possible
over-estimation of green weight equivalents, particularly of &quot;other&quot;
Patagonian Toothfish products, are likely to bias the estimates upwards.
Conversely, estimates of world trade in this article are likely to understate
actual trade, to the extent that the available data used (Canadian/EU/Japanese/US
imports plus Australian/Chile/EU exports to other markets) exclude the
exports of countries such as Argentina and Uruguay to other markets. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Trade data for Patagonian
Toothfish continue to exhibit anomalies that impede the analysis and interpretation
of trade statistics. As an example Japanese import statistics for Patagonian
Toothfish indicate that 4 t of fillets were imported from Australia in
2000. Australian export statistics indicate that 223 t of fillets were
exported to Japan in February to December 2000, a discrepancy of 219 t
of fillets or nearly 500 t green weight. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Notwithstanding these anomalies
the green weight estimates of world trade in <B><A HREF="table8.jpg" TARGET="new">Table
8</A></B> show a decline in world trade in Patagonian Toothfish between
1998 and 1999 but an increase in 2000. The greater comprehensiveness of
the trade data in 2000 is at least partially responsible for this and makes
any trend difficult to identify. The Japanese and US import data are the
most consistent over the three-year period. Using the total imports of
these two markets the data suggest a significant drop between 1998 and
1999 but a levelling off at around 47 000-48 000 t in 1999 and 2000. Despite
a 12 000 t reduction in reported catch over those two years these markets
were able to maintain their imports at around the same total level. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimating IUU catch</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The difference between recorded
catch and recorded trade should give an indication of the extent of IUU
catch of Patagonian Toothfish. The total and conservative trade estimates
of IUU catch for 1998-2000 along with CCAMLR estimates of IUU landings
are presented in <B><A HREF="table9.jpg" TARGET="new">Table 9</A></B>.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The trade estimates of IUU
catch of Patagonian Toothfish indicate a significant drop in the estimated
IUU catch between 1998 and 1999 but an increase back to 1998 levels in
2000. The trade analysis suggests that IUU catch comprised around 57% of
the total trade in that year and is four times greater than the CCAMLR
estimate of IUU landings of Patagonian Toothfish. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Even a conservative estimate
of world trade, provided by imports to only the Japanese and US markets,
indicates that total quantities traded have approximated 47 000-48 000
t (green weight) in each of the last two years. This is far in excess of
reported catch levels and of particular concern given that reported catch
declined by 12 000 t between 1999 and 2000. This resultant shortfall in
supply would appear to have been compensated for by IUU catch. The conservative
estimate of IUU catch in 2000 is 21 500 t, adding more than 80% to reported
catch levels. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES
TO COMBAT IUU FISHING</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The principal international
legal instrument governing exploitation of fisheries is the 1982 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). A number of agreements
and plans have been developed since UNCLOS was adopted in an attempt to
clarify and expand on some of the provisions in the Convention. The issues
faced by CCAMLR and coastal States in dealing with IUU fishing were central
to many of these, including: </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>- the 1993 Code of Conduct
for Responsible Fisheries together with the 1993 Agreement to Promote Compliance
with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels
on the High Seas (the Compliance Agreement);</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>- the 1995 Agreement for
the Implementation of the Provisions of UNCLOS relating to the Conservation
and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks
(the Fish Stocks Agreement); and,</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>- the 2001 International
Plan of Action on IUU Fishing.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Compliance and Fish
Stocks Agreements</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Compliance Agreement,
an integral part of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries,
is particularly concerned to address monitoring, control and surveillance
(MCS) problems associated with fishing vessels operating under flags of
convenience in order to avoid compliance with applicable conservation and
management rules. A further five countries are required to accept before
the agreement comes into effect. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Fish Stocks Agreement
emphasizes the importance of regional fisheries management organizations
(RFMOs) in the sustainable management of fisheries resources, and strengthens
their jurisdictional scope, particularly with respect to RFMO non-Parties,
provided those non-Parties are Parties to the Fish Stocks Agreement itself.
A further two States are required to ratify or accede to the agreement
for it to come into effect. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>When in force these agreements
will, in theory, allow organizations such as CCAMLR the opportunity to
impose MCS schemes on Parties to those agreements that are not Parties
to CCAMLR. In practice, however, the relevant States may not be party to
either agreement (<B><A HREF="table2.jpg" TARGET="new">Table 2</A></B>).
However, the accession to and ratification of the Fish Stocks Agreement
by Mauritius and Namibia, respectively, is a positive sign. The entry into
force of the agreement would place them under an obligation to take measures
as port States &quot;to promote the effectiveness&quot; of CCAMLR's Conservation
Measures and gradually will help to close the avenues for the landing of
toothfish taken in violation of CCAMLR's conservation strategies. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Only eight CCAMLR Members
have ratified the Fish Stocks Agreement and eight Members have accepted
the Compliance Agreement. Only four Members have done both (<B><A HREF="table2.jpg" TARGET="new">Table
2</A></B>).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>International Plan of
Action (IPOA) </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The threat posed by IUU fishing
has been recognized internationally with the adoption in March 2001 of
an IPOA on IUU Fishing by the United Nations FAO's Committee on Fisheries
(FAO, 2001b). The IPOA outlines measures for exercising flag State responsibility,
the use of port and market measures and sanctions to control the actions
of those involved in IUU fishing. Adoption of the IPOA, which will be used
as the blueprint for action against IUU fishing, is a positive move. It
is disappointing, however, that the plan falls well short of expectations
in relation to port State measures and market-related measures. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The IPOA places the onus
on port States to &quot;have clear evidence&quot; that a vessel has been
engaged in IUU fishing activity. This outcome reverses the burden of proof
that was initially envisaged during the plan's drafting. For countries
that benefit from the Patagonian Toothfish fishery only through the commerce
that arises from being a port State, the IPOA provides little incentive
to insist on vessels providing, for example, satellite positioning evidence
of where the fish was taken. For those port States, particularly those
with limited surveillance and enforcement resources, that do wish to refuse
access to IUU vessels the burden of proof is very high. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>The agreed text on market-related
measures effectively relegates them to measures of last resort and denies
their legitimate role in fisheries management and conservation. The need
for consistency with WTO rules is acknowledged and, as has been demonstrated
by the CDS, is achievable. However, the IPOA introduced criteria, over
and above those established by the WTO, requiring that market measures
be implemented only in &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; and only where
&quot;other measures have proven unsuccessful&quot;. The plan caters for
those who wish to defer the introduction of such measures. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="helvetica,arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Furthermore the IPOA has
missed the opportunity to take a strong stance against the apparent trend
towards the use of charter vessels in IUU fishing. This practice involves
a country allowing its nationals to charter foreign flagged vessels. The
country benefits financially through increased catch while incurring no
responsibility for, or control over, the activities of these vessels. </FONT></FONT></P>
