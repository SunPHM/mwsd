</center>
<font face=arial size=2 color=black><font size=4>B</font>elow
is a picture of a 'Spirit of Tasmania' passing through Port
Phillip heads on the date on the picture, while on a daylight
crossing. It was recorded by one of the four <A
HREF="http://www.portofmelbourne.com/shipping/webcams/ptlon_cam.asp">
<font color=black>WebCams</font></A> at Port
Lonsdale Lighthouse. A view of Point Lonsdale lighthouse and Port
Phillip Heads is in the second picture below. This entrance to Port
Phillip Bay from Bass Strait, part of which can be seen on the right of
the second picture, is recognized as being capable of becoming one of the
most dangerous sections of water in the world.
The water depth, changes dramatically between the Port Phillip
Bay and Bass Strait, and fast flowing tides over the uneven seabed
between the deep and shallower water, combined with bad
weather can create very dangerous conditions.

There is a long list of
<A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/~oceans1/portphillip-main.html">
<font color=black>shipwrecks</font></A> which have occurred there.
Tidal flow in and out
of Port Phillip Bay is very strong when at its peak, and combined with
gale force winds which occur, particularly on the darkest of nights,
this stretch of water is easily turned into a navigational nightmare
for those unfamiliar. Ships sailing in or out of the Bay with
the tide in their favour, can appear as if to moving really swiftly,
while some sailing in or out against the tide can sometimes appear to
be, practically not be moving. A pilot vessel is based at nearby Queenscliff
and transfers pilots to incoming ships and picks them up from outgoing
ships. Transfers are made a few miles or so out into Bass Strait.
In the second picture, a hill called Arthurs Seat a little over 1,000 feet
high, can be seen in the distance in the left. The deeper shipping channel
which most ships navigate, heads towards this, and then a sharp turn to
port is made (about&nbsp;90&nbsp;degrees) before heading for Port
Melbourne. (From the Heads to the top of the bay is some 42
nautical&nbsp;miles).
<!--
Across 'the&nbsp;Rip' in both pictures, can be seen Point Nepean
which is at the end of the Mornington Peninsula. The Point Lonsdale
Lighthouse is on the Bellarine Peninsula.
<A HREF="http://www.searoad.com.au"><font
color=black>Passenger/Vehicle&nbsp;Ferries</font></A>
from nearby Queenscliff, connect the both Peninsulas. Crossings take
about 45 minutes between Queenscliff on the Bellarine Peninsula, and
Sorrento on the Mornington. It is about a five
hour drive around Port Phillip Bay betweem Queenscliff and Sorrento
otherwise, with Melbourne traffic having
to be contended with. The&nbsp;ferries
are an interesting and relaxing way
to relax, pass time and gain appreciation for the area. The same can be
said for another attraction operating from
Queenscliff; the <A HREF="http://www.bpr.org.au"><font

of Tasmania</A> took over in 1959,
Taroona provided generally, a twice weekly return passenger service
across Bass Strait between Melbourne Victoria, and Tasmania. Ports in
Tasmania it called at, were Burnie, Devonport and Beauty Point - in the
Tamar River some 30 miles from Launceston.&nbsp; Taroona, was built in
Glasgow in 1934 by Alexander Stephen &amp: Sons,
and commenced its time on Bass Strait in 1935 replacing the
<A HREF="Shipping.htm#OONAH">Ooonah</A>.&nbsp; It was of 4,286 tons with
twin steam turbines. Taroona berthed regularly at Princess Pier at Port
Melbourne but also occasionally used Station Pier -- both at the northern
end of Port Philip bay - as in the picture above which was taken at
Station Pier -- and North wharf in the Yarra river. Taroona
was used as a troop ship during World War and ventured at least as far
north as New Guinea. (See the link to further information - near the
bottom of this page). It was a dark green ship with a yellow band around.
Motor cars were lifted into two holds for transportation, using the two
on board cranes.&nbsp; Vehicles were also carried as deck cargo near the
back of the ship in busy periods. Taroona could turn and berth of its own
accord. Tugs were used only on rare occasions in bad weather and in
confined berths such as in the Yarra river.&nbsp; Recalled on one occasion
for example, is that the steam tug "James&nbsp;Paterson" of about 1900
vintage, assisted it to turn when sailing from 17&nbsp;North wharf.&nbsp;
As well as the two anchors up front, it also had an anchor
at&nbsp;its&nbsp;stern.

of Tasmania, often called the "POT" - was owned and operated
by the Australian National Line.&nbsp; The 230 miles between
Melbourne and Devonport, over
which the ship sailed three return trips per week was appropriately
named the "Searoad".
This was along Port Phillip Bay, over Bass Strait and along the
Mersey River at Devonport to it's other specially constructed berth.
At the time of introduction in 1959, it was reportedly
the longest drive-on drive-off service in the world.&nbsp; The
Princess of Tasmania was 4,619 tons and carried 334 passengers, 178 in
cabins and 156 in lounge chair type accomodation. The seating
accomodation was in three sections,
Two of these were situated -- one on each side 
of the funnel, while a bigger saloon was situated just behind
the front full width deck. It was built at the State Dockyard at
Newcastle New South Wales and had a draught of 15 feet which allowed it
to use the more direct shallow channel at the southern end of Port
Phillip bay to and from the heads (as did Taroona),
which saved considerable time and distance. It also carried some
100 cars and caravans plus commercial vehicles and mail van.&nbsp;
It was a twin screw motor vessel, and had four Ruston engines which
according to information at hand, provided 2,880 horsepower,
for all services including the side thrust bow
propeller which was&nbsp;unique&nbsp;at&nbsp;that&nbsp;time.

which originally plied between Sydney and Hobart Tasmania
three times every two weeks for seven years.
It had a gross tonage of 12,037 tons and was 445 feet in length,
and was the largest vessel of this
type in the world when built while its route was one of the longest
open water routes in the world for a vessel of this type.
It was built at the Cockatoo
Island Dockyard as ship number 220, for the government owned Australian
National Line (ANL). Construction started on September&nbsp;11&nbsp;1962.
It was launched on January&nbsp;18&nbsp;1965, and was completed on
January&nbsp;8&nbsp;1965.
It was transferred to the Melbourne to Devonport run in 1972. Original
passenger capacity was 250 in cabins but capacity was
increased to some 450, with the addition of about 200 seats for the
Melbourne - Devonport overnight service.
It could take about 158 vehicles including many semi trailers.
The 'Empress' was replaced by the Abel Tasman.
It was sold and renamed <i>Royal&nbsp;Pacific</i>.&nbsp; and 
sank in the Malacca Strait, in 1991 after colliding with

Tasman was built in West Germany in 1975. It was renamed Abel Tasman
before commencing running across Bass Strait for its new owners - the
Tasmanian Transport Commission in July 1985.
It was a twin screw, roll-on roll-off
passenger and road vehicle ferry with hydraulic operated bow doors
and stern doors which enabled fast loading and unloading. Bridge height

17m (metres) and the Load Draft was 6.19m. Gross Tonnage (volume)
was 19,212 tonnes while the load weight was 12,128 tonnes. Vehicle deck
capacity was 234 car equivalents&nbsp;/&nbsp;44.61m container equivalents.
It had two main diesel engines each with 16 cylinders, and each developing
10,400 horsepower giving a total of 20,800. Propellers were four blade
variable pitch at 242&nbsp;rpm. through two reduction gears and two
switchable clutches. Each main engine drove a shaft generator each
being of 1125kva. In addition, there were four diesel alternators - each
1160&nbsp;hp at 900&nbsp;rpm&nbsp;@&nbsp;1000kva, and one diesel
alternator&nbsp;@&nbsp;310hp 1,800rpm&nbsp;@&nbsp;225kva.
There were two bow thrust propellers&nbsp;@&nbsp;11 tonnes.
Stabilising plant - 2 fins each seven square metres, 5 metres long.
Other information is as follows: 1 electro hydraulic twin steering gear,
twin rudders. Car platform deck (raisable) throughout vehicle deck
including fore and aft tilt ramp decks. 10 motor life boats
2&nbsp;@&nbsp;60 persons. 8&nbsp;@&nbsp;83&nbsp;persons. 21 liferafts,
