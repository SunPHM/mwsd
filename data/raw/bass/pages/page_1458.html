<H1>AXON Neural Guitar MIDI Converter For Guitar And Bass</H1>

Terratec bought the rights to AXON in 2004.

<H2>AXON realizes the dream ... finally &quot;REAL-TIME&quot; MIDI for
guitar and bass</H2>

<P><IMG src="i/p7062h.jpg" ALT="cover" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=300 WIDTH=218 ALIGN=RIGHT>
</P>

<H2>FASTER</H2>

<P>With the AXON, Blue Chip has introduced a new technology making a <B>&quot;GUITAR
MIDI CONTROLLER &quot; </B>for lead and bass guitar. This is the first
product that will allow a bass player to use his own instrument. Usually
MIDI controllers will recognize analog waves. <B>However, the AXON recognizes
the picking transient. Using a neural network it can determine pitch and
tone characteristics from the picking transient. </B>This quick recognition
system allows the guitar player to make fast moves, while the MIDI sound
will follow, virtually in real-time. </P>

<H2>BETTER</H2>

<P>The AXON is the first guitar MIDI Controller that will work for all
kinds of electric and acoustic guitars and for bass as well (metal strings).</P>

<P> <B>Better means more precise tracking because the AXON is completely
digital. </B>This system double-checks the pitch and the character of each
string separately. </P>

<H2>SMARTER</H2>

<P>The question remains, how smart can the AXON be? Will it recognize personal
style of the guitar player? It will! The neural network is trained for
&quot;real-time&quot; tracking.</P>

<P> In this way, it becomes possible to control sounds via MIDI as if they
were coming from the guitar itself. We call it smarter, because it really
does what the guitar player wants it to do. <B>The AXON method </B>(patented)
with its premier features of rapid sound recognition, Bass-to-MIDI, Pick
Position and Pick Control <B>has generated a new age in guitar playing.</B>
</P>

<H2>MORE FLEXIBLE</H2>

<P>In the past, MIDI guitar controllers could send pitch bend data only.
Due to AXONs innovative technology the picking position can be used either
to switch from one MIDI sound to another or to continously change the value
of a MIDI controller message.</P>

<P> </P>

<P>Additionally, a mono signal source can be connected to the AXON and
this signal can be converted into MIDI information.</P>

<P> The <B>MONO input </B>of the AXON can be used for all kinds of guitars
with monophonic pickups. Also microphones as well as any other monophonic
audio signals will work with this input. </P>

<H2>EASIER</H2>

<P>Instead of suffering from carrying a lot of equipment throughout the
world, you can attach an embedded GM sound module into the AXON NGC 60
or the NGC 77.</P>

<P> The result is not only an extremely powerful MIDI controller, but also
an excellent sound module on board.</P>

<H2>AXON NGC 60/77 </H2>

<H3>MIDI for GUITAR and BASS </H3>

<H3>Now with a mono input </H3>

<P>Now the world of MIDI can be yours. Make your own MIDI recordings and
arrangements. Use the various sounds MIDI offers you through keyboards
and sound modules, whether you like Bluegrass, Country, or Rock n Roll.
Use a sequencer and play your own backgrounds, track-by-track.</P>

<P> Unlike other equipment, which can quickly become obsolete, the AXON
is software based and can easily be upgraded by simply changing an EPROM.
The NGC60/77 will provide many years of service. Its comfortable operation
and preset functions will make you feel at ease instantly. No matter what
kind of guitar you play (lead, bass, acoustic), the AXON offers you the
world of MIDI. </P>

<P>The MONO Input allows you to control your Synthesizer, Keyboard or Sampler
with any monophonic audio signal.</P>

<P> This means that you can plug a microphone into the NGC 60/77 and control
your MIDI devices with a saxophone, flute or other acoustic instrument.
</P>

<P>Since the AXON is also suitable for the bass guitar, you can plug your
bass directly into the MONO Input. This allows the use of the bass monophonically
without the use of the Interface.</P>

<H1>AXON PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES</H1>

<H2>AXON NGC 77</H2>

<P><IMG src="i/p7062.jpg" ALT="AXON  NGC 77" HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=832 ALIGN=RIGHT>
This unit allows the combination of string, fret and pick splits as well
as the hold function. The NGC-77 enables you to assign 13 different parts
on your guitar. A further innovation is the pick control function. With
this function, you can send separate control messages to each one of the
13 parts. No other device allows you such possibilities. For simpler applications
the SCRATCH mode is available </P>

<H2>AXON NGC 60 </H2>

<P><IMG src="i/p7064.jpg" ALT="AXON  NGC 60" HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=830 ALIGN=RIGHT>
Fast and simple operation are the key words for the NGC-60. This unit maintains
the interlocking menus of the NGC 77. However, al functions are on one
level. With the exception of combining multiple splits, the NGC-60 is identical
to the NGC-77. The NGC-60 includes the possibility of assigning the Hold
Pedal to one of the 128 MIDI controllers. In addition to calling up the
conventional sustain function, you can 'also activate Portamento or even
echo. The buttons of the guitar interface are included in this operation.
You can effortlessly change preset sounds from your guitar interface. </P>

<P>The tuning aid can always be activated. The horizontal LED line clearly
shows the exact tuning and can be seen from a long distance. Combined with
the optional sound module SB-676, you are well prepared for live pertormances.</P>

are available now as an option for the AXON. You can immediately benefit
from the 128 best sounds in connection with the AXON.</P>

<P> In addition, MIDI IN places the whole functions of a MIDI sound expander
at your disposal.</P>

<P> GUITAR TO MlDl Converter, GUITAR SYNTHESIZER as well as a sound module
are now combined in one device. You can get this innovation at a price
that will positively surprise you...
