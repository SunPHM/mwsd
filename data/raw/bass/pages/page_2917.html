      <h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/ner.html#george">LAKE GEORGE</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Lake George is one of the premier bass fishing lakes 
      in central Florida. It is the second largest lake in the state (46,000 
      acres), and is 18 miles northwest of Deland and 29 miles east of Ocala.<br>
      <br>
      Lake George is one of the many natural lakes on the St. John’s River. It 
      has extensive vegetation that provides excellent habitat for bass. Wade 
      fishing in eelgrass, with plastic worms fished on the surface, and other 
      top water artificial lures, is productive. Fishing with live shiners is an 
      excellent method for catching trophy bass during the spring spawning 
      season.<br>
      <br>
      Hot spots on the lake include Juniper, Salt and Silver Glen spring runs on 
      the western shoreline. In winter and early spring, look for bass to 
      congregate at the jetties on the south end of the lake. Additionally, 
      casting deep-diving crank baits is productive near old dock structures 
      along the northeast shore and off Drayton Island.<br>
      <br>
      There are many fish camps on the St. Johns River just north and south of 
      Lake George; however, the only one located on the lake itself is the Pine 
      Island Fish Camp. There is one public boat ramp with limited parking on 
      the south end of the lake off Blue Creek Lodge Road, located north of S.R. 
      highway 40. A fishing pier is also located along the east side of the lake 
      at the end of Nine Mile Point Road.<br>
      <br>
      Due to low mercury levels in this lake, women who are pregnant or may 
      become pregnant, and nursing mothers should follow EPA guidelines and eat 
      no more than 8 ounces of bass in a week’s time. Children under age 10 
      should eat no more than 3 ounces of bass in a week’s time. All others are 
      not advised to limit consumption of largemouth bass.<br>

      in 1987, the Stick Marsh/Farm 13 Reservoir is synonymous with trophy bass 
      fishing. This 6,500-acre reservoir near Fellsmere, west of Vero Beach, 
      became one of the hottest bass lakes in the country during the past 
      decade. FWC biologists predict a continuation of excellent bass fishing in 
      the upcoming years. Electrofishing samples in 2001 and 2002 indicated good 
      reproduction and growth of bass in the reservoir. The winter/spring 2001 
      angler survey produced the highest total angler effort on record for 
      largemouth bass since 1994. During this period, anglers caught 65,943 
      largemouth of which 451 trophy bass (8 lbs or larger) were caught and 
      released.<br>
      <br>
      Anglers can locate bass throughout the reservoir among a variety of 
      habitats; including woody stump fields, submerged canals and hydrilla. 
      Plastic worms, spinner baits, crank baits, soft jerkbaits, and topwater 
      propeller baits are effective. Wild golden shiners are the top choice for 
      anglers looking to catch a trophy fish.<br>
      <br>
      Due to low mercury levels in this lake, women who are pregnant or may 
      become pregnant, and nursing mothers should follow EPA guidelines and eat 
      no more than 8 ounces of bass in a week’s time. Children under age 10 
      should eat no more than 3 ounces of bass in a week’s time. All others are 
      not advised to limit consumption of largemouth bass. NOTE: Since this lake 
      is catch-and-release, only the consumption advisory should have no impact 
      on anglers.<br>
      <br>
      The regulation for largemouth bass is catch and release. There is
      a two-lane <a href="../ramps/so-ramps.html#197">boat
      ramp</a>, paved parking lot, picnic pavilions and rest rooms. No
      gasoline, food, ice or other facilities are available on site.&nbsp; 
      This area is part of the St. Johns Blue Cypress Management Unit, see

      <h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/ner.html#tohopeka">WEST LAKE TOHOPEKALIGA</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Bordering the city of Kissimmee to the south is the 
      18,810-acre West Lake Tohopekaliga.<br>
      Tohopekaliga has long been a popular bass fishing lake for both 
      recreational and tournament anglers. In recent years, both Bass Anglers 
      Sportsmen Society (B.A.S.S.) and Forrest L. Wood (FLW) bass tournaments 
      have been held out of the Kissimmee <a href="../ramps/ne-ramps.html#125">
      lakefront park</a>. Winning weights are routinely in the 18-to 25-pound 
      range. To date, the largest bass documented from the lake weighed 17.10 
      pounds.<br>
      <br>
      Flipping plastic worms, crayfish and lizards in shoreline vegetation is a 
      common technique among successful anglers. Casting Carolina- or 
      Texas-rigged plastic worms, jerkbaits, spinnerbaits or top-water propeller 
      baits in these areas is also popular. Anglers fishing live golden shiners 
      account for some of the largest bass caught from the lake.<br>
      <br>
      A planned lake draw down was underway on Lake Toho during 2004. Fishing 
      should be outstanding due to the effect of concentrating fish into a 
      smaller-sized lake. The lake was scheduled to reach the extreme low pool 
      lake level (49 feet NGVD) by February 15, 2004. The lake will remain at 
      this elevation until June 1, 2004 when refill begins. Lake Toho should be 
      back to normal low pool (52 feet NGVD) by September 1, 2004 with average 
      rainfall. From January 5, 2004 through September 1, 2004, there will be a 
      catch-and-release (no harvest) regulation in effect for largemouth bass on 
      Lake Toho.<br>
      During the lake drawdown, boat access will be limited to the following:<br>
      <br>
      Southport Park (south on 17-92, 10 miles south on Pleasant Hill Rd, left 
      on Southport Rd for 6 miles) 2001 E. Southport Road, Kissimmee FL 34746

      Saint Cloud, FL 34772 (407) 892-8795. <br>
      <br>
      All of these access points are on Lake Tohopekaliga, and from that point 
      you can boat all the way to the Gulf of Mexico and even further south to 
      the Atlantic Ocean!<br>
      <br>
      Due to elevated levels of mercury in this lake consumption of largemouth 
      bass should be limited by women of childbearing age and children under age 
      10 should not eat more than 8 ounces of bass over a 4-week period. All 
      others should limit consumption of bass from these areas to no more than 8 
      ounces a week.<br>

      <h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/ner.html#rodman">RODMAN RESERVOIR</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Rodman Reservoir, east of Gainesville and south of 
      Palatka, covers 9,500 acres of prime largemouth bass habitat. Since its 
      creation in 1968, Rodman Reservoir has been known for trophy largemouth 
      bass. The state’s largest bass of 2000, 15 pounds and 17 pounds, came from 
      the reservoir during March. Much of the largemouth bass fishery’s success 
      is due to abundant habitat in the form of stumps and aquatic vegetation 
      and periodic drawdowns. Strong year classes of largemouth bass are 
      produced following drawdowns, which allow a higher percentage of fish to 
      reach trophy sizes.<br>
      <br>
      Largemouth bass are most active during cooler months. Anglers targeting 
      trophy largemouth bass use live golden shiners, either floated under a 
      cork or free-lined. Most big bass are caught in the pool area, known as 
      the “stump fields,” along the river channel. However, many trophy bass 
      come from the area between Cypress Bayou and Kenwood Landing, including 
      Orange Springs. Successful anglers use artificial baits, such as 
      deep-diving and lipless crank baits, spinner baits and soft plastics. 
      Access to Rodman is available at several locations. Among the most popular 
      is Eureka east and west off C.R. 316, Rodman Recreational Area west of 
      S.R.19 and Orange Springs Recreational Area, Cypress Bayou (Paynes 
      Landing) and Kenwood Landing off S. R.315.<br>
      <br>
      Due to low mercury levels in this lake, women who are pregnant or may 
      become pregnant, and nursing mothers should follow EPA guidelines and eat 
      no more than 8 ounces of bass in a week’s time. Children under age 10 
      should eat no more than 3 ounces of bass in a week’s time. All others are 
      not advised to limit consumption of largemouth bass.<br>
      <br>

      <h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/swr.html#tarpon">LAKE TARPON</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Lake Tarpon is a 2,500-acre lake near Tampa/St. 
      Petersburg in Pinellas County. This lake has consistently produced high 
      quality bass for years. Most fish range from 12 to 16 inches long; 
      however, quality and trophy fish are also present in good numbers. 
      Biologists have observed anglers catching upwards of 20 fish, including an 
      occasional 10-pounder.<br>
      <br>
      Anglers are most successful flipping or pitching plastic worms along canal 
      and bulrush edges. Offshore bass fishing is productive for anglers who 
      fish around ledges, humps, coontail, and eelgrass beds. Popular lures 
      offshore include shad-imitating jigs, crankbaits, jerkbaits and topwater 
      baits. Fishing with wild shiners and live shad is also effective.<br>
      <br>
      There are two public boat ramps within county parks. Anderson Park boat 
      ramp is on the west shore, off U.S. 19. Chestnut Park boat ramp is on the 
      east side of the lake, off C.R. 611. Some bank access is available in both 
      parks. Boardwalks and piers serve as excellent fishing locations.<br>
      <br>
      Due to elevated levels of mercury in this lake consumption, of largemouth 
      bass should be limited by women of childbearing age, and children under 
      age 10 should not eat more than 8 ounces of bass over a 4-week period. All 
      others should limit consumption of bass from these areas to no more than 8 
      ounces a week.<br>

      (Lake Walk-In-Water)</span></h3>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font><span style="font-family: Arial">Lake 
      Weohyakapka, commonly known as Lake Walk–in-Water, is a 7,532-acre water 
      body, south off S.R. 60, south of Orlando and east of Lake Wales. The lake 
      has a national reputation as an outstanding spot to catch largemouth bass. 
      Anglers frequently catch up to 25 bass a day with several ranging from 
      four to eight pounds. Weohyakapka also produces many trophy bass exceeding 
      10 pounds each year. Last year, Walk-in-Water anglers entered 130 bass 
      with a qualifying weight of eight pounds in FWC’s Big Catch Program. A 15- 
      to 24-inch slot limit regulation with a three-bass daily bag limit is in 
      place to help maintain quality bass fishing. Anglers may keep three bass 
      per day, either under or over the protected slot range, of which only one 
      bass greater than or equal to 24 inches is allowed.<br>
      <br>
      The best technique to catch trophy bass is to drift live wild shiners over 
      hydrilla weed beds in the northern half of the lake. Hydrilla can pop up 
      anywhere in the lake, so time spent looking for smaller, lesser known 
      pockets may be rewarding. Jerkbaits, lipless rattling crankbaits, and 
      plastic worms also produce bass in areas of offshore hydrilla. Topwater 
      lures are productive, particularly chuggers or walk-the-dog type baits. 
      Although topwater baits catch fish throughout the year, summer months 
      offer the best action when schools of bass roam deep-water areas. Flipping 
      soft plastic baits in the bulrush and behind cattails in the northern and 
      eastern areas of the lake also works well January through March. This 
      technique is effective for smaller bass, but the larger females spend the 
      majority of the year in offshore hydrilla beds.<br>
      <br>
      A public ramp is located on Boat Landing Road, which runs east off of 
      Walk-in-the-Water Road; just a few miles south of S.R. highway 60. There 
      is little access for bank fishing on the lake.<br>
      <br>
      Due to elevated levels of mercury in this lake consumption of Largemouth 
      bass should be limited by women of childbearing age and children under age 
      10 should not eat more than 8 ounces of bass over a 4-week period. All 
      others should limit consumption of bass from these areas to no more than 8 
      ounces a week.</span></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/swr.html#istokpog">LAKE ISTOKPOGA</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Bass anglers who fish the Kissimmee Chain of lakes 
      to the north and Lake Okeechobee to the south often overlook 28,000-acre 
      Lake Istokpoga. Situated in Highlands County between U.S. 27 and U.S. 98 
      south of Sebring, Istokpoga is the fifth largest natural lake in Florida 
      with an average depth of only six feet. Anglers frequently catch bass up 
      to eight pounds with many over 10 pounds. An angler caught a 16-pound bass 
      in March 1998.<br>
      <br>
      Bass fishing is excellent throughout the year. From January through April, 
      bass spawn in bulrush and other vegetation along shallow-water areas 
      enhanced during the 2001 drawdown and around the lake’s two islands (Big 
      Island and Bumblebee Island). Flipping soft plastics in bulrush patches 
      and in pockets of submerged vegetation can be productive during the 
      winter. In spring and summer, topwater lures and jerkbaits worked over the 
      top of hydrilla and pondweed in the south half of the lake are often 
      successful. Weedless spoons tipped with grub tails and spinnerbaits fished 
      over pondweed south of Bumblebee Island are deadly on bass during early 
      morning. Rattling lures (silver, gold, and “Tennessee Shad” are excellent 
      colors) also can be effective during summer and fall as baitfish school in 
      open water areas along the north end of the lake. April and October are 
      the best months for anglers looking for cooler weather and lots of bass. A 
      live shiner fished a few feet under a popping cork is the most reliable 
      bait for catching trophy bass.<br>
      <br>
      Lake Istokpoga has a 15- to 24-inch protective (or no-harvest) slot limit 
      for bass with a three fish daily bag limit, of which only one bass may be 
      24 inches or longer. All residents between 16 and 65 years of age and all 
      non-residents are required to have a fishing license.<br>
      <br>
      Due to elevated levels of mercury in this lake consumption of largemouth 
      bass should be limited by women of childbearing age and children under age 
      10 to no more than 8 ounces of bass over a 4-week period. All others

      Although largemouth bass fishing typically slows down during the winter 
      months, it picks up again in mid-February and March becoming red hot in 
      April and May. Beginning January 2, 2004 and continuing to February 14, 
      2004, a brief (45 day) drawdown of the lake will move largemouth bass out 
      from shoreline habitats, aggregating them into deeper water. This is an 
      excellent time for some wintertime largemouth bass action! Catches of 
      twenty bass during a morning fishing trip can be common during the 
      drawdown. During that time period in 2004, approximately 1000 largemouth 
      bass will be tagged by FWC fisheries biologists for a population and 
      movement study.<br>
      <br>
      One thousand largemouth bass weighing up to 11.7 pounds were collected and 
      tagged in Deer Point Lake in February 2003, and the largest reported 
      trophy largemouth bass caught by an angler in 2003 weighed 12.2 pounds! If 
      you catch a tagged bass in Deer Point Lake this spring, you are urged to 
      contact the FWC Regional Office on Deer Point Lake by calling the 
      telephone number on the tag (850) 265-3676. Also, if you catch a tagged 
      bass and wish to release the fish, please clip the tag as close to the 
      fish’s skin as possible. Do not attempt to pull the tag out. Remember to 
      please clip, keep and return the tag! Prizes will be awarded for all 
      returned tags.<br>
      <br>
      Anglers unfamiliar with Deer Point Lake should try fishing for largemouth 
      bass in the old creek channels of Bear, Cedar, and Econfina creeks with 
      plastic worms, diving crank-baits or rattletraps. Bayou George and the 
      flats area at the confluence of Bayou George and Deer Point Lake are also 
      popular largemouth spots. Also, try targeting docks and boathouses along 
      the creek channels and at the mouth of Bayou George. Anglers should 
      exercise extreme caution during boat operation due to the tremendous 
      amount of flooded cypress stumps and snags found in the lake.<br>

      <a href="http://www.floridafisheries.com/forecast/ncr.html#suwan_r">SUWANEE RIVER</a></strong><br>
      <br>
      The Suwannee River is a pristine, black water stream flowing 213 miles in 
      Florida from the swamp-like region at the Georgia border to salt-marsh 
      tidal creeks at the Gulf of Mexico. In between are rocky bluffs and shoal 
      areas in the upper reaches and floodplain cypress tree-hardwood swamp 
      borders, lined with water lilies, in the middle sections. The Santa Fe 
      River is a significant tributary and has abundant spring flow influence, 
      making water clearer, yet more productive for submerged vegetation and 
      fish food organisms. <br>
      <br>
      Although the Suwannee River is not known for trophy largemouth bass, good 
      catch rates can be expected, and quality-sized bass are frequently caught 
      be anglers. Suwannee bass also occur throughout much of the river system, 
      and fish large enough to qualify for Big Catch Suwannee bass can be caught 
      by anglers in the Santa Fe. <br>

      Crawfish are the main food item for bass in the whole river system, so 
      anglers should fish accordingly. Plastic worms, lizards, and crawfish; 
      jigs with orange skirts and pork rinds; and metallic crankbaits are all 
      standard lures that catch fish in the river. While the scenery may change 
      every 20 or 30 miles, the key to catching bass is the same. Deep structure 
      or shallow structure with deep water near-by is what anglers should always 
      look for. Suwannee bass, more common in Santa Fe River, prefer current 
      where water moves around cypress trees or in mid-river at low water 
      levels. Changing depths will change location of current structure.<br>
      <br>
      The lower Suwannee River moves more slowly and bass utilize shoreline 
      cover of fallen trees and cypress trees on outer bends. Plastic baits, 
      rigged weedless, can catch bass in the pads of inside shallow banks. Live 
      shiners can be fished into brush piles from upstream by letting them float 
      downstream. Small bass will hit a fly or a small floater-diver fished 
      along the bank in the Suwannee. <br>
      <br>
      The estuary is also productive. In the fall when shrimp are in the river, 
      fishing can be outstanding. Tidal creeks are a unique fishing experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Boat ramps are located along the entire river but fish camps are few and 
      far between. <br>
&nbsp;</font><h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/sor.html#eca">EVERGLADES WATER CONSERVATION
      AREAS 2 AND 3</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">The Everglades Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) are 
      marshlands intersected with over 250 miles of canals. WCA-2 has 210 square 
      miles of marsh, and WCA-3 covers approximately 915 square miles of marsh. 
      Originally designed for flood control and water supply, the area provides 
      some of the best bass fishing in the country.<br>
      <br>
      The best fishing usually occurs in the spring when dropping water levels 
      concentrate fish in the canals. April is the peak month with angler catch 
      rates as high a 4.1 bass per hour in the L-67A Canal.<br>
      <br>
      Most anglers fish in the canals rather than in the marsh. Anglers work 
      edges with plastic worms and minnow imitations. Flipping into the 
      vegetation is also a popular technique. During high water, anglers will 
      often enter the marsh areas where bass can be found in the open slough 
      areas. The L-67A Canal has trails off of it that are specifically cut to 
      provide boats access to these marsh areas.<br>
      <br>
      The L-67A and L-35B are two popular canals in the area for fishing. The 
      L-67A Canal has access at the north end at Holiday Park, off U.S. 27, 
      where camping and boat rentals are available.<br>
      <br>
      At the south end, it can be accessed at the S-333 water control structure 
      off Tamiami Trail (S.R. 41). The L-35B Canal access is at Sawgrass 
      Recreation Area, off of U.S. 27 and has boat rentals. Boat ramps are 
      available at all three sites.<br>
      <br>
      A special bass fishing regulation is in affect in south Florida, including 
      the Everglades Conservation Areas, in which only one bass of the five bass 
      daily bag limit may be 14 inches or longer. This gives anglers the 
      opportunity to harvest smaller bass, but still provides protection from 
      overharvest of fish over 14 inches in total length.<br>
      <br>
      Mercury health advisories follow current length limits established for 
      largemouth bass caught in the water conservation areas with 
      recommendations made based on bass length. For Largemouth bass less than 
      14 inches women of childbearing age and children under age 10 should not 
      eat more than 8 ounces of bass over a 4-week period. Others should limit 
      consumption of bass from these areas to no more than 8 ounces a week. No 
      one should consume Largemouth bass greater than 14 inches in length.<br>
&nbsp;</font><h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="../forecast/sor.html#okeechob">LAKE OKEECHOBEE</a></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial">Lake Okeechobee is consistently one of Florida’s top 
      producing bass lakes and is also one of the best lakes in the country for 
      bass fishing. Situated in south central Florida, the “Big O” covers 730 
      square miles, and is easily accessible from Florida’s east and west coast.
      <br>
      <br>
      The lake increased to 16 feet, early in 2003, due to above average 
      rainfall in the upper lakes. Due to the drought in 2001, the lake has 
      experienced positive changes in vegetation. As a result, biologists 
      anticipate increased production of young fish in Lake Okeechobee.<br>
      <br>
      Anglers routinely catch bass weighing 10 to 12 pounds. The lake record is 
      15 pounds, 5 ounces. Lake Okeechobee currently averages 500 bass fishing 
      tournaments a year. Anglers do well fishing in bulrush near Eagle Bay 
      Island, Little Grassy Island and King’s Bar at the north end of the lake. 
      At the south end, anglers are effective fishing in eelgrass in the South 
      Bay area. The largest bass are caught using live golden shiners and 
      casting into, or along edges of, vegetation. Plastic worms and spinner 
      baits are often productive. Casting lures near vegetation often produces 
      the largest numbers of bass.<br>
      <br>
      Lake Okeechobee has a 13- to 18-inch slot limit on bass, meaning all bass 
      between 13 and 18 inches must be released unharmed.<br>
      <br>
      Sixteen boat ramps and numerous fish camps surround the lake. For more 
      information contact the Clewiston Chamber of Commerce at (941) 983-7979 or 
      the Okeechobee Chamber of Commerce at (941) 763-6464.<br>
      <br>
      Due to low mercury levels in this lake, women who are pregnant or may 
      become pregnant, and nursing mothers should follow EPA guidelines and eat 
      no more than 8 ounces of bass in a week’s time. Children under age 10 
      should eat no more than 3 ounces of bass in a week’s time. All others are 
      not advised to limit consumption of Largemouth bass.<br>
&nbsp;</font><h3><font face="Arial" size="3"><a href="http://www.floridafisheries.com/forecast/ner.html#crescent">
      CRESCENT LAKE</a></font></h3>
      <p>
      <font face="Arial">This 15,725-acre lake borders the east side of Crescent 
      City on the Putnam/Flagler county line. Crescent Lake flows into the St. 
      Johns River via Dunns Creek on its north end. Past electrofishing samples 
      for largemouth bass revealed one of the highest catch rates recorded for 
      areas on the St. John’s River. Largemouth bass up to 20 inches long were 
      well represented in the sample and good numbers of larger fish (8 lb +) 
      were collected. <br>
      <br>
      Fall/early winter fishing tends to be best near deep-water structures such 
      as dock pilings. Preferred artificial baits include plastic worms, spinner 
      baits and crank baits. Live golden shiners are always a popular bait.<br>
      <br>
      Several fish camps provide access to the lake on the western and southern 
      shorelines. A public boat ramp is located near downtown Crescent City one 
      block east of U. S. 17 and another is located on the northeast shore off 
      S.R. 20/100. Bank access is limited to these facilities. <br>
      <br>
      Due to elevated levels of mercury in this lake, consumption of largemouth 
      bass should be limited by women of childbearing age, and children under 
      age 10 should not eat more than 8 ounces of bass over a 4-week period. All 
      others should limit consumption of bass from these areas to no more than 8 
      ounces a week.<br>
