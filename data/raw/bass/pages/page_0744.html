This instrument is a modern reproduction of an <i>Italian Serpent</i> or
a <i>Bass Cornett.</i> &nbsp;The following text gives a brief history of
this family of lip-activated (ie: mouthpiece) instruments</p>
      <p align="justify"> &nbsp;A serpent was the earliest non-reed bass
instrument and was widely used from the 16th through the early 19th Century.
It consisted of a conical bore tube made out of wood and wrapped with leather.&nbsp;
They were played with a mouthpiece (usually made from horn or ivory) roughly
similar in shape to a cup mouthpiece used in modern brass instruments. The
exotic shape of these instruments was purely practical- as it allowed the
player to reach finger holes or keys, which would have been way out of their
reach had the instrument be straight like an Alphorn.<br>
       <br>
 There are illustrations as far back as the 11th century of players using 
horns with 6 side holes for additional notes and a cup mouthpiece.&nbsp; These
were the immediate ancestors of the cornett- a gently curved or straight wooden
instrument. These remained in use almost to the 19th century. The potential
of these cornetti was exploited magnificently by composers like Gabrielli
in the 16th and 17th centuries.<br>
       <br>
 Toward the end of the 16th century,&nbsp; Edme Guillaume, a canon of Auxerre 
in France experimented with a lower pitched tenor cornett and ultimately created
a longer bass instrument called a serpent. The instrument features a large
      <u>conical</u> bore with a rounded exterior and about 213 cm long and
a snake shape.&nbsp; The Serpent&#8217;s immediate function was to support the
choir in plainsong and was soon adopted by churches throughout France.<br>
       <br>
 &nbsp;By the 18th century, the brass <a
 href="../trombones-euphoniums/1850-opheclide.html"><i>Ophiclide</i></a> was
becoming preferred for supporting choirs, and the <i>Contra-Bassoon</i> was
preferred for the bass line in most orchestral works.&nbsp; Some metal variations
of the serpent were created in the early 19th century, and a V-shaped   
   <i>Cor-Anglais</i> or <i>English Bass Horn</i> was found to provide a
more preferable bass sound than the serpent. Nonetheless, Handel, Beethoven, 
Wagner, and Bennett still specified serpents in their works in the early 1800s.&nbsp;
Mendelssohn specified <i>Corno Basso</i> in his works in the 1830s.&nbsp;
The serpent&#8217;s days were numbered by the advent of the keyed Bugle early in
the 19th century which lead to early Bass Tubas that provided an eminently
more suitable bass sound for almost any application.<br>
       <br>
 The shape of this particular instrument was copied by Scott Hall of Merritt 
Island Florida based on illustrations of a 16th century bass cornett also 
called an "Italian Serpent." It features the octagonal sides and the hole/key 
layout typical of then-contemporary lysarden and bass&nbsp; cornetti. As with
post-1590 serpents, these were made from wood and were leather covered.&nbsp; 
Unlike Guillaume serpents, these bass cornetti were made with a very narrow 
bore .<br>
       <br>
 This particular instrument was constructed using laminations of high grade
birch plywood (non-historical but very, very substantial and solid). For
ease of construction, the inner bore is not circular, but rectangular. There
are no keys but the simple 6-hole fingering system used on early serpents.
The horn has a cylindrical copper bocal-or leadpipe-for the mouthpiece. Some
of the old bass cornetts had no bocal at all &#8211; with the mouthpiece inserted
directly into the wood at the top of the instrument.<br>
       <br>
 As in the original Bass Cornetti, this instrument has a hexagonal outer
surface shape, but it is painted and not wrapped in leather. &nbsp; It is
8 feet in overall length and plays in Bb and can reproduce roughly the entire
chromatic range of the modern bass trombone, and plays on and below the bass
clef staff. The the range and sound of a proper serpent can be heard by clicking
on the the links in the left column.</p>
       
      <p align="justify"> It is virtually impossible to find an authentic 
period serpent or bass cornett&nbsp; which has not been ravaged by worms and
termites. &nbsp;</p>
