A standard violin is commonly referred to as "full size" or4/4.Smaller sizes include 1/16, 1/10, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4.<p> Determining correct size: Have the student hold the instrument inplaying position. Ask them to reach out and wrap their hand around thescroll (seeimage). If the student can comfortably wrap their fingers around thescrollwhile still maintaining some bend in the elbow, the instrument iscorrectsize. If the student cannot reach the scroll, or has no bend in theirelbow,move them down to the appropriate size.</p><p> </p><p><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/sizing.jpg" border="3"> <br clear="">Do not have a student play on an instrument that is too small! Movethemup to the largest appropriately sized instrument.</p><p> Violas also come in a variety of sizes, but are sized by bodylengthand typically come in the following sizes: 12", 13.25", 14", 15",15.5",16", 16.5". For students who need a viola smaller than 12" it ispossibleto restring a violin as a viola until the student grows enough to playareal viola. In any case, students should always play on the largestviolaappropriate for their size. </p><p> </p><h4> Cello</h4>Cellos also come in a variety of sizes-3/4, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Endpin length should be span ofstudents hand + length of the little finger(This is an approximate starting point). With the endpin extended, thecello should be about chinheight when student stands. C peg should be accross from left ear whensitting with correct posture.The chair should be of a size so that both of the student's feet canrest flat on the floor.The instrument should be a size so that when the endpin is adjustedproperly and student is sitting in an appropriate chair, their kneescan rest comfortably against the side of the lower bouts, and the baseof the cello neck contacts the student's body near their sternum. <br><h4>Double Bass</h4>Basses also come in several sizes. There are 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 sizebasses available for smaller students.The size most professionals play isthe 3/4 size. Occasionally you may come across a 7/8 bass, but&nbsp;4/4 basses are extremely rare because they are simply too large formost people to play.&nbsp; Adjust the endpin so&nbsp; the bridgeof the bass is on the same plane with the largeknucklesof the students right hand. Theimportant thing is not to set the bass too high. A bass set too highwillcause the right elbow to bend too much, the angle of the bow to thestringswill change, and ultimately, the result will be a poor sound.<br><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><h3>Preliminary exercises for violin and viola to develop the shape ofthe left hand</h3>Place the instrument in rest position.<br><p><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/banjo.gif" border="3" height="219" width="169"> <b>Rest position<br></b></p><h3>Exercise 1</h3><h4>Shake hands with neck of instrument</h4><p><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/shakehands.gif" border="3" height="119" width="192" align="left"> The thumb should be lengthenedand straight.

Here is the test todetermine if you need better shoulder support. While holding theinstrument in playing position, take the left hand, and touch the rightshoulder. The instrument should stay in position. <br><br><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/DCP_1234.JPG" alt=""><br><br>If the instrument slides down, the support is inadequate. Please seethe <a href="/~mhopkins/string/?Page=maintenance.html">Careand Maintenance</a> section for information on shoulder rests.<br><br>A general rule for playing a string instrument is "No part of your bodyshould touch any other part of your body." If the instrument is heldcorrectly, the left arm will form a natural 90 degree angle at theelbow. The angle will be slightly smaller on the cello and bass.<br><br><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/DCP_1232.JPG" alt=""><br><br>This student is resting her elbow against her body. Notice the effectthis has on her bow placement. Her tone will be weak and unsavory.<br><br><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/DCP_1233.JPG" alt=""><br><br>What is the cause? If she lacks proper shoulder support for theinstrument, her left hand is holding up the instrument, which causesfatigue. The natural tendency would then be to rest her elbow againsther body.<br><br>Be sure to watch for these common problems in the beginning stages ofinstruction. Repeat the entire process of bringing the instrument intoposition frequently. Problems are likely to creep in whenever keyconcepts are not reviewed. It is very simple: The things you addresswill get better, and the things you ignore will get worse.<br><hr><h2 align="center">Addressing the Instrument to the Body for Cello and Bass</h2><p>Holding the cello and the bass can be difficult for younger studentsbecauseof the size of these instruments. Students should have an opportunitytoget familiar with the feel of the instrument. One way to do this is tohavestudents carry instruments around room, being careful not to bang them.Letthe students practice putting down and picking up their instrumentswithoutmaking any noise. <br></p><p> </p><hr><h3>Correct Cello Posture</h3><p><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/cellopos.gif" border="3" height="251" width="180" align="left"></p><p> While sitting, the student should be able to stand up withoutmoving feet.</p><p> Cello should contact at three points: </p><li>Both knees should touch the side by lower bouts. </li><li>Students' chest should touch top of cello back at around thesternum height. Have student place arms around and hug the cello. Rockback and forth.</li><p><br clear=""><br></p><h3><br></h3><h3><br></h3><h3><br></h3><h3>Positioning of Bass</h3><p>The bassist may either stand or sit on a stool while playing.</p><p> </p><h4>Standing with the Bass</h4><p> The student should stand with their feet shoulder width apart sotheir weight balances. The lower right back of the bass should beplaced against the student's left leg. The student will need toexperiment to find the placewhere the bass balances with their body. If the instrument is balancedcorrectlythe student will be able to hold it without using their arms.</p><p> Make sure the student's left leg is behind the instrument, andtheir shouldersare relaxed.</p><p> </p><p> <img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/basspos.gif" border="3" height="264" width="180"> <img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/backbass.gif" border="3" height="271" width="180"></p><br>.gi<hr><p></p><h4>Sitting with the Bass</h4><p><img src="/~mhopkins/string/gif/basssit.gif" border="3" height="303" width="180" align="left"></p><p> Sitting posture should be approached from a standing posture. Afterthestudent has learned where the bass balances with their body whilestanding, they can sit down on a stool and balance the instrument inthe same way. Thestudent should not slump over the instrument in sitting position.Depending on th height of the stool, the endpin may need to be adjustedwhen going fromstanding to sitting. </p><p>In my own playing I have found that sitting works well with theFrench Bow because of the extra leverage you get from your arm weight.I prefer tostand when playing with German Bow, primarily because the angle of thebowto the strings gets too extreme in the high positions when sitting.Everybass player I meet has an opinion on standing vs. sitting, but mostwouldagree that a good bassist should be able to play both ways. Mostplayerssit in orchestra rehearsals, but most stand when performing a solorecital.</p><p>For more information on Double Bass Pedagogy, please visit <a href="http://www.hiline.net/~alecm/bass.html">Alec Mariani's BassPedagogyResources</a>.</p><hr><h3>Preliminary Finger Exercises for Cello and Bass</h3>While the violins and violas are strumming and tapping in their fourpositions (rest, shoulder, shoulder leftside, playing position), thecellos and basses can also be doing some preliminary exercises.<p> </p><p>1)Tap the right shoulder with the left hand, then tap on stringswith 2,3,4.</p><p> 2)Tap with 2,3,4 low on fingerboard, then high on fingerboard.</p><p> 3)After arch is formed with fingers, tap thumb against back of neck.</p><p> 4)Hook ring finger on a lower string. Slide hand down fingerboardand pluck at the end of fingerboard. Then wave the hand to releasetension.(power curve)</p><p> 5)Tap 2,3,4 tap thumb, then tap index finger. Index finger shouldbe thelast finger placed down. This will help with extensions later.</p><hr><ul>  <li><big><big><a href="/~mhopkins/string/?Page=lefthand/posture.html&amp;SM=lefthandmenu.html">Posture</a>    </big></big></li>  <li><big><big><a href="/~mhopkins/string/?Page=lefthand/body.html&amp;SM=lefthandmenu.html">Addressingthe Instrument to the Body</a> </big></big></li>  <li><a><big><big></big></big></a><big><big><a href="/~mhopkins/string/?Page=lefthand/hand.html&amp;SM=lefthandmenu.html">Addressingthe Hand to the Instrument</a> </big></big></li>  <li><a><big><big></big></big></a><big><big><a href="/~mhopkins/string/?Page=lefthand/lhint.html&amp;SM=lefthandmenu.html">IntermediateSkills for Left Hand</a> </big></big></li>  <li><a href="/~mhopkins/string/?Page=lefthand/lhadv.html&amp;SM=lefthandmenu.html"><big><big>AdvancedSkills for the Left Hand</big></big></a></li></ul><hr></body></html><p class="modify">Last modified October 11 2004 06:07 PM</p>
