		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">-- From the poem 'Mandalay' by Rudyard Kipling.</font></p>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">It was more than a century ago that the great author, Rudyard Kipling, described Burma as &quot;quite unlike any land you know about&quot;. Myanmar, as Burma is now named, remains as captivating for todays traveller as it was to Kipling then.</font></p>

		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Despite having been in the grip of Military Dictatorship since 1988, the countries cultural heritage and spirit of its people remain remarkably intact. Recent attempts to attract more tourism have yet to take effect and this beautiful place remains one of Southeast Asias best kept secrets. It is not the exotic landscape or the cultural riches of this nation that most impress the visitor but the Burmese people, with their endearing smiles and enduring spirit.</font></p>
		<div align="center">

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There is a remarkable air of positivity surrounding the largely Buddhist population and their warmth and kindness will be among the most enduring memories. It is surprisingly easy to find English speaking people in a country where there is little opportunity for education beyond the elementary basics. Those who I spoke to in Rangoon (now Yangon) and Mandalay told how the opportunity for college or university education was largely reserved for the countries monks -- who number more than a million. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Because of the political situation, it is easier to explore the country as part of an organised tour. The Military dictates that foreign visitors must spend $300 upon entering the country but this fee is waived for members of group tours. My companion, James Hardcastle, and I found Eastern and Orient Express to be the natural choice to arrange our Burmese adventure. The company, who also operate the Venice Simplon Orient Express in Europe and the Eastern and Orient Express from Singapore to Bangkok, have a long history of satisfied customers and a continued stellar reputation in the region. They offer a luxurious seven day tour comprising two days on Rangoon and Pagan, followed by five days on the Irriwaddy River aboard an exemplary 'Road to Mandalay' cruise ship. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The adventure begins on arrival in Rangoon, checking in to the Inya Lake Hotel. Once owned by the Russian military, it retains the air of an era gone by. Despite being an architectural hangover from the Cold War, it's beautiful lake backdrop and sumptuous pool make it the best choice for your time here. When exploring Rangoon you'll find most of the action in the city centre. Here life descends onto the streets as early as 5 a.m., the hustle and bustle of this commercial city up to full steam by 8 a.m. The streets and sdiewalks teem with people from dawn till dusk -- buyers and sellers, man, woman, and child -- life is played out on the streets in a captivating show for the bystander. The main city market is a dazzling infusion of sights, sounds and smells. Hundreds of stall holders, their wares arranged in what seem like tiny carved out caves, all ply their trades hoping to attract a sale from the passing throngs of locals and tourists. Here you'll find yourself surrounded by local flavours. An old man sellings spices, his broad smile revealing a mouth of crooked teeth. The brother and sister generously offering a free sample of fried locusts, which we sheepishly declined. The fresh cut sea bass thrust, unsolicited into my hands by a fisherman. This wasn't the souvenir I was looking for so I exchanged it for taking his photograph -- we were both happy with the deal. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Another highlight of Rangoon is the Shwe Dagon Pagoda, the largest and most important Buddhist shrine in the country. Built on a hilltop, it's 100 meter tall golden sphere dominates everything around it. Reaching the hilltop is like entering one of Kipling's fairy tales. Your eyes are met by hundreds of pavilions and shrines, statuary images and a sea of faithful devotees making prayers and offerings to Buddha. This age old scene of humility and reverence once inspired author Somerset Maugham to write; &quot;This magical place is like finding sudden hope in the dark night of the soul&quot;. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Rangoon is a city slowly waking up from a time warp. Here, in the administrative center of Myanmar, where the traditions of the past meet the commercial future, high-rises are being etched on a skyline little changed since British Colonial Rule. On the afternoon of our third day it is time to leave Rangoon and we take a flight on Mandalay Airlines to Pagan. Pagan, the capital of the first Burmese Empire, must be one of the most remarkable religious cities in the world. This ancient Buddhist city is bejewelled with countless temples, pagodas and monasteries. 2000 of them lay scattered across a dusty, sun baked plain stretching as far as the banks of the Irrawaddy. Such a feast for the eyes is this, that it is hard to imagine that at one time the structures here numbered 13,000. It's a picture perfect sunset over Pagan. Shades of yellows, browns, reds, pinks and purple race across the sky bouncing off the burnished structures. For a few breathtaking moments they light up like ancient gem stones. As the sunset plays out across the rooftops, it's easy to see why Pagan has been designated a World Heritage Site and Burma dubbbed the 'The Land of the Golden Pagodas'. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">That evening we boarded 'The Road to Mandalay' for the next chapter in our adventure. The journey up the Irrawaddy, from Pagan to the northern capital of Mandalay, must make for a once in a lifetime experience for today's explorer. The Eastern and Orient Express cruise ship is the perfect vessel for such an epic journey. 'The Road to Mandalay' provides a standard of luxury that no other cruise operator in the region can compete with. Spacious staterooms combining traditional Burmese motifs with colonial elegence, polished teak wood floors making up the glorious observation deck and the excellent foor on offer make for some of the highlights. We set sail the following morning and journey up river for the following 36 hours. The sights and sounds of the Irrawaddy, the main artery of Burma's transport system, drift by and there's an opportunity to laze by the pool, soaking up the luxury. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We arrived in Mandalay on the 5th day and used our luxurious vessel as a floating hotel. From here there are excursions by land and by boat to savour yet more of the Burmese experience. Whether it's to visit a temple to see the monks accepting alms from the local community or a visit to the U Bein, the worlds longest teak wood bridge, that spans the Taungthaman River. Here, in a scene that hasn't changed in a millennium, you will see the traditional Burmese fishermen, fully clothed and immersed in the shallow river waiting for a bite. These scenes are eye candy for the soul. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mandalay, the last royal capital of Burma, while still a relatively young city, has become the cultural and spiritual heart of the nation. More than 85% of the Burmese population are Buddhist and it is here that the tradition of Theravada Buddhism is best preserved. Mandalay can be explored in the couple of days the tour allowed but -- if you have the luxury of time -- a few more will lead you out of the city and in to its fascinating surroundings. Among the many places of interest are the ruins of King Mindons Palace [tragically destroyed by fire in W.W.II] and the Kyauktawgyi Pagoda, famous for its vast Buddha statue carved from a single block of marble. Touring the district feels a little like travelling through the centuries in a time machine. </font></p>

		</div>
		<p><font color="#ccffff" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Alas, all fairy tales must come to an end, and our time in this magical land was at its close. Our tour of Burma had been a journey of discovery through the ages, from Burmas ancient past, Myanmars delicate present and wishes for a peaceful future. To discover Burma, Southeast Asia's best kept secret, is to be cast under its spell and bound to return. </font></p>
