          </font><p><font face="Georgia" size="2">There is no part of Bass fishing
quite as rewarding as the art of fishing top-water lures. There are fishermen like Charlie Campbell and Sam Griffin who have spent
a lifetime developing their skills in this art. Envision a small lake on a quiet morning
at sunrise covered with patches of lily pads and large bass busting
the surface in pursuit of bait. This is when you grab a rod with a top-water
lure tied on and get ready for the experience of a lifetime. This doesn't
mean that this is the only time you can fish a top-water lure, as they will
work almost anytime and under many conditions.</font>

          <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Top-waters are best when fished
around heavy cover.&nbsp; Look for areas that have fallen trees, grass,
bullrushes or even an old boat dock.&nbsp; If you become adept at throwing the lures around
this type cover with good accuracy, you will catch many fish.&nbsp; Open-water
areas surrounded by submerged grass can be an excellent place to have a
bass crash your lure.</font>

          <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">There are basically four types
of top-water lures in use today. These include chuggers, stick baits,
prop baits, and soft plastic weedless lures. Chuggers are those lures like
a <a href="http://www.hroller.com" target="_blank">High Roller</a>, Storm Chug Bug, Pop&quot;R&quot;,&nbsp; or the old Heddon Chugger.&nbsp; Probably the most
famous stickbait, made famous by Charlie Campbell, is the Heddon Zara Spook and
the original <a href="http://www.hroller.com" target="_blank">High Roller wooden
lure</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A good example of a soft plastic top-water would be a Scum Frog or Rat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

          <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Maybe the easiest of all to fish is the prop bait.&nbsp;
The very popularlures like the <a href="http://www.hroller.com" target="_blank">RipRoller,</a>&nbsp;
Devils Horse and Tiny Torpedo are very easy to use and produce thousands
of fish each year all over the world.&nbsp;</font>

          <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">The most common mistake among top-water fishermen is impatience. You must slow down and take your time
when fishing top-water lures.&nbsp; Just enjoy the surroundings and cover each
area thoroughly and completely.</font>

          <p><font face="Georgia" size="2">If you will try some top-water
fishing this season you will find that the attack of a largemouth on a
top-water&nbsp; bait is more exciting than almost any other type of fishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take these tips
and HAVE FUN.</font>
