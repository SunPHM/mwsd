      <p>Fished with Ken Mearns of Babylon.&nbsp; We had three bass on live bait.&nbsp; One was
      a good one at 22 lb., the other two were about 18 and 12 lb.&nbsp; Fishing is OK but
      slimming down.&nbsp; The action was hot along the beach to the east.&nbsp; Lots of blues
      and bass and some big fish.&nbsp; Looks like this weekend could be hot.</p>

      <p>Fished the Riverview Striped Bass contest with Tim C. Smith and Tara Froelich.&nbsp; It
      was a tough day of fishing.&nbsp; We caught two small fish under the 36 inch minimum limit
      and ended the day with nothing to weigh in.&nbsp; It was a beautiful day anyway and we
      shot some good video that we will put on the site as a webcast.&nbsp; That's fishing!</p>

      <p>Fished in the morning to scope things out before the Riverview Bass Tournament set for
      tomorrow.&nbsp; The fishing is tough with mostly smaller fish.&nbsp; I did catch two fish
      on leve bait, a small one about 12 pounds and also a 20 pound fish.&nbsp; The water is
      very cold at 46 degrees.</p>

      <p>Fished alone on an exploratory mission.&nbsp; Had a good day with 6 bass to 35 lb. on
      live bait.&nbsp; Found a couple of new places that hold fish.&nbsp; There are a lot of
      smaller fish, 15 to 18 pounds etc. and a few big ones just moved into the area. Yesterday
      all the fish were of the smaller variety but today a few big ones were to be had. &nbsp;
      The water really chilled out.&nbsp; On the ebb it hit a low of 43 in the backbay and the
      high for the day at the inlet was 53.</p>

      <p align="left">We left the dock early Saturday morning in search of Bluefish and maybe
      shark only to be disappointed by poor water visibility. We were 17 miles off the beach
      where we set-up anyway despite the murky water. We stuck it out for 4 hours with nothing
      but a 5 second runoff. I was ready to pack it in and head in-shore and try for some Fluke
      when I noticed some bird life way off in the distance. Anthony and Tara quickly brought in
      the lines and we steamed towards the first real sign of life I saw all Day. As we arrived
      closer I could see more birds and water boiling beneath them. When the Argo was in range I
      through a surface plug into the frenzied water only to pull out a small cocktail Blue.
      Somewhat disappointed we kept tossing popping plugs into the fray and used light tackle to
      increase the sporting value.&nbsp; I then hooked up with something larger that was
      stripping off line at an alarming rate. The fight was different then the bluefish but what
      could it be? Three minutes later we netted a 5.5 lbs. Weakfish. At this time we were
      completely surrounded by bait, birds and foaming boiling water. We changed over to lead
      heads with swimming jelly bodies where we were able to get the lures below the Bluefish
      and hook up with big Weakfish every cast. The fish were all 5 plus lbs. Tara had the
      biggest weighing in at 7.5 lbs. We all lost count of the fish we caught but I think it
      would be safe to say we had 15 to 20 Weakfish each. Early in the game we started releasing
      fish and keeping only the ones that did not look like they would make it or chopped in two
      by large bluefish. When we left the water was still boiling but we were to tired to catch
      even one more.</p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished the &quot;Surfside 3 Weakfish Tournament&quot; Saturday and
      Sunday in horrible weather.&nbsp; Wind blew from the East (fish bite the least) and it was
      as cold as November.&nbsp; John Dall from Bay Shore an I gave it our best.&nbsp; We
      managed one small weakfish and a half dozen flounder on Saturday.&nbsp; Sunday was much
      better with an 8.26 weakfish that took 6th place in the tournament.&nbsp; We also had a
      lot of fun with bluefish up to 6 lb. and about a dozen bass, about half keepers up to 33
      inches.&nbsp; </big></p>
      <p align="left"><big>The tournament was well run and had lots of prizes including a 17'
      Boston Whaler boat with <strong>Mercury</strong> power for first prize.&nbsp; We didn't
      win it but did get a Lowrance X-48 recorder for sixth place.&nbsp; I also won an Igloo 54
      quart cooler for a raffle prize. Paul and Matthew Barbara of &quot;Surfside 3&quot; &nbsp;
      with sponsors &quot;The Fisherman&quot; , &quot;Boston Whaler&quot; and &quot;Captain
      Bill's&quot; ran a top notch event.&nbsp; They promised next year would be bigger and
      better! </big></p>
      <p align="left"><big>All considered it was a successful weekend of fishing.&nbsp; John and
      I had a good time.</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished the back bay for a couple of hours in the afternoon with my
      son Luke.&nbsp; We caught our first weakfish of the season on a jelly worm on the flood
      tide.&nbsp; The water has cleaned up a bit.&nbsp; It looks like the yellow-brown algae is
      finally dying off.&nbsp; This will help the fishing.&nbsp; The weakfish was really on the
      feed.&nbsp; It took the lure way deep, no question about a solid hookup.&nbsp; We also
      caught a few searobins so the fluke must also be in the neighborhood.</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished the State Channel early in the AM and then flounder in the PM.
      &nbsp; Al from the Sea Devil caught a few nice bass on plastics.&nbsp; I didn't do very
      well but managed one pretty good fish about 30 inches.&nbsp; Flounder fishing was slow.
      &nbsp; I fished with Ken Mearns of Babylon and we caught only two fish in Dickerson's
      Channel.</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished the State Channel for a couple of hours in the AM and
      connected with one small bass on green plastic with lead head.&nbsp; The fish was about 20
      inches.&nbsp; Other fish were taken in the area.&nbsp; I was checked by the DEC Officer on
      a Coast Guard boat.&nbsp; They were courteous and checked to see if I had any fish on
      board.&nbsp; They checked my registration and asked if I had seen anyone breaking the law.
      &nbsp; I told them that I had not and that was about it.&nbsp; I was glad to see
      enforcement on the water.</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished the State Channel with my son Luke on my birthday for anything
      that would bite on a lure.&nbsp; We didn't catch a thing but Al on the Wild Mouse had
      three Bass up to 35 inches.&nbsp; There are fish in the neighborhood if you want to put in
      the time.&nbsp; It is early and the fish are feeding on the bottom to slowly worked soft
      plastics and bucktails.</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished Saturday morning in the rain but it was peaceful rain. &nbsp;
      Caught 3 flounder in the Babylon cut on my little 14 foot MFG.&nbsp; Lots of really big
      skates beating me up.&nbsp; The fish were fat but not big but made for some good
      eating.&nbsp; All were packed with clam chum when I examined them upon cleaning. &nbsp;
      They are active and feeding but not too plentiful in this area.&nbsp; Bigger fish were
      caught way to the East off Heckscher Park but also not plentiful.</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big>Fished with Rich and Nick Santos on their new (used) 23' Wellcraft.
      &nbsp; We fished for flounder in the Babylon Cut.&nbsp; It was the only place we could
      hide from the 25 to 30 mph winds.&nbsp; We chummed with clam chum and fished blood worms.
      &nbsp; We caught 6 fish, all keepers but on the small side.&nbsp; We quit at noon. &nbsp;
      It was fun to be back on the water!</big></p>

      <p align="left"><big><strong>2/23/00</strong></big></p>
      <p align="left"><strong>This is the first report for the new year.&nbsp; I fished with
      Rich Santos at Connetquot State Park during the afternoon session.&nbsp; We had beats 21
      and 22.&nbsp; They aren't the best spots in the park but we got there late and had no
      better choices.&nbsp; There were plenty of fish however near beat 21 and we had a good
      time.&nbsp; It was a real nice day with temperatures about 50 degrees.&nbsp; The fish
      seemed to prefer bead heads and black wooly buggers.&nbsp; We caught and released about 4
      or 5 fish each, all rainbows.&nbsp; The sea run steelheads have not arrived in any numbers
      yet but are due soon.&nbsp; A great day!</strong></p>
