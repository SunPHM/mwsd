	 <P ALIGN="CENTER">White bass are an enormous amount of fun to catch (try to
		imagine bluegills that run up to 3-4 pounds.) If you catch one, it will fight
		so hard you will swear it is twice as big as it actually is. They eat almost
		anything, but mostly small fish, so I would suggest 3-4 inch streamers. Bright
		and flashy ones will usually work, but sometimes they will be a little fussy
		about color (sometimes they will insist on a perch-colored lure.) I have also
		seen white bass hitting grasshoppers and moths on the surface in mid-summer,
		but unfortunately, never while I had a fly rod in my hand.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER">White bass usually travel in large schools, so if you
		catch one, work the area thoroughly because there are probably a lot more. They
		travel a lot, so finding white bass in an area one day is not a guarantee that
		they will be there the next day.</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER">They are good to eat, too. I especially like to smoke
		them.</P>
