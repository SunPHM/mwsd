									<p><b>ALASKAN COD POTS<br>
										</b>The cod pot fishery that originally developed in Alaska, used modified crab pots that were <img src="../pics/content/cod.jpg" align="right">around 7' X 7' X 3'. These pots had inwardly leading ramps for the crab to crawl up and pass through a horizontally mounted steel tunnel eye. These modified crab pots had a lot of their internal volume occupied by the crab ramps. As the fishery developed, fishermen and pot makers, developed pots specifically made for the directed cod fishery. The most popular design is about 6' X 6' X 3' and has Neptune cod triggers on three sides of the <img src="../pics/traps/codpot.jpg" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="4">pot with shallow leads leading to the 9&quot; X 18&quot; tunnel eye. The pot's door is on the fourth side of the pot, opposite the bridle. Washington pot makers include Dungeness Gear Works and Eclipse Gear and Supply. Both are located in Everett, Washington.</p>
									<p><b>PACIFIC WEST COAST FISH POT FISHERIES<br>
											</b>The largest fish pot fishery other than the Alaska cod pot fishery is the fishery for sablefish in British <img src="../pics/content/westcoast.gif" align="right">Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Fish caught in these pot fisheries are acknowledged to be bigger fish than those caught with longlines or trawls. They are also of excellent quality since they are brought to the surface alive and unbruised. There's also an increasing market for live fish that can be caught in pots. Fish caught in a pot are unharmed while a hook caught fish might suffer mortal wounds from the hook.</p>
									<p><b>ATLANTIC POT FISHERIES<br>
										</b>There currently is no pot fishery in the NE Atlantic for most fish species. The exception being black sea bass and scup fisheries. This might change. Interest is growing<img src="../pics/content/eastcoast.gif" align="right"> in the North Atlantic to start experimenting with pot fisheries for various reasons. Reducing the catch of small juvenile fish is the main reason why a pot fishery is attractive. Rebuilding fishery stocks in the North Atlantic can be achieved by developing fishing methods that are more size selective. Catching various fish species with pots can create a selective fishery. Unwanted, or undersized, fish in the pot , are returned live to the sea.</p>
									<p><b>CATFISH POTS</b><br>
										Neptune triggers offer a long lasting entrance alternative for all catfish pot designs. <img src="../pics/content/catfish.jpg" align="right">Instead of using the traditional wooden entry slats, Neptune triggers, or just the finger units, should be considered when rigging your pot. If your pot gets beat up over time, remove your Neptune triggers and put them in your new pots.</p>

									<p><b>CHILEAN SEA BASS (TOOTHFISH) POTS<br>
										</b>Numerous international fishermen in the hook and line longline fishery for Chilean sea bass have inquired about catching these valuable fish with pots. There are numerous reasons why they want to explore this capture method. <img src="../pics/content/chilleanseabass.jpg" align="right">The initial concern is providing a way to avoid predation by whales as the fish are hauled up on the longlines. Just as in the Alaska sablefish and turbot longline fishery, the whales (orca and sperm) have the table set when the boat starts to haul their gear up from the ocean bottom. With the fish protected in pots, whale predation is not a problem. The other advantage of catching these fish in pots is the fact that fish are not wasted when hooks are ripped from the fish's soft mouths when longline gear is brought to the surface. Many of these lost fish are already dead creating a resource waste that is avoidable if fish are secured in a pot.</p>
									<p><b>BLACK SEA BASS POTS/TRAPS<br>
										</b>Numerous sea bass fishermen have contacted us in recent months to inquire about <img src="../pics/content/blackbass.jpg" align="right">the use of Neptune triggers in their fishery. To date, no one has caught a sea bass with a Neptune modified pot, but we think this will be changing in the near future. Fishermen will be experimenting with various Neptune triggers during the upcoming season. Trap makers and fishing supply outlets in the NE Atlantic are being contacted to handle Neptune Triggers. Check out our links section to see if there is a dealer near you. We're confident that a Neptune trigger will be developed by fishermen experimenting with our triggers during the upcoming season. Contact us with questions about and trap and trigger designs.</p>
									<p><b>FLATFISH POTS<br>
										</b>To date, no directed pot fisheries for flatfish exist using Neptune triggers. There is no doubt that certain flatfish species will enter baited pots. In Alaska, <img src="../pics/content/halibut.jpg" align="right">halibut is exclusively a hook and line longline fishery. Cod pots, without excluding divisions, have proven very effective in catching halibut. The use of halibut &quot;excluders&quot; prevents the bycatch of most halibut in the cod pot fishery and makes it a very clean fishery. In the Bering Sea cod pot fishery, yellowfin sole are commonly caught, and released, in certain fishing areas. Experimental flatfish pot designs suitable for catching flatfish are shown below. Contact us if you are interested in talking about other designs.</p>
									<p><b>ROCKFISH, GROUPER AND OTHER FISH POTS<br>
										</b>Numerous fish species have a vertical profile when <img src="../pics/content/rockfish.jpg" align="right">viewed head on. Vertical oriented shapes and dorsal fins on rockfish, grouper, and other fish dictate that Neptune triggers be used in a vertical orientation instead of a horizontal placement. This vertical orientation of the trigger also works well for round fish.</p>
