LEO-15 consists of two unmanned seafloor observatories 1.5 kilometers apart
approximately 9 kilometers off the central coast of New Jersey. They have been
linked to the Rutgers Marine Field Station in Tuckerton, NJ, with an
electro-optic cable which contains optical fibers to transfer information and
copper wires to transfer power. This link provides a real-time connection
between the undersea world off the coast of New Jersey and the Internet,
providing scientists, engineers, and educators with realtime access to the
sea. It permits them to monitor experiments and to alter their direction from
essentially any classroom, office building, or laboratory in the world. The
cable also provides continuous and ample electrical power, a luxury denied to
experimentalists using traditional methods to study the ocean.

<h3>NODE COMPONENTS</h3>
<CENTER><A HREF="images/leo15.gif"> <IMG SRC="images/leo15.gif"></A>
</center>

The major components of the nodes are a surge resistant node shell, an inner
instrument frame, and a cable junction box. The node shell is made of
stainless steel, painted to prevent it from becoming fouled with undersea
growth. It is anchored to the seafloor and strongly braced against the
tremendous wave induced surge forces which occur on this open coastal shelf
during seasonal storms. Both nodes survived hurricanes Eduarde and Fran which
hit shortly after the nodes were deployed in the late summer of 1996. Inside
each node, the seafloor cable is terminated in an oil-filled cable junction
box. The inshore node passes the cable through its junction box and on to the
offshore node. Extra cable is coiled on the floor inside the node shell. This
extra cable permits the termination box to be lifted to the surface for
it may be disconnected from the node shell and raised to the surface by divers 
repair, servicing, and installation. The instrument frame is buoyant so that
it may be disconnected from the node shell and raised to the surface by divers
using a hand operated winch mounted on the node shell. Once on the surface, it
can be lifted aboard a small 50 ft. boat and brought to shore for repair,
servicing or upgrade. <P>

The instrument frame provides the infrastructure which permits the various
robots and sensors, as well as future experiments to be linked through the
cable and back to shore for distribution on the Internet. The instrument
frame contains a fiber-optic telemetry system and microprocessors which
switch power and signal channels to the various undersea connectors at each
nodes. Electronics in the instrument frame are used to monitor the health of
the node as well as the experiments and robots which are hooked to it. Every
20 seconds, a computer on the surface directs a sequence of events which tests
the status of all systems connected to the node. In the event that a fault is
detected, the computer program automatically switches through a pre-programmed
cycle which identifies the damaged system and then turns it off and isolates
it from the node. The program then sends an email to the owner of the robot or
experiment, detailing the failure and what has happened to their experiments.

</center>
<h3> PROFILER </h3>
Each node already has a vertical <A HREF="images/profiler.gif">  profiler</A>
operated by an electric winch
controlled via the Internet to provide water column profiles of temperature,
salinity, oxygen concentration, light transmission, and chlorophyll. In
addition, each node has a channel of video to provide continuous bottom
imagery and two hydrophones to provide information on the sound environment.
Scientists will soon be adding other instruments including a high resolution
scanning sonar, an acoustic doppler current profiler, and a BASS (Benthic
Acoustic Stress Sensor) tripod. Each sensor will be connected via underwater
matable connectors to one of eight guest ports on each node. <P>    <p>


<h3> REMUS </h3>
Remus (Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS) is a small, lowcost autonomous
underwater vehicle designed for environmental monitoring. It was developed by
engineers in the Oceanographic Systems Laboratory of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution. The REMUS vehicle is an integral part of the LEO-15
design. It will be used to exploit the real time deployed presence that the
seafloor observatory offers by making measurements of episodic events which
take place in locations which are remote from the cable. On command from a
control station, or even via the Internet, one or more of the vehicles
garaged in the seafloor observatory will be launched and will then
automatically negotiate a pre-programmed round trip course. <P>

<h3> Sensor Suite: </h3>
Both nodes have the following sensors:
<UL>
<li> CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) </li>
<li> Dissolved Oxygen </li>
<li> Flourometer </li>
<li> Transmissometer </li>
<li> Optical Backscatter </li>
<li> Precision pressure sensor </li> </UL>

All sensors except the precision pressure sensor are located on the vertical
profiler, thus allowing them to be positioned anywhere in the water column.
These sensors in general are operational at all times except when being
serviced. As a result, LEO-15 generates an enormous amount of raw data 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. This data is made available to scientists
world wide via an archiving system.

<H1> <A name="rovs"></A> <CENTER>Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV's)</H1>

<P></CENTER> ROV's are used increasingly to conduct undersea research for 
specialized applications. The size and capability range from the low cost ROV 
(LCROV) to much larger, more elaborate systems. LCROV's are small, tethered 
vehicles that can generally be operated to depths of approximately 230 m 
(755 ft.) from ships of opportunity. They have thrusters, color still and 
video photographic systems, and a simple single function manipulator arm. 
NURP owns both Phantom and Mini-Rover LCROV's.</P>

<P>Several larger deep-ocean ROV's have been developed and maintained for 
scientific use by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Deep Submergence 
Operations Group (WHOI DSOG), the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute 
(MBARI), and the Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS). Also, under a memorandum 
of agreement between NURP and the U.S. Navy, several larger ROV's are 
available for research.</P>

The Rutgers University Marine Field Station (RUMFS) at Tuckerton is situated 
at the end of a peninsula adjacent to Little Egg Inlet and is the site of a 
former U.S. Coast Guard Lifesaving Station.  Facilities include the
R/V CALETA
a 30 ft. (9 m) aluminum hull research vessel, equipped with an A-frame and 
winches.  The Institute has recently (August 1996) taken delivery of the 
R/V ARABELLA, a 48 ft. (14.6 m) fiber glass hull research vessel.  Several 
small boats, docking facilities for larger vessels, analytical laboratories, 
running
seawater lab, dark room, dive locker, dormitories and a classroom also are 
available.  This field station serves as the shore base for the Institute's 
Long-Term Ecosystem Observatory on the continental shelf (LEO-15).  Research 
activities focus on fishery-related investigations including recruitment of 
marine organisms, early life history studies, and studies of sediment 
transport on the continental shelf.<p>

Renovations of the facility were completed in 1995.  Additions to the RUMFS 
complex are a culture room, five new independent seawater labs, a LEO-15 room 
where the fiber optic link from the offshore observatories terminates at the 
observatories control console.  Also included are expanded dry lab facilities 
and additional office space.  Construction on a new 10-bedroom dormitory 
facility, approximately 5 miles from the RUMFS complex, was completed in 
late 1994 (5,528 sq. ft.).  This facility can house as many as 20 students, 
faculty and visiting scientists.  The dormitory has a large meeting room (up 
to 40 individuals), extensive kitchen facilities, a mud room, and laundry 
facilities.  Also at the dormitory site is a 2,068 sq. ft. warehouse, with an 
outside fenced in storage yard.  From these additions, more space at the 
marine lab will be devoted to research activities of visiting investigators 
using undersea facilities.  Photos by E.L. Creed.<p>
