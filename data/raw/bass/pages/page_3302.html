<p> <font face="AGaramond Bold" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Dallas, TX--</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">After checking out the Fort Worth 
    steakhouse scene over the past few years, we decided to descend upon the 
    Dallas dining scene and see why Al Biernat's steakhouse, is ranked the best 
    in Dallas and possibly after we finished dining, one of the best in the 
    United States.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">So what makes this place an award 
    winner, when there are so many great steakhouses nationwide? Well it all 
    starts with the proprietor Al Biernat. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernat%20in%20front%20of%20bar%20story.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="244">Not 
    only has Al combined his 22 years of experience in the restaurant business, 
    in which he helped propel several of the well known Palm restaurants to 
    their current status, he combines his attitude towards customer service and 
    commitment to have the best dining experience possible and puts that out 
    every night in his restaurant.&nbsp; </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Things such as Biernat coming 
    into the restaurant on his day off to sat down with our staff, told us about 
    why this place ranks where it does, we had no further questions as to why 
    this place is what it is. There are just three words to describe the dining 
    experience, “Off 
    the Hook.” </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Before you even enter the 
    restaurant, you will see why Al Biernats is our number one choice in Dallas 
    for steak. Just like the Porsches, Bentley’s and Rolls Royce’s that sit next 
    door at Dallas’ most prestigious car dealership Park Place, this steak house 
    says prestige from the outside.&nbsp; Sitting by itself, the décor of the 
    restaurant doesn’t stop on the outside.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Once you have arrived, Valet 
    Parkers will promptly greet you, taking your car and leading your to 
    entrance.&nbsp; Once inside you will see what Al has done to make this place 
    unique, which starts with one of the hottest bar designs we have seen in a long time  greeting 
    his patrons. It will capture all with its artwork that was created by San 
    Antonio artist Larry Brooks. It is just a piece of work to look at. It’s 
    hidden faces and characters and the vibrant colors make this one of the best 
    greeting we’ve had entering any restaurant. After looking, the staff will 
    continue your enjoyable experience.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Speaking of staff, this brings us 
    to the second feature of the restaurant that will capture your attention, 
    the attentiveness of the staff. We thought the staff at the Palm catered to 
    its patrons, but Al Biernats does one better by hiring only the best in the 
    business.&nbsp; Our waiter has been serving up steak for over 30 years and 
    knows the meaning of customer service. You don't have a college age kid waiting your table 
    and treating you like one of his friends. If you need it, 
    guaranteed it will be there. Like a fine watch that needs no tuning, the staff 
    is exactly that.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">As you are seated, another 
    feature of Al Biernat's that will continue to set this place apart from the 
    others, the napkins. Okay this might sound a bit ridiculous that we are 
    talking about napkins, but the black napkins were introduced as a way to 
    have patrons leave the restaurant lint free and sure enough we checked our 
    pants and no lint. It’s no fun going out for an awesome dinner and then 
    having it ruined moments before a big outing when you are left searching for 
    a lint brush. In some restaurants, how you leave is not even a thought, at 
    Al Biernat's, its a reality.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Since we have talked so much 
    about what the restaurant has offer, we might as well tell you that Al has 
    built such a great reputation as the best in Dallas, that A-LIST celebrities pour into the 
    restaurant on a regular basis. Many have left their individual mark, some of 
    which you can see lining the walls. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">From Troy Aikman to Angie Harmon, Al has 
    developed a client list that knows him by name, we even spotted Dallas Stars 
    million dollar man Mike Modano having dining in the private room behind us. 
    “ I do a lot with these guys during the season. They come in after the games 
    and have dinner. They are my personal friends.”&nbsp; We give them what they want 
    and what the others can not offer,” said Biernat.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some of the extra amenities found 
    at this steakhouse that you will not find anywhere else are features like 
    the special sound system Biernat had installed featuring separate channels for each part of the 
    restaurant and bar area. “ We can have people in the private area listening 
    to music of their choice at full blast that will not disturb any of our 
    other patrons or we can turn it up in the bar area, what ever sets the tone. 
    “These are things you do not find anywhere, especially in a steakhouse.”</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">If you thought Al Biernat's sounds 
    cool after all we have described, wait until you taste their mouth watering 
    appetizers, entrees and homemade desserts prepared fresh by their in-house 
    pastry chef. No matter what you choose it will be something not to forget 
    and something to keep you coming back.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernats%20appetizer%20sampler%20story.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="201">We 
    started the evening with the appetizer sampler, which looked more like a 
    meal of its own when it hit the table. Complete with three huge crab cakes, 
    three jumbo shrimp and fresh calamari, if you like seafood any of these 
    appetizers will be for you.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The crab cakes, which had almost 
    absolutely no fillers and the lump crabmeat, could be seen the minute it was 
    placed on the table. If you like shrimp, these Tempura Jumbo beasts along with 
    Field greens and Honey Dijon can not be missed.&nbsp; Nothing less than 
    spicy and filling with the shrimp. After the shrimp, grab a hold of the 
    Potato Crusted Calamari and dip it into the Red Wine Diablo Sauce served on 
    the side and all you will be able to do is ask for more. It's spicy as well, 
    but has the kick that keeps you asking for more.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The appetizer sampler was 
    specially prepared for us and it allowed us to give patrons a chance to see 
    what was the appetizer menu was all about. Any of the three options are very 
    enjoyable and if you like it as much as we did, you may opt for all of these 
    three on their own in case you do not want to share. We will admit, sharing 
    is very difficult because nothing will be left on the plate long enough to.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">With appetizers such as the ones 
    offered at Al Biernat's, they are just a perfect warm up for what is next. They are a great warm-up to any meal, because entrée are just as 
    delicious if not better.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernats%20porterhouse%20story.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="234">Our first selection 
    from the dinner menu was the 
    Porterhouse Steak, which unlike some steakhouses, give you more strip then 
    filet, this steak&nbsp; came with enough beef to share. Each steak that you 
    will be cutting into is some the worlds best beef coming directly from 
    Chicago’s Allen Brothers Stockyards.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Even while aged steaks are 
    extremely short to come by right now due to the overwhelming demand and cows 
    coming in a bit smaller than normal, Al Biernats excepts no substitutes when 
    it comes to your satisfaction in the steak department, he will always have 
    the best beef found any where in the USA.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernats%20lamp%20chops%20story.jpg" align="right" width="243" height="201">Next, we were almost swept off 
    our feet by the Colorado Lamb Chops, which were so tender a knife wasn’t 
    even needed to slide the meat off of bones. Your proportion will once again 
    be more than average and more than filling. The chops are available for $31.95 
    and highly recommended. If you like wine with your meal, then if you 
    happened to miss the bottles as you walked in, then a list that is sure to 
    delight is available for you to select from.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernats%20sea%20bass%20story.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="234">Lastly, 
    if the seafood from earlier left you eager for more. We highly recommend the 
    Pan Seared Sea Bass, which looked more like an entire fish than just a piece 
    of it. It is complimented with wild rice and served over Lobster Risotto and 
    the Basil Infused Olive Oil makes this selection out of this world. It was a 
    tough match-up against the Salmon for $23.95, which is once again covers the 
    entire plate from side to side.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernats%20wine%20story.jpg" align="right" width="234" height="316">While 
    all of the dinner selections are unbelievable, what is more amazing then 
    anything on&nbsp; the menu is the extensive selection of wine on hand. 
    Nationally recognized sommeller Todd Lindcome has put together a list of 
    wines almost as grand as the State Texas itself, which includes 650 
    different selections and approximately 10,000 bottles of wine, some so rare 
    they don't even want to part with them. Todd will be more than happy to make 
    a selection that is right for you, just another feature of having a great 
    dining experience at Al Biernats.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">After a complete meal from Al 
    Biernat's, there 
    will barely be any room left in your stomach for dessert, but these homemade 
    choices are well worth saving space for.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">
    <img border="1" src="al%20biernats%20cheesecake%20story.jpg" align="right" width="299" height="229">From 
    Cheesecake to the fresh Key Lime Pie with Berries, there is a dessert for 
    everyone. Do not miss the Texas Pecan Pie a la mode with Chocolate and 
    Caramel sauces, the presentation alone is almost ordering them to check it out. 
    The sauces with the Pecan pie are simply mouth watering.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">As we finished our meal, we were 
    once again greeted by Biernat, just as he does with most of the patrons. 
    Most of&nbsp; his customers he knows on a personal level after they have eaten here 
    just once. This is a place that will have you hooked like a fish and the 
    food is like a pheromone, it will keep you coming back time after time.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Al Biernat's is located just 
    minutes from Downtown Dallas and reservations are strongly 
    recommended, because even with the open area seating they can fill the place 
    quickly and with the selections available, no one is quick to leave.</font></p>
