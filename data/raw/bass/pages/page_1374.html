<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">After a short attempt to learn trumpet when he was a child et and a crossing of the sonorous desert that lasted four years, Frantz came back to music when he discovered the bass. This first approach took place in 1978 with his first band Ortaxe ! During this period, he discovered Genesis, et this "revelation" encouraged him to practice on his instrument even more seriously.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">So, a few years later, he started to study the music theory again, and had some lessons (with Daniel Mathieu), which allowed him to approach other musical styles such as jazz.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">In 1986, he discovered the lyrical singing et then returned to the conservatoire. At the same time, he performed in several lyrical shows, mainly as a chorister, which allowed him during this period to earn his living. Indeed, Frantz is gifted of a superb bass-baritone voice, that you can hear several times on the album.</FONT></P>

ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="9" WIDTH="276" HEIGHT="248" ALT="Beatles"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">He didn't give up the rock however, and founded Open with Gilles Safaru and Christophe Rocher (currently members of Indigo) and Alain Miraucourt (Media-Studio sound engineer).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">After a first short encounter with some members of Morrigan (at that time, Horizon), he joined the band for good in 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Inside Morrigan, Frantz is not only the bass player, but also psychologist (Thank God!</FONT></P>

HSPACE="9" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="200" ALT="Genesis"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">His musical influences are quite wide, Frantz is indeed a classical music lover, and more specifically lyrical music; one can quote in particular Gabriel Faur&eacute;, Mozart, Puccini, Debussy, among many others. He also likes "Voices", Noa for example. He appreciates traditional music too, with a weakness for these native to Middle East countries, and Indian music. His rock influences, are mostly the Beatles, Genesis, Sting and Police… Frantz favourite bass player is Tony Levin, for he is bald, but also because, although the great range of his musical performances, he has got a very personal style. "He doesn't play BASS GUITAR, but rather BASS in the very musical meaning".</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Frantz feels a great admiration for Peter Gabriel, not only for his musical works but also for the intelligence with which, as a mere human being, he expresses very generous ideas,  that are not very widespread in the rock world, and that make music not an aim, but a means of men's rapprochement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">One can conclude on Frantz, that he considers music, not like an accumulation of disparate parts, but like some parts that make a whole.</FONT></P>
