<td><b>Shallow Water Habitat Monitoring Methodology Study</b>

<p>The CALFED Bay-Delta Program has emphasized restoration of shallow water

habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.&nbsp; Although never formally

defined, local working definitions typically consider water &lt; 3 m deep

to constitute ‘shallow water habitat’.&nbsp; Obviously, it is anticipated

that restoration projects include post-project monitoring to determine

if objectives are being met.&nbsp; This study assessed the performance

of numerous gear types throughout the Delta in 2000-2001.&nbsp; The project

lead, Dr. Michael Chotkowski (US Bureau of Reclamation) is currently analyzing

data and, in conjunction with the project co-principal investigators (Matt

Nobriga of the AES and Randall Baxter of the California Department of Fish

and Game), will prepare an Interagency Ecological Program technical report

summarizing all findings.&nbsp; Peer-reviewed journal publications also

may be prepared where appropriate.

<td><b>Shallow Water Habitat Predator-Prey Dynamics Study</b>

<p>Matt Nobriga of the AES is leading this project with co-principal investigators

Dr. Michael Chotkowski of the US Bureau of Reclamation, and Randall Baxter

and Michael Dege of the California Department of Fish and Game. Numerous

papers have been published on the ecology of lower food web organisms in

the San Francisco Estuary.&nbsp; Despite increased focus on the roles of

higher trophic level organisms in the estuarine and tidal freshwater food

webs in recent years, knowledge of the higher trophic levels still lags

behind the lower trophic levels.&nbsp; The CALFED Bay-Delta Program has

emphasized restoration of shallow water habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin

Delta.&nbsp; Although never formally defined, local working definitions

typically consider water &lt; 3 m deep to constitute ‘shallow water habitat’.&nbsp;

Our ability to predict the success of many currently proposed restoration

strategies is hindered by our lack of understanding of the function and

influence of higher trophic level organisms.&nbsp; There is considerable

interest in increasing our understanding of what if any influence two popular

non-native sport fishes, striped bass and largemouth bass, exert on native

fishes protected under the state and federal Endangered Species Acts.&nbsp;

This study is investigating the ecology of striped bass and largemouth

bass, as well as a native piscivore, the Sacramento pikeminnow.&nbsp; We

are assessing the habitat use, diets, prey selectivity, and relative predation

influence of these fishes in the Delta.&nbsp; Field work began in 2001

and is expected to continue through 2004.&nbsp; Comprehensive data analysis

and reporting will begin in 2005.</td>
