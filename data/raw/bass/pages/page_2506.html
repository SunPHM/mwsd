Charter Flight service is available through Melaire LTD. at 807-274-6411. The waterway consists of Lower and Upper Manitou Lakes which join into the Manitou Stretch and Esox Lake giving you over 32,000 acres plus. The crystal clear waters can reach depths up to 300 feet. The rocky shoreline, numerous islands and many bays give great structure for the fishing and also offer shelter whether it is windy or calm. With this variety of waters it consistently produces above average catches of LAKE TROUT, SMALL MOUTH BASS, NORTHERNS and those MANITOU MONSTER MUSKIES!<br>
