					<p>Two remarkable days last month, three monster bass &#151;&nbsp;all more than 15 1/2 pounds, one topping the 16 1/2-lb. mark &#151; all caught in Georgia.<br>
						
						The two bigger bass were caught by one man, Sam Taylor of Box Springs. Sam was featured in GON last September with three bass in our exclusive Biggest Bass rankings. Sam now has five bass on those all-time rankings, including the new No. 8 that he caught on March 15 from a 14-acre lake in Marion County. <br>
						
						&#147;The day before I caught a 7- and an 11-pounder,&#148; he said. &#147;The beds were showing up everywhere, but the big females weren&#146;t on them yet.&#148; <br>
						
						At about 12:30 p.m. on March 15, Sam spotted a bed in deep water near the mouth of a slough. <br>
						
						&#147;I didn&#146;t see a fish on it, so I fished on in to the back. On the way out,  I remembered that bed.&#148;<br>
						
						Sam was fishing with a watermelon-seed 4-inch Gambler tube on a weighted hook. <br>
						
						&#147;I never saw the fish, but as soon as that big tube hit the area, she slammed it, and here we went.&#148;<br>
						
						The bass weighed 16.58-lbs., the eighth best weight ever verified on a Georgia bass.<br>
						
						The next day, Sam was back on the Marion County property, only he was trying a different 7-acre lake, one of four small lakes on the property. <br>
						
						&#147;I actually saw this fish. She was in an area close to a bed, but there wasn&#146;t a male on the bed. It was exa<img src="../Images/giantbass1.jpg" width="200" height="166" border="3" align="left">ctly quarter to 1:00 when I caught her. All I had tied on then was a watermelon-seed Fluke. I skipped it across the water in front of her and just let it fall. I saw her gills flare, and when I set the hook she came straight up out of the water.&#148;<br>
						
						That monster weighed 15.96 pounds and ranks as Georgia&#146;s No. 16 bass of all-time.<br>
						
						Both bass were weighed and witnessed on certified scales at a U.S. Post Office.<br>
						
						Sam, who fishes exclusively for giant bass year-round on smaller lakes, is convinced there are some bass in Georgia make his 16 1/2-pounder look small.<br>
						
						&#147;I&#146;ve seen some fish that were just huge. Georgia has the genetics to produce another world record, but those fish aren&#146;t in a big reservoir. They&#146;re in little lakes that you wouldn&#146;t think twice about having bass like that.&#148;<br>
						
						The other giant bass caught last month was boated by another familiar face to GON readers. David Hudson of Warner Robins is a big-bass fanatic. He appeared on the May cover last year with a Lake Varner 9-pounder. David travels the state fishing small lakes known to produce bass over 10 pounds. On  March 16, David was easing along the shallows of Dodge County Public Fishing Area (PFA), a 104-acre state-owned lake.<br>
						
						&#147;I found her about 9:15 and fished for her for about an hour and a half, then I left her to let her settle down. A lot of times if you wait until the sun gets a better angle they&#146;ll come up in the bed a little better. I went back at 12:30 and finally got her to hit at about 2:20.&#148;<br>
						
						David was using his standard big-fish bait, a jig with a big pork chunk. <br>
						
						The 24 1/2-inch long bass weighed 15.53-lbs. and places No. 22 on the all-time rankings.<br>
						
						&#147;Thank God for dad and Baltimore minnows,&#148; David said. &#147;He took me when I was three years old to a little pond outside of Warner Robins. I was sitting on a dock in his lap, and I reeled in a 5-lb. bass. I have never been the same since.&#148;<img src="../Images/giantbass2.jpg" width="200" height="247" border="3" align="left"></p>
