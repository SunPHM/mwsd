            so different from that of Australia. Each class only has nine students 
            and there are mostly only two classes per year level. So, the school 
            is very small but ranges from Grade 1 to Year 11. Most of the teachers 
            are Greenlandic but several come from Denmark and this adds to the 
            children's cultural and social development. They can all speak at 
            least three languages: Greenlandic, Danish and English but some better 
            than others.</span></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span

            in this class make such items as sealskin gloves, pants, jackets and 
            a wide range of other items like pencil cases, pillows and bags. As
