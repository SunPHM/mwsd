<img src="images/bass2.jpg" width="432" height="444" align="right"><!-- description -->If you caught a fish worth $100,000, would you throw it back? That's what top
professional anglers do, because in the high stakes world of freshwater bass
tournament fishing where six-figure cash pay outs, big-ticket product prizes
and lucrative sponsorships lure winner and wannabe alike, the only good fish
is a live one.<br>
<br>
Of course they take the fish to the bank first, so to speak, to be weighed in
and tallied up at tournament headquarters. In this kind of competition, total
live catch weight counts for points and mere ounces can make or break a winner.
<p>So nobody wants their score cut for weighing in with a dead fish. That's one
  of the rule changes made years ago when tournament promoters realized that
  piles of dead bass left in the wake of a tournament could kill the golden goose. </p>
<p>Instead of pitching the catch in the back of a pickup truck, as they did in
  the early days, promoters now take pride in &quot;recycling&quot; fish for
  tomorrow's tournaments through careful handling and return to the water.</p>
<p>So, while dead bass in the weigh-in baskets are a rarity today, what happens
  to these fish after they go back in the water?</p>
<p><strong>Stayin' Alive</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The first few days after release is critical and if we're going to see
  mortality among tournament-caught fish, it will show up then,&quot; reports
  Dr. Harold Schramm, who heads the U.S. Geological Survey Cooperative Fish and
  Wildlife Research Unit at Mississippi State University.</p>
<p>Scientists like Schramm, who has studied freshwater bass and tournament fishing
  for 25 years, call it post-release or delayed mortality and it continues to
  be a hidden problem for an industry that so publicly extols the virtues of
  catch-and-release.</p>
<p>But in a paper presented last May at the World Recreational Fishing Conference
  in Darwin, Australia, Schramm noted that even though great strides had been
  made in reducing delayed mortality in tournament-caught fish during the 1970s,
  overall the rate has remained between 26% to 28% for the past two decades.</p>
<p>That's a pretty good record, Schramm says, and it points to angler acceptance
  of the &quot;don't kill your catch&quot; ethic instilled by tournament pioneer,
  Ray Scott, founder of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.), which
  sponsors 20 of the top-money tournaments in the U.S. Scott's message led to
  refinements in boat design to include livewells with aerators to oxygenate
  the water and improved equipment shoreside to reduce stress on the fish during
  weigh-in so they could be released alive.</p>
<p>The goal now is to encourage tournament organizers to use new techniques and
  equipment for handling the fish between the time it's weighed in and when it
  goes back in the water.</p>
<p>&quot;There are three times during a tournament when you can kill a fish after
  it's caught,&quot; reports Bruce Shupp, conservation director of B.A.S.S. &quot;The
  first is in the boat's livewell if you're not careful about the water quality
  and temperature. After that, it's between the boat and the scales when the
  fish are in holding bags waiting to weigh in and the water has to be kept fresh
  and oxygenated. </p>
<p>&quot;But it's what happens to the fish after the weigh-in that is so critical,
  when they are taken off the scales and held for release back into the water,&quot; he
  notes. &quot;And after this point, it's up to the tournament organizers; the
  anglers have done their part.&quot;</p>
<p>Depending on where the weigh-in takes place, often in a large public venue
  like a stadium, and the length of the event, the fish may have to be kept in
  holding tanks and transported by tank truck back to the water. </p>
<p>This is a critical time, Shupp says, since while largemouth bass are very
  hardy, they require roughly one gallon of adequately oxygenated water per pound
  of fish to survive. And at a tournament with several hundred boats bringing
  in as much as 2,000 lbs. of fish, overcrowding in the holding tanks can lead
  to severe stress that shows up later - belly up - as delayed mortality.</p>
<p>The competitor is not the problem, Shupp says, since for the most part tournament
  anglers understand their role while the boat and equipment manufactures are
  providing the products to help anglers fulfill it. To take bass survival to
  the next level, he says, means convincing tournament organizers that they need
  to do more to address the problem of delayed mortality.</p>
<p><strong>A Spoonful of Salt</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/bass3.jpg" width="207" height="362" align="left">To do the education job that's needed on the circuit, Schramm and another
  recognized expert on freshwater bass, Gene Gilliland of the Oklahoma Dept.
  of Wildlife Conservation, teamed up to produce a guidebook for tournament operators
  under the auspices of B.A.S.S. The book, called Keeping Bass Alive, incorporates
  the latest knowledge about stress factors in fish, livewell and holding tank
  water quality management and fish-friendly weigh-in and release procedures.</p>
<p>One technique that sounds like it's intended more for cooking fish than keeping
  them alive is the &quot;salt dip&quot; and it's catching on with some tournament
  organizers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an old hatcheryman's trick for handling brood fish and it really
  seems to improve survival and prevent delayed mortality,&quot; reports Jimmy
  Yarbrough, staff biologist with the American Bass Angler (ABA) Trail which
  produces over 550 tournaments annually in 39 states.</p>

<p><img src="images/bass4.jpg" width="325" height="255" align="right">The dip, a simple 3% solution of water and uniodized salt, stimulates
    the mucus cells to replenish the slime coat of the fish and can also kill
  any parasites
    or fungi. All fish landed at the ABA National Championship in Decatur, AL
  last October went through the dip just prior to release and an Auburn University
study measured just 6% mortality, 10 days after release.</p>
<p>While such results are impressive, Shupp says it's hard to talk to tournament
  organizers about delayed mortality when the fish are being brought to the weigh-in
  in such good condition these days. The problems only show up after the crowds
  are gone, the TV lights turned off and the last bassboat has been trailered
  off to the next tournament.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
