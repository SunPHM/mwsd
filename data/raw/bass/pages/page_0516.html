Westone produced this bass line in the mid-80's. Similar in appearance to a Steinberger 
headless bass, it is a four-string electric bass guitar of headless design. 
The Rail Bass is distinguished by the missing central body, replaced with 
a pair of pipes. It features a rail mechanism that allows you to slide and lock the pickup along the range of the rails. It has a 
long scale neck. It was produced in three finishes: white, red, and black. 

The original owner of this Rail purchased it new for $425 in 1986, and I bought this 
particular bass (#49269) from him in in December 2000. It is currently strung with Rotosound strings. 
<BR>
Because of its size, it is easy to transport and easy on the 
shoulder when you are playing it.

Bottom Line</A> bassplayer list archives comes this quote:<BR>
<i>To my knowledge the [Dan Armstrong] Londoner is the first of only three production basses to have this
feature, the others being the mostly unloved-and-unmissed Gibson Grabber
and the el-cheapo Westone "The Rail."</I>
