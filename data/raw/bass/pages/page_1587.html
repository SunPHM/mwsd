<P>
This site will also contain a special link for local musicians.<BR>
We will be providing a <I>free</I> "book" for bands looking for
<BR>players, backups, stand-ins, etc. and those who are looking FOR work.<BR>
No charge, no special setup...<BR>
All WE ask is that you keep it clean, "friendly" (no flames, put-downs, etc.),
and honest...<BR>
The local music groups have always "cross-pollinated" with each other,
helping out when needed - we are encouraging that!
