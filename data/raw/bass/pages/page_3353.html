<BR>
My lovely girlfriend Dawn and I received a delightful gift from my sister and brother-in-law this year as a sort of combined graduation-birthday-Christmas gesture.  They sent us a gift certificate to Le Cirque in New York City.  It was such a thoughtful and extravagant gesture that I hope they frequently combine special occasions in such a manner in the future!<BR>
<BR>
I had never heard of Le Cirque (I must be terribly out of the loop!) but Janet and Bob (my sister and B-I-L) had in Southern France so it must be pretty darned famous.  This NYC staple is the work of the Maccioni family and has enjoyed great success and acclaim since 1974.  In 1997 it moved to its current location on Madison Ave. and 51st St. in the Villiard House, also occupied by The New York Palace hotel.  Le Cirque has since opened restaurants in the Bellagio in Las Vegas and in Mexico City at Camino Real Hotel.<BR>
<BR>
Having gathered a little info (coat and tie required!) and made reservations (a week or so in advance for weekdays, a little more for weekends) we were off for a night of decadent cuisine in Midtown Manhattan.  My apologies for the spotty picture quality.  We tried to be slightly less gauche by turning off the flash at least.  The results are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/decor.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
Le Cirque is lavishly decorated with a vaguely circus-like theme and an old-world, New York City interpretation of European luxury.  We ate in the Hunt Room, decorated with elaborately carved walnut panels and Baroque paintings, set off by dramatic swatches of deep pink and beige.<BR>
<BR>
The menu was largely what is available online here:<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.lecirque.com/dinner.htm" target=_new>http://www.lecirque.com/dinner.htm</a><BR>
<BR>
Plus a large list of specials from which most of the five course Degustation Menu of seasonal selections was taken.  This is unfortunate for this recollection as I had the degustation menu and did not bother to keep a copy of the specials. <img src="/images/sad.gif" height=14 width=14>  Consequently, the kind readers will have to suffer through my less than adequate descriptions of those courses.  Dawn's selections were also mostly from the specials menu so bear with me.  BTW, it was only because the restuarant was fairly slow that the chef was willing to prepare the Degustation Menu for one, typically it is only served in pairs (I felt like such a lout! <img src="/images/happy.gif" height=14 width=14> ).<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/me.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
We started off with a half bottle of Taittinger "La Francaise" NV Brut and it was an excellent acompaniment to the first half of the meal.  Whoever said that champagne goes with everything couldn't have been more right.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/foie-gras.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
My first course was sauteed foie gras with, um, some sauces and stuff.  The red and clear suaces were both sticky, yummy, rich reductions of some sort and the meat itself was topped with pea-sprouts (?) a wafer thin slice of rye toast (?) and an even thinner slice of unidentified citrus fruit that was somehow crisped into a chip of sorts.  This dish was awesome.  The foie gras was perfectly prepared and the accompaniments were delightful.  The only problem with this dish was that it was so good that the rest of the meal would have a lot to live up to.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/crab.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
Dawn's first course was a delightful stone crab salad on a bed of slaw with grapefruit, avocado and sauce Louis (isn't that the name for the fancy version of Thousand Island dressing? <img src="/images/happy.gif" height=14 width=14> ).  The slaw and the sauce both had hints of crab flavor as well and the quality and sweetness of the meat was exceptional.  Nice job on this one guys!<BR>
<BR>
 <img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/lobster.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
My next course was lobster claw and tail with black truffle tortellinis in a, um, unidentifible, dark sauce (possibly similar to the black truffle vinaigrette the lobster salad is served with?).  This was also exquisite although the lobster tail was not quite as tender as one might've hoped.  An excellent dish but a slight let down after the devastating first course.  Dawn shared this one with me as she was playing the cheap date and only ordered four courses. <img src="/images/happy.gif" height=14 width=14><BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/risotto.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
Dawn's next course was butternut squash risotto with seared foie gras and leeks and it was awesome.  Dawn was trying the foie gras on an experimental basis and found it a little too "jiggly" for her tastes, but I valiantly finished the rest of the morsel for her.  The risotto was of a lovely consistency and the squash flavors were dramatic: earthy and sweet.  Yum!  The waiter commented about how clean Dawn's plate was and she assured him that she had stopped just short of licking the bowl.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/seabass.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
My next dish was a paupiette of Black Sea Bass wrapped in crispy potatoes on a bed of braised leeks and Barolo wine sauce.  This description from the menu is surprisingly accurate and descriptive although it was hard to imagine beforehand how the crisped mashed potatoe crust on the sea bass would actually come together.  I have no idea how they did it but the results were exquisite.  I was beginning to ruminate on the depth of skill necessary to create so many sauces that are on the surface fairly similar, but in flavor, texture and complimentarity to their respective dishes so strikingly different.  Of course, the champagne was starting to get to my head a little as well.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/pheasant.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
My final main course was a delightful sounding breast of pheasant with a sweet au jus reduction of some kind, served with a sweet potatoe puree, some unknown little root or nut like nuggets (vaguely like chestnuts?) and roasted salifies.  This dish was not as hot as it could have been and the pheasant was a little overcooked.  It was still delicious, but not a fitting crescendo to such an exquisite meal.  I should have gone with the veal.  <img src="/images/sad.gif" height=14 width=14>  <BR>
<BR>
With this course I had a glass of D'Arenberg Shiraz "The Footbolt" that was quite delicious if nearly completely wrong for the dish.  It was nobody's fault but my own that it paired so badly as I knew it would overpower the pheasant.  I'm a sucker for big, bold new world wines though and wanted to try this one anyway.  The wine was very tannic, peppery and bright with a relievingly long, lush, fruity finish when it first arrived but the flavors began to integrate more thoroughly as it opened up.  Even then it remained slightly conflicted if charmingly so.  <BR>
<BR>
 <img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/duck.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
Dawn's main course was outstanding however.  She had the duck magret dusted with "Espelette" pimento, golden duck rillette croutons, roasted salsifies and baby carrots.  This dish came together wonderfully even if the rillette croutons (crackers with some kind of delicious duck stuffing on top) were slightly salty.  The sommelier recommended a glass of Gigondas with this dish that was a perfect accompaniment.  Surprisingly jammy while still earthy and complex.     <BR>
<BR>
 <img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/brulee.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
For dessert Dawn had the universally recommended creme brulee and its renown is well-earned.  The slightly greenish color you notice in the picture is surprisingly accurate for reasons that are beyond my comprehension.  It was truly exquisite despite its non-traditional complexion.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/chocolate.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
I chose a tasting of hot and cold chocolate desserts and it was a fine choice.  The little cake on the far left was filled with a hot, fudgy goo and topped with a white and milk chocolate wafer.  This was the topper of the chocolate tastes.  The ice cream was good if unspectacular and the dark mousse next to it was wonderful.  The little bowl that looked like pot-de-creme had a crazy, citrusy flavor to it that we couldn't quite nail-down.  A little like lemon zest and/or Grand Marnier.  It was good, but so confoundingly unfamilar as to be hard to get one's palate around.  <BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/cookies.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
And of course there were petite fors.  They were lovely as was the espresso.  They were not nearly as out-of-focus as they appear either, although Dawn and I were by that point.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="http://www.tp178.com/jd/le-cirque/us.jpg"><BR>
<BR>
Here we are on our way out, fattened and happy, ready for our post holiday diets. <img src="/images/happy.gif" height=14 width=14><BR>
<BR>
Thanks Janet and Bob, it was a delightful evening that we will cherish fondly!<BR>

That's great advice.  I've also found that one can get a wonderful meal at the bar of fine restaurants, and without all the fuss in some ways.  <BR>
<BR>
No watches spotted there, but I did have brunch today with a watch collector I was meeting for the first time (he was a wearing an Urwerk wandering jump hour, talk about making a good first impression on me!) and a guy sat down at the table next to us wearing a steel Aquanaut.  How often does that happen?<BR>
