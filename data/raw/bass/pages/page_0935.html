        <hr noshade size="1" color="#333333">
        <p>Right from the get-go, things didn't sound good. This was Opeth's
        first trip to Vancouver and the third date on their North American tour.
        Three days earlier, the band made a last-minute cancellation of their
        Edmonton date, citing drummer Martin Lopez' illness as the reason. Two
        nights later, the Calgary date was also questionable but the band
        decided to carry on with the show, but with a reduced set and their drum
        tech sitting behind the kit. Opeth played 6 acoustic songs and were
        profusely apologetic for the situation and even offered discounts to
        those in attendance. The next night was the Vancouver show and I didn't
        think it was going to happen. Just a couple of hours before showtime, it
        was announced that legendary drummer Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel, Death,
        Testament, Strapping Young Lad) would be filling in for Lopez. This was
        excellent news, as not only is Hoglan one of the greatest drummers
        playing today, but indeed the show would go on!</p>
        <p>When I first arrived at the venue, I was greeted by the ubiquitous
        merchandise booth flogging everything from Opeth thongs and stickers to
        Moonspell t-shirts to DevilDriver toques. What still amazes me is not
        only what these people charge for their swag, but that people actually
        pay it. DevilDriver toques selling for $35 and shirts for $55?!?! It's a
        piece of $2 cotton with an iron-on sticker, for god's sake!!! (In
        comparison, I should mention that a snazzy Metal-Rules.com toque can be
        yours for the bargain basement price of $15.99 at <a href="http://www.metal-rules.com/CD/MetalRules-toque.htm">www.metal-rules.com/CD/MetalRules-toque.htm</a>.)</p>
        <p><img border="0" src="images2004/devildriver_dez3.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="275" height="413">I'll
        admit I was a bit apprehensive about DevilDriver. This is the new band
        fronted by Dez Fafara, the screamer of former goth/nu-metal pioneers
        Coal Chamber. His image and musical style with that band was not
        something that I particularly liked but I thought, &quot;New band…new
        music…might be good.&quot; With that being said, DevilDriver quickly
        made me forget Coal Chamber ever existed once they hit the stage. Their
        new, self-titled album was just released on Roadrunner Records and
        Fafara is certainly the leader of the band. He has assembled a young
        band of unknowns and opted for a heavier style, as well. Gone are the
        down-tuned, &quot;chugga-chugga&quot; nu-metal riffs and annoying vocal
        style. They have been replaced with some thrashy, dual guitar breaks
        played over a death growl/black scream from Fafara. Bassist John Miller
        is a strong stage presence as well, not only because he is the only one
        with long hair, but his thumping licks are a nice bonus to the music.
        The band played a 30-minute set and covered most of their new CD
        including &quot;I Could Care Less,&quot; &quot;The Mountain,&quot;
        &quot;What Does It Take (To Be A Man),&quot; and &quot;Die (And Die
        Now).&quot; Fafara had plenty of stage banter with the audience and I
        didn't hear a single &quot;BOO&quot; from the crowd. Maybe growing his
        hair out, ditching the silly braided goatee and donning a Motorhead
        shirt wasn't such a bad career move after all! Based on the songs I
        heard live, I wouldn't say it's the album of the year, nor would I
        recommend anyone should immediately rush out and buy DevilDriver's CD,
        but Fafara has certainly squashed any doubts about whether or not Coal
        Chamber's influence still runs through his veins. A pleasant surprise.</p>

        Moonspell was the middle act on the bill and being their first time in
        Vancouver, the band garnered a pretty warm reception. Moonspell's hybrid
        of goth/doom/black metal can be a bit tough to take at times given its
        lyrics, but as a live act, they are very compelling. Vocalist Fernando
        Ribeiro is &quot;a graduate of the tall, dark and handsome school of
        European studs,&quot; according to one of the female fans I spoke to and
        he is indeed a commanding presence on stage. Second
        guitarist/keyboardist Pedro Paixao appears to do double duty as the
        band's sound tech, setting and coordinating levels before their set.
        During &quot;The Southern Deathstyle,&quot; Ribeiro appeared on stage
        with what can best be described as tribal skull stick. I'm not sure what
        the significance of it was, but it certainly looked cool! Ribeiro also
        took a respectful turn at cymbals during the 50-minute set finale,
        &quot;Full Moon Madness.&quot; The band played killer versions of
        &quot;Full Moon Madness&quot; and &quot;Opium&quot; from 1996's
        IRRELIGIOUS CD and &quot;In And Above Men&quot; from their latest
        release, THE ANTIDOTE. They chose to omit from their set any tracks from
        their much-loathed SIN/PECADO and THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT albums, but every
        other release received fair treatment. There was plenty of headbanging
        done to Moonspell and the Vancouver crowd seemed thrilled having them
        here.</p>

      <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images2004/opeth_akerfeldt_chair3.jpg" align="right" hspace="8" vspace="5" width="275" height="413">The
      clutter of the stage soon cleared and a single chair was brought out and
      placed directly at center-stage. There was some controversy over the
      setlist chosen for this tour given that Opeth had already toured in
      support of their acoustic CD, DAMNATION. Fans hoped for a
      &quot;metal&quot; Opeth show, but because of Martin Lopez' absence, they
      were forced to improvise and strip things down until his return. Once the
      chair was put in place, the fans got restless, knowing they weren't going
      to get their metal fix. Despite notices clearly posted outside the venue
      that a full refund would be given or a $5 cash rebate to those chosen to
      go in anyway, people still seemed shocked, for some reason. Also on the
      notice was that Opeth would be doing a &quot;meet-and-greet&quot; at the
      merchandise booth after the show. Before they even played a song, Mikael
      Akerfeldt made a statement of apology and explained the situation. He
      seemed genuinely disappointed that they couldn't play their planned set,
      but appreciated everyone's understanding that still came to witness
      Opeth's first Vancouver appearance. Opeth's drum tech, Damon, was
      introduced and given a rousing round of applause for stepping up to the
      plate. He did a fine job despite requiring notes next to him for the
      songs. The band kicked off the show with a haunting rendition of &quot;In
      My Time Of Need&quot; from DAMNATION. This is one of the band's best
      songs-acoustic or not-and Akerfeldt's remarkable voice didn't miss a note.
      Following &quot;To The Rid The Disease&quot; was an interesting choice
      given the circumstances-a cover song! Taking a stab at Deep Purple's
      &quot;Soldier Of Fortune&quot; from 1974's STORMBRINGER album, the band
      did the classic justice with their use of acoustic guitar and Akerfeldt's
      spot-on David Coverdale imitation. &quot;Hope Leaves,&quot; another
      DAMNATION track, ended the acoustic set on a high note. With it's Pink
      Floyd-like passages, this song hearkens back to the psychedelic rock of
      the 1970s, which Akerfeldt is a notorious fan of. This track is another
      stellar song that I was happy to see performed live.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images2004/opeth_akerfeldt_chair2.jpg" width="400" height="310"></p>
      <p align="left">With that, Akerfeldt said that they would be doing some
      &quot;metal songs&quot; and that they &quot;found a drummer in the
      house.&quot; As expected, out strode the mighty Gene Hoglan to chants of
      &quot;HOGLAN!! HOGLAN!! HOGLAN!!&quot; Akerfeldt proceeded to announce
      that Hoglan called him 2 days earlier and said he would be willing to fill
      in on the Vancouver date. With one day to practice and learn the songs ,
      Akerfeldt said Hoglan nailed one song on the first take and the second
      song in 2 takes! Akerfeldt joked, &quot;We thought we were technical
      metal, but he made it look like child's play!&quot; The band kicked into a
      searing version of &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; from BLACKWATER PARK to
      the fans delight. As promised, Hoglan didn't miss a cue and made people
      wonder aloud, &quot;Martin WHO?!?&quot; &quot;Demon Of The Fall&quot; from
      MY ARMS, YOUR HEARSE concluded the band's all-too-brief 50-minute set,
      leaving fans chanting for more. Unfortunately, Akerfeldt stated earlier
      that there would be no encore under the circumstances and the band stuck
      to their word.</p>

      the show, a line-up for the 20-minute meet-and-greet began to form and it
      appeared that only a slice of their crowd would get a chance for an
      autograph, photo or handshake. When all was said and done, the band stayed
      there until every last person standing in line got a chance to meet
      them-VERY COOL GUYS!</p>
      <p align="left">While the masses were up the street for the Nickelback and
      Staind show, Vancouver metalheads descended on The Commodore for what was,
      well, one of the more &quot;interesting&quot; shows I've seen in awhile.
      You can't fault Opeth for not trying to make the best of the situation.
      Short of putting on a free show, they did everything they could to
      accommodate the unfortunate circumstances that greeted them upon the
      arrival for the North American tour. Lopez reportedly returned to the band
      the next night in Seattle for the rest of the tour where a
      &quot;regular&quot; set was played. Still, Opeth promised to come back and
      play a full show for us later, so you can bet that we're holding them to
      it!!</p>
