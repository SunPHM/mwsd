            <strong><br>
            </strong>In July 1897 the Commissioners decided that two lighthouses should 
        be erected on the Haddingtonshire coast - on the Bass Rock and on a suitable 
        place near Dunbar - as the unlighted condition of the area was causing 
        concern.</font>
        </font>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consequently,
            Barns Ness Lighthouse was established in 1901 and a light was first
            shown from the Bass Rock on the evening of 1 November 1902. The cost
          of the Bass Rock Lighthouse was &pound;8,087:10:4.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bass 
          Rock is a massive crag rising out of the sea to a height of 350 feet 
          and it is about a mile in circumference. Through the Rock, from the 
          East to West, runs a natural tunnel, but this is not accessible except 
          at low tide.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Halfway up 
          the Rock stands the ruins of a Pre-Reformation Chapel which was dedicated 
          to Saint Baldfred, and was consecrated in the year 1542. Saint Baldfred 
          was said to have his cell on the Bass Rock, dying there about the year 
          606. The Bass has a long and varied history. It is mentioned in writings 
          dating back to the region of Malcolm Canmore and the first recorded 
          owner was Sir Robert Lauder, who was granted a character for it around 
          1316. This family (Lauder of Bass) retained ownership of the rock for 
          hundreds of years and must have been connected with the erection of 
          a Pre-Reformation Chapel which must be dedicated to St Balfred in 1542, 
          as well as being responsible for the building of the fortress.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/bassrock2.jpg" alt=" Bass Rock with pleasure boat from Leith   &copy;  NLB" width="170" height="214" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="2" align="right">Earlier,
            in 1671, Charles I claimed the Bass as Royal Property and it was
            sold
          to the crown for the sum of &pound;4,000 sterling by the then owner,
          Sir Alexander Ramsay of Abbotshall, Provost of Edinburgh. The bloody
          pages of the Bass Rock's history now unfold when, under another Lauder
          (dale) known as the Captain of the Bass, the fortress was turned into
          a prison for Presbyterian ministers. Between 1672 and 1688 some 40
          political/religious
          prisoners died in the dungeons of the rock. In 1691 during the reign
          of William and Mary, a party of four Jacobite prisoners escaped from
          their calls and captured the fortress when all the garrison was engaged
          in unloading coal. For the next three years they held the Bass for
          the
          Old Pretender and defied all attempts by Government forces to retake
          it. Aided by supply ships from France, this unique quartet even carried
          out raids on the Fife and Lothian coasts! In 1694 a more effective
          blockage
          finally starved them into submission, but they negotiated favourable
          terms and walked out free men! The fortress continued as a State Prison
          until demolished seven years later. In 1706, the Bass was sold to Sir
          Hugh Dalrymple, whose descendants still own it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From then, 
          up until the First World War, the rock was let out to tenants who earned 
          money by fishing, grazing sheep (Bass Mutton was a famous 18th Century 
          Edinburgh delicacy) and by killing young sea birds and collecting eggs. 
          The last tenant of the Bass, a Mr Easton, was a North Berwick fishmonger.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But
            the true owners of the Bass Rock are, of course, the birds, for almost
            every
          available inch is occupied by razorbills, guillemots, cormorants, puffins,
            eider ducks and various gull species. But the bird of the Bass is
            the
          Gannet or &quot;Solan Goose&quot; with a breeding colony of 30-40,000 
          pairs, making the Bass a mecca for international ornithologists. It 
          is thus only fitting that this superb sea bird's latin name &quot;Sula 
          Bassana&quot; should be derived from the word Bass. Even as long ago
          as 1792, the gannets of the Bass Rock were famous both for their numbers
          and as food. Find out more about the birds of the Bass from the <a href="../../historical/links.htm">Scottish 
          Sea Bird Centre</a> at North Berwick. </font></p>

          1988 when it was demanned, the Rock Lighthouse was lit by means of incandescent 
          gas obtained from paraffin oil of a high flash point. There was an oil 
          container in the Light Room to which there was connected an air container 
          and the oil was driven from its container by the air at pressure to 
          a vaporiser where it was converted into a bunsen gas for heating a mantle 
          which it rendered incandescent.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new light 
          is Biform ML300 Synchronised electric with Bifilament 20 watt lamp.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            Light was automated in 1988 and is now remotely monitored from the
            Board&#8217;s 
          headquarters in Edinburgh.<br>
