In my younger days that would have been an exceptional fish, certainly one over 10 lbs. 
A bass weighing a pound or so would have been "groceries", or released without much 
thought. If I caught a bunch of those and anybody asked if I was catching any, 
I'd have said "Nope, not really."
<p>
<br>
For a number of years I just kept wanting one "bigger than the last big one". 
From  3 lbs, then 4 lbs, then 5 lbs, and so on, until I finally got to the 
point where it wasn't likely I was ever to catch one much bigger than my 
current "big bass". The solution to that one was a relocation to the 
southern United States, to pursue the bigger bass. Sure enough, within 
6 months I finally caught a bass over 10 lbs, an 10 lb, 11 oz beauty taken 
on a buzzing spinnerbait in North Alabama one cold and windy October day. 
It made the local sports page, with a story covering the entire top of 
the sports section, big smiling photo included. It made the news as far 
away as Birmingham, Alabama. I received a letter from the sports writer 
of The Birmingham News, addressed to "Mike Lott, World Famous Bass 
Fisherman". We were even on T.V. , my bass and I. Watch out, Bill Dance 
and Roland Martin, there's a new kid on the block. This was a northern 
species bass, and a 10 lb northern species bass is rare indeed. She was 
25 inches long, and had a 28 inch girth,  sort of football shaped. 
That fish I had mounted, and to this day it retains a place of honor on my wall.
Hollywood was not interested in my story.
<P>
<BR>
That didn't stop my search for the "next bigger one." Every so often we'd 
make another  trip  in search of the "bass of a lifetime". We encountered 
them, sometimes big enough that if I told the stories you'd think I was 
lying. I'll be telling some of those stories on another page. We often fished 
Lake Jackson in northern Florida, using techniques 
proven by Bill O'Conner, who at that time had caught over 300 bass that were 
10 lbs plus. On several occasions my pals and I caught bass in the 10 lb. range, 
and I couldn't even begin to guess how many 7 to 10 lb. bass. Bunches of them.
Some of them were outstanding performers.
<BR>
<P>
On many occasions I fished "World Record Water" for other species of bass. 
Smith Lake Near Cullman, Alabama for Kentucky Spotted Bass, Wheeler, 
Wilson, and Pickwick lakes on the Tennessee River for Smallmouth Bass, 
the Suwannee River in Florida
for Suwannee Bass, and a place called Lady Ann Lake in North Alabama 
known for holding (at that time) the state record for Redeye Bass. 
It was my stated goal to catch a "bass-of-a-lifetime" of each of the 
7 species of bass. In the ensuing years I have managed to catch a 
nice selection of 6 of the 7 species. 
<P>
<BR>
It finally got to the point where I had to move to the center of the 
best bass fishing I could find. It was a tough choice, but I chose 
Tampa, Florida. I haven't been sorry. In the ensuing years I have 
learned a bunch of new ways to lose a big bass.
<BR>
<P>
Some of my  big bass encounters have been with out-of-state visitors that 
I have guided to trophies a few times, a number of broken lines, and 
other mishaps where the bass has been clearly seen to be a "bass of a 
lifetime". Once it was on a white willow-leaf spinnerbait at Teneroc, 
when my regular fishing partner took one look and said "There's your 13 
pound bass!" Ten seconds later, the hook pulled loose, strictly from 
the strength of the bass.
<P>
<BR>
Another time it was on a plastic worm in a canal, and I happened to 
have accidently left 10 lb line on my reel after a tournament. Duh. 
The bass clearly was a monster with a mouth the size of a 5 lb coffee 
can, pulling the boat against a Minn Kota trolling motor. She came to 
rest in a submerged treetop and nothing I could do would get her to 
swim out of there. Finally, I gently reeled in the line to the point 
where I could tell I was within an arms length of her position. When 
my hand touched the water, "PING", she broke the line and left for 
parts unknown.
<P>
<BR>
Worse even than those examples are the times when my  friends have 
"helped" me by grabbing the line, attempting to net the bass from the 
tail, actually broken the line with the net on one occasion, or similar 
comical situations. One of my friends has fallen out of my  boat on 3 
separate occasions. How many of those big bass were the "bass of a 
lifetime'? Today my answer would be "all of them", or "any of them".
<BR>
<P>
After fishing for bass for a quarter of a century, I have come to 
believe that any bass is a creature to be respected and appreciated. 
Would I mount any of those big fish today? Probably not. Would I be 
more careful to release the smaller bass unharmed? You bet I would. 
Today I am still concentrating my fishing in several areas in central 
Florida. Most of my spots are benefitting big time from catch and release fishing. 
<P>
<BR>
My most recent big bass event was watching my grandson (9yrs old) catch a 13 lb. 
female at Lake Kissimmee. 
We measured her and released her right away, and he now has a fine replica mount over the fireplace. Pretty cool to see her swim away.
<BR>
<P>
We are seeing a constant increase in the size and number of 
big bass caught in central Florida.
Certainly a contributing factor is the change in Florida's 
fishing laws, where the limits are now 5 bass per day, only 
one of which can be 24 inches or more. The minimum size is 
now 14 inches as well.
<P>
<BR>
Another factor contributing to the release of that Bass-of-a-lifetime, 
is the growing use of fiberglass replicas in taxidermy, as opposed to 
skin mounts. A fiberglass bass looks just as good, and resists damage 
better than a skin mount. Count in also the cost of skin mounting a bass 
properly these days, and it just makes more sense to go the 'glass 
route. All you need is a couple of good pictures and a measurement 
of the length and girth, and any good taxidermist can make a mount 
exactly like your "bass-of-a-lifetime."
<P>
<BR>
If you are interested in catching your "bass-of-a-lifetime", then the 
solution is at hand here. Contact Van Horn Charters and arrange a trip with 
Captain Ray. Chances are, you'll catch one. Let me point out a fact that some people may not be aware of. With all the hype about the big lakes in Florida, few people ever point out that before
George W. Perry caught his world record bass in south Georgia, where was the previous world record from? Hmmmm.... Lake Tarpon, Tarpon Springs, Florida. Is your bass of a lifetime swimming in Lake Tarpon or one of Captain Ray's secret spots?
<BR>
<P>
Just be sure you bring  
a few things, like a plastic measuring tape, (the kind they sell in 
sewing departments), a dependable pocket scale for weighing your fish, 
and TWO cameras. I'd recommend one dependable camera, and one 
disposable camera.
<BR>
<P>
Then, when you get your bass in the boat, take a measurement, 
weigh her out, take pictures with both cameras, and please release her.
<P>
<BR>
You'll benefit from knowing that your big bass is still swimming around 
out there gaining weight and making new generations of little bass.
