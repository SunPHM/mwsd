<h2>EJ's Tub Bass Is Autographed By "Riders In The Sky"</h2>
     The Grammy Award Winning band "Riders In The Sky" stopped by Chillicothe,
  Ohio on October 26, 2002.<br>
     They performed show #4579 in the auditorium of Smith Middle School.<br>
     "The Riders" are band of musicians that appeal to American Western music
  lovers of all ages.<br>
     <br>
     Among&nbsp;the people at their performance, was a long time fan and
one   of The Highpoint Brothers, our tub bass player, EJ.<br>
     <br>
     After the show, EJ waited patiently in the line for an autograph.<br>
     But an autograph on one of the typical items ( the program, a CD, etc. 
) was not  good enough for EJ. &nbsp;No.<br>
     When his turn came at the autograph table, EJ presented his tub bass.<br>
 The Riders seemed quite pleased   that a fellow musician would bring in
such an unusual instrument to be autographed.<br>
     In fact, after they autographed the neck of the tub bass, a couple of
 The  Riders played it for those gathered around!<br>
     <br>
     Shown below, Too Slim ( on the right ) autographs EJ's tub bass.<br>

     <br>
     The temptation to tickle the neck of EJ's bass was too much for Too
Slim.<br>
     Below, he slaps out a tasty tune on the instrument, to the pleasure
of  those gathered in the area.<br>

     After Too Slim had his fun, Woody ( their fiddle player ) took a turn.<br>

     So the next time you're at a show with The Highpoint Brothers, look
down   low on the neck of EJ's tub bass<br>
     ( below where you normally place your hand ) to see the autographs of
 "Riders  In The Sky"!<br>
