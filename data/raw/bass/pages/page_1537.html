<center>~@}--,-'----~<p>Turns out, i can boogie oogie oogie until others just can't *watch* me boogie no more<p>~@}--,-'----~<p>I think it’s been pretty well established that I am not classy.  This fact does not stop me, however, from attending classy events.  And it especially does not stop me from going to classy events where free food is involved.  Thus, my weekend.<p>Every year the theatre and music departments get together and host the Performing Arts Ball at the National Arts Centre.  Because we are Arts kids, and therefore contractually obligated to be “wacky” there is usually a theme involved.  It was our department’s year to pick so we suggested: 80’s Prom.  They countered with: no.  Further suggestions met with answers as varied as: nope, not likely, i don't think so, and stop it.  After much fussin’ and cussin’, our council decided to go Greek on their ass and made the ball The Festival of Dionysus — pretty much an excuse to dress in bedsheets and take blackmail photos.  And it totally beat the engineering kids which were doing something like "enchantment under the sea" which is cool if you want to ask that special someone to the grade 10 formal.  What followed was much whooping of up and plenty of ho-downing, with or without Jackie’s mother.  There was eating, there was dancing, there was singing of Billy Jean (in honour of the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/serialkeller/39125.html">costume</a> that got me the comp’d tickets in the first place).  And somewhere in the chaos I realized that Trasker can Do it Up Royal (not to be confused with me Doing A Royal… which may or may not happen if Wills gets bored with American chicks and comes back to the Commonwealth that lurves him).<p>After much hemming and hawing and some awesome suggestions from people as to what Goddess/nymph/Greek upstart to go as, I settled on Ate, not only the goddess of mischief, criminal folly and infatuatio, but also the name of one of my favourite activities in the past tense.  The boy went, of course, as the hapless victim of Ate.  This was accomplished by the inclusion of tags of the sticky variety and the use of a nearby sharpie.  We both dressed in black and I had some Greeky sandals (as opposed to geeky sandals), jewelry, the whole nine yards.  Which, if you hang out with me, you’ll know is something of a stunning revelation, as I usually look like the Salvation Army gangbeat me into their &#36;1.99 rack.  <p>Some things haven’t changed, though.  The shoes still come off before midnight.  And excitement is now officially a catalyst to drunken hilarity.  Which is good, at fuckin’ 7/50 a drink, ya hosers.  I feel like I should be part of a side show, with a man with a megaphone announcing me<p><i></P><P>“Behold!  Trasker the One-Drink Drunk!  Watch as she pumps her fist in the air after sniffing a bottle of vanilla flavouring!”</i><p>Truth is, I think it just gave me an excuse to be what I’ve always privately expected I am: Awesome.  Except for a brief and embarrassing silence towards what was heralded as “some Latin beats” I danced my heart out this weekend.  Danced until my radicchio salad caught in my throat.  Danced until I gave the kickass kids who actually wore togas (all of them theatre students, I might add) something to laugh about.  Danced until… well, until the music kids started line dancing.  <p>And what dances did I do?  Oh, what dances didn’t I do?  I did the microwave, the apple, the anglo WASP stomp (warning: doing this dance to anything but celtic music will result in a slipped disc and loss of respect), the postman and my beloved Jackie’s “What? What?” with Sara at my side.  I missed her so much, as did the dance floor.  If you need a mental picture of me dancing and you watch Six Feet Under, think of how David dances at the club in season 1.  That is completely me.  Especially the “bottle-in-the-hand-fist-knocking-on-the-door” dance, which I will freely admit, I rock at.  I’m almost as good at that as I am at my patented “Do I rock?  Yes I rock!” head toss with additional damn-I’m-sexy bedroom face-- coming soon to a dive near you.<p>In a group, all alone, harassing a beleaguered waiter for some “damn service over here” while bump-n-grinding my way to the pay bar, it’s all good.   I am a freak for the beat, using the precious downtime between songs to scream “Play freebird!”.  And if you slow dance with me?  I will rock your world.  I will ruin you for other women.  I will grab your ass and make you weep, only to come callin’ at 5:30 the next A-M (that’s how we say it in the hizz-ouse), beggin for me to swing you round the floor one more time, to Clapton.  This is a threat and a promise rolled up into a good ol’ shindig and wrapped up with a bow of too-cool-for-school.<p>And to all the music kids who mocked?  You dance like 6th graders, we are not “drama kids” until you take your rightful place as “band nerds”, and wearing togas is not lame.  Especially when you *fought* for that theme in the first place.  Jackazzles.  I’m glad “Home for a Rest” cleared the floor of you.<p>Wish you were there,</P><P><p>-Trasker.</P><P></font>
