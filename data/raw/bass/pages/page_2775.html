	  <p align="justify">  <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One
	      and a half hours drive east of El Fuerte and deep into the foothills of
	      the Sierra Madre's, is the new &quot;Mystery Lake
	    of Mexico,&quot; Huites, where a lakeside fishing camp for Villa Del Pescador
	    was completed in the summer of 1998. Lake Huites, constructed for irrigation
	    in 1991, was stocked with fast growing aggressive Florida strain hybrid
	    black bass three years ago. The lake has been protected from fishing
	    or netting since the stocking and will be managed as a catch and release
      bass fishing honey hole.El Fuerte near Lake Huites</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../images/roy_young_feb98.jpg" alt="lake huites bass fishing,lake huites mexico,mexico bass fishing,lake el salto,lake baccarac,lake aguamilpa,lake huites,lake guerrero,el salto bass fishing,baccarac bass fishing,aguamilpa bass fishing,huites bass fishing,guerrero bass fishing" width="215" height="312" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">The lake covers about 15 thousand acres and is loaded with cover and hungry
	    bass. The Florida hybrids are fast growers and are already reaching 7 pounds.
	    With the management strategy now in place these fish will be pushing 10
	    pounds this year. By this fall large numbers of 3 pound plus bass will be
	    caught.</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For more than two decades, Mexico has been a popular destination for American
	    bass anglers in search of schools of trophy largemouth bass. Unfortunately,
	    many of the once fabled Mexican bass impoundments no longer live up to their
	    legendary reputations - their fisheries having declined as a result of over-harvesting
	    of the - once plentiful - resource and drought conditions that resulted
      in poor water quality and a decline of baitfish species and bass populations.</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last four years,
	      however, one lake has emerged that is helping to restore the mystique
	      of Mexican bass fishing once again. The hottest bass lake in the world
	      might be Lake Huites, located on Mexico's West Coast, outside the city
	      of Los Mochis. When at full pool, Huites is a 30,000-acre man-made reservoir
	      that had been initially stocked with Florida strain largemouth bass fingerlings
	      to jump start the fishery. And these bass have taken a liking to the
	      mountainous climate, long growing season and an abundant, protein-rich
	      diet of tilapia and shad and are growing at a rapid rate. When conditions
	      are right, skilled anglers are catching in excess of 75 bass a day and
	      10 pound plus trophies are being caught with great regularity. The local
	      guides have an intimate knowledge of this deep, clear lake and will take
	      you to prime structures that concentrate Huites&rsquo; fantastic
	    bass population.</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../images/tony_olson_may97.jpg" alt="lake huites bass fishing,lake huites mexico,mexico bass fishing,lake el salto,lake baccarac,lake aguamilpa,lake huites,lake guerrero,el salto bass fishing,baccarac bass fishing,aguamilpa bass fishing,huites bass fishing,guerrero bass fishing" width="259" height="243" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Lake Huites is a beautiful new remote mountain lake located on Mexico's
	    west coast. The port of entry city for commercial air travelers is Los Mochis
	    located in the State of Sinaloa. Lake Huites was stocked in 1994 with Florida
	    strain black bass and the fish have grown at a phenomenal rate. This explosion
	    of growth is due to the warm year-round growing season, the clear, pure
	    mountain waters, the tremendous food base of talapia, threadfin shad, crawfish,
	    and blue gill perch. Lake Huites' remoteness insures that it will never
	    receive a great amount of fishing pressure. The lake opened to public fishing
	    in October 1997.<br>
	    Fishermen can expect to catch 50 to 60 bass per day per boat on any kind
	    of lure they desire to throw. The bass will range from 1 lb to 10 lbs and
	    possibly larger, with many of those bass weighing 4 to 6 lbs.<br>
	    We believe this lake to be the very, very best on sheer numbers of quality
	    black bass in the entire world. In a very few years when the American fishermen
	    have found out about it, this lake will be the most famous black bass lake
	    in the world and will be a household word with every American fisherman. </font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../images/won_bass_feb98.jpg" alt="lake huites bass fishing,lake huites mexico,mexico bass fishing,lake el salto,lake baccarac,lake aguamilpa,lake huites,lake guerrero,el salto bass fishing,baccarac bass fishing,aguamilpa bass fishing,huites bass fishing,guerrero bass fishing" width="245" height="284" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Hidden among the mountainous landscape of western Mexico, the Lake Huites
	    was initially stocked with Florida-strain largemouth bass. Because of a
	    plentiful food source and a long growing season, the bass on Huites are
	    growing at a rate far exceeding their growth rate in the states. The fish
	    are aggressive and will take an assortment of lures. Catches in excess of
	    100 bass in a day of fishing have been recorded at this lake.</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lake Huites is located in the foothills of the majestic Sierra Madre mountain
	    range in the state of Sinaloa near the town of Choix and is one of the most
	    beautiful and remote in all of Mexico. To make sure this lake becomes the
	    most famous bass fishery that has ever been opened anywhere in the world,
	    the Mexican officials overseeing this magnificent fishery have designated
	    this lake to be the first catch -<br>
	    and - release lake in the republic. </font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only tough part
	      to any successful fishing trip for me is the travel to the lake and then
	      the trip home. The trip to the lake is difficult because the level of
	      anticipation has you &quot;chomping at the bit&quot; to get
	    your lure in the water. The trip home is difficult because you are pretty
	    well worn out from all the fish you have reeled to the boat. According to
	    the &quot;rules for a successful trip&quot; the above statements couldn't
	    be truer for the trip to Lake Huites, in Choix, Mexico.</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../images/vpd_courtyard.jpg" alt="lake huites bass fishing,lake huites mexico,mexico bass fishing,lake el salto,lake baccarac,lake aguamilpa,lake huites,lake guerrero,el salto bass fishing,baccarac bass fishing,aguamilpa bass fishing,huites bass fishing,guerrero bass fishing" width="301" height="230" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">The lake is a man-made creation located in the foothills of the Sierra
	    Madres. Very similar to many of our TVA lakes, it consists of a combination
	    of river-like areas, small lake areas, and the setting is magnificent. Most
	    of the time the canyon walls are quite steep right to waters edge and continue
	    the rapid down slope into deep water. There are a lot of points, lots of
	    trees and brush, and fantastic fishing at every turn.</font></p>
	  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lake
	      Aguamilpa offers the avid bass angler the best bass fishing action
	      of any lake in Mexico, if not the world, with catches of 30 to 100 bass
	      per day ranging in size from 3 to 10 pounds.&nbsp; The best lake for numbers
	      of bass!!!</font> </p>
