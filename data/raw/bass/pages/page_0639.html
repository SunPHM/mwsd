  <P>Friends and Relations: The Bass Trumpet<BR>
</DIV>
<DIV style="font-size: 14pt">
  By Harold Nash
</DIV>
<IMG src="images/basstrp.jpg" border="0" alt="Bass Trumpet in Eb" width="450" height="226">
<DIV align="JUSTIFY">
  <P>I have in front of me an insurance renewal notice which lists among the
  &quot;specified articles of value&quot; a <I>Base Trumpet</I>. Whether this is
  simply another slip of the word-processor or an intentional appraisal of the
  instrument's true status, I cannot say; in either case it could be (and
  feelingly has been, on occasion) called a bastard instrument since it has no
  genuine pedigree. It was simply dreamt up by Richard Wagner, with inspiration
  from the Marquis de Sade, to satisfy his craving for yet more sounds from his
  already vast orchestra.</P>
  <P>For his epic cycle of operas, <I>Der Ring des Nibelungen</I>, he called for
  a trumpet of Brobdingnagian lengths (as Forsyth calls it in his book on
  orchestration). This grotesque weapon was to have a tube length of 23 feet,
  equipped with three crooks in C, D and Eb (all very much <I>basso</I>, of
  course), and be capable of playing in a range extending from the lowest
  trombone notes up to the highest horn notes. It was soon discovered that it
  would need an Olympic-standard weight lifter to hold it for the time Wagner
  takes to tell his tale; preferably one with at least three embouchures. In due
  course, common sense prevailed and a more sensible bass trumpet pitched in C,
  with three valves, was provided (one tone higher than the Bb tenor trombone).
  The printed part is still written in three keys and the same wide range is
  expected, if not always achieved!</P>
  <IMG src="images/basstrp2.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="Bass Trumpet in Bb" width="142" height="291">
  <P>Before Sir Georg Solti introduced me to the thrills of bass trumpet playing
  in 1962, the part had been played at Covent Garden on a long Besson instrument
  in C, originally made for a German-style band involved in one of Beecham's
  projects in the 1920s. This instrument was really more akin to a valve
  trombone, having a comparatively large bore and long, straight tubing, but it
  had nevertheless been played by Frank Stead for the Bruno Walter performances
  during the thirties, and since then by Evan Watkin, George Maxted and John
  Cobb.</P>
  <P>In an effort to find an instrument capable of producing the distinctive
  sound I believe that Wagner wanted for the numerous solo statements of his
  beloved motifs, and yet capable of blending with the rest of the brass, I
  experimented with, and eventually bought, an Alexander four-valve rotary
  trumpet in C; the fourth valve being used more as an intonation-adjuster than
  a subterranean exploratory device.</P>
  <IMG src="images/thein_basstrp.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="Bass Trumpets in Bb and C by Thein" width="291" height="343">
  <P>The search for a perfect mouthpiece continues, and for those interested in
  seeking the impossible, perhaps a few suggested guidelines would be helpful:
  the rim should be able to receive, comfortably, a trombone embouchure, but at
  the same time be able to contain the lips in a trumpet-like articulation. It
  must also allow enough support to cover a range from a sounding bottom G
  (bottom line bass clef) up to Gb three octaves higher, and yet be flexible
  within those dire straits. The shank must obviously be small enough to fit the
  proportionately very narrow bore of the instrument, yet wide enough to
  accommodate a bore large enough to dominate a titanic orchestra and yet
  control a terrifying <I>pianissimo</I> solo.</P>
  <P>In fairness to our great tormentor, Herr Wagner, we should be grateful to
  him for giving us in <I>Der Ring des Nibelungen</I> a new, and hopefully
  unique, brass sound which no other composer seems able to use.</P>
  <P>Richard Strauss uses a bass trumpet in his opera <I>Elektra</I>, as well as
  in the tone poems <I>Macbeth</I> and <I>Guntram</I>, but with little
  imagination. There are little solos, but they are those of a low
  &quot;ordinary&quot; trumpet. Of the more modern composers, Schoenberg scores
  for bass trumpet in <I>Gurrelieder</I>, but again only as a member of the
  trumpet section. As for Stravinsky's risible little solo echoing the cor
  anglais in the <I>Rite of Spring</I>, it is meant to be tackled by a
  &quot;normal&quot; fourth trumpet since it is printed on his part, and is
  scored for an E flat instrument anyway. Janácek, on the other hand, proves
  his generosity by providing work for two players in his <I>Sinfonietta</I>
  when he could have managed with just one bruiser. The parts are completely in
  unison and always lead to trouble in deciding who is Principal!</P>
  <P>I'm afraid it is an inescapable fact that if we are talking bass trumpet,
  we are talking <I>Der Ring</I> and nothing else. The Master uses it uniquely
  and imaginatively: as a solo instrument stating his beloved motifs, at the
  bottom of the trumpet section, above the trombone section (like an alto
  trombone almost) and leading the family of tubas.</P>
  <P>Unfortunately, the poor chap trying to fulfil all these aspirations is
  usually just a trombone player doing a bit of moonlighting on an instrument he
  plays only rarely, and which is incapable of producing the precise intonation
  he's used to on his proper instrument, the trombone. As a result, a lot of
  time and effort is spent shunting tuning slides and working out alternative
  fingerings featuring the fourth valve. It is only when the vital moment
  arrives that he discovers that the vital rotary cylinder has jammed again!</P>
