</DIV>
<DIV align="JUSTIFY">
  <P><STRONG>Monday, March 16, 1998; Boston, London and Manchester</STRONG></P>
  <P>Dear Diary,</P>
  <IMG src="images/london.jpg" border="0" alt="Changing of the Guard" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" width="317" height="214">
  <P>Here we are, on the road again with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, this
  time to Europe. We haven't been back to Europe since 1993 and since that time,
  I've met a lot of people over the Internet and have piled up a list of things
  I'd like to do while there, so this ought to be interesting.</P>
  <P>Flying overnight from Boston to London (we left on a British Airways flight
  at 8:10 PM on Sunday with a 6.5 hour flight and 5 hour time change), it always
  surprises me how short the night was, no matter how many times I do it. I
  don't get much sleep on the plane, it seems that they are always pushing food
  at you when you just nod off, &quot;Excuse me sir,&quot; the flight attendant
  whispers through my &quot;noise-buster&quot; headphones and
  &quot;mind-fold&quot; eye shade, &quot;you aren't sleeping, <I>are</I>
  you?&quot; Grrrrrrr....</P>
  <P>Upon touching down at Heathrow, we learned that the passport control agents
  didn't have the BSO work permit quite ready (they only had 2 years, wonder
  what took so long). My colleagues are a cranky lot after the overnight flight
  - being told to wait for some person to complete paperwork doesn't sit well
  but I urge, patience, patience. As it turns out, the lines open up just as I
  happen to walk in front of one so I end up being the first one through. And
  some people say there is no God!</P>
  <P>Waiting for me outside of customs is Gordon Higginbottom of Yamaha Kemble
  who will be my chaperone for a few days. Several months ago, Peter Bassano of
  the Royal College of Music in London asked if I would be interested in giving
  a master class at the RCM. I immediately accepted, but a few weeks later, the
  Royal <I>Northern</I> College of Music in Manchester got wind of my class at
  the RCM and <I>they</I> wanted a class, too. Gordon Higginbottom made the
  arrangements for me to work out this impossible feat - giving classes in both
  Manchester and London on the same day, and I'm grateful for his (and Yamaha's)
  help in making it all happen. Gordon, as you may know, is a legendary brass
  band horn player, and we had a great time talking about bands and his recent
  playing of his E flat horn in a Prokofiev cantata with Neeme Järvi.</P>
  <P>We arrived in Manchester where we checked into a bed and breakfast inn and
  I promptly went to sleep for a few hours, my usual routine when making the
  trip across the pond. Upon awaking, James Gourlay, who wears many hats
  including that of Director of Brass Studies at the RNCM, conductor of the
  Williams Fairey Band and tuba soloist extraordinaire, came over to take me to
  a rehearsal with my accompanist for the next day's recital. Oh, didn't I
  mention, when the RNCM asked me to do a clinic, they asked if I would give a
  mini-recital - being a glutton for punishment, I agreed, and Jim secured the
  best for me, John Wilson, head of the accompanying department at the RNCM.</P>
  <P>My program was designed to be a bit different, not the standard fare, so I
  chose the Hindemith <I>Three Easy Pieces</I> for cello, Bozza's <I>New Orleans</I>,
  and two songs, the first of the Brahms <I>Four Serious Songs</I> and <I>The
  Call</I> from Vaughan Williams' <I>Five Mystical Songs</I>. John proved to be
  a more than able accompanist, particularly in the Brahms where he simply
  whipped up and down the keyboard with obvious glee that he had such a piece of
  &quot;meat&quot; to devour.</P>
  <P>Jim Gourlay asked me if I would like to accompany him to the evening
  rehearsal of his band, Williams Fairey. There was no question, of course I
  would! Fairey is one of the top bands in the world, playing in the
  championship section and currently riding at the top of the brass band
  rankings. Having recorded my solo CD <I><A href="proclamation.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Proclamation'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" title="Go to article on Proclamation" target="_self">Proclamation</A></I>
  with the assistance of the Black Dyke Band, I knew it would be a treat to hear
  another great band up close. I asked Jim if I could sit in the band for a
  march and he readily agreed.</P>
  <P>Trouble (or, rather, I should say, the fun!) began when I noticed the
  principal trombone chair (held by Simon Cowen, who had been with Black Dyke
  when I recorded <I><A href="proclamation.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Proclamation'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" title="Go to article on Proclamation" target="_self">Proclamation</A></I>)
  was vacant. It turned out that Simon would not be there so Jim asked if I
  would dep (dep=deputise=substitute, for those of you who don't know the
  British lingo...) for Simon - on first trombone! Of course I agreed, and
  therein began a most enjoyable 2 hours that did wonders for my face and helped
  me get over the airplane chops I had picked up. What a band! They were
  preparing for a concert on March 21 at the Stockport Citadel of the Salvation
  Army, so the program was mostly sacred classics, including a new piece, <I>A
  Psalm for the Chase</I> by Bolton written for principal horn, Sandy Smith.
  What a beautiful piece, and exceptionally played by Sandy. I thoroughly
  enjoyed my time with the band, and at the end, was both surprised and
  delighted when Band Manager John Cresswell presented me with a handful of new
  Fairey Band CDs and some recent editions of their newsletter, <I>Fairey Tales</I>.
  What a nice gesture, and a wonderful way to end the rehearsal for me.</P>
  <P>Jim, his fiancée, Lela, Gordon, John Cresswell and I went out to an Indian
  restaurant for a dinner that couldn't be beaten before heading back to the
  hotel where I collapsed (after, of course, checking my e-mail!).</P>
  <P>And there was morning and evening, the first day.</P>
  <STRONG>Tuesday, March 17, 1998; Manchester and London</STRONG>
  <P>Today it begins - the marathon.</P>
  <A href="proclamation.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Proclamation'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';"><IMG src="images/proccover.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="Proclamation" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="203"></A>
  <P>After a good night of sleep (I slept straight through the night which was a
  good sign that jet lag was going to get over pretty quickly), Gordon and I had
  breakfast and Jim picked us up and took us over to the RNCM where I warmed up
  for the recital and class. The RNCM has recently undergone a new building
  programme and I was happy to be given a large room with plenty of windows and
  a fine piano. Students began trickling in and by the time things started, it
  was standing room only with about 60 people there including Nick Hudson, noted
  soloist and principal trombone with the Yorkshire Building Society Band. I had
  never met Nick but we had corresponded a bit over the last few months as he
  was very enthusiastic about my <I><A href="proclamation.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Proclamation'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" title="Go to article on Proclamation" target="_self">Proclamation</A></I>
  project as I was likewise keen on his new solo album, <I>Anthology</I>. It was
  nice of him and so many others to come.</P>
  <IMG src="images/nick_hudson.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="Douglas Yeo &amp; Nick Hudson" width="154" height="166">
  <P>The recital went well; it's always a great feeling to know that you did
  what you can do, and John's piano playing was splendid. I then moved on to the
  clinic portion of the program where five bass trombonists played. All were
  fine players who played a varied cross section of music. The three hours
  passed quickly, and when Jim Gourlay wound things up by presenting me with a
  RNCM sweatshirt, Gordon was there, hurrying me along so we could get to the
  airport to head to London.</P>
  <P>Before leaving Manchester, I couldn't help but get a bit nostalgic, as it
  was there, in Peel Hall of the University of Salford, that I recorded <I><A href="proclamation.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Proclamation'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" title="Go to article on Proclamation" target="_self">Proclamation</A></I>
  with Black Dyke. The week I spent in Manchester (and neighbouring Queensbury
  and Stockport) in September 1996 is one that is indelibly imprinted in my
  mind, and detailed by my friend Roger Green in his book about the project, <I>PROCLAMATION:
  In Pursuit of a Dream</I>. It was nice to remember that exciting time in my
  life.</P>
  <P>Enter Roger Green. . .</P>
  <IMG src="images/roger_green.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" alt="Dr. Roger Challoner Green" width="202" height="171">
  <P>Gordon and I flew back to Heathrow, picked up his car and made our way into
  London at rush hour, an amazing feat that was done in record time. I stopped
  at the Inter-Continental Hotel at Hyde Park Corner where the BSO was staying,
  checked in, dropped off my suitcase, and we headed over to the Royal College
  of Music for my next class. Gordon couldn't stay for it so we said goodbye,
  happy that I had made a new friend and grateful for all he and Yamaha have
  done for me over the years. Once in the RCM, I found the cafeteria where my
  BSO colleague, tubist Chester Schmitz was waiting for me (he had been
  scheduled to do a clinic that afternoon as well but the tubists at the RCM all
  fell ill and it unfortunately had to be cancelled) along with my friend Roger
  Green and John Ingman, an Internet friend who I found, to my surprise, to be
  17 years old, far younger than his mature postings to the <A href="trombone-l.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Trombone-L mailing list'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" title="Go to articleon Trombone-L mailing list" target="_self">Trombone-L</A>
  led me to believe.</P>
  <P>I don't need to tell you about Roger Green, you already know that he is my
  friend from Wiltshire whose idea it was for me to record a CD of bass trombone
  solos with brass band. We became friends in about 1983, pen pals, if you will,
  and we met during BSO tours of England in 1984 and 1993. It was in 1993, after
  interviewing me for <I>The Trombonist</I> magazine that Roger &quot;popped the
  question&quot; about making the CD and our lives were changed. Roger had come
  in to London on the train to meet me at the RCM. We chatted a bit, catching up
  on many things (my wife and I had been to visit Roger and his wife, Frances,
  on a vacation in the UK in September 1996) before Peter Bassano popped in to
  take us to the Durrington Room on the top floor of the RCM where my class was
  to be.</P>
  <IMG src="images/masterclass.jpg" border="0" alt="Douglas Yeo London master class" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" width="309" height="179">
  <P>It was great to see Peter, as well as Dudley Bright of the Philharmonia
  Orchestra and Lindsey Shilling at the clinic, so very nice of colleagues in
  other orchestras to give up a bit of time to come here me play and teach. The
  five students at the RCM were also quite good - one poor chap had the
  misfortune to play <I>New Orleans</I> which I had just performed earlier in
  the day! No, seriously, he and all the others did quite well, and I actually
  learned about three pieces I had never heard - John White's <I>Sonatina</I>
  (published by <A href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/warwick_music/" target="_blank" onmouseover="self.status='Go to Warwick Music'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" title="Go to Warwick Music">Warwick
  Music UK <IMG border="0" src="images/leave-site.gif" alt="Leave The Trombonist Online" width="17" height="11"></A>),
  the Gabaye <I>Tubabillage </I>and Henry Wolking's <I>Shadows, Sherlocks and
  Seven Cues</I>, a strong, unaccompanied, contemporary work chosen by Laura
  Sherlock because... it had her name in it!</P>
  <P>When the class was over, I talked with several students for a few minutes
  and saw a chap begin taking out and then playing a <A href="rose.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on G bass trombone'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" target="_self" title="Go to article on G bass trombone">G
  bass trombone</A>. I couldn't help overhearing what was going on as the fellow
  and Roger engaged in animated discussion and I finally was able to break away
  and join them and meet, for the first time, <A href="mailto:webmaster@trombone-society.org.uk" onmouseover="self.status='Send feedback by e-mail to the Webmaster'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';">Edward
  Solomon</A>, my good friend from the Internet who is both a frequent and sage
  contributor to the <A href="trombone-l.htm" onmouseover="self.status='Go to article on Trombone-L mailing list'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" target="_self" title="Go to article on Trombone-L mailing list">Trombone-L</A>
  e-mail discussion group and the Webmaster of the <A href="http://www.trombone-society.org.uk" onmouseover="self.status='Go to BTS web site'; return true" onmouseout="self.status='';" target="_top">British
  Trombone Society web site</A>. Edward sounded just great on his Besson G bass
  and he really gave me inspiration to get out my old Salvation Army G bass
  (formerly owned by the Cambridge, Massachusetts, Citadel Band - now defunct)
  and get cracking on it.</P>
  <P>Edward volunteered to help Roger and me get some dinner because my stomach
  was eating itself - I was famished. After driving around a bit, all the while
  jabbering about trombone players, instruments, the Internet and much more (and
  listening to the Mozart <I>Requiem</I> in an excellent recording with the
  English Baroque Soloists conducted by John Eliot Gardiner [Philips 420 197-2,
  with trombonists Peter Bassano, Susan Addison and Stephen Saunders]), we ended
  up at a pizza house where my appetite was satisfied. We trotted over to Tower
  Records at Piccadilly Circus (open until midnight) in hopes of finding some
  brass band CDs; regrettably they had a very small selection, but I did pick up
  the Mozart recording we had been listening to in Edward's car and Edward found
  the Nelson Riddle album, <I>The Joy of Living</I>. A long, but fulfilling day
  finally over, Edward deposited Roger and me back at my hotel before Roger
  trotted off to his B&amp;B (he decided to pass staying at the
  Inter-Continental for $240 a night!). Sleep came quickly and easily, after an
  e-mail session, of course.</P>
  <P>And there was morning and evening, the second day.</P>
  <P><STRONG><A NAME="March18">Wednesday, March 18, 1998; London</A></STRONG></P>
  <P>Roger came by after breakfast and I finished warming up in my room (with my
  Yamaha SBS practice mute) as the BSO had a rehearsal at Royal Festival Hall
  from 10:30 am - 1:00 pm. The tour programmes consist mostly of Mahler 3 and
  Mahler 6, and we needed a rehearsal to sort out the vocal movements of Mahler
  3. We had an excellent women's chorus, the London Symphony Women's Chorus, who
  sang with incredible blend, style and panache - and they had fantastic German
  accents as well. Their beautiful singing reminded me of my first visit to
  England in 1984 when we played Mahler 2 in Royal Albert Hall with the
  Philharmonia Chorus - another fine chorus that left me with wonderful memories
  of the British vocal tradition. Seiji Ozawa's rehearsal went overtime which
  didn't help the orchestra's mood, but we really did get a lot done in
  rehearsal as the acoustics in the Festival Hall are not the most user friendly
  in the world. We are quite spoiled playing in Symphony Hall in Boston and need
  to make many adjustments when playing on other halls around the world.</P>
  <IMG src="images/sa_bass.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="Salvation Army Eb Bass Trombone" width="132" height="455">
  <P>Yesterday, Edward had told Roger and me where HMV Records was (on Oxford
  Street, near Oxford Circus) so we headed there where there was a much larger
  selection of brass band CDs. I also managed to pick up two discs containing
  both the complete sketches for and a &quot;completion&quot; of Elgar's <I>Symphony
  No 3</I>, which has long fascinated musicologists. That will make for an
  interesting study on another day. We also made our way to Boosey &amp; Hawkes in
  search of the famous Otto Langey tutor for B flat trombone, one of the few
  tutors published in the UK that are for trombone in <I>bass</I> clef. We found
  it and I will enjoy looking through it when I have some time at home.</P>
  <P>Roger and I then headed to Salvation Army Headquarters on Judd Street (near
  King's Cross) in hopes of seeing the famous <A href="grinsted.htm" onmouseout="self.status='';" onmouseover="self.status='Go to Article'; return true" target="_self" title="Go to Article">E
  flat bass</A><A href="grinsted.htm" onmouseout="self.status='';" onmouseover="self.status='Go to Article'; return true" target="_self" title="Go to Article">
  trombone</A> in the
  Salvation Army Heritage Museum that was the subject of an article in <I>The
  Trombonist</I> a few months back. This unusual instrument was invented and
  patented by the Salvation Army near the turn of the century and has an
  extraordinary series of springs and strings that, when the hand slide is moved
  out, causes a slide to go out the back of the instrument! Alas, the museum had
  closed when we got there, but Roger and I spent some time looking through the
  SA bookstore and I bought more CDs, several books on the famous
  conductor/composer Eric Ball and Roger purchased some music to play with his
  band, Bratton Silver Band.</P>
  <P>Time was getting short so we headed to dinner with a promise to return to
  the museum tomorrow when it was open, and we just made the bus to Festival
  Hall for the evening concert, Mahler 6. It was, if I say so myself (and <I>The
  Times</I> agreed as well), a memorable performance, with my colleagues really
  taking to heart Seiji's admonishments against playing out too much, with
  everything in excellent balance. It was a great opening to the tour and
  afterwards, Roger and I headed out to a pub for a deserved Guinness before
  dropping into bed for much needed rest.</P>
  <P>And there was morning and evening, the third day.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Thursday, March 19, 1998; London</STRONG></P>
  <IMG src="images/doug.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="0" align="right" alt="Doug Yeo playing Salvation Army Eb bass trombone" width="177" height="209">
  <P>Each day seems to be even more packed with great things to do and
  experience. We were up early as I wanted to get back to the Salvation Army
  Heritage Museum when it opened to get a good look at that <A href="grinsted.htm" onmouseout="self.status='';" onmouseover="self.status='Go to Article'; return true" target="_self" title="Go to Article">E
  flat bass</A><A href="grinsted.htm" onmouseout="self.status='';" onmouseover="self.status='Go to Article'; return true" target="_self" title="Go to Article">
  trombone</A> I had read about in <I>The Trombonist</I>. Old instruments fascinate me, and
  none had ever looked so interesting to me as this contraption with the
  spring/string loaded slide that pushed out the back. Roger and I arrived at
  the Museum when it opened at 9:30 and went straight for the bass trombone. And
  what a specimen it is! It is in beautiful condition, upon on a trombone stand
  and right there for you to touch (were it not for the &quot;Please do not
  touch!&quot; sign). We were soon greeted by Museum archivist Gordon Taylor who
  promptly picked up the instrument and began telling more of its history along
  with details of its construction. The instrument has the same beautiful rolled
  metal ferrules which have the appearance of being engraved that my old SA G
  bass has, and I was struck by the puny size of the top tube of the dual bore
  slide - smaller than a standard symphonic trumpet bore was my guess.</P>
  <P>Much to my surprise, Gordon handed the instrument to me and asked if I
  would like to hold it! I accepted (while Roger got our cameras popping) and
  was struck again by the perfect balance of the horn - neither front nor back
  heavy. The slide moved easily for something that had not been played in some
  time, and the &quot;whooshing&quot; sound of the back slide moving in and out
  was quite apparent in my left ear. Gordon then suggested I have a blow on it!
  That was a treat beyond words, it played a bit stuffily, but part of that was
  no doubt me, not being used to an instrument in E flat. Perhaps, too, a good
  cleaning would improve things, but I was able to play some scales and bits of
  excerpts and études; Gordon commented he had never heard that instrument
  played before so I was happy to be part of the learning process for all of us.
  With gratitude and a sense of awe of having played a piece of history (how
  many SA Bandsmen had played that instrument over the years, how many parades
  had it marched in, how many hymn tunes and marches had come out of its bell?),
  we returned the instrument to the stand and moved on downstairs again to do
  more shopping in the bookstore.</P>
  <P>We hurried over towards Regents Park to the Royal Academy of Music where I
  was to give my final of my trilogy of master classes in England. After
  stopping for a bite to eat in the church across the street (no, not communion,
  but a lovely meal, I remain puzzled why churches have restaurants in them over
  here!), Roger and I were met outside of the RAM by the three bass trombone
  students there, Richard Broomhead, David Vines and Rob O'Neil. We hurried up
  to the room for a bit of a warmup and was delighted when John Wallace came in
  to give my introduction. I had long admired his many recordings over the years
  and as London Symphony Orchestra bass trombonist Bob Hughes was on tour at the
  time, John took over getting the class started. I was also happy to meet Roger
  Argente, Bass Trombonist of the Royal Philharmonic - a generous gesture of
  these colleagues to take time from their schedule to come and say hello.</P>
  <P>The RAM bass trombonists acquitted themselves well at the master class
  which I began after a few words of my own and a performance of the Telemann <I>Flute
  Fantasie in C minor</I>. Time passed quickly and in no time at all, we found
  ourselves running for dinner. As we passed Tower Records, we popped in again;
  one of the RAM students had recommended a Nelson Riddle album with Ella
  Fitzgerald that included a duet with Ella and George Roberts, something
  unknown to me. Happily, Tower had it in stock (<I>Ella Swings Brightly With
  Nelson</I>, Verve 519 347-2, the track with George Roberts is <I>Love Me or
  Leave Me</I>) and we ran off for dinner (in another church!) before heading to
  Festival Hall for Mahler 3.</P>
  <P>The performance that night was a good one, well received by the audience
  with the kind of ovations an orchestra can only get on tour - prolonged and
  noisy! I enjoyed chatting with some of the chorus members again who sang so
  beautifully; Roger made his way backstage and we headed back to the hotel for
  a final pint of Guinness at the pub and our farewell. Fortunately, we will be
  seeing each other again soon, as we and our wives have booked a holiday
  together in Bermuda for August 1999. It is our favourite vacation spot and it
  will be a treat to introduce Roger and Frances to our island getaway.</P>
  <P>How I wish I had a few more days in London, I never tire of it. So much to
  see, so much history, so much music, so many friends. But I suppose this is
  incentive to return again soon and I know I will. After packing up my suitcase
  and writing some e-mail, my head hit the pillow and I was, I believe,
  instantly asleep.</P>
  <P>And there was morning and evening, the fourth day.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Friday, March 20, 1998; London and Paris</STRONG></P>
  <IMG src="images/eiffel.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="Eiffel Tower" width="215" height="313">
  <P>The trip to Paris was typical of a Boston Symphony travel day. We had to
  have our bags outside our door at 6:30 am, check in with British Airways in
  the hotel lobby at 7:30 to get a boarding pass, and our buses departed for
  Heathrow at 9:30. Arriving at Heathrow around 10:30, our plane for Paris took
  off a bit late at 11:30 and by 3:00 pm, I was at the Paris Hilton which sits
  only 200 yards from the Eiffel Tower. No matter how many times I see it, it
  still amazes me - up close it is bigger than you could ever have imagined,
  from a distance it looks, especially at night, as if it were constructed of
  the finest Belgian lace.</P>
  <P>Upon plugging my computer in to the wall to recharge the battery, I
  promptly blew a fuse in the hotel, shutting off the lights for the entire
  floor! Whoops, wrong adapter! No damage done, only the adapter was fried
  (which was not plugged into my computer at the time) so after maintenance made
  their way up and sorted it out, I was back up and running (plugging in the
  computer in the bathroom shaver socket for a charge).</P>
  <P>There was little time for more than a bit of practising and a quick bite to
  eat before heading to the Théâtre des Champs Elysées, the famous hall where
  Stravinsky's <I>Rite of Spring</I> had its premiere. I can't say it's my
  favourite hall, it's rather like playing into your closet (full of clothes)
  but it does have history going for it. In addition to playing Mahler 6, we
  were to play a new piece by Henri Dutilleux which was commissioned by the
  Boston Symphony and premiered by us in October 1997, <I>The Shadows of Time</I>.
  This was added at the last minute; not only that, but we recorded the work
  live last week at 2 concerts in Boston and tonight, one week later, Erato will
  be offering it for sale as a &quot;single&quot; in the lobby of the hall!
  Amazing what can be done when people put their mind to it!</P>
  <P>Dutilleux is a gentleman; at intermission, after we played his piece, he
  made his way backstage and sought out each member of the orchestra, personally
  thanking us for our contribution to his piece. A warm and very human gesture
  on his part.</P>
  <P>It's hard to know how the Mahler went, I honestly couldn't hear what half
  the orchestra was doing as the stage at the Théâtre des Champs Elysées is
  so deep that the brass, winds and percussion seem to be in a separate room
  from the rest of the orchestra. The addition of the Dutilleux made for a long
  concert (2.5 hours) so I gladly fell into bed, grateful that the time change
  from London would give me an extra hour of sleep.</P>
  <P>And there was evening and morning, the fifth day.</P>
  <P><STRONG>Saturday, March 21, 1998; Paris</STRONG></P>
  <P>This was a day I had been looking forward to for a long time. Since I began
  playing serpent (that 16th century instrument that has a shape that lives up
  to its name) several years ago, I had wanted to play for an extended period of
  time on an &quot;original&quot; instrument, not a modern reproduction. As good
  as my new serpent is (made by the Christopher Monk Workshops of London in
  1996), there is something about an old instrument that is very special, and
  while I had briefly played on one at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts a few
  weeks earlier in preparation for a lecture/demonstration I will be giving
  there in April (it unfortunately wasn't very good), in Paris I knew I might
  have the opportunity to play and perhaps purchase an antique instrument.</P>
  <P>My friend, Craig Kridel of the University of South Carolina is one of the
  most well versed people when it comes to serpent and he had told me of an
  instrument dealer in Paris, Andre Bissonnet. I had called Bissonnet yesterday
  to see if he would be in today and he said he would - I prayed he would have
  something interesting for me to try.</P>
  <IMG src="images/vosges1.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="Place des Vosges, Paris" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="314" height="170">
  <P>I took the Métro to M. Bissonnet's shop and found it with no difficulty
  (Instruments Musicaux Anciens, 6 rue du Pas-de-la-Mule, Paris - near the Place
  des Vosges). What a place! It was jammed from floor to ceiling with all manner
  of instruments - saxhorns, trombones (nothing too exotic, though), lutes and
  violins, ophicleides, Russian bassoons, other winds and brasses and one
  serpent. I explained to Bissonnet who I was and that I was interested in an
  old French serpent. While he eyed me a bit suspiciously at first
  (&quot;Why,&quot; he must have thought, &quot;does <I>he</I> play
  serpent...?&quot;), he closed the shop for a moment and took me upstairs to
  his private collection - even more fantastic than the one in the shop below,
  where he took down from the wall, an exquisite instrument, by Baudouin.</P>
  <P>My excitement mounted, as my Monk serpent was modelled after an instrument
  by Baudouin from 1810. To hold an original in my hands would be a great
  experience, I knew.</P>
  <P>This serpent was in C with 2 keys, made, Bissonnet calculated, around 1801
  or 1802. I was nearly afraid to play it for fear it would disappoint. But the
  first note on its original ivory mouthpiece gave me to know that I was playing
  an extraordinary instrument. It blew beautifully and easily, was in tune, and
  had a marvellous feel to it. I played for about 30 minutes while Bissonnet
  worked in his back room, eyeing me now and then as I played every serpent
  excerpt I could think of including music of Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Wagner,
  Handel as well as some chant and bits of Simon Proctor's <I>Serpent Concerto</I>.
  After a while, Bissonnet took the instrument from my hands, poured a quart of
  water into the bell and sloshed it around before emptying it in the street. <I>Violà!</I>
  The instrument had an even richer sound than before as some moisture was put
  back into the wood. A little care and feeding and I knew this would be a
  remarkable and very special instrument. Another 30 minutes of playing
  convinced me I had found something rare indeed.</P>
  <P>With more than a little fear I asked the fateful question, &quot;How much
  is it?&quot; and when the reply came back (no, I will not tell you yet what he
  asked!) I gulped and began thinking fast. How could I pay for it? How could I
  get it around on the rest of the tour? How would I explain this to my wife?
  Was it a great deal or was I being taken for a ride? I just didn't know, so
  for once of my life I resisted impulse and regrettably handed the serpent back
  with a promise to call Bissonnet back tomorrow after I had done some research
  and spoken with Craig Kridel and my wife about it!</P>
  <P>I left the shop exhausted from an hour of serpent playing but thrilled to
  have had the &quot;high&quot; of playing such a wonderful instrument. Ah,
  money, there's the rub. But no matter what I decide, I will always carry with
  me the memory of Bissonnet's shop and that serpent. Again, my thoughts ran,
  Who had previously owned it? What church might have had it? Was it played
  during the Revolution, in a home, in government ceremonies, in a concert.
  Could it have been used in the premiere of music of Berlioz? Who knows...?</P>
  <P>The rest of the afternoon was spent on a wild goose chase, looking for
  posters of Paris and France to take home to my youngest daughter's French
  teacher. Nothing seemed to go right - the shop I had been sent to was closed
  for the weekend (after walking 2 hours to get there!), after returning to the
  hotel to ask the Concierge for another recommendation, I took the Métro to
  find out that all the shop had was maps and satellite photos. Exhausted, I
  decided it was time to get back to the room, do some laundry and practise a
  bit before heading over for Mahler 3 tonight. My kingdom for a poster, please!</P>
  <P>The concert was good considering the horrid acoustics and the Choeur des
  Femmes de Radio France was another excellent chorus - a deeper, darker sound
  than the LSO Women's Chorus but without the precision and excellent diction of
  their British counterparts. So far, the LSO women have it over the American
  and French choruses in my mind, Tuesday, in Vienna, will bring us the Wiener
  Singverein and Wiener Sängerknaben which should be interesting as well.</P>
  <P>The hall was hot as blazes, and 1 hour 47 minutes is a long time to sit in
  one place, but in the end, it came off well, and after a short bus ride back
  to the hotel, it's nice to be back in the room. After a call home and an
  e-mail session, it's off to bed without setting the alarm. Tomorrow is a day
  off.</P>
  <P>And there was morning and evening, the sixth day. And, because it was very
  good, tomorrow is a day of rest. Achieved is the glorious work...</P>
