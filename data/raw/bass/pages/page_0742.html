<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many young people do not worry about what their background
is.&nbsp; Where they came from is not important to them, but&nbsp; Lance
Bass is not like the others.&nbsp; Lance Bass is very proud of his <b>Mississippi
</b>background.&nbsp;
He is one of the most famous guys in the pop music scene right now,&nbsp;
yet he continues to stayed focused with himself and his surroundings.&nbsp;<img SRC="Mer2.jpg" ALT="Merry Love Bishop, SHS student researcher" height=209 width=146 align=RIGHT>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Lansten "Lance" Bass was born on May 4, 1979,
to Jim and Diane Bass of <b>Laurel, Mississippi.</b>&nbsp; He has one older
sister named Stacy.&nbsp; In 1989, Jim Bass moved his family to<b> Clinton,
Mississippi.</b>&nbsp; His son Lance began singing in the chorus when he
was in the seventh grade.&nbsp; In eighth grade Lance auditioned for a
spot with the Mississippi Show Stoppers.&nbsp; The Mississippi Show Stoppers
is a state- wide group sponsored by the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry
Museum located in <b>Jackson, Mississippi</b>.&nbsp; Lance later became
a member of a competition choir called Attache (Lance).&nbsp; At Clinton
High School, Lance's favorite subjects were math and science.&nbsp; His
best childhood memory is spending Christmas with his family (The Dutch
'NSYNC website-Lance Bass).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lance is five feet, eleven inches tall, has green
eyes&nbsp; which sometimes look yellow, and blonde hair (Lance Bass of
NSYNC).&nbsp; He considers himself to be "the all-American dude from Mississippi"
(NSYNC The Official Book).&nbsp; Others view Lance as the business man
of *NSYNC.&nbsp; Fellow group member Chris Kirkpatrick says, "Lance is
professional."&nbsp;&nbsp; J.C. Chasez describes Lance as "all business"
(NSYNC The Teen Reader Interview).&nbsp; Lance really likes the music of
LeAnn Rimes, who is also a Mississippi musician and would love to one day
have the chance to perform for with her.&nbsp; He thinks of Garth Brooks
as one of his major influences.&nbsp; The first time he saw Garth Brooks
in concert, he knew he wanted to be a performer (NSYNC The Official Book).&nbsp;
Other musicians he likes are present day artists&nbsp; Boyz II Men, Matchbox
20, and Az Yet (Lance Bass of NSYNC).&nbsp; Lance's family is his biggest
role model (NSYNC The Teen Reader Interview). His first job was dressing
up as a dog named Poo-Fu and promoting the dog's book.&nbsp;&nbsp; His&nbsp;
goal in life is like all other musicians:&nbsp; to hit number one and win
a Grammy (The Lance Bass Interview).&nbsp; The best day of Lance's life
was when he was called to audition for NSYNC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lance currently
resides in Orlando, Florida, but his family still lives in <b>Clinton,
Mississippi,</b> where his mother is a sixth grade teacher at a Brandon
school. ( NSYNC the Official Book)<img SRC="lancebass4.jpg" ALT="NSYNC in Jackson, Sept., 1999.  Photo by Merry Love Bishop" height=236 width=353 align=LEFT>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSYNC is a pop dance group made up of four other
guys&nbsp; from different backgrounds.&nbsp; J.C. CHasez is 21 and from
Washington D.C.&nbsp; Justin Timberlake is 17 and from Memphis, Tennessee.&nbsp;
Chris Kirkpatrick is 27 and from Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Joey Fontane is 21
and from New York (NSYNC Their Story).&nbsp; Lance was the fifth and final
member of&nbsp; the group, and he did not formally audition ( NSYNC The
Official Book). Lance is the "bass" singer of NSYNC.&nbsp; The name NSYNC
was thought up by Justin's mom.&nbsp; She took the last letter of all the
guy's first name and created NSYNC (NSYNC The Official Book).&nbsp; The
group has been compared with such groups as Backstreet Boys and New Kids
On The Block.&nbsp; They have been a solid group for more than four&nbsp;
years.&nbsp; NSYNC first hit it big over in Europe, but eventually hit
it big in American with their Disney Channel live concert (The Lance Bass
Interview).&nbsp; NSYNC's self- titled debut album was released on March
24, 1998 (NSYNC Their Story).&nbsp; Their first single was "I Want You
Back.'&nbsp; It was the fastest- rising single and had the longest stay
for a new act on the charts.&nbsp; "I Want You Back" went platinum within
four months of its release (NSYNC The Official Book). In November, 1998,
NSYNC had two albums on the Billboard Top 10 Chart, their self- titled
album and Christmas album.<img SRC="lancebass1.jpg" ALT="Photo by Merry Love Bishop" height=197 width=353 align=LEFT>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, they've&nbsp; received
three Grammy Nominations for "Record of the Year" ("Bye Bye Bye"), "Best
Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal" ("Bye Bye Bye") and "Best
Pop Vocal Album" (No Strings Attached). On February 21st the
<br>2001 Grammy Awards will be announced.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although NSYNC has had great success, Lance
Bass has managed to to keep his head straight.&nbsp; His family has commented
many times on how he is still the same guy he was before all this madness
and popularity began.

<br><b><font size=+1>Update</font></b>:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.lancebassnetwork.com/archives1.html">Lance
Bass Bass, </a>23,&nbsp; qualified as physically fit for a seat aboard
a Russian rocket flight to the International Space
<br>Station,according to David Krieff, president of Destiny Productions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bass did space flight training at the cosmonaut center in Russia's Star
City, where he undertook a battery of physical and medical tests.&nbsp;
Flying into orbit has been a lifelong dream for the Bass, who attended
"space camp" as a child&nbsp; and who also underwent a "surgical procedure"
to correct an irregular heartbeat in order to qualify for the flight.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSYNC's debut CD is one that is unforgettable.&nbsp;
This Orlando-based group puts pop and dance together to make one great
CD.&nbsp; Their first singles of "I Want You Back" and "Tearin' Up My heart"
caused this CD to go double platinum in Canada and platinum in the U.S.&nbsp;<img SRC="cdnsync2.jpg" height=172 width=177 align=LEFT>This
CD has a style of no other kind.&nbsp; It goes easily from a ballad like
"God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You, " to the up-beat dance
type of "Giddy Up."&nbsp; Each song has its own special quality, some make
you smile, some make you sad, and some make you just want to get up and
dance.&nbsp; This CD has qualities of a mix between Backstreet Boys and
the ever-so- popular old group New Kids On The Block.&nbsp; This CD is
definitely a must buy on my list.&nbsp; I would give it four stars if I
were a music critic.

of how the group NSYNC came together.&nbsp; It also
<br><img SRC="nsyncbook2.jpg" height=189 width=161 align=RIGHT>tells the
individual stories of each of the five guys in the group.&nbsp; The mothers
of NSYNC members tell their versions of their story and how each of their
children acted growing up.&nbsp; There is a "Day In The Life Of NSYNC",
which will tells&nbsp; in detail what NSYNC goes through on a basic "work"
day.&nbsp; This book is full of pictures of NSYNC touring and pictures
of them during&nbsp; their childhood.&nbsp; It is a great way to learn
in-depth from the first- hand source of NSYNC.&nbsp; I really enjoyed this
book and not just because I am a fan.&nbsp; It was fun to read with all
of the zany things the guys told about themselves.
