<DIV>White Seabass Head-Butt</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Hi All,<BR><BR>The fish head-butting stories reminded me of an experience back in the summer of '94.&nbsp;<BR><BR>It was about 11 AM.&nbsp; I drove out to Palos Verdes, a secret spot of course, saw no vehicles parked in the street, ran out to the cliff and no boats, no divers, nothing.&nbsp; The water was flat, clean, and the sun was shining bright: warm and dry.&nbsp; Well, my excitement was overwhelming-- this was too good to be true.&nbsp; I suited up, ran down the cliff at full speed (those were the years!), and stepped in.&nbsp; Incredible!!!&nbsp; Crystal clear, beautiful, like a stunning day in a redwood forest.&nbsp; The kelp was standing up right, reflecting all kinds of colors from translucent to yellow to light green to deep green and clear blue.<BR><BR>My technique is to start "stealth" hunting the moment I'm submerged.&nbsp; I drop to a neutral depth, then kick very slowly, almost randomly and with almost no motion (almost like fining).&nbsp; The rest of my body is dead still, my head looking forward but not moving.&nbsp; I try to pretend I'm a swimming white seabass.&nbsp; Within 50 yards I saw the first fish, all around 40 to 50 pounds.&nbsp; I experimented with my technique and swam about 15 feet from them, then continued to circle around very silently.&nbsp; They never budged.&nbsp; Well, I had the entire day, no boats racing around, no stupid idiot jet skiers racing through the kelp, and no other spearos.&nbsp; So I decided to milk it, enjoy every second of it.&nbsp;<BR><BR>I continued toward the outside of the kelp (it was a LONG ways out that summer) and continued to see couples and trios of wsb in the 50 to 60 pound range.&nbsp; Once on the outside edge I floated like a dead man on the surface, and, as I expected by now, I would see 60-pound wsb under the kelp fronds, usually 3 to 5 feet below the surface.&nbsp; It's funny; it seems the best way to find wsb successfully is to do nothing.&nbsp; What a paradox!&nbsp; All I did was become a "dead man", no thoughts, no tension in my body, empty, still. I would move by making only the very tiniest of motions with the tip of a fin or sculling motion of the hand in front of my body.&nbsp; Then I'd see a fish, move above it, and then remain motionless, barely breathing, for long periods of time.<BR><BR>What was with these fish?&nbsp; None of them spooked!&nbsp; This was heaven.&nbsp; And, by the way, I am telling the whole truth.<BR><BR>Now, here's the exciting part.&nbsp; The kelp created kind of a peninsula form, then, on the other side, it angled in sharply toward shore (there was a sand bottom), creating a kind of "kelp bay".&nbsp; I slowly swam around this "peninsula", seeing a few individual fish here and there, and then SUDDENLY I looked out in front and below me, and there were about ten white seabass, all giants, all about 60 to 70 pounds.&nbsp; My heart was calm, but I had such an incredible sense of joy inside.&nbsp; What a sight.&nbsp; These fish were mostly faced toward the shore (ocean depth was about 40 feet, the fish were all about 8 feet below the surface).&nbsp; I decided to try something totally unusual.&nbsp; It was a risk, but big deal!&nbsp; This is one of those days in your life when you feel so tuned in, so peaceful and at one with life.&nbsp; Silent, as though I didn't even exist (but exhilarated and totally awake!), I took a deep breath, moved my body in that humpback whale style, lifting my hips ever so silently, raising my right leg and fin straight up, and dropped down to their depth (8 feet).&nbsp; I stopped.&nbsp; Then, 1/2 an inch at a time, slowly moved forward until I was right next to them.&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR>I'm not kidding!!!<BR><BR>I "drifted" next to one of the wsb, about 65 pounds, then stopped.&nbsp; I was parallel with the fish, about two feet from it (I was about 10 feet inside the kelp border, they were inside the kelp to my right).&nbsp; I looked at it in the eye, it looked at me, and they all just continued to sit still in the water (were they asleep?-- they certainly seemed wide awake).&nbsp; I continued about 20 feet past the fish, and while doing so, suddenly caught movement to my left, in the open water (in the kelp bay).<BR><BR>Okay, you don't have to believe this, but it's true.&nbsp; There were about, hmmm, maybe 500 white seabass of all sizes, from the bottom to the surface, and as far out as I could see.&nbsp; Many of the largest fish were headed right for me.&nbsp; I was out of air, so had to surface quietly.<BR><BR>At this point I decided I wanted to enjoy this and not take any risks, so I stayed on the surface (no dives) and always kept over kelp fronds in order to hide a bit.&nbsp; Now I could play with my croaking technique.&nbsp; Grrrrrrnt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grrrrrrnt (a deep low A, low in my larynx).&nbsp; These fish that were close to me all ranged from 60 to 70 pounds.&nbsp; Some of them would kick their tail and then come to a dead stop only one or two feet beneath me.&nbsp; My breathing was about as shallow as I could possibly make it.&nbsp; No motion, no thoughts.&nbsp; My gun was hidden tight and close to me on my right side.<BR><BR>This lasted about one hour.&nbsp; One of the greatest and shortest and most exquisite hours of diving I've ever enjoyed.<BR><BR>THE HEAD-BUTT<BR><BR>Well, you knew this story couldn't last forever.&nbsp; The end comes really fast.&nbsp; I'll just say Skip Hellen inspired me.&nbsp; Basically, I wanted to break his world record of 80 pounds.&nbsp; Well, there were lots of 60 to 70 plus pounders all around me, but no 80 pounders.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; I knew the length of my gun was 60 some inches, so an 80 pounder would have to be longer.&nbsp; As I lay there, I held my gun beneath me and literally measured each fish as it swam below me.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; The fish were mostly holding at around 5 to 5 1/2 feet long, but I was also trying to gage their tail height, the girth, and their head size.&nbsp; Kind of hard, really.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Now, the chills started setting.&nbsp; Bad news.&nbsp; The fish started getting a little restless, but only a little.&nbsp; A couple of tiny rivets in the bodies, a teeny tail slap here and there, fish moving in circles and then coming back to me.&nbsp; Their speed was definitely picking up.&nbsp; No more dead still fish.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Okay, dinnertime.&nbsp; Probably won't be a record, darn it, but I was real hungry for some fresh white seabass, marinated in tons of garlic and virgin olive oil and fresh lemons and sea salt, and grilled lightly over white coals until the white meat falls apart, juices squirting all over at the slightest touch.<BR><BR>So, slowly, my gun tip lowers.&nbsp; Very slowly, unnoticeable.&nbsp; A particularly large fish, not an 80 pounder, though, gets curious and swims right up to the tip (sardine?) then stops and starts to meander away.&nbsp; Well, talk about "I think this is the fish that's meant to be"-- this fish was now positioned with its brain about 6 inches from my tip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whooooops!&nbsp; Instinct!&nbsp; My trigger was off before I even had a thought.&nbsp; BA BOOOOM, the fish exploded away! Damn!&nbsp; I thought it'd be stoned for sure.&nbsp; Whack, the fish turns sharply to the right.&nbsp; Whoooaaa!, the 5/16 shaft is now bent entirely in half!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR><BR>ZZZZZZZZSSSSSSSSSSSSlllllllll, out goes the line from my reel at the speed of light, only right at the surface.&nbsp; Everybody else is just watching the action.&nbsp; The wsb now does something I had never seen-- it leaped out of the water like a marlin!&nbsp; No kidding.&nbsp; Shaft bent in half, sunlight washing everything in white light and blue glimmer, with the gold of the wsb gleaming.&nbsp; Beautiful.&nbsp; Gawd, really beautiful.<BR><BR>Then, in an eye blink, the fish turns around.&nbsp; Now, this fish has stayed on the surface the entire time, it did not go under at all.&nbsp; JEEEEEEEEEshhhhhhhh, here he comes like a bull.&nbsp;&nbsp; BAMMM!!!!! He head-butts me right in my chest!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Actually, I was scared to death.&nbsp; This fish wanted to kill me.&nbsp; Well, I can understand why, but I just never saw anything like this before.&nbsp; I'll tell you, talk about projecting human intention and stuff onto an animal.&nbsp; Whew, that fish had blood for me in its eye.&nbsp; He was enraged.&nbsp; I was terrified, mostly of the shooting line, but also by the fact that this fish appeared to want to kill me.&nbsp; I pushed the fish away from me with my gun, and then kicked back and away as fast as possible.</DIV>
<DIV><BR>The end was swift.&nbsp; He tired out fast.&nbsp; I pulled the line in, careful to stay far from where it was floating, grabbed the shaft, then thrust my left hand under its gill plate, grabbing the throat, then ripping out the gill rakers in one massive pull.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Resting on my back, fish subdued, I felt so happy.&nbsp; The sunlight warming my face (lifted my mask onto my forehead for a moment), the water as still as a swimming pool, the bluffs green and yellow with mustard flowers, I saw that I had an audience of bummed surfers on the cliff.&nbsp; Slowly coming in, it was a joy to bring the fish up.&nbsp; Get this-- the surfers ran down the cliff to greet me and then they all offered to carry my fish and my gear!&nbsp; Whoa!&nbsp; Fine with me.&nbsp; They were all stoked.&nbsp; They had seen the entire battle and couldn't believe what they had just witnessed.<BR><BR>With the blood and gill rakers out of the fish, it weighed about 66 pounds (call Dick Jappe if in doubt, he weighed it).&nbsp; I gutted it immediately and when I cleaned it, the meat was almost as transparent as glass, shimmering kind of silver translucent.<BR><BR>We grilled it and served my entire 50 member Chorale that night (once the phone tree got started)-- Hawaiian style, of course!&nbsp; :)<BR><BR>That was my fish head-butt story.<BR><BR>Thank you,<BR></DIV>

<P>PS; although it's not the very fish from this story, <A href="http://www.freediver.net/freedivelist/photogallery/persons/barville_m/barville_mark_wsb1.jpg">here's a picture of a 72 pounder </A>that I speared in 1992, (unfortunately, that's a dull story, I stoned it).
