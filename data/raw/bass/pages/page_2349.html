Marco Nolli is a Cremonese Master and winner of the gold medal at the
1988 Cremona International Competition. His instrument, a double bass, was aquired by the 
City of Cremona and is on perpetual exhibition at the "Stradivari Museum" in Cremona. 
<P>I personally met Marco a number of times and 
find his work expressive and bold.<P> His violins are mellow, powerful, project well
and are played by well known soloists, worldwide.<BR>
Marco is a Member of the Cremona Violin Makers Consortium.
