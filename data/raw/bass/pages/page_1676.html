    by Mozart</a></p>
  <div align="left"><img src="sheetmusicsanmt.gif" width="39" height="37">The 
    string section has been the chief lyric-harmonic element in the orchestra 
    for much of the past 250 years. This section, which has evolved into five 
    distinct voices, has the capability to sustain major musical ideas either 
    as a choir within the full orchestral texture or in works for strings alone. 
    It has been said that one never tires of the varied sounds and timbres that 
    strings can produce. This depends, of course, on how this very versatile choir 
    is used. Among the different effects created by the string instruments are: 
    double-stops, triple-stops, quadruple-stops, vibrato, glissandos, various 
    bowing styles (ie. Detache, loure, staccato, legato, marcato), trills, tremolo, 
    playing on the fingerboard, playing on the bridge, playing with the wood of 
    the bow, pizzicato, playing with the mute, altering the tuning of the open 
    strings, and harmonics. The four different instruments that make up the string 
    section are the violin, the viola, the cello, and the double bass, and they 
    all have the capability to create these effects. </div>
  <p align="left"><font size="+2"><img src="violin8.jpg" width="139" height="102">The 
    Violin</font></p>
  <p align="left">The violin is the soprano instrument of the string section. 
    The tuning of the violin starts with the G below middle C and goes up in 5ths 
    (G, D, A, E). The practical orchestral range of the violin extends from the 
    low string G to the High E (an octave above the E that is above the treble 
    staff). It is held on the left shoulder, supported by the left side of the 
    chin, and held from underneath by the left arm and hand at the instrument&#8217;s 
    neck. In a full symphony orchestra, there are typically 16 to 18 players playing 
    1st Violin and 14 to 16 players playing 2nd violin. Therefore, the total number 
    of violin players can be anywhere from 30 to 34 players. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+2"><img src="viola.jpg" width="176" height="58">The 
    Viola</font></p>
  <p align="left">The viola is the alto voice of the string section and its playing 
    techniques are similar to that of the violin. However, it is quite a bit larger, 
    sometimes as much as three to four inches, than the violin, and this means 
    that the hand must stretch more to get the intervals in tune. The tension 
    on the left hand is also greater, especially in the higher positions. There 
    are variations in the size of violas, and experts do not agree on the ideal 
    size for the most beautiful, characteristically dark-hued tone quality. <br>
    Viola music is usually notated in the alto clef, but to avoid ledger lines, 
    the upper notes are sometimes written in treble clef. The tuning starts with 
    the C below middle C and continues to go up in 5ths (C, G, D, A). Therefore, 
    the tuning of the viola is exactly one 5th lower than the violin. The practical 
    orchestral range of the viola extends from the low string C to the high A 
    (an octave the A that is above the treble staff). In a full symphony orchestra, 
    there are typically 10 to 12 players. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+2"><img src="strad.gif" width="57" height="143">The 
    Cello</font></p>
  <p align="left"> The cello is both the tenor and the bass of the string section. 
    The violin and the viola are both held on the left shoulder and supported 
    by the chin, but the cello&#8217;s playing position is quite different. The 
    instrument is placed between the player&#8217;s knees and supported on the 
    floor by means of an adjustable peg that slides out of the bottom just below 
    the end of the tailpiece. The neck points over the player&#8217;s left shoulder. 
    <br>
    All music for the cello is written in either the bass, tenor, or treble clef. 
    The tuning starts with the C below the bass staff and continues to go up in 
    5ths (C, G, D, A). As you will notice this is exactly one octave lower than 
    the viola. The practical orchestral range of the cello is the low string C 
    to the G above the treble staff. In a full symphony orchestra, there are typically 
    10 to 12 players. </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="+2"><img src="bass.jpg" width="93" height="214">The 
    Double Bass</font></p>
  <p align="left"> The double bass is really the bass voice of the string section. 
    The instrument stands on an adjustable peg and is supported by the player&#8217;s 
    body and left knee. There are two minor differences in construction between 
    the double bass and the other members of the string section: its shoulders 
    are sloped rather than curved and it has cogwheel tuning pegs to cope with 
    the thickness of its strings. Many bass players sit on a high stool while 
    performing. <br>
    All music for double bass is written in bass, tenor, or treble clef and sounds 
    an octave lower than written. The (written, not sounding) tuning starts with 
    the E below the bass clef and goes up in 4ths (E, A, D, G). This is the only 
    instrument in the string section that is not tuned in 5ths. The (written) 
    practical orchestral range of the double bass is the low string E to the G 
    above the treble staff. In a full symphony orchestra, there are typically 
    8 to 10 players. <br>
