<p>Artificial reef sites in state waters of New York are managed by the NYSDEC Marine Artificial Reef Program and are visited by hundreds of divers each year. These sites are popular for the fishing and photo opportunities made available to members of the local angling and diving communities.</p>

<p>Many different types of animals are found on artificial reef sites. Lobsters are well known for seeking dens that provide refuge from predators. Blackfish are also found at reef sites where they seek prey among the crabs and mussels living on the reef.</p>

<p>Observant divers can learn much about the marine ecology of artificial reefs by exploring the diverse communities that form on these sites. Many divers record their dives with photographs that show the rich diversity of marine life present on the individual reefs sites.</p>

<p>The DEC Marine Artificial Reef Program can benefit from the observations made by divers of what is happening on the various artificial reefs sites. By recording specific details of each dive, such as environmental conditions and types and numbers of animals, local divers can help to monitor the value of these reefs to the recreational fishing and diving communities. This information can also reveal local abundances of fish, lobsters, and other animals found at the reef sites.</p>

<p>If you would like to participate in this program, just take a look at the online volunteer <a href="diver2.pdf">diver log</a> (20 KB, pdf) After your next dive on an artificial reef site in New York, when you are ready to record your diving observation, print the log form, complete it, and mail it to us at this address:</p>

<p>The information you provide will help the DEC to develop a more effective artificial reef program that can enhance future diving and fishing opportunities in New York State marine waters.</p>

<p>We are also looking for participants in the <a href="reefanglers.html">artificial reef volunteer angler program</a>. Please check out the online volunteer <a href="angler.pdf">angler form</a> (9 KB, pdf) if you would like to participate as an angler.</p>
