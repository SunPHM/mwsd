                New Jersey Coast is dotted with numerous wrecks and Artificial 
                Reefs that hold many kinds of game fish from bottom dwellers like 
                <a href="#cod">Cod</a>, <a href="#pollock">Pollock</a>, <a href="#ling">Ling</a>, 
                <a href="#seabass">Sea Bass</a>, and <a href="#tog">Tautog</a> 
                to pelagic species like Bluefish, Sharks and Tuna. In the past, 
                many of these wrecks were out of reach of the average NJ fisherman 
                who owned a small boat, but today with GPS/Loran and good sonar, 
                any boat with a range of 10 to 50 miles can find some excellent 
                angling opportunities at these offshore hotspots.</p>

                Reefs:</a></b> The New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife is 
                currently maintaining 14 reef sites in the ocean along the New 
                Jersey coast. These sites are located between 2 and 25 nautical 
                miles offshore from Sandy Hook to Cape May. Reefs are constructed 
                by sinking heavy structures, such as old ships, concrete debris, 
                rock, obsolete army tanks and prefabricated concrete artificial 
                reef units on the sea floor. The structures are placed within 
                areas designated as reef sites by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
              <p><br>
                Bottom fishing on or around the various hard bottom structures 
                can produce many species of fish. Listed below are fish you will 
                most commonly catch around the wrecks/reefs.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b><img src="images/wreck_reef/sbass_geneken.jpg" width="215" height="204" align="right" alt="gene and ken sea bass"><a name="seabass"></a>Sea 
                Bass:</b> The sea bass can be taken year around offshore but the 
                best fishing inshore occurs when the bottom temperature is about 
                50 F, during May-June and September-October. The black sea bass 
                is a bottom dweller that inhabits wrecks and rocky or &quot;broken&quot; 
                bottom. The primary fishing ground extends from the beach to about 
                8 to 12 miles offshore. Considerable fishing activity also occurs 
                on wrecks up to 18 mile or more offshore. The rocky bottoms at 
                the mouth of the Delaware Bay and the entire coast of North Belmar 
                are heavily fished for sea bass</p>
              <p><br>
                <b><img src="images/wreck_reef/tog_ken.jpg" width="259" height="213" align="left" alt="kens tog"><a name="tog"></a>Tautog 
                (Blackfish):</b> As the sea bass the tog can be taken year around 
                but best fishing occurs between April-June and September-December. 
                The Tautog is a bottom dweller that is found on mussel beds, clam 
                beds, jetties, sod banks, wrecks or rocky bottom ground from the 
                inshore third of the continental shelf. Unlike the sea bass, tog 
                will not stray very far from the structure. Also tog will only 
                feed actively during daylight hours. The primary fishing ground 
                extends from the beach to about 12 fathoms. Tog actively feeds 
                on these inshore grounds during the spring and fall when most 
                are caught. During the winter tog move offshore and become less 
                available to anglers.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b><a name="ling"></a>Red Hake (Ling):</b> Ling are caught all 
                year in depths of over 20 fathoms, but the primary &quot;sportfishing&quot; 
                season occurs during April-May and November-December. Small numbers 
                are present on offshore wrecks and lumps during summer. The ling 
                also frequents muddy bottoms and is in resident in high numbers 
                in the deep waters of the mud hole the entire summer. In New Jersey 
                waters the prime fishing for ling extend from Long Island to just 
                south of Manasquan Inlet. Secondary grounds extend along the southern 
                portion of the state to about 30 miles offshore and includes the 
                24 fathom hole and the Old Grounds.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b><img src="images/wreck_reef/cod_pat.jpg" width="235" height="194" align="left" alt="pats cod"><a name="cod"></a>Cod:</b> 
                Cod can be taken year around all year on offshore wrecks deeper 
                than 25 fathoms. Cod move inshore during November-April when the 
                water temperatures are below 55F. The best fishing on the inshore 
                grounds occurs during November-mid January and March-April. During 
                the past 20 years the cod stock has been at a low level. As a 
                result there has been little recreation fishing activity. Cod 
                have been particularly scarce in near shore waters, and the majority 
                of fishing takes place from party boats on deep offshore fishing. 
                Two areas of wrecks are fished in northern NJ waters, one between 
                the 25 and 40 miles off of Manasquan inlet and the other, 60 to 
                70 miles offshore, including Chicken Canyon. During years of abundance 
                cod were caught inshore on wrecks, reefs, rocky outcroppings, 
                coral and irregular bottoms and offshore shoals.</p>
              <p><br>
                <b><img src="images/wreck_reef/pollock.jpg" width="203" height="166" align="left"><a name="pollock"></a>Pollock:</b> 
                Pollock can be taken off of the New Jersey coast year-round in 
                waters deeper than 20 fathoms. Pollock move inshore and remains 
                there until October-May. The best fishing is during December-April. 
                Pollock is often taken when cod fishing or offshore sea bass fishing. 
                Although fishing for Pollock alone is limited at this time, the 
                two primary grounds include areas of wrecks, one between 60 and 
                70 miles off of Manasquan Inlet and the other 40 to 60 mile off 
                Cape May Inlet. A secondary fishing ground is between 25 and 40 
                miles off of Manasquan Inlet.</p>

                Possibilities:</b> Sometimes you never know what you'll catch 
                when wreck/reef fishing. It always pays to keep live bait out 
                when the water temp is above 50F.</p>
