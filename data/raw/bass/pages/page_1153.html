vintage guitar: i only got screwed by a vintage dealer one time www.mike's music
ohio.com ".however,that was kind of my fault because i bought the bass
site unseen over the internet.they blatantly mis-represented a bass
and then only offered take the item back after a bullshit 20%
"restocking fee".the owner "mike" wouldn't come to the phone he was
always 'too busy" to take my calls.yeah right he was scamming and he
knew it. i'm saying this was my fault because i decided to keep the
bass and didn't put in a claim with my credit card company.kind of
funny as "mike's music" is listed in vintage guitar magazine as one of
the references for the vintage guitar guide-lol too funny!that scumbag
scammer knows exactly what he is doing.after the fact i ran into a few
other guys that have been screwed by him also.he is known to sell
broken guitars.same with that scammer buzzy and that slimo rich guy
who runs rumbleshit.
<br><br>vintage guitar: the l7ces was absolutely gorgeous. the top was thin, so it was a very
responsive instrument. the floating mcarthy pick-up added to its gorgeous
acoustic tone. and the neck was a dream. what a player. what a looker.
fabulous instrument. the electrics looked dated though. but ... what a great
vintage guitar.
<br><br>vintage guitar: the guild artist award felt great and played well. solid guitar, a bit
heavily built maybe. but fine. did not knock me out though. this one was
4200 euro and that's a lot of money. i did see a new one later in a
different store for 10,000 euro and that is a price i'd never pay for one.
i'd go for vintage instantly.
<br><br>vintage guitar: now the weird stuff, when i got out from the vintage guitar shop, i actually
saw brad pitt and george clooney shooting a scene with a film crew on a
bridge over an amsterdam canal. i actually took a pic of them! my wife and
daughter were so excited .... as were all the by-standers.
