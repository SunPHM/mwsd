<img src="../images/kiss-bass-master-record.jpg" width=300 height=240 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="right" alt="Rojas sets record with a 45 lb, 2 oz catch"><p>&quot;You hear about California having all these big bass, but they haven't got squat compared to this lake,&quot; enthused Arizona bass pro Dean Rojas following his record-shattering four-day performance on 22,700-acre Lake Tohopekaliga (Toho) during the recent $431,450 <a href="http://www.bassmaster.com/news/prs_tournrecord_00.htm">BASSMASTER</a> Top 150 Tournament.</p>

<p>Rojas, 29, vaulted into a substantial lead on opening day when he checked in with a five-fish limit catch scaling 45 pounds, 2 ounces and never looked back. His first day haul eclipsed the all-time record since the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) was founded 34 years ago.</p>

<p>Not content to rest upon his laurels, the Arizona flash followed up on day-two with another limit catch weighing 34 pounds, 9 ounces, and actually exceeded the previous four-day tournament mark by the end of the third day. North Carolina's David Fritts set the previous four-day record of 91 pounds, three ounces in 1994 on Lake Seminole.</p>

<p>An original 150-angler field was trimmed to 10 finalists on day four with Rojas holding nearly an 18-pound lead over the next best contender. He managed to bag another limit catch weighing 13-1/2 pounds, running his overall total to an unprecedented 108 pounds, 12 ounces-17-1/2 pounds more than the old record.</p>

<p>&quot;This has just been a phenomenal week for me,&quot; said Rojas who collected the tournament winner's share of the prize money amounting to $110,000.
&quot;The management practices taken by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) have definitely made Lake Toho a top fishery in Florida and the nation.&quot;
Runner-up Mark Davis of Arkansas was astonished at catching a 41-pound, 10-ounce limit on day two and 93 pounds, 10 ounces overall - both records if not for Rojas' heroics.
&quot;I congratulate Dean. What he did by catching over 100 pounds is amazing, and I never thought I would see that happen.&quot;</p>

<img src="../images/kiss-big-bass.jpg" width=300 height=240 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="left" alt="big bass are the order of the day at Lake Toho"><p>&quot;In 34 years of conducting professional fishing tournaments, no one at B.A.S.S. has ever seen anything like the Lake Toho event,&quot; added National Tournament Director Dewey Kendrick.
B.A.S.S. Conservation Director Bruce Shupp echoed the opinions of Rojas, Davis and Kendrick.
&quot;To a natural resource manager that has followed FWC's efforts for many years, I'd say this (tournament) is a tribute to a courageous and aggressive restoration project on the Kissimmee system and the Commission should be commended for their programs.&quot;</p>

<p>FWC's Director of Freshwater Fisheries, Ed Moyer, pointed out that the work enabling the extraordinary results witnessed here actually began in 1971 when Lake Toho was first drawn down to enhance aquatic habitat.  Subsequent draw downs, combined with simultaneously restoring littoral habitat, and replacing noxious weed growth with desirable, productive aquatic plant species, has had a tremendous impact on the quality of not only Lake Toho, but also on more than 70 other major lakes throughout the Florida.</p>

<p>In 1992, the Commission instituted new regulations and policies aimed at returning the state's inland fisheries to their previous greatness.  These rules helped to restore the quality of bass fishing and to extend the benefits of restoration efforts, so that more people could enjoy excellent recreational fishing.  Key components of these rules were reduction of the bag limit from 10 to five bass, implementation of minimum-length limits and an innovative regulation limiting daily harvest of bass longer than 22 inches total length to one.</p>
<p>
&quot;As a result of these earlier actions, anglers can expect many more years of quality fishing throughout the state,&quot; said Moyer.  If funding is appropriated in 2001, we expect to complete our largest enhancement project ever on Lake Toho.  The county commission has also dedicated tourist development tax money and, for the first time, we will receive federal money to work on the lake during a scheduled drawdown.</p>

<p>Osceola County Commissioner Chuck Dunnick suggests that 'we ain't seen nothin' yet.'
&quot;When I was a kid, I saw stringers of big bass in old photos at fishing camps in the area.
&quot;What we saw during the BASSMASTER Top 150 Tournament is just the tip of the iceberg,&quot; Dunnick predicted.  &quot;Lake Toho will truly be a tremendous fishery in three to five years.&quot;</p>

<p>If Dunnick's prophecy comes to pass, perhaps we'll soon be seeing B.A.S.S. records falling like bowling pins.</p>
