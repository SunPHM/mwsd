															<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Mazatlan, has gained worldwide recognition for it&acute;s exceptional saltwater fishing, but the freshwater fishing has developed great enthusiasm among fishermen from all over the world. Local residents have kept it a secret, however we have a very active freshwater club at Lake El Salto The best Mexico Bass Fishing. Lake El Salto is one of the new hot spots for large mouth bass with great lodge accomodations and it&acute;s just 90 minutes away. During the past fishing seasons, the average catch was 80 bass per day, with an average weight of 7 to 16 pounds. As you know, there have been many great bass lakes in the past, but none to equal Lake El Salto. During the fall, spring and winter, most anglers choose to bang the banks, points and shallow areas with top waters, spinner baits, crank baits and Texas-rigged soft plastics and 10 inches power worms, everything works at Lake El Salto. There is plenty to throw at: lots of lay downs, standing timber, and prickly aquatic grass that resembles hydrilla. While Lake El Salto looks promising from one end to the other, the upper half is usually where the best fishing occurs. Please be our guest, check out our fishing packages and send us your email address so that we can let you know about pricing for groups and stay longer than three days.<br>
