    <p>Fished for four hours drifting live bait and did not have a touch.&nbsp; I tossed plugs
    in all the good spots and no takers.&nbsp; Plenty of bait around but no bass.&nbsp; The
    water is below 50 degrees and I think it is about over for inside fishing.&nbsp; There are
    probably fish in the ocean and trolling along the beach should be productive but the bay
    is pretty barren.</p>

    <p>Went waterfowl hunting at the beach house on Sexton Island for the opening of the
    2001/2002 season.&nbsp; Rich Santos, Ken Mearns and Jim Conte were the rest of the crew
    for three days of fun.&nbsp; We had pretty good gunning during the morning flight on all
    three beautiful days.&nbsp; We bagged the limit of brant, one goose, a couple of black
    ducks and a few mergansers.</p>
    <p>Of course, I brought a couple of fishing rods just in case the hunting was slow and the
    fishing was good.&nbsp; On Friday after the lunch break, we did a little fishing for bass.
    &nbsp; It was quite amazing.&nbsp; I plugged a 35 pound bass on a Gibbs popping plug and
    we had two other fish to 20 pounds on live bait, all in an hour of fishing time.</p>
    <p>It was a great weekend of fishing and hunting with good buddies.&nbsp; <strong>It
    doesn't get any better!</strong></p>

    <p>Fished with Seymour.&nbsp; We baited up and looked for bass.&nbsp; It wasn't a great
    day but we did find the fish.&nbsp; Seymour who broke his wrist was fishing with one arm.
    &nbsp; I hooked him up with a Penn 113H and belly gimble with shoulder harness.&nbsp; With
    that set up he could reel without using his left hand.&nbsp; He hooked up and fought the
    fish with no problem.&nbsp; Seymour boated a 25-pound beauty and dropped a fish in the
    30's.&nbsp; Had another run off but overall it was slow even though we had a good day.</p>

    <p>Fished with Seymour, Danny and Jim of Dunewood.&nbsp; It was a tough day with lots of
    wind out of the Northwest.&nbsp; Offshore was unfishable so we had to fish in the inlet
    and bay.&nbsp; It was a tough pick through all the little fluke but we did manage three
    keeper fluke.&nbsp; No signs of weakfish today either.</p>

    else was real quiet.&nbsp; Nasty day with the wind out of the east and blowing.&nbsp; The
    water is really discolored with &quot;brown tide&quot; algae.&nbsp; Lots of small bluefish
    running around but that is about it.&nbsp; The big bass seem to have moved out for the
    time being.&nbsp; When the water cleans up the fishing action should heat up again.</p>

    header bass on the same plug.&nbsp; One fish on each hook.&nbsp; They were both keepers.
    &nbsp; His favorite plug got beat up.&nbsp; Wells was sad about that but had a great time

    plugs.&nbsp; It doesn't get any better.&nbsp; Fish up to 16 pounds on twelve pound test on
    light spinning gear in the tough currents of the inlet.&nbsp; We had a triple on at one
    time with lines all wrapped around each other and still managed to boat all three fish.
    &nbsp; We limited out with all fish between 35 and 36 inches.&nbsp; We then caught a few
    flounder and had some fun with that.&nbsp; We also hit some schools of bluefish and had
    fish up to 12 pounds.&nbsp; The weakfish scene was quiet today.&nbsp; We tried some places
    but they weren't there.&nbsp; I think they all moved out onto the flats and are on the
    spawn.&nbsp; The cold snap probably put them down for a couple of days.&nbsp; Had them
    yesterday but not today.&nbsp; They call it fishing and not catching and sometimes that is
    the way it goes.&nbsp; It was a good day however and all had fun.</p>

    <p>Fished for flounder for a couple of hours in the afternoon.&nbsp; Worked a couple of
    areas around Babylon and Lindenhurst and didn't catch a thing.&nbsp; The water is still
    very cold.&nbsp; I think we need to have a few warm days to get things started.</p>

    <p>Fished the Connetquot River again.&nbsp; I was the invited guest of Bruce Morabito and
    the Idle Hour Fly Fishers Club.&nbsp; This group does a lot to support the efforts for
    fly-fishing at the Connetquot River State Park and Preserve.&nbsp; I was able as an
    invited guest to seen the hatchery in operation.&nbsp; I was also allowed to visit all the
    fishing sites which are called &quot;beats.&quot;&nbsp; Bruce and I fished most of the
    sites and had a ball with brook, rainbow and brown trout.&nbsp; We also caught a few
    &quot;steelhead.&quot;&nbsp; The Casual Dress Nymph was the hot fly for the day.&nbsp; We
    landed many fish from 2 to well over 3-pounds.&nbsp; Beautiful weather also helped to make
    it a great day.</p>

    <p>Fished the Connetquot River with Jim Conte.&nbsp; We had a ball.&nbsp; Lots of big
    rainbow trout and a few brookies.&nbsp; It was a beautiful day.&nbsp; No wind, lots of sun
    and warming temperatures.&nbsp; We even saw a small hatch take place about 11 am.&nbsp; We
    used streamers and nymphs.&nbsp; Both worked very well.&nbsp; The rainbow streamer seemed
    to do best.&nbsp; The fish were between 2 and 4 pounds.&nbsp; Real good fighters.</p>
