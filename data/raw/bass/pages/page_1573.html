If it's with his wife and children, it's great. If it's with friends, it's wonderful. If he is playing with Martin, it's excellent. And if it's with the band, enough with the superlatives already....</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Past musical experiences with Andy have been in what might - loosely - be described as formal venues. Whether it is the wonderful Mill Theatre in Banbury or any number of locations throughout the so-called ' folk rock belt', there has always been the element of seriousness about the gig. After all, music is a serious business for young Guttridge.</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">It was therefore something of a pleasure to see Andy in slightly different circumstances at his latest live performance. The gig was noticeable for two reasons - firstly, it was to celebrate a 21st birthday party and, secondly, the first formal live performance by The Andy Guttridge Band.</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Regular readers will know that TAGB (you think we're gonna type that lot in again?) first appeared in Banbury on November 3rd 2000. On that occasion the bass guitar was wielded by the very capable Mick Bennion, of Banbury favourites 'The Unprofessionals'. This time however saw the awesome Roger Innis take the role - for three reasons. First, Steve Gibbons was not playing anywhere and second, Elkie Brookes was not touring. Thirdly, Andy asked him to play and fourthly - well, we won't get Pythonesque here.<img border="0" src="../../images/andy_g/010302/toby.jpg" alt="Toby - no, we didn't pose this one.  Honest...." align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="129" height="237"></font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Python? Are we talking humour here? We sure are. Anyone who has seen Andy and number one sidekick Martin Green perform before will know that the two spark off of each other.&nbsp; Gentle jibes swapped back and forth, be it through a dropped note or a miscue etc., all add to the enjoyment of the performance.</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">This time, the addition of 'Unprofessional' drummer Toby Bennett and Roger added a new dimension, not just to the music, but to the fun as well. To be fair to both Roger and Toby, neither are as familiar with the music as perhaps they should be. A result, certainly, of a lack of rehearsal time together, but also of Rogers ability to change his part as it happens and Tobys pre-occupation with the impending birth of his third child. Best wishes to you and your wife mate.</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial"><img border="0" src="../../images/andy_g/010302/roger.jpg" alt="Roger (thinks - why did I buy a six string bass guitar??)" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="177" height="159">For all that, the performance was, on the night, spot-on. Once or twice one of the four would call time towards the end of a solo, noticeably during the extended solo that saw Martin and Roger swap riffs in the middle of General Store. The Pink Panther theme got a brief outing and I swear that Roger played the chord riff to Smoke On The Water on his six string bass plank. Roge, mate, it's a lead guitar part....</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Throughout the evening each member of the quartet more than justified his inclusion within the band. Toby played a solid underpinning role on the drums, never for one moment allowing himself to be fazed by Rogers deviation from the script. Roger, for his part, just continues to amaze on the bass guitar and showed, once again, why the likes of Gibbons and Ms Brookes want him in their bands.</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Martin Green is just one fantastic lead guitarist. Whether he is electric with another<img border="0" src="../../images/andy_g/010302/martin.jpg" alt="Martin - I'm just a sensitive type really" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="203" height="212"> Banbury band (Spank The Monkey) or acoustic with Andy, the man is just unbelievable. It has to be said though that, within the confines of the acoustic setup that is 'Andy Guttridge (be it duo, trio or band), he does sometimes wish for a Les Paul electric - complete with 'whammy' bar. Whether he will ever master the trick of swapping acoustic for the electric fast enough during 'Perfect Bliss' will, sadly, remain one of life's untried&nbsp; mysteries. Certainly he gave the impression that, for this night only, only an electric solo would do....</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">And then, of course, there is Andy Guttridge. All he did was give his name to the band, play rhythm guitar, write most of the songs and sing them all.</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">And sing he most certainly does.&nbsp; Beautifully.&nbsp; His reading of the Ewan Macoll classic 'First Time' is exquisite; 'Crazy' is delivered with passion and every other number, be it a cover or an original gets given full measure.</font></p><p><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">The set list for the night featured:</font></p><p><font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">Homeless - </font>B<font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">lack Shepherd - </font>S<font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">ave Me (new song) - Perfect Bliss - The </font>Fi<font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">rst Time (Ever I Saw Your Face) - </font>P<font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">arking Lot - </font>Th<font COLOR="#000000" size="3" face="Arial">e Why?
