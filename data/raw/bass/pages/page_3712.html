Ferraris crossing the Continental Divide and exploring Colorado’s fall colors is 
certainly a story in itself! But then you add being the guest at Colorado’s 
finest wineries, a spectacular five course, twin-entry meal and you end up with 
a remarkable weekend!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">September 22 was the date for the Fall 
Foliage and Winery Tour. This was the<a href="fall%20tour%20two.jpg"><img border="2" src="fall%20tour%20two_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="fall tour two.jpg" align="right" width="91" height="133"></a> 
concluding event for 2001 for the Ferrari Fine Dining and Racing Association (FFDRA). 
First, a word about FFDRA. FFDRA was first formed in Dallas by John &amp; Linda 
Pembroke. Following racing events a number of Ferrari owners wanted to get 
together for a nice meal and a bottle of red wine. Racing stories (and lies) 
were exchanged and the FFDRA was born. Soon the dinners outnumbered the racing 
events. Now, in Colorado, FFDRA meets monthly at selected fine restaurants for 
an evening of camaraderie and stories of past racing and road-going Ferrari 
events.</p>

<img border="2" src="fall%20tour%20three_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="fall tour three.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="66"></a>The 
Fall Foliage and Winery Tour took place on the exact weekend when Colorado’s 
fall color change was at its peak. The three-day, two-night excursion took the 
group into Colorado’s high country. The tour group convened at 7:30 am on I-70 
at Evergreen, Colorado to depart via Loveland Pass to Leadville, Colorado. 
Leadville hosts the National Mining Museum. Colorado’s tradition is 
significantly based in mining. After touring the museum, the group traversed 
over the 12,000 foot heights of Independence Pass, the top-center of the 
continental divide, arriving in Aspen for a light lunch. The Hotel Jerome 
handled our accommodations for the evening. After checking into the hotel, 
several of the group watched an international rugby tournament, while others 
took in the world class shopping. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Dinner that evening was at the Mother Lode 
Restaurant. The building was built in<a href="fall%20tour%20five.jpg"><img border="2" src="fall%20tour%20five_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="fall tour five.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="66"></a> 1886. Original portraits of Victorian 
belles on the walls with warm and comfortable fireplaces evoke a feeling of 
yesteryear. The restaurant has operated continuously for over 40 years. The 
Mother Lode is named after a silver-mining term for the richest vein in a mine. 
Sufficient wine, along with our pan-roasted Chilean sea bass wrapped in prosciutto, was distributed to all guests to ensure the continuation of the 
FFDRA tradition!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><a href="fall%20tour%20six.jpg">
<img border="2" src="fall%20tour%20six_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="fall tour six.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="66"></a>Early Sunday morning the group departed for 
the Maroon Bells, a visual highlight on the west side of Aspen. The Maroon Bells 
are one of Colorado’s most photographed sights. Three mountains rise 
majestically from a narrow valley and reflect in a multi-acre fresh water lake. 
Normally, automobiles are not allowed to enter the park area. Our Trail Boss and 
tour leader, Kent Miller, secured close-up parking from the Park Rangers for the 
Ferrari entourage. That day, hundreds of photographers were set to photograph 
the famous Maroon Bells. The colors were extraordinary. Soon, numerous 
photographers were surrounding and photographing the Ferraris. One group from 
Japan asked who were the movie stars? It seems in Japan only movie stars drive 
Ferraris.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">At around 11:00 the group left the park for 
a direct blitz to Grand Junction. Once arrived, the group parked their Ferraris 
for a deluxe coach ride to three wineries. First on the agenda was Plum Creek 
Cellars, our host for the weekend. We were greeted by Doug Phillips, owner, who 
explained how the Colorado wine experience got started. After tasting numerous 
varitels, we departed for Two Rivers Winery and Canyon Wind Cellars. At around 
5:00 we were all glad we were being chauffeured back to our hotel and that our 
cars were safely tucked away for the night. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Sunday’s dinner was hosted by Doug and 
Susan Phillips, owners of Plum Creek Cellars. Our dinner started with New 
England lump crab cakes accompanied with mango and Jamaican jerk aioli. To our 
surprise our chef had prepared two main courses to be served separated by Plum 
Creek Riesling Sorbet. Our first treat was crusted sea bass rubbed with tandori 
paste, lollo rosso greens partnered with white truffle homey Dijon vinaigrette 
over carambola garni and grape tomatoes. Next we were treated to Applewood 
smoked, grilled veal chop with a rainwater Madeira veal glace. The spectacular 
veal was surrounded by chanterelle and lobster mushroom risotto and caper 
berries, sugar snaps and baby carrots. During this dining experience, Doug had 
hand picked ten different wines to heighten each course. His explanation of the 
flavors and the character of the wines added to the enjoyment of the evening. 
Finally, desert included pear ginger merlot ice cream in chocolate (edible) 
glass with white chocolate strawberries, fresh blackberries, raspberries and 
gold kiwi!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Monday morning the FFDRA departed Grand 
Junction splitting into two touring groups. One did a direct dash back to 
Denver, the other, to the Grand Mesa. The Grand Mesa, located southeast of Grand 
Junction, is the largest flattop mountain in North America. The scenery was 
breathtaking as you carved through switchbacks and overlooked hundreds of miles 
of bright yellows, reds and green trees and brush. For those of you that have 
visited the Grand Canyon, the Grand Mesa has a similar look. Deep cuts and 
gorges that stretch for miles. Additionally, unlike the Grand Canyon, there are 
over 30 fresh water lakes with elk and dear greeting you at each stop. It took 
our group almost four hours to cover the 135 miles, and we still didn’t see all 
that was offered by the Grand Mesa. Give yourself a treat and include the Grand 
Mesa on you next trip to Colorado. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Truly, this event was made for road-going 
Ferraris! The sounds of the Ferrari exhausts echoing off the steeply pitched 
mountain passes added to our visual pleasure. The tour covered over 650 miles 
ending up back in Denver late Monday evening. </p>
