            <p class="innerheaders">There are some excellent hand made instruments 
              coming over from Central Europe. Can you tell me where this one 
              was made? </p>
            <p class="body"> Its difficult to pin point exactly where this good 
              looking hand-made "three-quarter" size instrument was 
              made but if we were forced to proffer an educated guess as to the 
              country of origin we would most probably say that it emanated from 
              either Hungary, the Czech Republic or Russia. Its impossible to 
              be any more specific than that because this particular model of 
              instrument &#8211; viol shaped with a swell back and outside linings 
              - has been manufactured on the continent since the early twentieth 
              century. It is for this reason that the exact date of the instrument 
              is difficult to pin point too. Once again an educated estimate based 
              on the internal colouration of the timber would place its construction 
              to be within the last five to ten years.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> What will I get for my money?</p>
            <p class="body"> We can assure you that you'll be getting a 
              lot of value for your money if you buy this instrument. I keep harping 
              on that to buy the timber alone &#8211; here in England - to start 
              making a double bass of this quality would cost in the region of 
              two thousand pounds, and that's even before you start putting 
              a chisel to it. On top of this The Contrabass Shoppe has spent a 
              considerable amount of time and effort improving both the acoustical 
              and playability qualities of the instrument. The repair and adjustment 
              invoice reads as follows; "Remove front, re-thickness front 
              where necessary, make and fit new bass-bar, reglue front, shoot 
              fingerboard, fit new top nut, bush endpin hole and fit new endpin 
              unit, fit new bridge with aluminium adjusters, fit new sound post, 
              clean instrument and touch in varnish where necessary".</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Summary:</p>
            <p class="body"> A very well presented instrument that sounds and 
              looks good. An instrument such as this should easily see you through 
              your student days at college or as an excellent companion should 
              you be a touring jazzer. </p>
