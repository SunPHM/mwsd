			<p>Smallmouth Bass Fishing In Ontario: <center><b>Parry Sound and Multisport Canada Present<br>
One Of The Most Challenging Bike Courses Of The Summer</b><br>
August 27 and 28, 2005</center><br>
Parry Sound, Ontario, Canada hosts an Ontario Half Iron Distance Triathlon and Duathlon at beautiful Waubano Beach Park.  The sprint triathlons, sprint duathlons and sprint relays, along with the Kids of Steel and Adult Aquathons, will take place on August 27, 2005.  The half iron distance triathlon, half iron distance duathlon and half iron distance relays will run on August 28, 2005.
<br><br>
<b>Post Race Report 2004</b><br>
Well the weather was great on Saturday and the rain on Sunday was probably a blessing in disguise for the run. Once again the feedback we've received from our participants was that everyone loved the courses and the venue. We hope that you agree and will be back in 2005.
<br><br>
The only foreseeable change to next year's races will be that the Half Iron Distance Bike will not have the construction at the 3.5KM mark and will be a much smoother ride. A GPS system was used to mark both the Sprint and Half Iron Distance swim courses. On the surface it may look like the swim times are a little fast but this can probably be attributed to the fact that athletes were able to run or dolphin dive the last 50 metres as they came out of the water.

<b>The Venue:  <a href="http://www.townofparrysound.com/?kw=triathlon%20canada">The Town of Parry Sound</a></b>
<br><br>
Our Vision:  To be the world renowned jewel of the 30,000 Islands on Georgian Bay.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.townofparrysound.com/waterfront.asp?kw=ontario%20triathlon">Parry Sound's waterfront</a> is a gathering place on the shores of magnificent Georgian Bay where culture meets nature - a place of vitality and economic opportunity.
<br><br>
The Town of Parry Sound lies in the heart of the famous 30,000 Islands. It is surrounded by the beauty of Georgian Bay and the rugged pink granite of the Canadian Shield, with its forests, lakes and streams. Parry Sound is a four seasons vacation destination with excellent waterfront facilities for boating, fishing and cruise boating.
<br><br>
For its unique balance of natural conservation and residential use, Georgian Bay's eastern shoreline region was recently designated Canada's 13th <b>biosphere reserve</b> by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  The biosphere designation works to preserve the natural shoreline, as well as promote the area.  Parry Sound lies at the heart of the 3,420 square kilometre reserve.
<br><br>
Parry Sound's extraordinary new centre for arts and entertainment, the <a href="http://www.charleswstockeycentre.com/festivalperformancehall/index_cwsc.html">Charles W. Stockey Centre for the Performing Arts</a>, houses a 480-seat acoustically sound Festival Performance Hall which offers a wide variety of year-round entertainment programming including professional theatre productions, concerts, movies, and community events.  With its newly installed computerized digital projector, this leading-edge audio-visual system makes it an excellent venue for corporate meetings and conferences.
<br><br>
In any season, be sure to visit the <a href="http://www.bobbyorrhalloffame.com/" target="blank">Bobby Orr Hall of Fame</a> where we celebrate the astonishing legacy of Parry Sound's own Bobby Orr, one of the greatest hockey players of all time, and all the other great athletes of this area.  Come see the many pieces of memorabilia from Bobby Orr's most famous moments as a professional player, and experience the interactive displays -- record your own commentary in the Play-by-Play Booth, take on an NHL goalie in the Slap Shot zone, or be the goalie in the Hockey Skills Zone.
