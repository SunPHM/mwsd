  <p align="left"><b>Liberty Reservoir (Carroll County):</b> Fishing is holding 
    steady. Shoreline bass fishing has been good using medium to large shiners, 
    crayfish, chicken liver, crankbaits, and 10-inch power worms. Fathead minnows, 
    Mini Mites, and maggots have been catching bluegills crappies at Nicodemus

    of water have been producing bass. Roger Hudy of Damascus, Maryland, caught 
    a 22 inch, 6 pound largemouth bass during the afternoon of June 26th just 
    prior to dark. He caught this beautiful largemouth on a 4 inch motor-oil plastic

    4.89 pounds. That cat was caught using chicken liver. The next night fishing 
    opportunity is Thursday, July 11th. Fishing the hydrilla beds for largemouth 
    bass has been excellent. Double bladed spinnerbaits, wacky worms, and large 
    rubber worms have been effective. </p>
