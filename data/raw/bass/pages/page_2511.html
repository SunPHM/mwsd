<p>No Mexico bass fishing lake has ever received the amount of hype that Lake Huites (pronounced Wee-tez) did prior to its opening in the fall of 1997. With forecasted fishing reports of 100-250 bass per day in the 3-6 pound range and new sport fishing laws in place to protect them, anglers locked in droves to dabble their hooks in what some believed would be the hottest lake in the history of Mexico bass fishing.</p>

	<td><p>During the last six years, anglers going to Lake Huites to do some Mexico bass fishing have proven that hype to be true. According to fishing reports, the hottest Mexico bass fishing lake in the world might be Lake Huites, located on Mexico's West Coast, outside the city of Los Mochis. When at full pool, Lake Huites is a 30,000-acre man-made reservoir that had been initially stocked with Florida strain largemouth bass fingerlings to jump-start the fishery. These Lake Huites bass have taken a liking to the mountainous climate, long growing season and an abundant, protein-rich diet of tilapia and shad. </p></td>

	<td><br><p>They have been growing at a rapid rate. When conditions are right, fishing reports indicate that skilled Mexico bass fishing anglers are catching in excess of 75 bass a day and 10 pound plus trophies are being caught frequently at Lake Huites. The local guides have an intimate knowledge of this deep, clear lake and will take you to prime structures that concentrate Lake Huites' fantastic bass population.</p><p>Bass, by nature, are object juts. Lake Huites offers them a variety of the good stuff. Wood Cover and rocks are abundant in Lake Huites, and the bass use both to their advantage. For best results, anglers should try spinner baits, soft plastics, top waters, Rat-L-Traps and crank baits around shoreline brush and on main lake and secondary points. Anglers will enjoy trouble-free casting from the decks of 17 1/2 -foot custom bass boats. The boats are equipped with 55 and 65 horsepower motors and dual tanks that'll allow you to get to those special Lake Huites fishing holes quickly and easily.</p></td>

<p>Lake Huites has to rate among the most scenic impoundments in Mexico. The 30,000-acre lake was built on the Rio Fuerte River and winds for 30 miles through the steep, rocky bluffs of the Sierra Madres. The lodging facility we represent on Lake Huites is one of the finest on the water. It's the Lake Huites Lodge. The lakeside complex features air-conditioned, spacious bedrooms, private baths, shower and a rustic palapa where anglers can dine on gourmet meals and exchange those incredible tales of the day's fishing action.</p>
