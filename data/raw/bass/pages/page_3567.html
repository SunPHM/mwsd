      <font size="4">Dear Dr. Andrews,</font>
      <p><font size="4">RE: NW &amp; NWSFC Netting Byelaws and the Conwy Estuary
      Bass Nursery Area</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Thank you for your letter dated 30th April 2004.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Having read your letter and fact sheet regarding the new
      Byelaws I note that it now gives a very basic overview of the old &amp;
      new laws, however I am still unsure of the protection now offered to bass
      and migratory salmon and sea trout from commercial nets men.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Having looked at the old byelaw 24 I refer you to
      paragraph c which states that persons were required to obtain authorisation
      for netting in certain areas e.g. area 3. Any other netting was strictly
      prohibited.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">The new Byelaw 24 para c suggests that any gill net is
      now acceptable for 9 months of the year.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Moving on to paragraph diii, the authorisation would
      only be given to mesh sizes greater than 250mm in certain areas e.g. area
      3.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">The new Byelaw confirms that any gill net is now
      acceptable for 9 months of the year.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Please can you clarify exactly how the reduction in mesh
      size to ‘any size’ for 9 months of the year and the removal of
      required authorisation helps protect the fish stocks?</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">I am also concerned that the WFSA was not informed or
      consulted on this matter! The areas under discussion have a great draw for
      many anglers and bring ££££'s into the local economy - far more than
      commercial angling will do. With it having an obvious effect on WFSA
      members and traveling angers I feel it would have been more constructive
      for both parties to have been involved in the consultation stage to help
      formulate the way forward for all concerned.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">I look forward to hearing from you in the very near
      future.</font></p>
      <p><font size="4">Yours sincerely</font></p>
