<p>The sea bass or barramundi <i>Lates calcarifer</i> is one of nine  <i>Lates</i> species (the others mostly in fresh waters in Africa) of  the Family Centropomidae.   Sea bass is widely distributed in coastal and fresh waters in the tropical Indo-West Pacific, from the Persian Gulf to India to northern Australia.  </p>
<p>Sea bass is protandrous,  that is, the fish mature first as  males and become females when they get older and larger.  Sea bass spawn in coastal waters near river mouths, usually at the start of the rainy season.  The pelagic eggs (0.7-0.8 mm in diameter) and larvae (1.6 mm long at hatching) develop at sea.  In a few weeks, larvae move into mangroves, flood plains, and other coastal nursery areas where they settle as juveniles, and may then be caught for grow-out farms.  Juveniles move upstream into lakes, where they remain for 3-4 years until they mature as males.  Mature fish migrate downstream out to sea to spawn.  Sea bass are carnivorous, taking a broad range of prey but mainly fish and crustaceans, and including their own kind.  Sea bass is easy to breed and propagate and grows fast in farms.  It has high market value in Australia and in the large cities in Asia. </p>

<p><i><font color="blue">Broodstock and Seed Production</font></i></p>
<p>To establish criteria for egg quality assessment, the biochemical characteristics of fertilized sea bass eggs were correlated with egg quality (J Nocillado). Positive correlation exists between fertilization rates and total saturated fatty acids, phosphoserine, and aspartic levels; between hatching rate and DHA/EPA (eicosapentanoic acid) ratio; and between the percentage of normal zygotes and the DHA and aspartic acid content. Arginine in spawned eggs is negatively correlated with hatching rate.</p>
<p>Mature sea bass readily spawn by injection or implantation of hormones such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRHa). The bioactivity of LHRHa depends on proper storage.  Sea bass spawn when injected an LHRHa solution that had been frozen and thawed or when implanted LHRHa pellets stored at room temperature (Garcia 1996).  Spawning is significantly reduced with the injection of dissolved LHRHa solutions that had been stored for more than 90 days in a refrigerator (4-10 C) or for more than 30 days at room temperature (28-30C). </p>
<p>Research to reduce the use of <i>Artemia</i> in sea bass seed production was continued. The brackishwater cladoceran <i>Diaphanosoma celebensis</i> was tested as partial replacement of <i>Artemia</i> in rearing sea bass larvae (de la Pena et al. 1998). Compared to <i>Artemia</i>, <i>Diaphanosoma</i> contains higher crude protein and crude fat, but lower n-3 HUFA, particularly EPA and DHA.  Nursery rearing of small juveniles may be done in illuminated floating net-cages.  High zooplankton abundance at night  under the 300 lux lamps increases the feeding incidence, gut contents, specific growth rate, and survival of the juveniles, relative to those in non-lighted cages (Fermin et al. 1996; Fermin and Seronay 1997). Growth and survival are enhanced in larvae fed minced 'trash fish' during the day.</p>

<p><i><font color="blue">Grow-out</font></i></p>

<p>Catacutan and Coloso (1997) formulated a practical diet for sea bass containing 20% carbohydrate, 10-12% lipid (1:1 mixture of cod liver oil and soy bean oil), 42.5% dietary protein, energy level of about 337-358 kcal/100 g diet, and a protein:energy ratio close to 128 mg of protein per kcal. White cowpea and green mungbean meals can be used to replace 18% of the fish meal in practical diets without affecting the growth of sea bass (Eusebio and Coloso 1999).  The quantitative requirements for arginine, lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine have been determined (Coloso et al. 1999), and experiments for isoleucine, leucine, and valine are ongoing  (RM Coloso).</p>
<p>Experiments have been done on the use of immunostimulants for disease prevention and in sea bass.  Based on plasma lysozyme levels, betaglucans and levamisole have enhancing effect on the nonspecific immune response while handling stress and poor water quality has a negative effect on the immune response of sea bass (JM Almendras).</p>
