      <p class="p">Below are excerpts from an interview with David by Joshua Rosenbaum
        published in Bass Player Magazine in March of 1995. The interview deals
        with many questions of importance to those on the look-out for a new bass.
        We hope to soon have a similar Instrument buying guide for cellos. If
        you have any questions you would like to see answered here, please e-mail

      <p class="p">"When many of New York's top acousitic bass players need to
        have work done on their instruments or are in the market for another bass,
        their first stop is invariably David Gage String Instrument Repair in
        Manhattan's Tribeca district. Gage's clients include such world'class
        jazz bassists as Dave Holland and Ray Brown as well as first-chair players
        for the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. But David
        doesn't just sell and repair instruments; he also takes the time to listen
        to his customers, advise them, and educate them. And you don't have to
        be a pro to patronize his shop - students and amateurs get the same kind
        of informed and courteous attention as the big names...</p>
      <p class="p"><a name="price" class="p2">An acoustic bass can cost anywhere
        from $1,500 to $20,000 and up. If you buy an expensive bass, what are
        you getting for the higher price?</a><br>
        In generals terms, you're getting an instrument that's made more carefully
        - one that has fewer problems, more volume, and no weak spots in its tone.
        You're basically buying a healthy bass. When you get up over $10,000,
        you might be buying pedigree, too; the maker may have been well known,
        so you're buying a collector's item. <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="origin" class="p2">Does the country of origin have
        an effect on price?</a><br>
        Italian basses tend to cost more; the English, French, and German instruments
        usually have lower prices. Old Italian basses like Guarneris, made in
        the 18th century, are considered to be better because their sound has
        huge, wonderful spread. When classical musicians audition for orchestral
        jobs, the orchestra is looking for that sound. Bu you should be careful,
        because the more money doesn't guarantee you a better bass. [For more
        details, please check the <a href="z_gallery_atlas.htm" class="bodylink">Instrument
        Atlas</a> page.] <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="age" class="p2">Is there a big difference between
        old and new basses?</a> <br>
        Traditionally, old ones are more in demand; basses and other instruments
        in the violin family mellow and become better over time, although there
        are excellent makers of new instruments. Some people say new basses are
        risky because the wood is green and therefor more likely to crack. That
        may be true for companies that mass-produce basses, but if you're buying
        a bass from a good maker, he will have used wood that was air-dried over
        a considerable period of time, so it shouldn't be a problem. Top-quality
        new carved-top basses cost $12,000 and up. <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="carved-top" class="p2">What are the pros and cons
        of carved-top and plywood basses?</a><br>
        For bowing, a carved-top bass is generally better. They usually have a
        more sophisticated sound, with a more even tone throughout. If you are
        going into music school and taking a traditional classical approach, a
        carved-top would be more suitable. A good one, set up properly, costs
        at least $3,000. Plywood, on the other hand, gives you more strength,
        so the basses tend to be more solid. They're less vulnerable to humidity
        changes and damage from being hit. For a jazz player, a plywood bass can
        be more effective than a carved bass plywood basses tend to have a fat
        front end, and they often record better. In my opinion, plywood basses
        improve with age; a quality Kay bass that's 30 or 40 years old can be
        a really good instrument. Plywood basses are a good option - they're not
        just a poor man's instrument. A good plywood bass, worked on and set up
        properly, costs between $1,500 and $2,500 here. <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="setup" class="p2">How important is setup?</a><br>
        It's very important. Plywood basses are often thought of as the kind of
        instruments you see in high schools - difficult-to-play basses that are
        poorly set up, with high action. If you start on one of those, it's easy
        to give up. It's important for a plywood bass to be properly set up and
        to have a good ebony fingerboard. Many plywood basses coming out now have
        white wood fingerboards; the necks often warp, which increases the string
        height and the difficulty of playing. <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="size" class="p2">What's the best size for a bass?</a><br>
        My first bass was a very big one, and I fell in love with that big sound.
        I figured: the bigger the bass, the bigger the sound. The string length
        of that bass was over 44", and it took me a whileto find out I couldn't
        really lay it. I wasn't playing in tune, and it was so difficult it put
        me at a disadvantage. You can hurt your left hand with a bass that's too
        big. If the bridge is set correctly - basically, at the notches of the
        f-holes - I wouldn't recommend a string length over 42 ½. Also, unlike
        the violins and cellos, basses come in many different shapes, and the
        width of the shoulders can vary a lot, But generally, that's not too important
        as long as you can get around when you're playing. <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="flatback" class="p2">How about the differences between
        a flat-back and <br>
        rounded-back basses?</a><br>
        Some people say flat backs project better and have a better sound, but
        that's a matter of opinion. Flat backs tend to have more problems due
        to humidity than round backs. They're traditionally made of maple - unlike
        the top, which is spruce - and maple reacts more to humidity changes.
        In the summertime, when there's more humidity, the back fills up with
        water and bows forward; in the winter, the back bows the other way, pulling
        the fingerboard up into the strings. <a href="#top" class="bodylink">[top]</a></p>
      <p class="p"><a name="considerations" class="p2">What are the most important
        things to consider when <br>
        shopping for a bass?</a><br>
        First, learn what kind of sound you like. Do you want to sound like Ray
        Brown? Paul Chambers? Marc Johnson? No bass can make you play like those
        guys, but it can get you closer to the sound you're hearing. There are
        certain immediately visible problems you should look for. If there's a
        crack where the neck and body join, that's pretty serious, especially
        if it's close to the fingerboard. Check the varnish - if you see little
        holes in the bass, that could be a sign of worm damage, which can be a
        serious problem. If the top sagging in where the tailpiece is? That's
        a classic problem, too. Use a yardstick to check the fingerboard. When
        you put the yardstick at the seam between the fingerboard and the neck,
        the seam should be perfectly straight. If someone put the fingerboard
        on with the neck warped, or if the fingerboard has been planed too much,
        that will show up. A very thin fingerboard results in a weak sound and
        buzzing. Also, check the center seam on the back of the bass; if it's
        separating, or it looks as it it's been stuffed with glue or sawdust,
        that's a major problem and will be a source of buzzing. A good seem should
        look very clean, like a pencil line. There are three other things to look
        for that you can't see right away. First, is the neck straight? Look straight
        down the neck and see how it lines up; that can be difficult, but a repairmen
        can help you. Second, look inside the bass. You'll need a special took,
        often call a furnace-inspection mirror, that has a low-wattage light bulb
        and a mirror mounted on a stick. Put it in the f-hole and look at the
        blocks at the end pin. Make sure they're not cracked. Check to see that
        the bass bar - the beam that crosses from top to bottom on the E-string
        side - is in place. If it's not, it's going to cost you a considerable
        amount to repair. New blocks and bass bars can cost $1,000 each, and resetting
        the neck can cost about $700. Third be sure the play up the whole neck
        to see if there are any problems with the sound. It's important to establish
        where the wolf tone is. Play the octave A on the A string. Go down a whole-step
        on the G. Then slide up through the A to the B - you'll hear generally
        speaking, the sound getting rougher. If the bass has a bad wolf tone,
        that might be a consideration. The only real way to eliminate a wolf tone
        is to use something called a wolf eliminator, which you put on the string;
        it dampens the wolf tone, but it also dampens the whole sound of the instrument."
