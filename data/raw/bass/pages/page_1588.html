Burns are also well known for their fine bass guitars. Their fine sound, along with the fact that they are both good players and lookers, have made them popular with several famous bands both past and present.

<b>The Artist bass (1960-62)</b><p>
The sister of the Vibra Artist Guitar. Styling and fittings updated accordingly to match. Cherry finish with rosewood fingerboard, and black scratchplate. Two Tri-Sonic Bass type
pickups. Two volume, two tone and one 3-way select and one bass boost switch.
A good instrument, but not as popular as the guitar, and therefore, fewer were made.

<b>The Bison Bass (1964-65)</b><p>

The Bison underwent drastic changes in 1964, matching those of the guitar. Only the body
styling remained unaltered. 3 Rez-o-Matic bass type pickups (the earliest with Nu-Sonic pu). One volume-control, two tone-control and one 3-way select. Standard finish in black or white with grey tortoiseshell scratchplate. Scrollhead.  Rosewood fingerboard. Although the Bison Bass was a good instrument, it was no longer distinctive in style or sound, and fewer basses were made.
