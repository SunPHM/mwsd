              still remember feeling the anxiety and apprehension as the plane 
              touched down on the runway at the airport in Guadalajara.&nbsp; 
              As we slowly taxied to the exit ramp, the question kept creeping 
              into my mind "Will the kid do alright?"&nbsp; That question would 
              be answered later. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As we stood 
              together at the baggage claim area we found everything intact.&nbsp; 
              It was amazing - we had enough stuff to start a Mexican Sporting 
              Goods Store.&nbsp; I kept noticing my boy, Austin, looking a little 
              nervous as we went through customs, me not fully understanding what 
              he was really going through inside.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He had spent 
              countless hours casting different size practice plugs in the front 
              yard, the alley, the school grounds and the ball park near the house 
              where we live in Clovis, New Mexico, some 1700 miles north of Guadalajara.&nbsp; 
              The kid had successfully gone through 600 yards of 20 pound Sigma 
              Mono in less than a week.&nbsp; Backlash after backlash was the 
              norm and man he was good at it, especially when he tried his "double 
              overhand power cast."&nbsp; Seems his thumb wasn't part of his anatomy 
              at first, but he practiced undauntedly and was very proud of the 
              fact that he could "take them backlashes apart like a pro."&nbsp; 
              Thats what he was so nervous about as we approached the rest of 
              our party. </font></p>

              etc.etc.&nbsp; I gave my old buddy Mark a hug and a handshake and 
              he said "Who's this?"&nbsp; I introduced my somewhat star-struck 
              son to them all and not once did he loosen his grip on that new 
              soft tackle box I had bought him just a week ago.&nbsp; </font></p>

            word, Austin set the 50 pound bag down and gave a sheepish little 
            grin towards his new friend and asked, "Dad, would it be ok if I go 
            get a Coke?"&nbsp; I said, "sure" and told him to meet us at the van

              the conversation from Guadalajara to Tepic was filled with our concern 
              about the future of Hunting and Fishing.&nbsp; The talk was about 
              the kids who fill their days and nights with rap music and video 
              games, and who seemingly never make it to the fields and streams 
              to experience a real adrenalin rush.&nbsp; I mentioned, "The future

              country seemed to melt away.&nbsp; All the while Austin was sitting 
              motionless soaking it all in and feeling comfortable being part 
              of it all.&nbsp; What a wonderful thing for him to listen to three 
              giants in the industry speak very candidly about how fragile this 
              industry really is and how important it is for us as parents to 
              get our children involved in hunting and fishing now, before its

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were greeted 
              by Mario with a smile and a big old hug like he always does, and 
              the staff began to unpack everything and move the gear to our rooms.&nbsp; 
              Since there were fe of us on this trip that meant one of us had 
              to bunk alone.&nbsp; I had always stayed in the big room with Bill 
              Chapman Sr., Mario, Pepe and Billito, Bill Sr.'s youngest son, so 
              I decided to stay there with them which meant that Austin would

              stars on the patio getting all our rigs ready for the morning, we 
              all noticed the proud look that all boys get when they are tying 
              their first lures on.&nbsp; Austin was almost lovingly holding his 
              new balanced <i> <b>Shakespeare</b></i> "INTREPID" bait casting 
              rod and reel when he noticed Mark Davis tying a knot that was different 
              than the one he had been practicing.&nbsp; So off they went talking 
              about the new knot and how tough it was.&nbsp; Austin turned and

              at 5:00 am with the smell of coffee and fruit tempting us to the 
              breakfast table.&nbsp; Austin was the last to get there.&nbsp; He 
              stood with his tackle box and his rods, eyes half open or half closed, 
              maybe both.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After fruit, 
              eggs, bacon and pancakes, we were greeted with a smile by Mario.&nbsp; 
              He mentioned that the guides had been waiting for half an hour on 
              us and it was time to get a move on, so off we went.&nbsp; Chester 
              Moore and Bruce Stanton paired off, Mark opted to fish alone the 
              first day, while Austin and I had a new guide named Arcadeo.&nbsp; 
              I always get the new guides because I worked as a guide in Mexico 
              for Bill Chapman Sr. many years and I help train them when I go 
              down to Milpa. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By noon we had 
              caught some nice bass but mostly I watched in dismay while my boy 
              threw his spinnerbait into every tree he could posibly throw into 
              except when he was feverishly working on giant backlashes.&nbsp; 
              I noticed the bottom of the boat was starting to resemble a pile 
              of small tumble weeds and my head still hurt from the first "double 
              handed power cast" that he made.&nbsp; Seems he didn't remember 
              me standing behind him.&nbsp; Thats ok 'cause the hooks went in 
              and came out so fast that I barely felt it, and the wet hat felt 
              good on my bruised head when I finally got it out of the lake. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At lunch we 
              listened to all the great fish stories.&nbsp; Some with catches 
              of over 150 bass up to 8 1/2 pounds and others with similar experiences.&nbsp; 
              When they asked me how the kid and I did, I just said, " Not bad 
              for our first day."&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second half 
              of the day was much the same, watching an embarrased kid, struggling 
              to make those casts just right and missing the mark every time.&nbsp; 
              After about two hours of backlashes and snags, I re-spooled his 
              reel and handed him his new <i><b>Shakespeare</b></i> "INTREPID" 
              spinning rod & reel, spooled with 20 pound Sigma line and a Texas 
              rigged lizard.&nbsp; I had the guide pull us near a point and got 
              Austin to throw a long cast parallel to the shore.&nbsp; We had 
              practiced worming on the lawn, so I just sat back and watched him 
              do his stuff.&nbsp; </font></p>

              till I saw the familiar twitch of his line and the rod came back 
              so fast it was just a blur.&nbsp; Man what a solid hookset.&nbsp; 
              If there was one thing Austin learned playing Nintendo, it was hand 
              speed.&nbsp; A natural born worm fisherman!&nbsp; That bass didn't 
              even have a chance to taste the salt on the 7" Gene Larew lizard.&nbsp; 
              One minute later with some coaching, the mad 4 pound Florida strain 
              largemouth was in my grip. </font></p>

              soared almost straight up and landed about 30 yards up into the 
              jungle of trees choking the shoreline. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next cast 
              hit the water with a kind of mini explosion about 5 feet from the 
              boat.&nbsp; A dejected look came over Austins' face and I felt a 
              mixture of emotions. Frustration, anger and empathy all rolled into 
              one: but it was just day one and we had two more to survive.&nbsp; 
              He laid his pole down, stared off into the distance and almost cried, 
              and my heart sank.&nbsp; I thought to myself, <b>surely</b> he will 
              get the hang of it, he's just <b>got</b> to.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I mumbled a 
              few things and he asked, "What did you say?" I came back with "Do 
              you want a Coke or some cold water?" He said, "Yeah, thanks." I 
              told the guide to move to another spot near the lodge so we wouldn't 
              have such a long ride back.&nbsp; We went to a big cove that I had 
              been fishing for a couple of years and I pointed to a protected 
              inlet where we could try some top water.&nbsp; After a couple of 
              bass on top, I handed Austin back his casting rod and told him to 
              pitch it near the back of the inlet we were in.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He stood up 
              and did one of his back hand casts and it flew off the reel just 
              like a pro and hit the water with barely a splash.&nbsp; He moved 
              the lizard about a foot when I saw the tap and WHAM, same deal as 
              earlier.&nbsp; The bass was hooked before he knew what he even had 
              in his mouth. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I noticed the 
              line slicing its way toward the top and said, "She's coming up," 
              and come up she did, about three feet into the air doing a nice 
              1 1/2 flip with a half roll.&nbsp; Austin said, "Man thats like 
              that stuff on TV, huh Dad?"&nbsp; A moment later the bass was in 
              the guide's net and we weighed her in at 4 pounds, 14 ounces, his 
              personal best.&nbsp; His attitude changed, I saw it in his face.&nbsp;

              felt good -I felt like I had a new fishing partner - but we would 
              have to wait for another day because Arcadeo said, "Vamonos por 
              la casa."&nbsp; So off we went into the warm sunset, the water looking 
              like it was on fire. I looked at the new guide and he shrugged and 
              gave me a little smile.&nbsp; I smiled back and handed him a Coke 
              and patted him on the shoulder and said, "Gracias, mi amigo," he 
              quickly said, "Por nada." </font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lodge looming 
              in the distance looked good and I felt like I was home again at 
              my little jewel in the south, Agua Milpa, but this time my boy was 
              with me and that felt very special.&nbsp; When we reached the dock, 
              there was my friend Mario.&nbsp; He helped us out of the boat and 
              drove us up the hill to the lodge.&nbsp; We could smell the steaks 
              cooking as soon as we got out of the van. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Austin said, 
              "Thanks for putting up with me today," and I said "I'm sorry I was 
              so hard on you, but we will do better tomorrow.&nbsp; Go take a 
              shower and I'll meet you in a little while, I want you to taste 
              the tea the girls make here, its really good, you'll see." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So off he went 
              with his head down and I knew what he was feeling, but I just needed 
              a little more patience and he needed a little more courage and endurance, 
              but it would come.&nbsp; It always does, given a little time. That 
              night at the dinner table the fishing stories were back to back, 
              one after another.&nbsp; Austin wasn't contributing but he was soaking 
              it all in.&nbsp; Chester Moore, the writer, asked, "Well how'd ya

              I'm a pro at it.&nbsp; But I caught a 4 pound, 14 ounce bass on 
              a lizard that jumped plum out of the water twice.&nbsp; Man, that 
              fish was strong, it had my new rod bent like this," showing us all 
              a big half moon gesture with his arm. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mark Davis told 
              us about 180 bass he caught with a crank bait, with the biggest 
              being 5 1/2 pounds and Bruce Stanton had a similar story.&nbsp; 
              They all turned to me and asked how the fishing was for Austin and 
              I, and I told them it was a tough day for me but that I would figure 
              it all out tomorrow.&nbsp; I explained that we still caught over 
              100 bass, but we did a lot of running and looking for different 
              places.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It sounded pretty 
              good, but they all knew that we were in training and they could 
              see the uneasiness on Austins' face, but like all good fishermen, 
              they had been there before and remembered how it was to be a kid 
              hanging with the big boys for the first time.&nbsp; Everyone gave 
              him a word of encouragment and then started to turn in for the night. 
              &nbsp;Mark said, "Lets hit the sack Austin, five o'clock is going 
              to come early," so off they went.&nbsp; When they got to the room 
              Austin turned around and kinda waved to me and said, "See ya in 
              the morning Dad."&nbsp; I waved back and told him to sleep tight 
              and think about what had happened today. </font></p>

              a sound that I had become familiar with and enjoyed.&nbsp; He was 
              like the dad that passed away 15 years ago.&nbsp; I thought of him 
              that night and the many, many days and nights of fishing we had 
              spent together in South Texas, near Port Arthur, where Chester our 
              writer was from.&nbsp; Those were the good old days, Dad and me,

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My sleep was 
              stirred by the voice of Pepe saying, "Bill, get up.&nbsp; Its 5 
              oclock.&nbsp; Time to get up, Bill."&nbsp; The shower took the sleep 
              from my eyes and as I shaved and brushed my teeth, I kept wondering 
              what the day would bring for me and the boy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I had had a 
              couple of cups of coffee and Austin was nowhere in sight so I walked 
              to his room and there he was all curled up in a ball sleeping his 
              heart out.&nbsp; I said, "Austin, get up buddy, its time to go hammer 
              em," and he rolled over and said in a half hearted tone, "Dad could 
              I just stay here and go fishing at noon with you?"&nbsp; I knew 
              he felt a little embarrassed and defeated, so I just nudged him 
              and told him that the other guys were waiting for him cause he was 
              part of the group, and out he rolled muttering that he would "do 
              better today." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We were the 
              last to leave that second day, but that was OK with me cause I had 
              changed overnight and I now possessed some super-natural patience 
              I had received sometime in the night..Hah!&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the time 
              I had untangled Austin's line from the fourth <img src="../pic/am_bill_nice.jpg" width="312" height="492" align="LEFT" alt="Wild Bill and his bass">tree, 
              I was about to come unwound and he knew it, so he just quit for 
              a while and watched me catch about 30 bass or so on a watermelon 
              worm rigged with a 1/2 bullet weight.&nbsp; He was watching me side 
              arm casts within 6 inches of the target every time and power casting 
              30 yards to the base of rocks and stumps.&nbsp; I would say, "Watch 
              this! Do you see that stump over there?&nbsp; I will hit it just 
              on the right side and I bet you I get a bass right there."&nbsp; 
              Sure enough almost every cast would produce a bass and he would 
              just look at me. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally he said, 
              "How do you expect me to cast like that, you've been doing that 
              for years!"&nbsp; I'd come back with something like, "Its hard to 
              catch fish when your line's not in the water, as a matter of fact, 
              I would almost bet that you can't catch a bass unless you get your 
              line in the water!" </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally he said, 
              "I don't like worming that much."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
              I looked at the guide and said, "Lets go eat".&nbsp; So, off we 
              went for the campo. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rest of 
              the guys were really excited about catching a ton of bass that morning, 
              and I could see that Austin was drifting away into a kind of depression 
              of some kind.&nbsp; He wasn't listening to the stories and he wasn't 
              making any eye contact and the guys knew it.&nbsp; I just looked 
              at them and shrugged while I watched them load up and disappear 
              into the vastness of the lake.&nbsp; Agua Milpa is a really huge 
              lake, you can go 70 miles down the Santiago river and 40 miles down 
              the other one, or you can go North just from the lodge and go about 
              20 miles back into some places that no one ever fishes.</font></p>
            <p align="CENTER"><b><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">NEW 
              FRONTIERS</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So I told Austin, 
              "Hey lets go explore some new places to fish."&nbsp; That caught 
              his interest and we headed out to parts unknown to me or the guide.&nbsp; 
              After about 20 minutes I noticed a cove on the right and I had Arcadeo 
              slow down and pull into the back of it as far as we could go.&nbsp; 
              The structure was different in that the trees were less numerous 
              and it wasn't nearly as steep dropping off the bank. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My first cast 
              with my <i><b>BASSMEX</b></i> spinner bait produced a 4 1/2 pounder 
              and my second cast landed a 5 pounder.&nbsp; Man, Austin grabbed 
              his bait casting rig and tied on one of my chartreuse 1/2 oz spinner 
              baits, using the new knot that he learned from Mark Davis.&nbsp; 
              I watched admiringly as he tied a perfect "Improved Cinch" knot, 
              about as fast and good as it can be done.&nbsp; He pulled out his 
              new <i><b>Stren</b></i> pliers and cut the tag end off just like 
              a pro.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He fired his 
              first cast up on the bank about 6 feet and dragged it down into 
              the water and gave me a sheepish grin and said, "Well you said throw 
              it on the bank, and thats exactly what I did!"&nbsp; About that 
              time he started struggling with his rod and I thought for sure that 
              he was hung up again, but his eyes told a different story, and so 
              did that <i><b>Shakespeare</b></i> rod. </font></p>
            <p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>&quot;How 
              do I keep them out of the brush?&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The guide said, 
              "Muy grande, Muy grande, net, net!"&nbsp; About the time I grabbed 
              the net I noticed that the line wasn't moving anymore.&nbsp; The 
              bass had sounded and had found his tree and that was that, but I 
              wouldn't have traded that moment for a million dollars.&nbsp; Austin 
              was visibly shaken, and he just couldn't believe that his big bass 
              was gone and so was his lure, but we had found a pattern and it 
              was working.&nbsp; "I kinda like this spinner bait fishing," Austin 
              exclaimed, "but how do I keep them out of the brush?" </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I told him to 
              tighten his drag and try to bring them to the top with everything 
              he had.&nbsp; "You can't break the rod bringing em' in, so give 
              it all ya got," I yelled, somehow thinking he knew how to crank 
              them in, but knowing he would learn.&nbsp; We spent the rest of 
              the afternoon throwing the blades and caught a respectable number 
              of quality bass in all the little coves, but mostly running and 
              searching. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While we were 
              doing that I kept looking at some bald points in the distance. There 
              was one here, one there, some on down the lake.&nbsp; They were 
              mostly points that had a sheer wall on one side and a less steep 
              drop than most of the points I'd seen at Milpa.&nbsp; There was 
              very little cover, just an occasional bush or two, then accompanied 
              with a bank past the point for about a quarter mile or so, and then 
              another point almost identical, and on and on as far as the eye 
              could see.&nbsp; But it was getting late and I thought we could 
              get in a little top water, so back we went towards the lodge to 
              try some flats I'd seen on the way there earlier. </font></p>
            <p align="CENTER"><b><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">BLOWUP!</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We caught some 
              bass on top just as I had thought. We pulled up next to the bank 
              so the casts wouldn't be so far away, thinking Austin would have 
              a chance at his first top water bass.&nbsp; On his very first cast 
              with one of my <i><b>BASSMEX</b></i> top water plugs, he had a blowup.&nbsp; 
              The bass came completely out of the water, came crashing down on 
              the plug and swam away with it.&nbsp; Austin froze.&nbsp; The plug 
              bobbed to the surface and another bass hit it and ran the opposite 
              direction and the boy just stood his ground.&nbsp; Up came the plug 
              again and the guide was laughing out loud for the first time and 
              I said, " Man Austin, what are ya waitin' for?" </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Austin looked 
              me square in the face and said, "I don't know what to do; what do 
              I do?"&nbsp; I told him to just reel down on him, set the hooks 
              hard and try to break his jaw and reel him in as hard as he could 
              so the bass would stay on top. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He said, "Ok!" 
              and fired his next cast into the middle of the lake.&nbsp; I just 
              stared in disbelief and ask him what he was doing and he said he 
              didn't want to get caught on a tree or something.&nbsp; Well that 
              was at least honest of him and a humble thing to do, but I explained 
              that the bass would be hanging in and around the brush. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once again he 
              said "OK" and fired another one out in the deep water.&nbsp; I just 
              watched while he practiced his popping.&nbsp; He did that for a 
              solid half hour and got pretty good at it.&nbsp; I coached him till 
              dark.&nbsp; We practiced the top water bite away, but I enjoyed 
              watching him learn and he wasn't getting near the number of backlashes 
              that I was accustomed to, so things were looking up. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The guide said, 
              "Vamonos", and off we tore into the evening air, as fast as the

              see the guys and listen to the stories again of unbelievable catches 
              and action beyond one's imagination.&nbsp; I believe em' all because 
              I'd fished Milpa 10 times this year alone and I always caught 150

              a bass every cast, I mean every cast, except when we would get hung 
              up."&nbsp; He explained that they were using 50 pound braid tied

              "I did a lot better today and I lost a really big one in the bushes, 
              and I learned how to pop Dad's topwater bait too and we found a

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I walked into 
              the dining hall and there was my son, all bright eyed and bushy 
              tailed and ready to go.&nbsp; We had a quick breakfast and the guys 
              all told Austin, "Have a good day."&nbsp; Somehow we all felt something

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we got 
              to our boat, Arcadeo was standing there smiling in a different way. 
              I don't know if he was happy because it was payday for him, or because 
              he knew he had only one more day to put up with the chaos, the backlashes, 
              the snags and the "teaching".&nbsp; He reached out and helped us 
              aboard into a spotless boat, it looked like he had just pulled it 
              through a car wash.&nbsp; He then shook my hand and then Austin's 
              hand, and said, "Hoy, muy bueno," meaning that today was going to 
              be good. I think mainly because he knew that it was my turn to guide 
              and that I knew something about the bass and the pattern they were 
              on. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The wind was 
              up and we churned our way across the lake at 3/4 speed.&nbsp; I 
              noticed that his course was a little different, so I pointed to 
              the North and said "Norte."&nbsp; I could tell that it wasn't to 
              his liking, but I stood firm and North we went.&nbsp; I was still 
              thinking about the points I had seen in the distance the day before, 
              but the wind was in the wrong direction, so we ducked into a cove 
              on the east side, a mile short of the points.&nbsp; I had him pull 
              us up on a flat that looked like a dream topwater spot and asked 
              Austin if he was ready to try out his popping skills. </font></p>

              "Yeah, I practiced pretty hard yesterday and I'm ready, so the bass 
              better look out for me today cause I'm ready!" <br>
              "Wow!", I thought to myself, "The kid has picked up some fishin' 
              language from down inside."&nbsp; I guess he had been listening 
              all along at the tables we sat at to eat and talk.&nbsp; He had 
              a confidence that only comes when you feel ready to rumble.&nbsp; 
              He had stopped thinking about casting, and was just casting and 
              pitching without many backlashes and hang-ups this morning.&nbsp; 
              The topwater bite was a little slow but we did manage to catch 15 
              good bass in that first hour and then opted to try a Texas rigged 
              worm along a promising bank.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Austins' first 
              cast went high into the air and 20 feet up into a tree right into 
              an old discarded net that had been used when the water was higher.&nbsp; 
              Arcadeo pulled to the bank, took his machette, cut a big branch 
              off a downed tree and formed a hook on the end.&nbsp; He stood on 
              the bow of the boat and ripped at the old rotted net until the line 
              was free.&nbsp; Arcadeo was so proud of his ingenuity and Austin 
              learned that anything can be done if you use your head.&nbsp; After 
              losing about 20 minutes with that snag, Austin set his rod down 
              and said, "I don't want to fish anymore." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At that, I came 
              unglued and said, "You will fish or I will <img src="../pic/austin_landing_fish.jpg" width="156" height="221" align="LEFT" alt="Austin lands a beauty">put 
              you on the bank and come back for you at dark, its your call!"&nbsp; 
              Well he thought for a moment, picked up his rod and did a little 
              flip toward an old stump and before the watermelon lizard hit the 
              bottom, "Whop!" my boy was tied onto a really nice bass.&nbsp; He 
              laid into her with all he had and up she came right next to the 
              boat, spraying water all over us, and in a short while there she 
              lay in the net, all 5 pounds and 15 ounces - a new personal best 
              for the green kid from New Mexico. </font></p>

              square in the eye and said, "This wormin' isn't all that bad, I 
              kinda like it now!"&nbsp; I just grinned at him and told him to 
              get his line back in the water and get another one.&nbsp; We fished 
              almost tangle free till 11:30 and caught 123 bass ranging from 2 
              1/2 pounds to 6 pounds 14 ounces, all on lizards. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During lunch, 
              the conversation around the table was more of the same tall tale 
              type stories that can only be true at this great fishery.&nbsp; 
              Mark Davis and Chester Moore had caught around 200 bass that morning 
              with the biggest being 6 pounds 14 ounces, all caught on Carolina 
              rigs using 10" worms.&nbsp; Austin joined right in with his stories 
              that we could all relate to, having been being kids ourselves "once 
              upon a time."&nbsp; The wind really kicked up and that bothered 
              some of the guys, but I knew exactly what I was going to do. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We were to go 
              back to the little coves in the calm waters and worm our way out 
              of them till 3 pm, and thats exactly what we did.&nbsp; We only 
              caught 20 bass that first hour in the afternoon, but they all were 
              from 4 to 5 1/2 pounds each, and Austin had turned his Mag from 
              1 to 4 on his <i><b>SHAKESPEARE</b></i> reel and he was backlash 
              free.&nbsp; It took him two and a half days to figure his equipment 
              out, but he had done it on his own and that "lesson" burned into 
              his memory. </font></p>
            <p align="CENTER"><b><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">TO 
              THE POINTS!</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At exactly 3 
              pm, I looked at the guide and told him to pull out of the cove and 
              head for the points.&nbsp; He couldn't believe his ears, and wasn't 
              too thrilled about the idea because the lake had three foot waves 
              and was blowing directly into the points at full force.&nbsp; On 
              the way to the points I tied on a 1/2 ounce Bill Dance Fat Free 
              Shad in a silver-blue back, orange belly pattern and tossed Austin 
              a 3/4 ounce Fat Free Shad in a solid pearl color.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we approached 
              the point, I noticed that the water was like ribbons of clear blue 
              and caramel colored candy.&nbsp; I thought to myself, "Man this 
              is perfect, not only is there a current passing this point, but 
              the bass can hide in the muddy water to ambush the first shad that 
              swam by."&nbsp; As Austin was tying his lure on, I caught four really 
              nice bass in the four pound range. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He stood up 
              and threw a bullet right at waters edge, cranked the lure down and 
              "Wham!&quot; the fight was on.&nbsp; That scene was repeated for 
              2 1/2 hours and netted us 81 bass, most from 3 to 5 pounds.&nbsp; 
              Not once did I see a backlash, not once did I have to stop to get 
              his plug off the bank.&nbsp; <img src="../pic/austin_landing.jpg" width="312" height="404" align="RIGHT" alt="Smiles at last!">I 
              was fishing with a fisherman who could flat line a cast anywhere 
              he wanted it without thinking.&nbsp; His thumb had its own brain 
              now and his eyes were fixed on the target.&nbsp; He was hand lipping 
              every bass he caught, and releasing them as well. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It felt good 
              to just fish with my new friend without watching him struggle and 
              feel intimidated by it all.&nbsp; Just as I was revelling in my 
              newfound contentment, I heard Austin say, "Hey dad, lets go to that 
              point accross the way, it looks really good." </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Good idea," 
              I muttered, feeling a bit relieved from my duty as boss, guide, 
              teacher and dad.&nbsp; It was his turn to be the guide, and his 
              hunch proved to be the very best bassin' I've ever experienced in 
              my life.&nbsp; We caught a bass on nearly every cast and they were 
              <b>all "Hawgs"</b> from four to seven pounds. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On one occasion, 
              Austin threw a side arm bullet cast right against the wall and cranked 
              the handle once.&nbsp; I noticed the line cutting the water like 
              a bonefish run towards deep water just below the surface.&nbsp; 
              I turned to my boy, and told him to set the hook, but before he 
              could, the water exploded and out came a huge bass of ten pounds 
              or more throwing the plug a good thirty feet into the dark warm 
              air. </font></p>
