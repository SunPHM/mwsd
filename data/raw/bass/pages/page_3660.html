Today is a report from a big fan of the MOR and I am more than delighted make the addition, eventhough I was atleast a thousand
miles from the fishing grounds. <br> Russ Whitman has been a regular visitor of this website (I think there are about 4 
of you guys) since my brother Matt inspired me to create it two years ago this month. Below are the pictures of White Perch and 
Stripped Bass as well as Russ' email message that included the pics and the details about the fish. If I'm not mistaken, Tom's River and Barnegat Sound, are 
spots near New Jersey. Russ, you can correct me if I'm wrong on that. And I like that t-shirt.

hey Tom,
<br> 
Just a little fishing update. Hope you're doing well. I've attached a .jpg file or two of white perch. They've been the staple of
early spring fishing on the Toms River. Easy dinner, excellent eating. The big guy is shy of 14" which in these parts is a rather
large fishy. Most white perch range 8-10", 12" is big. Anyway, they're up here breeding and such. The big guys will disappear
leaving us a fall fishery of smaller but feistier fish. Right now the weakfish fishery, (sea trout family) is busting open. Big tide
runners in the spring. No electronic pictures yet but all fish in the 26" and up range. Last night at sunset or so I brought a 30",
71/2 lb. weakie on board. That's a pretty nice specimen and my biggest so far this year. I've decided to cut him up and fry him
for the good folks here at Urner Barry for a snack tomorrow. Lots of bluefish are mixed in. We're going to try Striped Bass off
the beach tonight but it's just the slightest bit early for catching them big time in the surf. Offshore you're doing fine. What the
hell. I'll attach the file of my first Striper of 2000. We'll see what 2001 brings. May try the reef 3-5 miles off Barnegat Inlet for
Sea Bass this weekend. Hope all is well!
<br>Keep fishin'

Thanks to Russ for giving the MOR an entry for May. It has been too windy for six straight weeks off Miami. Maybe it'll lay down
 this weekend.
