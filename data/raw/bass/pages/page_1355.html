Variations on these themes can be ordered to suit yourself. Scale lengths, fingerboard widths, neck dimensions, decorations and timber types can be infinitely varied.<P ALIGN="justify"><B>"TORRES" MODEL</B><P ALIGN="justify">This is a small bodied guitar, measuring 356mm across the bottom bout, closely modelled on the work of Torres. Antonio de Torres (1817-1892) is widely acknowledged as having established the essential constructional features of the modern classic guitar. <BR><BR> <IMG align=right alt="Guitar Machine Head" border=0 height=330 hspace=10 src="Images/Guitar-Head2.jpg" width=187><DIV ALIGN="justify">The pattern and layout of this model are based on a Torres guitar and were given to me by José Romanillos the guitar maker and author of the book "Antonio de Torres Guitar Maker - His Life &amp; Work." I have studied the work of José Romanillos having carried out maintenance and repair work on quite a few of his instruments (including Breams famous 1973 guitar). We have been friends for many years and I would like to think my instruments carry some of the spirit of his work.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV ALIGN="justify">The scale length I use for this model is 650mm though I have used shorter lengths to great success. The fingerboard width is 51mm at the nut and 61mm at the twelfth fret. String spacing at the bridge is 60mm.</DIV><BR><BR><DIV ALIGN="justify">The front is European Spruce, the neck Brazilian Cedar and the Fingerboard Ebony. The Head Facing and Bridge are usually Indian or Brazilian Rosewood. I have used a variety of timbers for the back and sides some of the choices on offer are: Indian Rosewood, Brazilian Rosewood Figured (Rippled) Maple or Sycamore, Birds Eye Maple, Quilted Big Leaf Maple, Siricote, Plane (Lacewood), Walnut and Yew. I often make the backs in three or four pieces sometimes using a combination of timbers. Indian Rosewood with a centre panel of Birds Eye Maple matched to Birds Eye Maple body bindings is a popular choice. Many fruit woods can be used for this back centre panel and body bindings, Apple, Cherry, Plum and Pear could all be used.</DIV><BR><BR> <IMG align=left alt="Rosette Magnifed" border=0 height=249 hspace=10 src="Images/Rosette-Magnify.jpg" width=300><DIV ALIGN="justify">I make each rosette individually and, whilst they all follow the same basic idea, I seldom produce two that are identical. The woods used for the rosette are matched to the purflings and bindings.</DIV><P ALIGN="justify">The big sound of these guitars belies their smaller size and is very focused. They have tremendous projection.<P ALIGN="justify"><B>"ARAM" MODEL</B><P ALIGN="justify">This model has been developed in response to the need for a larger bodied guitar though, at 365mm across the bottom bout, it is not large by today's standards.<P ALIGN="justify"><IMG align=right alt=Rosette border=0 height=276 hspace=10 src="Images/Rosette.gif" width=300>The jumping off point for the development of this guitar was a 1943 Herman Hauser measured by my pal Jeff Elliot of Portland, Oregon. Herman Hauser (1884-1952) was a German maker who, being influenced by the guitars of Torres and Manuel Ramirez, produced some of the finest classic guitars of this century.<P ALIGN="justify">For this guitar I usually use a European Spruce top but I have used Western Red Cedar Yugoslavian Fir, Yellow Cedar and Engelmann Spruce.<P ALIGN="justify">The most popular choice for the back and sides is Indian Rosewood though I often use other timbers, alone and in combination, as with the Torres model. The neck is Brazilian Cedar and features a 'V' joint at the head. <IMG align=left alt="V Joint" border=0 height=225 hspace=10 src="Images/Guitar-V-Joint.jpg" vspace=5 width=267>The fingerboard is Ebony and, whilst the standard scale length is 650mm I have successfully used longer lengths. Fingerboard width at the nut is 52mm and at the twelfth fret 62mm. The string spacing at the bridge is 60mm. Each rosette is again individually made and the woods used complement the purflings and bindings.<P ALIGN="justify">The sound of this guitar is very open with excellent string balance. It projects very well but also sounds very clearly to the player making it an excellent instrument for both the professional concert performer and the serious student. <BR><BR><IMG align=right alt="Guitar - Blue" border=0 height=389 hspace=10 src="Images/Guitar-Blue.jpg" vspace=2 width=150><DIV ALIGN="justify">Both models are oil finished as standard. I prefer to use David Rodgers machine heads and you will see photographs of them throughout this Website. If you would like more information on these machine needs <A HREF="http://homepages.webleicester.co.uk/rodgers/">please click here.</A></DIV><P ALIGN="justify"><IMG align=left alt=Guitar border=0 height=535 hspace=10 src="Images/Guitar.jpg" vspace=5 width=200>In addition to the above two models I make Flamenco guitars, Requintos, 7, 8 or 9 string guitars and 6 string bass guitars.<P ALIGN="justify">My method of construction is to prepare three guitars at once but to only assemble one at a time, enabling me to focus entirely on that instrument. The total construction time including polishing is spread over a 2&#189; to 3 month period.<P ALIGN="justify">I keep a large stock of timber and most of what I am using now was purchased ten or more years ago. The use of certain techniques to "test" the guitar during the building process ensures that my guitars, whilst light in construction, are extremely reliable. At the time of writing, I cannot remember the last time a guitar was returned for a crack or structural repair. It was certainly over seven years ago. I am very proud of my work and I feel there are very few things left in this world that are made in the way I make my guitars.</FONT><P><BR><BR><BR><BR><DIV ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1"><A href="Biography.htm">Biography</A> - <A href="Brief-History.htm">Brief History</A> - <A href="Wood-Facts.htm">Wood Facts</A> - <A href="Location-Contact-Us.htm">Location/Contact Us</A> - <A href="Prices.htm">Prices</A> - <A href="Timber-Supplies.htm">Timber Supplies</A> - <A href="Main.htm">Home</A></FONT></DIV></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><BR></TD></TR></TABLE></P></BODY></HTML>
