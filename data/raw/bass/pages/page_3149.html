The greatest liability of Calero Reservoir, the relatively high level of mercury found in its water and fish, is also the lake's greatest strength as a fishery. The County of Santa Clara, in signs around the reservoir and in the brochures for the lake, advises anglers, "Catch and Release... Please Don't Eat the Fish."
<P>
Although some foolish people choose to keep the fish, the vast majority of anglers catch and release their bass, catfish, crappie and other species at this small impoundment in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Jose. This has created a great trophy fishery for catch-and-release enthusiasts looking for some fast action within a short drive from downtown San Jose.

<P>
Though anglers are advised not to eat the largemouth bass and other fish, the fish themselves are fat, healthy and hard-fighting. The presence of the lake's mercury is the result of the region's fascinating history. The nearby Almaden Valley was once the site of quicksilver (mercury) mining. Sediments containing mercury have been deposited in Calero and other local reservoirs. The mercury in the sediment has been converted over the decades to methyl mercury by naturally occurring bacteria. Methyl mercury is absorbed by aquatic plants and fish - and by humans who choose to eat the fish.
<P>
The reservoir is open year round to both power and non-power vessels. Since the lake is heavily used by water skiers and jet skiers on the weekends, fishing this lake during the week is highly advisable. The 333 acre reservoir is located in a 2,421 acre park that features 12 miles of trails for hikers and equestrians.
<P>
Although Coyote Reservoir has become famous for big Florida-strain largemouths over 10 pounds, Calero is known for its consistency. Black bass are the main fish pursued by anglers fishing Calero, though hefty black crappie channel catfish, and bluegill will also reward anglers targeting them.
<P>
One angler who loves to fish Calero is Kirk Hill, a fishing guide and Coyote Bait and Tackle's pro staffer, whom I teamed up with to fish Calero on Friday, March 1. "My dad and I did pretty well yesterday fishing for bass for two hours in the late afternoon," he said. "We caught a total of 9 bass to 3 pounds while fishing Senkos."
<P>
The wind was howling when he launched his Stratos bass boat on the reservoir at 11 a.m. He rigged us both up with pumpkinseed Yamamoto Senkos on 1/4 ounce Zipper in line football jig heads. We started in a cove protected from the wind, but didn't have much action there, though Hill did briefly hook up a bass. "I was hoping that the bass would move into that flat with this warmer weather, but they haven't yet," he stated.
<P><IMG SRC="images/031402ccalero.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="222" ALT="Calero Reservoir Bass" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5">
He then motored the boat over to a series of rocky points, casting the lure against the rocks and some downed trees, from 1 foot to about 15 feet of water.  Hill was the first to hook up. "It's a good one," he said as the fish bent his rod. Sure enough, when he boated it, it turned out to be a whopping 6-1/2 pounds, a fat, gorgeous largemouth. 
<P>
Hill hooked another fish that came unbuttoned. Then it was my turn to catch a fish as I dragged the worm behind the boat. I hooked and boated a 2-1/2 pound beauty, followed by the second largest fish of the day, a chunky 3 pound largemouth. 
<P>
Over the next hour, we caught and released one bass after another.  Off one downed tree, Hill noted before tossing out his Senko, "I lost a big fish there yesterday that straightened out my hook. Let's see if I can land it today." Sure enough the fish bit twice at the same exact spot as yesterday, straightening the hook both times!   
<P>
Throughout the spring-like afternoon, we hooked around 20 fish, landing 13 fish total. We also both broke off two large fish, even though we were using 8 and 12 pound P-line, one of the toughest, most abrasion resistant lines there is.
<P>
Bank anglers can also experience some surprisingly good bass action at Calero in the spring. For example, Chris Van Cleff of Mountain View caught and released a two pound bass off the point near the boat ramp just after we put the boat up on the trailer. "I caught and released 3 other fish up to 3 pounds while using a straight tail worm," he stated.
<P><IMG SRC="images/031402dcalero.jpg" WIDTH="181" HEIGHT="275" ALT="Calero Reservoir Bass" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5">
Although we found a great bass bite, Hill said he expected to see better action as the lake fills the trees, brush and rock ledges in the lake's inlets. Spring is the best time to fish Calero for bass, when a variety of worms, grubs, Senkos, rip baits, spinnerbaits and crankbaits will all produce fish. 
<P> 
"You see that rockwall," Hill said. "I took an 11.1 pound largemouth on a Berkeley Power Worm in purple with blue flake there in 1996. On the same day, I caught a 6.3 pound largemouth off the same wall."
<P>
However, good fishing can also be found here in the summer and fall, particularly if you fish early and late on a weekday. "You can find an awesome top water bait and buzzbait bite in the summer during the early morning and afternoon hours," he stated. "The best top water lures here are Ricos, Pop-R's and Zara Spooks."
<P>
In the fall, he prefers to use Yamamoto grub "critter" baits, Carolina-rigged. Rip baits like Lucky Craft Pointer minnows and swim baits like MS Slammers are also hot lures.
<P>
Winter is his least favorite time to fish Calero, but he noted that drop shotting with 3/4 to 1 ounce football heads with twintail grubs can be very effective. Another great winter tactic is vertical jigging Senkos, Wacky-style, in the deep water.
<P>
Regardless what time of year you fish, Calero is a great place to fish and get away from the traffic and pressures of the Silicon Valley. The lake is particularly pretty now, since the hills are an emerald green and wildflowers are popping up everywhere. The lake features a boat ramp and two picnic sites, including picnic tables and barbecues.
