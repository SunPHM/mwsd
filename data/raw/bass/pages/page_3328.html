<h1 align="center">Fish and shellfish</h1>

<p>The rich and productive waters off the coast of South-WestWales support thriving
populations of ecologically and economically important shellfish and fish.</p>

<p>Rocky shores are colonized by the edible periwinkle <i>Littorina littorea</i> and the
edible blue mussel <i>Mytilus edulis</i>. Subtidal kelp forests on rocky coasts support
large populations of the edible crab <i>Cancer pagurus</i> and the lobster <i>Homarus
vulgaris</i>. The crawfish <i>Palinurus vulgaris</i> is also harvested.</p>

<p>Beds of cockles and oysters support significant fisheries within Milford Haven and the
large estuaries of Carmarthen Bay. Whelks are also harvested in Carmarthen Bay.</p>

<p>A seasonal fishery for herring exists within Milford Haven. There are also substantial offshore fisheries for rays, flatfish and sea bass.</p>

<p>Migratory sea fish such as salmon and sea trout pass through the area on their way to
the rivers of Carmarthen Bay.</p>

<p>The <b>Sea Empress</b> oil spill presented very considerable difficulties for the
fishing industry within the region. The Government imposed a blanket ban on all forms of
fishing across the region during the early days of the incident. An intensive sampling
programme was undertaken to test commercially harvested species for evidence of oil
contamination. Fortunately, offshore species and the important shellfish beds to the east
of the region were declared safe and the bans affecting those groups of fish were lifted
quite early on. Bans remained in place for certain shore species for longer periods
of
time.</p>
