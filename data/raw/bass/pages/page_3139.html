      <p>With the rise in popularity for bass fishing experienced in Eastern
      Ontario, smallmouth were rounded up in Lake Erie and loaded onto trains
      and transferred to North Western Ontario. Smallmouth was the fish of
      choice during the late 1800’s. The fish was loved so greatly that
      special “no commercial fishing for smallmouth” laws were put into
      place. This alone made it a good choice to transfer into the north where
      commercial fishing was much impacting the fish stocks for generations to
      come. This species would be safe from being targeted by the gill net.
      About four hundred adult fish first made it to Kenora around 1903 and were
      released into Longbow Lake. Soon they made their way into Lake of the
      Woods when the dam broke and were consequently swept downstream into the
      big lake. Once they were established in the big lake, more adult transfers
      were rapidly done from both the government and by private individuals.
      Smallmouth did quite well in their new environment. The experiment had
      paid off.</p>
      <p>Rainy lake was first stocked with smallmouth in the 1920’s. The first
      stocking was done on the United States side of the border waters. Quickly
      after, stocking along the Canadian National rail line was occurring on
      bodies of water that the railway ran next to. From Kenora and Fort Frances
      on the west, to Thunder bay on the east, the fish were planted from the
      tracks and trestles. Some planted lakes took off, and others did not
      succeed so well. Smallmouth only, was stocked on the Canadian side as
      opposed to both largemouth and smallmouth stocked on the southern US side
      of the lake. The Large mouth never really took in Rainy, although they
      exist in a few of the shallow oriented bays on the south side of the
      border lake today. Recently, one was weighed in at a tournament that
      fished in U.S. waters only. The Canadian local biologist Darrel McLeod has
      seen only one largemouth in Rainy Lake during his whole career of managing
      the Canadian side fishery.
      <p>Strangely, other than the extreme south portion of Rainy Lake, the
      largemouth stocks remain mostly a mystery. The main band of planting
      occurs in an arc running from the north end of Rainy Lake and arching west
      and north towards Sioux Narrows. Rowan lake would be smack in the middle
      of it. There are some great new largemouth lakes in this area all created
      by our outfitters and a few individuals. Strong speculation has the fish
      coming from down south where the (big fish) live. A rich dude from
      California I know swears the new record largemouth for Ontario will soon
      come from a lake he knows very personally. Wink, wink. Makes me wonder
      where his stock came from and how? Another story has a few fish that
      apparently made their way up here from Florida and prospered well. These
      planted fish have now made it a reality for massive planting, as the
      stocked lakes are readily available and abundant with nice healthy
      largemouth.
      <p>The gene stocks from the smallmouth are mainly direct descendants from
      the Lake Erie fish; in fact the genetics should be almost exact, just 100
      years later vs. the largemouth, which is not documented at all because
      private individuals did the stocking.
      <p>Largemouth appears to be the next species the tourist industry is
      expanding. Even with tighter home ranges than smallmouth the fish appear
      to be marching along. The best largemouth lakes I have found usually
      happen where the pike (and usually small pike) had previously
      proliferated. These lakes can be good largemouth lakes if they have been
      planted. Good three to five pound averages are possible in a few quiet
      locations. Some fish are now topping the biggest smallmouth I have seen
      ever. Largemouth like the wood up here too. Find a lake with lots of wood
      and it probably will have human transferred largemouth swimming in it. The
      largemouth boom is now upon us.
      <p>What was at first baffling during the expansion of the smallmouth was
      the speed at which the smallmouth were (and are) showing up in new water.
      Right across North Western Ontario the spread continues. Soon the entire
      system will be impacted by the spread of the fish. It appears that most of
      the new smallmouth water is where lakes with outpost camps exist. First
      come the main lakes with lodges located on them and then the small lakes
      adjacent are further transferred. Smallmouth can be loaded into
      floatplanes for the quick jump to the new (frontier) water. Some
      outfitters constructed elaborate oxygenated barrel tank set-ups to move
      the fish. It really was no secret if you knew the right person to ask.
      <p>It would seem Quetico Park would be a great comparison, one might
      think. No lodges or camps of the sort and it is known as “canoe
      country”. Not so!
      <p>The border waters south along the park were stocked in the early
      twenties by MINN. And north of the park along the C.N. railway by ONT.
      They were on the fringe since then.
      <p>What appeared to be a swift marching exotic species (smallmouth)
      through the park was in reality human transfers. By canoe? No way. Quetico
      is really not as remote as it is made out to be. Aircraft can and do reach
      deep into the park in minutes from their home bases. Boats and motors are
      allowed by the aboriginals and they can guide clients and fish from the
      watercraft. Outfitters have the right to fly in the guests, aboriginals,
      gas, and their gear. Planes are a common occurrence these days in the Park
      along with the boats and motors.
      <p>What really happened was a massive stocking campaign by the tourist
      outfitters that stocked the park from floatplanes. The rate at which the
      smallmouth spread across the map every year was mind boggling to those
      that were keeping track of the situation. It was blatant illegal stocking.
      The smallmouth moved with lightning speed and sadly now they are virtually
      everywhere you go in Quetico. Wow! They spread quicker in an environment
      where we tried to keep it as untouched by man as possible. Don’t get me
      wrong, I like smallmouth but not in every lake there is around here. The
      density of lakes with smallmouth in the park is the greatest of all
      N.W.Ont. Smallmouth now rule Quetico Park.
      <p>Largemouth has been hardly noticed in the confines of Quetico. That may
      change soon as the speed of the largemouth spread is gaining momentum.
      Remember those southern stocks are ripe for massive transfers.
      <p>When I hit a new lake that has the first fishable smallmouth it can be
      a wicked experience. If your timing is right, there seems to be a nice
      window where the planted fish get really big or maybe its the first good
      generation of successful spawners that get so big. I have no real way of
      knowing when the fish arrived and how many. I just know there are giant
      fish caught in the beginning. Maybe the food competition is at the extreme
      advantage for only a few smallmouth using the locations preferred. One
      thing is certain, if there is a good food source about, smallmouth will
      find it. True monster fish are there during the initial phases of
      populating a lake.
      <p>I follow the sightings regularly and have kept track of when and where.
      Usually it starts like this: “ The wife and I were trolling that boulder
      shore over there” pointing to the shore opposite from his cabin. “It
      was a five pounder”, biggest bass he ever caught and the first in this
      lake. That is until two years later when two large smallmouth were nesting
      close to his dock. This time he took a photo and a measurement due to my
      requests before he filleted it and showed me a 22-inch fish. He landed
      some giants over the next few years. With three more years added to the
      situation small fry would be abundant in the shallows and hanging around
      his dock, “just like in Rainy Lake” he say, “little 5 inch bass
      attacking any bait fish that moved near his dock”. When the massive wave
      of fry reached its teenage years there were small “grunt” fish
      everywhere along the shorelines. Walleye stocks usually took a dive in
      these situations as the smallmouth bloom happened. It can take Mother
      Nature many years to rebalance the equation once again.
      <p>The lakes with lake trout in them have been affected too. When ciscoes
      are available, smallmouth will find them and lower the over all bait fish
      numbers down in small lakes. This same baitfish was the lake trout’s
      staple diet. An unbalance occurs. I am actively fishing a lake that meets
      this criterion right now. Lake trout are few and far now a days, but
      unreal hog smallmouth have taken over. An unbalance for sure and it will
      be interesting as I follow the lakes progression. I miss the trout, but
      man, the wicked smallmouth!
      <p>Back years ago, there was a period of time when the locals were hardly
      impressed with these new-planted bass. Many blamed poor walleye fishing
      after the bass arrival and rightly so. Most lakes seem to be stabilize
      from the exotic smallmouth transfers but not all of them. Walleye and
      smallmouth can do quite well cohabitating with most other species
      especially on the bigger lakes that have a larger diversified food system.
      The small fragile lakes are harmed the most in situations that the bass
      can dominate.
      <p>“Many lakes will shift from walleye to a bass-dominated community”
      and “walleye densities negatively related to bass densities” were
      given from the summary of Smallmouth Bass in North-western Ontario:
      colonization, distribution and impacts by K.B. Armstrong &amp; R.
      Mackereth Ont. MNR 2000. The study also suggests that: “bass have yet to
      encounter their thermal barrier”, “bass exist in many water bodies”,
      and “higher bass densities in more clear lakes”.
      <p>So what appeared to be a mass migration of the smallmouth at lightning
      speed were in fact just human transfers. Eight kilometres is the figure
      given for the maximum range a small mouth can identify with. As Gord has
      written, the smallmouth know where they come from and they know where they
      live quite well.
      <p>In my experience some fish have adapted long-range tendencies and these
      fish do it for spawning reasons. Some extended shallow water bays on Rainy
      Lake that can almost be classified as an “enclosed lake” exist off the
      main lake basins. Big shallow water bays with warm dark water. The can be
      eight to ten miles deep with smallmouth right in the back of bay come
      early spring. A week earlier the fish were deep along the main lake basin.
      You can literally chase the fish all the way in if your timing and
      locations are right. These fish travel fast and from point A to B to C
      kind of a thing. The fish vacate the warm shallow water bays as summer
      progresses. In the fall some migrating sections of the lake (back bays
      which are “enclosed lake” type) have a mass spill of big migrating
      smallies into the main lake basin and out to the wintering areas. It would
      be entirely correct that this is my assumption and I have no true way to
      verify that the fish migrate further distances than normally assumed. It
      is just from my observations.
      <p>The current smallmouth situation suggests smallmouth that are
      transferred as adults into entirely new water also must have a high rate
      of success at proliferating in the new and most likely under utilized
      water. The human transferred fish by the tourist industry are proof
      enough. These fish have a strong will to live and to prosper the species.
      Far exceeding the natural fish that they have displaced. These fish want
      to rule!
      <p>The proliferation of the species has created the information of
      “where and how big” to be an ever changing item. A new big fish bite
      has materialized all throughout the area. Old news is well, Old News. Soon
      we may learn just how north this species and its cousin the largemouth can
      exist in. Right now we know they can live quite far north. Time will tell
      us how far north its range really is.
      <p>Man’s tentacles are long and wide. It is nice that it was only bass
      and not some snakefish kind of thing. Many new exotics are appearing on a
      more regular basis. Crappie, blue gill, brown bull head, smelt, etc.
      Hopefully we will be a little more diligent with these.</p>
