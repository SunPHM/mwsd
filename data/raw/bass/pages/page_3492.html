        Damn Soderberg! The guy friggin' sold out in the worst way! I used to 
        like him, back when he was alternative, independant. &quot;Kafka&quot; 
        was cool, and &quot;Schizopolis&quot; is one of the greatest movies nobody's 
        ever heard of. I also dug the way he snuck in under the radar in the studio 
        system, making a fully accessible woman empowerment movie, getting the 
        usually coasting Julia Roberts to do what we know she can: act. Then he 
        got a bunch of suits to pay for a grainy indie-style 2hr plus drug movie. 
        Stick it to 'em! But now, now he actually tasted success, and just sold 
        out. He did a big budget, star-studded, event movie REMAKE!!! A friggin' 
        REMAKE!!! But that's not the worst of it! Noooooo, sir. He made it one 
        of the best friggin' movies of the year, and possibly the coolest Vegas 
        heist movie ever filmed! Where, oh where has your artistic integrity gone?<br>
        <br>
        He could have let all of those big name actors coast through, but he insisted 
        on them exuding a charm and chemistry an operation like this would require. 
        He bought back all of the cool points people like Matt Damon lost doing 
        feel good golf movies. He went through the trouble of getting supporting 
        actors who could hold their own. Casey Affleck, probably brought on by 
        Matty, and Scott Caan were amusing as bickering brothers. Bernie Mac, 
        whose new show I have yet to see, is an up and coming talent who just 
        keeps doing well, and has some great moments throughout. Pulling a Jack 
        Lemmon &quot;Glen Gary Glenross,&quot; is Carl Reiner, coming out of near-retirement 
        to to put in a performance of a lifetime, with a pretty damn good track 
        record going in. Elliot Gould acts for the first time in over a decade, 
        and based on his perfornances on &quot;Friends&quot; I'd thought he'd 
        had a stroke and was just getting roles out of kindness. Andy Garcia doesn't 
        suck. Don Cheadle is, well, Don Cheadle, a solid workhorse in smaller 
        roles. There's also a funny cameo-fest at the beginning, with Joshua Jackson, 
        Topher Grace, and Holly Marie Combs as themselves trying to learn poker. 
        Joshua Jackson, whatever, he's been in stuff and always seems to play 
        himself. Topher just makes me laugh, no exception here. Holly. Mmmm, Holly. 
        She was one of the few reasons to watch &quot;Picket Fences&quot; after 
        season 2. She will be mine, oh yes, she will be mine.<br>
        <br>
        Besides the cast, there's great camera work, good costumes, well paced 
        editing and action, a script that's tight, witty, and thorough (I can't 
        find any glaring errors with, and frankly am not keen on nitpicking, just 
        because), and a proper payoff. The only thing that at all strikes as lackluster 
        is what Julia Roberts is given to do, just based on her stature in the 
        biz, but if it were a lesser known actress it wouldn't matter. I see her 
        character as supporting, and she tends to lead. Just a preconception issue. 
        I'll get over it. Okay, just did. Yaaay! So I wholeheartedly reccommend 
        &quot;Ocean's 11,&quot; and then go find a cool video store that carries 
        &quot;Schizopolis.&quot; Weird, but very cool. Then go volunteer some 
        time doing charity work. Why? Why not? Karma never hurts. Except for bad 
        karma, I guess. Just go.</font></p>

        Quick show of hands - who's surprised that a.) OCEAN'S 11 kicks ass, and 
        that b.) I, of all people think that OCEAN'S 11 kicks ass? If anyone's 
        holding their hands up, a.) you answered wrong, and b.) you're sitting 
        in front of your computer, holding your hand up. Put it down. You look 
        stupid. <br>
        <br>
        About thirty, thirty-five years ago, there was this really excellent subgenre 
        of movies about amiable criminals taking on an impossible crime. Michael 
        Crichton's THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY leaps to mind, or at least to my mind, 
        to say nothing of all the great cat burglar flicks of the 60's, of course; 
        and we couldn't possibly forget the great grandpappy of the bunch - George 
        Roy Hill's THE STING, featuring conceivably the most likeable gang of 
        con men ever to grace the screen. <br>
        <br>
        In the wake of the early 90's revival of violent crime flicks, though, 
        the mood turned, and the charm and grace of the Paul Newmans and Cary 
        Grants of the genre were replaced by the menace of darker, more sadistic 
        hoods, and their goals became less an exercise in criminal panache than 
        they were lessons in violent futility. <br>
        <br>
        What a blessed relief it is, then, that we have the new OCEAN'S 11, a 
        slick and self-possessed heist caper which calls back most of the better 
        elements of those 60's &amp; 70's flicks, while still maintaining a fresh 
        and appealing modern-day sheen. <br>
        <br>
        Now, even as not much of a fan of the 1960 original, I've been looking 
        forward to this remake for about a year, based its own considerable merits. 
        Steven Soderbergh again proves himself a nearly infallible stylist and 
        proper actors' director, adding yet another genre to his already sterling 
        and diverse resum&eacute;. <br>
        <br>
        Then, of course, there's the cast, which is maybe the largest assembly 
        of A-list talent this side of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. With the likes of 
        George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts on board, how could I not 
        anticipate this movie with anything but giddy eagerness? Hell, I could've 
        written this review the day before I saw the movie, and not have to revise 
        much afterward, so closely the film rose to my <br>
        expectations. <br>
        <br>
        Fresh out of a four-year stint in a New Jersey prison, suave con man Danny 
        Ocean (Clooney) doesn't waste much time before tracking down his old criminal 
        pals, most notably cardsharp Rusty Ryan (Pitt), now whiling away the hours 
        teaching Young Hollywood how to play poker. Ever the Idea Man, Danny pitches 
        an idea to Rusty for an audacious, near-impossible score - robbing three 
        Las Vegas casinos (this is the first example of the intelligence of the 
        remake's streamlining; in the original, the take was five separate casinos, 
        which made for a lot of set-up and repeated beats that here are wisely 
        condensed into the robbery of one vault which feeds all three casinos) 
        of $160 million. <br>
        <br>
        And before you can say DIRTY DOZEN, they're rounding up their motley crew 
        of likeable joe criminals - moneyman Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), demolitions 
        expert Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle, with a wardrobe so fantastic and a cockney 
        accent so lame they cancel each other out), getaway drivers Virgil and 
        Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan), electronics whiz Livingston 
        Dell (Soderbergh vet Edward Jemison), veteran con man Saul Bloom (an excellent 
        Carl Reiner), inside-man Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Chinese acrobat/contortionist 
        Yen (Shaobo Qin), and <br>
        rookie pickpocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon). <br>
        <br>
        And while this may seem like an unwieldy and large principal cast (and 
        we haven't even gotten to The Bad Guy or The Girl yet), Ted Griffin's 
        light-touch script makes good use of them all, giving them each little 
        bits of business, augmented by Soderbergh's keen eye for letting actors 
        have fun and riff. <br>
        <br>
        As the group cases the casinos, and their oily owner, Terry Benedict (Andy 
        Garcia), it comes to light that Benedict is now squiring Danny's ex-wife 
        Tess (Roberts), which calls into question Danny's motivation for the heist 
        - is it just the ludicrous shitloads of money, or is it personal revenge 
        against Benedict? <br>
        <br>
        Here, in this more personal arena, the story, which, till this point, 
        has grooved nicely on a slow-burn, slow-boil charm, derails a bit, as, 
        surprisingly, the ever-engaging Clooney and Roberts generate little chemistry 
        with one another; also, this subplot comes off as a somewhat-boorish move, 
        turning Roberts' smart, elegant Tess into little more than a poker chip 
        between power players Danny and Benedict. <br>
        <br>
        Fortunately, the proliferation of other charms the movie has to offer 
        reduce this to little more than a mildly-distracting misstep, as we launch 
        into a third-act heist, clever and dazzling enough in its execution to 
        rank with the finales of your finest ticking-clock heist flick, leading 
        up to a de facto curtain call in front of the Bellagio Hotel's gushing 
        fountain, set to the strains of Debussy's &quot;Clair de Lune.&quot; Breathtaking. 
        Just breathtaking. <br>
        <br>
        After tackling drug cartels (TRAFFIC) and hexavalent chromium (ERIN BROCKOVICH) 
        in the last year - never mind the intricacies of psychosexual behavior 
        (SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE) or paranoia (KAFKA) which dotted his earlier 
        works - Big Hollywood might seem like an odd step for Soderbergh, but 
        I count myself among those with the utmost confidence in his ability to 
        tackle whatever he wants, and tackle it well. As with TRAFFIC, Soderbergh's 
        insightful ability as a director transcends the weaknesses of the script, 
        and brings the project to life with a thoroughly engrossing energy and 
        agility. A few nice touches which dot the action here and there - the 
        running gag about how Danny always seems to get arrested in a tuxedo, 
        or the way Pitt's Rusty is constantly eating a vast array of junk food, 
        before meticulously wiping his mouth or licking his fingers clean - add 
        class and charisma far better and more subtly than the best dialogue can 
        convey. <br>
        <br>
        By and large, there are fine performances across the board. Clooney basically 
        reprises his role as charming bank robber Jack Foley from 1998's OUT OF 
        SIGHT, which is fine, since it's arguably his best performance to date, 
        but surrounded by more outspoken characters, Danny's idea-man posture 
        tends to remove him a few degrees from where the action is, and one can't 
        help but feel we'd be better served by a few instances of Danny the Master 
        Criminal in action. <br>
        <br>
        The other members of Danny's crew are each given moments to shine - most 
        notably Reiner's Saul, who, for the sake of the con, transforms himself 
        from a Miami Beach shlub to a Eurotrash high-roller in so graceful a manner 
        that you can't help but acknowledge that there's a reason some people 
        are legends. <br>
        <br>
        Even despite his unfortunate put-on accent (possibly a nod to Soderbergh's 
        excellent THE LIMEY), Cheadle pulls off a couple of solid character bits 
        - shock and surprise - but how much would I have paid to see him paired 
        again with his TRAFFIC foil, Luis Guzman? Like Cheadle's accent, the movie 
        is full of deft little nods to the actors' other works - e.g., when Damon 
        is decked out as a representative of the Nevada Gaming Commission - in 
        one of the movie's funniest scenes - he wears the same glasses and nerdly-parted 
        hair he wore as Tom Ripley. <br>
        <br>
        It's Pitt, though, who ultimately steals the show. Decked out in designer 
        suits he seems born into, Pitt exudes the easy charm that is fundamentally 
        the spirit of the movie. And, as with most members of this cast, Pitt 
        is obviously having the time of his life, an exuberance that makes Rusty 
        all the more appealing a hood. <br>
        <br>
        Not so fortunate are Roberts and Garcia, she for the aforementioned reason 
        of being reduced to currency (though she does get to make one hell of 
        an entrance, down a grand staircase in a stunning red designer suit, to 
        the accompaniment of composer David Holmes's remix of the Clair de Lune), 
        and he for, well, not being a very good actor, saddled with a not very 
        well-written part. <br>
        <br>
        Backed by OUT OF SIGHT composer Holmes's kickass score, Soderbergh's own 
        glamour-shot cinematography, and TRAFFIC editor Stephen Mirrione's cool 
        hand, the end result is a gift where the wrapping may be prettier than 
        what's inside the box, but DAMN is it nice wrapping. <br>
        <br>
        Now, is O's 11 a perfect movie? No, probably not. It lacks the grit and 
        fiber of Soderbergh's best works (OUT OF SIGHT, THE LIMEY, TRAFFIC), but 
        this is hardly accidental; this is a movie designed for exactly one purpose 
        - to look, feel, and go down as smoothly as a tumbler of good scotch. 
        Honestly, I can't recall the last time a movie set out to do this, and 
        accomplished it with such easy panache. <br>
