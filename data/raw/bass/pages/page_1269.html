                        A seasoned veteran of the live music scene, George began 
                        his playing career back in 1985 when he purchased a Cort 
                        hot pink Titan bass (which he still has). He thumped out 
                        the low end in 80&#8217;s local bands Taz and In N Out. 
                        George has 2 CD recordings of original music from those 
                        bands. In 1992, with the coming demise of the 80&#8217;s 
                        metal scene, George moved on to Top40 and for the next 
                        10 years played in successful Top40 variety bands such 
                        as Impostor, Skyline, and Wildfire (voted Best Band overall 
                        &#8211; 2000 Western Maryland Times/News Annual Reader&#8217;s 
                        Poll). It was with Wildfire that George moved from bass 
                        to playing keyboards, guitar, and harmonica.<br>
                        <br>
                        George has years of theory training, vocal coaching, and 
                        instrument lessons under his belt. The versatility necessary 
                        to playing all the styles of music that Top40 demands 
                        has made George an exceptionally complete player on several 
                        instruments. You can check out George as a featured artist

                          <br>
                          Alan started his musical training at the behest of his 
                          mother who insisted that he take piano lessons at the 
                          age of 10. Even though it was not his choice, he continued 
                          the lessons for 2 years before his father, without any 
                          prompting or request, bought him an acoustic guitar 
                          and a 30-page beginner book just to see what he would 
                          do with it on Christmas morning. Well it turned out 
                          to be a lot more entertaining than anyone expected. 
                          By the end of Christmas day, Alan had learned how to 
                          string and tune the guitar and before he went to bed 
                          that night, was playing along with the vinyl 45 copy 
                          of &#8220;She Loves You&#8221; on Swan records by the 
                          Beatles, which was also a Christmas present. And the 
                          rest, they say, is history.<br>
                          <br>
                          With his love for the guitar and his natural ability 
                          well recognized, he entered his first band when he was 
                          14. Along with a group of fellow members of a drum corp. 
                          called &#8220;The Pink Panthers&#8221; that he maintained 
                          a membership which brought him, his colleages, and his 
                          community great distinction in winning 10 national championships 
                          in 12 years, he got his first band and stage show experience.

                          <br>
                          Since then Alan has played in several different bands. 
                          The two most notable of these were &#8220;Side Effects&#8221; 
                          which was together, and very successful, from 1984 &#8211; 
                          1986 where the band worked all over the Washington metro 
                          area. The majority of there work was in College Park 
                          and Georgetown in clubs like &#8220;The Bastille&#8221;, 
                          &#8220;The Paragon&#8221;, and &#8220;The Bayou&#8221; 
                          where the band got their opportunity to play there own 
                          material while warming up for national acts.<br>
                          <br>
                          The last band Alan was in before joining with Alive-n-Kickin' 
                          was called &#8220;Back Ally Jones&#8221;. He formed 
                          BAJ after his previous band &#8220;Licking Post&#8221; 
                          disbanded over their displeasure of Alan&#8217;s choice 
                          of ME Jones as co-lead vocalist and true to his conviction, 
                          she was his first choice when picking members for the 
                          new band. BAJ enjoyed great success playing all over 
                          the metro area, as well as Baltimore, Annapolis, and 
                          Ocean City. During the seven years that BAJ was in existence, 
                          there were several bright moments including gigs at 
                          Massenutten Ski Resort, The Purple Moose, and a new 
                          original CD release called &#8220;Set Me Free&#8221; 
                          where Alan either wrote or co-wrote nine of the thirteen 
                          songs on the CD.<br>
                          <br>
                          After the breakup of BAJ, Alan found himself without 
                          a gig in the works for more years than he&#8217;s got 
                          fingers but that didn&#8217;t last long. Drummer Steve 
                          Miller had found out about the breakup and in less than 
                          two months of the previous band&#8217;s ending, was 
                          knocking on his door asking him to join with him in 
                          this new band. <br>
                          <br>
                          Now here we are! With his years of experience and his

                          <br>
                          Drawn to the energy and passion of music, Steve began 
                          playing drums after seeing his first KISS concert in 
                          1983. Eric Carr became his instant hero that night, 
                          and remains so to this day. &quot;I remember feeling 
                          the bass drums hitting me in the chest with every beat!!&quot; 
                          Ever since, Steve has been driven to succeed in drumming, 
                          no matter what scale or stage he may be on.<br>
                          <br>
                          His passion has taken him from Baltimore to the sunshine 
                          of Los Angeles, in search of the best musicians, bands, 
                          and teachers to help him hone his craft. This has included 
                          a long tuteledge under his original teacher, Myles Evans 
                          (DC STAR, KIK* The Dog) and several sessions with the 
                          legendary BOBBY ROCK (Nelson, Vinnie VIncent). &quot;I 
                          am constantly learning and practicing. There is always 
                          something new to work on, rudiments; hand speed; polyrythyms; 
                          DOUBLEBASS; technique; POWER!!! I will never stop!!!!'<br>

                          With Alive-n-Kickin' Steve hopes to achieve the goal 
                          of making this the best band in the mid-Atlantic area. 
                          &quot;The music we are playing is what I grew up on. 
                          It is the music I used to practice to in my bedroom 
                          after school. It is the music that was always the most 
                          fun. It is the soundtrack from the era of EXCESS!!!! 
                          &quot; That is exactly how Steve plays, with EXCESS!!!! 
                          Excessive Hitting, Excessive Energy, Excessive Charisma...Excessive

                          <span class="bodyCopySmall">Dave started listening to 
                          heavy metal as a teenager, with Back In Black and KISS 
                          Alive being the first albums he ever purchased. A friend 
                          later introduced him to Iron Maiden, and that was the 
                          beginning of a long love affair. After he was hooked 
                          on The Scorpions and Queensrÿche it became apparent 
                          that he had a natural affinity to music with soaring, 
                          killer vocals. He worshiped the vocal gods - Dickinson, 
                          Tate, Halford, Dio... &quot;I would sing along with 
                          these guys and attempt to emulate their styles, but 
                          I quickly realized you can only sound like yourself."<br>
                          <br>
                          In 2001, Dave co-founded the progressive metal cover 
                          band, Critical Path, with two friends. "We started from 
                          scratch - Rick played guitar, Ron played bass, and I 
                          offered to sing. It was my first real band so I didn't 
                          know what to expect - I just knew I loved the music 
                          and I wanted to try my hand at singing. It soon became 
                          clear that although I had some raw talent, I didn't 
                          know how to control it. After months of practicing and 
                          playing out I had improved significantly, but felt I 
                          had reached a plateau so I sought out a vocal coach." 
                          Dave hooked up with Steve Whiteman (KIX, Funny Money) 
                          in early 2003 and has been training with him ever since. 
                          "It is a real revelation when you realize how much theory 
                          and technique there is behind singing properly.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Although relatively new to the band scene, Dave aspires 
                          to help raise Alive-n-Kickin' to another level of excellence 
                          and to provide the people who watch the band with a
