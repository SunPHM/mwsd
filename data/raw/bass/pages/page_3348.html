Whether you fancy an hours mackerelling in the still calm of a
summer evening, available at many of the resorts, including <a
href="looe.htm">Looe</a>, <a href="st-ives.htm">St Ives</a> and <a href="mevagissey.htm">
Mevagissey</a> even <a href="newquay.htm">Newquay</a>What about a longer trip? 
Say 4 hours deep sea angling off the reef, or even an
all day wreck fishing out of <a href="padstow.htm">Padstow</a> or
<a href="boscastle.htm">Boscastle</a>, both on the North Cornwall
Coast, there's plenty of choice.

Some boats even supply angling equipment,
Species include pollack, caught
on feather, conger and pouting on mackeral strip, bass and cod in
the autumn, and even flatfish such as plaice or skate on the
patches of sandy ground between the reefs off the North Cornish Coast. If its a really hot
summer there may be even delicious black bream around. <br>
</p>

<h3 align="center">Shore Fishing from the Beaches, Headlands and
Cliffs </h3>

<p>On many of the Headlands the water deepens quickly and rock
dwelling  sea fish such as cuckoo and ballan wrasse are to be had. 
That is if you have the skill to prevent the initial dive once the fish takes.
Small crabs are an ideal bait for wrasse. Most of the Headlands
have good marks from Logan Rock <a href="porthcurno-mousehole.htm">Porthcurno</a>
 in the far South West to <a href="padstow.htm">Trevose</a> on the
North Coast of the County. Many of the best sea angling fishing marks involve a long walk
and a stiff climb. There are some celebrated bass marks in the
County.<br><br></P>


<h3 align="center">Fishing and Sea Angling Safety</h3>
Regrettably every year anglers lives are lost by either being
swept off rocks or loosing their footings. Locals as well as
visitors. There is no such thing as a freak wave.

<ul type="disc">
<li> Here's some DO's and DONTS.</li>
<li>Do not fish alone. Tell someone where you are going.</li>
<li>Do check the weather forecast and the tides before setting out.</li>
<li>Do ascertain the local conditions.</li>
 <li>If you have any doubt dont venture down to that mark.</li>
<li>Wear high visibility clothing and stout shoes or wellingtons.</li>
 <li>Take waterproofs, a whistle and a torch.</li>
<li>Do excercise caution after all its only commonsense.</li> 
<li>Its your one and only life!</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 align="center">Sea Fishing in The Estuaries and Harbours and on the Piers </h3>

<p>Though many anglers only retreat to the shelter of the
estuaries and harbours when its too rough to fish the open
sea, good fishing is still to be had, especially on an incoming
tide on a winters night. 
For example in Winter both the <a href="looe.htm">Looe</a> and <a href="fowey.htm">Fowey</a> Rivers hold very large flounder.
 Out of the main tourist season fishing is sometimes permitted from the Banjo Pier at Looe.
If the gates across the Pier Entrance are shut 
you are not allowed to fish from the Pier. 
Equally regardless if they are open or not 
and the weather conditions are bad you should not attempt to fish.

Sometimes Pollack venture well up the Looe River looking for scraps under the Fish Market,
 providing great sport on light float tackle on cold winter nights.</p><br><br>
