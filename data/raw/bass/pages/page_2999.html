<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The Seminole Indian name
Okeechobee actually means big water, an appropriate title for
the largest freshwater lake in the United States occurring entirely
in one state. The lake is approximately 37 miles long by 30 miles
wide (448,000 acres, 700 square miles) with an average depth of
almost 10 feet. To fishermen nation wide, Okeechobee is renowned
for the sheer numbers of bass it contains per acre and the fact
that it produces more Florida trophy bass over 8 pounds than any
lake in Florida and the United States!<BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Is by far the most productive
way to land a Florida trophy bass. The beauty of shiner fishing
is that you don't have to be a bass fishing angler of the year
to really experience the thrill of fighting trophy size bass.
Fishing with shiners is a sure shot method of putting a Florida
trophy bass on your wall. The going price for shiners is $14.00
per dozen. During the winter months when they become scarce they
can cost as much as $18.00 per dozen! A party can expect to use
- depending on how good the fish are biting - anywhere from 6
- 8 dozen wild shiners during a full day of fishing. That's</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS"> $84.00 - $112.00</FONT><FONT
 FACE="Comic Sans MS"> per day that you would pay in addition
to your guide rate charges<I>.</I> </FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Keep
this in mine</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"> when you are
planing your trip's budget. To take the sting out of this additional
expense - which can amount into hundreds of dollars over a period
of days - Captain Ron provides his party with 6 dozen wild shiners
per day </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">FREE

 FACE="Comic Sans MS">FISHING WITH ARTIFICIAL LURES</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Is by far the most economical
way to fish. At $250.00 for an 8 hour day of fishing for two persons
($125.00 per person a day) Captain Ron again offers a guide fishing
rate a client can afford. A party may also combine some wild shiner
fishing while they are fishing with artificial lures by purchasing
a dozen or so of shiners if they wish. Likewise, crappie, bluegill
and shellcracker fishing can be combined under this rate.<BR>

HOURS</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Our full day fishing rates
are for an 8 hour straight or split day of fishing. On our split
day trips we divide the day into 2 four hour sessions of fishing.
We do not charge a party extra to split a day of fishing. Access
to restrooms, a hot meal, dip in the pool, nap or some sightseeing
during an afternoon break to make one's day more enjoyable --
we feel should not be an avenue to additional charges. Our straight
day of fishing rate is for a straight 8 hour session of fishing.
Our half day fishing rates are for a four hour morning session
or 4 hour afternoon session of fishing.<BR CLEAR="ALL"><BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Is the foremost question
I am asked by every angler planning a trophy bass fishing trip
to Lake Okeechobee. In the 20 years I have guided on Okeechobee
I would honestly have to say that there really isn't a bad time
to <IMG SRC="merlin.gif" ALT="florida bass fishing, lake okeechobee trophy bass fishing, florida wild shiner fishing, USCG guide service"
WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="175" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">fish
Okeechobee. Take for example the 2 pictures on this page. The
first picture a 10 lb. trophy bass was caught using a wild shiner
in October along with 47 other bass that also included an 8 1/4
lb, 7 3/4 lb and a 6 lb'er. The second picture a 7 lb'er and 84
other bass up to 6 lbs were caught on wild shiners in July. The
summer months and early fall months produce good numbers of fish
as well as trophy bass. The spawn (November - April) when the
fish are bedding is considered to be the better months to catch
a trophy Lake Okeechobee bass. </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"
