  Effect of dissolved oxygen concentrations

<p>Reduced appetite of farmed fish exposed to suboptimal oxygen conditions can lead to considerable losses of feed. Overfeeding pollutes the environment and is uneconomical. It had been suggested that fluctuations of dissolved oxygen could have a more pronounced effect on feed intake and growth than constant intermediate levels.

<p>Hypoxic sea bass consumed less feed than normoxic controls. The groups exposed to 40&nbsp;% air saturation (moderate hypoxia) for one month consumed 24&nbsp;% less than the ration suggested by the manufacturer's feeding table (19&nbsp;% less than the normoxic control). No indications were found, however, for a more than intermediate suppression of feeding in groups with fluctuating levels of dissolved oxygen (Fig.&nbsp;1). To avoid overfeeding the oxygen content of the water in net cages should be recorded continuously, and feeding tables must consider not only temperature and fish weight but also saturation of dissolved oxygen. Prolonged periods of moderate hypoxia should be avoided by careful site selection and by adapting stocking densities to hydrographic conditions because reduced amounts of feed intake directly affect <a href="growth.html">growth</a> performance.
