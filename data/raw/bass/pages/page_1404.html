Petersson and&nbsp; is quite different than the current production model.&nbsp; It was
made entirely by hand! This was the 12-String Bass Tom used during the famous 4-Night
&quot;Live @ The Metro&quot; concerts which was the basis for Cheap Trick's second live
offering &quot;</font><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF8000"><strong>Music For Hangovers</strong></font><font
color="#FFFFFF">&quot;. &nbsp; It has a few cosmetic differences.&nbsp; The current
production &quot;Royale&quot; &nbsp; has a more rounded headstock than the original for
ease of sanding during construction (whereas Tom's &quot;Original&quot; has a sharper,
more rectangular shape) with a different style of white pearl headstock&nbsp; accents.
&nbsp; The pickups and bridge are positioned higher on the current production model as
well.&nbsp;(compare the distance from the bridge to the bottom of the Royale in the two
photos on this page)&nbsp; Also the &quot;original&quot; pickups have a Tortoise Shell
cover with a white binding, whereas the current model has black covers. The pickguard on
Tom's &quot;Original&quot; Royale was made exclusively for him and is not available for
duplication at his request, making this first production&nbsp; Royale
&quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;.&nbsp; </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Tom's &quot;Original&quot; has a thick
graphite slab underneath the rosewood fingerboard and a Dual Truss Rod system to withstand
the tension of a 12-String Bass tuned to concert pitch (440).&nbsp; The current design has
two Graphite Rods installed (on either side of a Dual Truss Rod/ which makes for easier
adjustments)&nbsp; with the correct tensile strength to resist the tension of the
12-String Bass tuned to concert pitch. This keeps the neck from bowing or twisting.&nbsp;
This improvement was the result of the continuing collaboration between Tom Petersson and
Chandler as they strive to build the &quot;Finest 12-String Bass Ever Made&quot;.&nbsp; As
the inventor of the 12-String Bass Guitar, Tom identified&nbsp; areas on which to improve
the &quot;Royale.&nbsp; Along with Chandler,&nbsp; they re-engineered the original design
producing a 12-String Bass to meet Tom Petersson' s high standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;Tom no
longer tours with his &quot;original&quot; Royale due to the fact that Chandler feels that
it no longer represents the quality of the current design.&nbsp; Tom now tours with a
couple of the current model Royales (</font><strong><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Black</font></strong><font
