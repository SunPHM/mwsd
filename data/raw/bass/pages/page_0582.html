      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Gordon Cullingham was born in Beckenham,
      Kent on July 10th 1915. In a letter written the day before he
      died, he describes for the benefit of his grand-children how
      he &quot;could still recall the sounds of the First World War,
      when German bombs rained down on SE London&quot;.<BR>
      Apparently, every so often, a Zeppelin (nicknamed &quot;The Baby
      Killer&quot;) would fly over Croydon dropping bombs as it passed
      overhead. Gordon describes how his mother told him that the resulting
      explosions were the sounds of trains going over a nearby bridge!</FONT></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">A 'Baby Killer' (Zeppelin) over
      London <BR>
      when Gordon was 2 months old. (8th September 1915)</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1924 the family bought their first car,
      a Singer 10 with overhead valves - a great advance - but still
      only with rear wheel brakes. Gordon writes &quot;This 4-seater
      Open Tourer took us - just about - to the Sussex coast and Suffolk
      and to Buckinghamshire where my father must have had connections.&quot;<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;The family home was probably typical of the time,
      gas lighting down stairs, candles in the bedrooms and a kitchen
      range that provided, &quot;more or less, heated hot water, but
      the bathroom was not often used. A galvanised bath served in
      front of the kitchen range fire, with its steel parts that had
      to be brightened by emery rubbing, the black being black-leaded.
      Our steel knives had to be cleaned until they shone on an emery
      board, a chore that my elder brother disliked.&quot;<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The milkman came round with a handcart and
      brought a churn daily to the back door where a jug would be filled
      with a pint (or two) of fresh milk - which in summer often went
      sour. There were no fridges. The baker called with his horse
      and cart, which reminds me that the horses were the source of
      much energy, and must have been fed from acres of fields of grass
      and corn, later to be replaced by steam Foden wagons and petrol
      engined lorries and cars.&quot;<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1927 Gordon moved to a nearby house in Beckenham
      which had electric light and a garage for their next car, an
      Austin 12 Tourer. <BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon lost some time at school due to illness but
      studied hard in his teenage years in the early 1930s to gain
      his qualifications for the Institute of Chartered Surveyors 
      (ARICS). By this time the family had moved to Herne Bay, Kent,
      where Mr Cullingham senior built a new family house in Queensbridge
      Drive at the junction with West Hill Road.</FONT></P>

      was later to use around Windsor until 1956, and with which they
      towed a magnificent caravan, 'Curlew', which weighed almost a
      ton and a quarter! Not surprising - it even had leaded windows!</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Gordon's first employment was in Colchester
      in the Town Planning Office, the journey from Herne Bay being
      made in, as Gordon describes, &quot;a decrepit Morgan 3 wheeler&quot;
      which included a river crossing at the Woolwich Ferry. He would
      make this journey regularly, travelling from his 'digs' to his
      parents' home back in Herne Bay.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after he worked in the Borough Engineer's office
      in Canterbury and met his wife-to-be, Mollie. Only later were
      they to discover that they had been born in the same road, Mackenzie
      Road, Beckenham!<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon recalls that he remembers seeing the fire
      that destroyed the Crystal Palace near Croydon on 30 November,
      1936. He drove over to witness this major loss to the London
      skyline. Although the Crystal Palace was not quite the size it
      had been when originally erected in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition
      of 1851, Gordon would have been very interested in the building,
      both from a historical and an engineer's point of view.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Arial">Gordon came to Windsor in May 1939 as Assistant
      Engineer to work in the large drawing office at the Windsor Corporation
      'depot' in Alma Road, no. 16, since demolished to make way for
      <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/wardroyal/wardroyal.html"
      TARGET="_blank">Ward Royal</A> in the late 1960s. With the outbreak
      of war with Germany in September 1939 some territorials had been
      called up and the rest &quot;registered&quot; at intervals. Gordon
      was at first &quot;reserved&quot; but he was never called up,
      possibly because of the nature of his work in the borough. <BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1941 Gordon and Mollie married and towards the
      end of that year their first son, Mark, (1941-1995) was born.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile F.N. McRae, the Borough Engineer, was becoming
      ill from asthma. He was in charge of the Rescue and Decontamination
      parties, but had done no training, and the gear was still in
      the store room. Gordon had done some training at Bexhill and
      found that he had to take over. There were three Rescue parties
      and three Decontamination parties, all from Borough workmen.
      The County ARP was at Steventon, and Gordon recalls a rare opportunity
      to drive a Ford ambulance full of men being taken for advanced
      training. This was the first chance to drive for months - his
      father's old Austin 12 was laid up for the duration of the War,
      with virtually no petrol available. Gordon describes how driving
      at 70 mph was great fun! <BR>
      Then came the Baedecker air raids and Gordon's call up to the
      Royal Engineers but Mr McRae was ill and somehow Gordon was deferred
      &quot;for three days or until a substitute was found&quot;. He
      kept his kit bag under the stairs beside where his wife Mollie
      used to shelter their baby son, Mark, in case of air raids. This
      was at &quot;Nancledra,&quot; 6 Maidenhead Road, opposite the
      newly built Grammar School. Gordon and Mollie had set up home
      at No. 6 in April 1941 and were to live there until 1948 and
      the move into their own, newly built home, 112, Clarence Road.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this period, Gordon's deferred call-up
      to the Royal Engineers was never cancelled and lasted after the
      war, until the call -up ended. Most of the borough staff had
      in fact been called up. Eventually Gordon had to work a double
      shift on housing plans and other planning matters, sometimes
      until midnight. But he was still holding his rail pass to the
      Royal Engineers.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1945 Mr McRae died and Gordon was appointed to
      take over but this was not to be. When the Labour Party took
      over from the Conservatives one of their objectives was to have
      a qualified architect in charge of housing, resulting in the
      appointment of G.S. Baker. But he was not an architect, so it
      was a shock to Gordon, as his housing plans had been approved
      by the Ministry and he was eminently qualified and capable. <BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon recalls that an alderman was critical of his
      plans because the &quot;C&quot; type houses faced in different
      directions. Gordon describes in his letter how &quot;...my Doctor
      had given me a pill to take &quot;in case of need&quot;. I took
      the pill at the Council meeting and this resulted in my being
      &quot;in top gear&quot; and dealing with every quibble!!&quot;
      There is no doubt that Gordon was highly qualified - he had continued
      to acquire additional qualifications throughout this period -
      but there were those who perhaps considered him too young, despite
      his experience in the Borough, or were less convinced than others
      by the value of qualifications. Gordon writes &quot;It was experience
      rather than my qualifications that I could rely upon, but the
      latter was invaluable to those who doubted the value of qualifications.
      &quot;Would you like to be operated upon by an unqualified surgeon?&quot;
      flattened the doubters!&quot;<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1947 Gordon was closely involved with the Windsor
      Flood in March of that year. Mollie Cullingham describes how
      she went out into Maidenhead Road to see the flood waters creeping
      up from the west. Although the water reached their front door
      at No. 6, Maidenhead Road, the water remained just under the
      floor boards. Nevertheless, they were required to share the upstairs
      flat with another family for the duration of the flood. Gordon's
      history of the flood is available at <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/floods47.html">The
      Floods of Windsor, 1947</A>.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1948 Gordon and Mollie built their own house,
      112, Clarence Road, in conjunction with Mr&nbsp;Lilley, a director
      of Miller, Morris and Brooker, the builders' supplies company
      in Slough. At the time of writing, November 1999, a beautiful
      Silver Birch remains in the front garden, planted as a sapling
      lifted from Windsor Great Park by Gordon's 7 year old son Mark
      at the time the house was built.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon described to his grandchildren how, while
      taking a weekend break with his wife Mollie and his family in
      Herne Bay in early 1948, he heard on the radio how building permissions
      were to be tightened up and that any applications received after
      Monday would not be granted. Gordon realised that plans for his
      new house would be scuppered if he did not get the relevant papers
      to the right department at Reading, Berkshire, in time for first
      thing Monday morning. He therefore jumped into the elderly Austin
      12 and drove from Herne Bay to Windsor, grabbed his and several
      other people's applications from his desk and raced to Reading
      to beat the deadline. A day or two later he received a call from
      the officer in charge in Reading. &quot;It's funny,&quot; the
      officer said, &quot;I could have sworn that I had completed all
      outstanding applications on Friday night!!!&quot;<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately Gordon's papers were passed and he received
      the necessary permits for the purchase of timber, etc. required
      for his house to be completed soon after the birth of their second
      son, Roger.</FONT></P>

      In 1949 The Borough Offices were relocated to <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/images/isc_images/kipling01.jpg"
      TARGET="_blank">Kipling Building</A> in Alma Road. Originally
      built for the <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/isc.html" TARGET="_blank">Imperial
      Services College</A> in 1939, the school moved away at the start
      of the war and the War Dept took over the premises, subsequently
      releasing them to Windsor Corporation in 1949. It is here that
      Gordon worked as Deputy and subsequently as Borough Engineer
      until the merger with Maidenhead in 1974. Kipling Building was
      demolished in 1981 to make way for the Rank Hovis McDougall office
      development, later occupied by Reckitt and Coleman and then by
      the The Six Continents Group. Gordon and Mollie moved from Clarence
      Road to a turn of the century house in Alma Road, directly across
      the road from Kipling Building, in 1967.</FONT></P>

      Gordon was the 'Responsible Officer' for a considerable variety
      of projects in the Borough throughout the 50s, 60s and 70s, notably
      the <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/scheme61.html">Civic Trust
      Face Lift of 1961</A>. The were numerous other events, some of
      them with Royal connections, with which Gordon was involved and
      which we will be featuring on this Web Site as the stories are
      completed and illustrated.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon was appointed Borough Engineer in 1966, a
      position he held until RBNW merged with Maidenhead in March 1974
      and he could then retire to a life of local history research,
      family genealogy and taking up the cudgels when the need arose
      for a local campaign or five! It is probably this aspect that
      most Windsorians will remember him for. <BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Details of Gordon Cullingham's various campaigns
      are included on ThamesWeb. There are reference areas for the
      <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/vnsttrt89.html">1989 Vansittart
      Road Open Space</A> and we shall be covering the attempt to turn
      The Bachelors Acre Burial Ground, now a peaceful area to the
      north of the Acre, into a Car Park for The Castle Hotel, a scheme
      that the Friends of The Old Burial Ground successfully scuppered
      after taking their battle as high as Privy Council. There was
      also the shadow cast over the houses in Alma Road, one of which
      was the birthplace of both Sir Sydney Camm, the designer of the
      Hurricane fighter, and <A HREF="../books/camm.html">Fred Camm</A>,
      Editor of the 'Practical' series of magazines. <A HREF="../carpark/index.html">[Alma
      Road Car Park Campaign.]</A><BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;We have also included a history of <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/freeze63.html">The
      Great Freeze of 1963</A>, the story of which Gordon had made
      a start on in the months before he died and <A HREF="../windsor/windsorhistory/rwtm/rwtm_intro.html">The
      Royal Windsor Tapestry Works</A> which was one of his earliest
      projects, completed in 1979, and published originally by The
      Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Gordon also wrote a
      book about Patrick Y Alexander, pioneer aviator, and a </FONT><A

      &nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">Gordon, in his final year, and
      not nearly as strong as he would have liked, continued to campaign
      vigorously from a background of knowledge and experience that
      it will be impossible to replace.<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;In the passing of Gordon Cullingham, Windsor is much
      the poorer. The love of his family, the respect and admiration

      thousands of Windsorians past, present and, I have no doubt,
      in the future, goes with him.<BR>
