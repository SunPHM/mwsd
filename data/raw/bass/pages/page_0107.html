<CENTER>Our bluegrass and folk band was desperately in need of a string bass and a reliable bass player.  However,
both are hard to find!  'Reliable' and 'Bass player' are two words not normally used in the same
sentence (no offense to any bass players out there, but I've had much experience in this...)  And it's rare to find a bass player who owns an acoustic upright bass instead of an electric.</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>So we improvised, and built the washtub bass pictured here.  It cost more than we would have liked
(total cost of about $1.75), but it was an easy 1 hour project. Everyone in all of our families can
play it, kids included, and we often harass listeners to grab the bass and join in.  Anyone can
learn to play it in one minute or less, and no musical knowledge or complicated fingerings are required.</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Materials</B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Washtub</B>--We got better sound quality with a new washtub than with the old rusted one we first
tried, though we sure liked the appearance of the rusty one better.</LI>
<LI><B>Aircraft cable for the string</B>--In doing a net search about washtub basses, the complaint we
most often saw was breaking strings when using normal bass strings. Hence, the aircraft cable. After trying
a couple different diameters of aircraft cable, we found that the thinner cable gave a better tone. Our
current model uses a 3/32 inch cable; one size smaller would probably be about right. The cable is kind of rough on the fingers, so leather gloves or a stick to hit the strings with are highly recommended.</LI>
<LI><B>4 cable clamps</B>--make sure they are right size for the cable you use, and clamp them down VERY
tight or the string will slip. We used 2 cable clamps on each end of the string.</LI>
<LI><B>A Stick</B>--We used a 1 1/4 inch diameter dead aspen stick from the forest since it was already
smooth.</LI>
<LI><B>Soup can lid</B>--This is for a washer underneath where the string connects to the washtub,
so it won't pull through the tub bottom.</LI>
<LI><B>Hose clamp</B>--This serves as a 'capo' for the bass. You can slide it up and down the neck
to change what scale note the 'sweet spot' of the bass is at for playing in different keys. After using the bass
for a few weeks, we found a good spot for the keys we play in and left the clamp there.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Construction</B>
<P>
Drill a hole for the string in one end of the stick, a couple inches from the end.  Pass the string
through the hole, double over, and clamp tightly with 2 hose clamps.  Put the hose clamp around the neck 
and string about 6 inches below the hole.  Drill a hole in the center of the washtub bottom and through
the soup can lid.  Pass the string though both tub and lid, and double clamp the end. Cut about a 1/2 inch deep notch in
the bottom face of the neck so it fits tightly on the bottom rim of the washtub (see the photo at the
top of this page for proper configuration and playing posture).
<P>
We settled upon the length of the neck (66 inches) and string entirely at random.  We fiddled around a bit with
the hose clamp capo and settled on a string length (from hole to hole) of 53 inches as a good happy medium for the keys we usually play in (G, D, C).

<P>
<CENTER>This instrument may have the shortest learning curve of anything other than a kazoo.  All you
need is a good ear and a little bit of stamina--you may work up a sweat while playing, as the higher
the note you want to hit, the harder you have to pull back on the neck and push down with your leg. If
you're getting tired, though, you can always go down instead to get that bass note for the 5 chord in
a song. We seem to get about an octave and half of useful range with our model. We don't mess with the capo now that we found a good length to set it at. There's not all
that much more to say about playing techniques...all kinds of slaps and plucks give unique and
interesting sounds.  The best way to learn is to pick it up and start playing along!</CENTER>
