  <b><i>written by Stefan Konstantopoulos</i></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Recently I was reminded 
  that it doesn't take a bass player to understand that the defining element of 
  a 5-string bass is the character of the low B string. As players discover that 
  most budget 5-string basses employ an inarticulate low B and that even some 
  boutique basses amount to mere eye-candy, viable options appear scarce. However, 
  the disheartened player is encouraged to read on.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> U.S. Masters 
  Guitar Works has been striving to build quality instruments in their Wisconsin 
  shop for the better part of ten years. The two brothers that founded the company 
  have worked hard for the recognition and respect they now enjoy. While a majority 
  of their products carry four figure price tags, the new EP4 and EP5 basses are 
  causing a surge of price-conscious players to take notice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The EP5 (5-string) caught 
  my attention, so I read up on it. I found it hard to believe that a company 
  could offer a respectable bass for less than $1,000. Thus a review was born. 
  I called the company and spoke to one of the founders, Dave Regenberg, who confidently 
  addressed my remaining questions and agreed to send me an EP5.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Right out of the box 
  the craftsmanship commanded my attention.</b> Just about every other bass in 
  this price range is mass-produced in Korea, Mexico, or Japan. I don't have anything 
  against those countries, of course, but seeing a freshly made EP5 reminded me 
  that U.S. made basses consistently set the standard for quality. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>The beautiful woods, 
  hand-rubbed oil finish, and precision fretwork of the EP5 are like that of basses 
  priced two to three times higher.</b> Furthermore, when you consider that standard 
  features include a graphite-reinforced neck with truss rod, Sperzel locking 
  tuners, a custom Kent Armstrong split-coil pickup, an EMG 3 band (boost and 
  cut) preamp, and La Bella strings,<b> this bass is clearly a bargain</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The U.S. Masters patented 
  neck joint is very effective in mechanically coupling the neck to the body and 
  allowing easy access to the highest frets. The headstock positioning further 
  adds to the stability of the neck. Not only is the neck quite rigid, <b>the 
  whole bass has an unusually solid feel</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Inside the control cavity 
  I found the 9V battery wrapped in a small sheet of foam, which is a common way 
  to prevent batteries from rattling around. I noted that the layout on the inside 
  of the cavity was orderly. The copper shielding offers a coverage area of about 
  90%, while the pickup, wiring, pots, and preamp are each fully shielded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">After playing the bass 
  I noted that both the neck and body shape are extremely comfortable. In fact, 
  <b>the neck is one of the best I've ever played</b>. More could be said, however, 
  you may want to see for yourself. I also noticed that the bass is not nearly 
  as heavy as I imagined it would be, so I found it easy to play for extended 
  periods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">I spent more than a few 
  days practicing familiar material on the EP5. It's very playable, versatile, 
  and has good intonation. Further, when they say that it &quot;plays in tune 
  and stays in tune&quot;, they mean it. The tuning would hold quite well over 
  time. This is attributable to the overall stability of the neck and the locking 
  tuners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>The EP5 was compared 
  to three comparably priced 5-string basses, each from a different manufacturer. 
  Not only did the craftsmanship of the EP5 make the other basses look cheap, 
  the B string on the EP5 outperformed those on the other basses.</b> To put this 
  into perspective I also compared the $699 EP5 to a $2,200 5-string from yet 
  another manufacturer. Although it's not exactly a fair comparison, the EP5 held 
  its own. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>To summarize, the U.S. 
  Masters EP5 is a very well built, good sounding, and attractive bass. It's made 
  entirely in the U.S. with high quality materials throughout. The EP5 is also 
  very comfortable to play. The built in 3-band EQ makes it quite versatile for 
  most any playing style. Best of all, U.S. Masters offers outstanding customer 
  support. If you are looking for a quality 5-string bass on a budget, the EP5 
  is the right choice.</b></font></p>
