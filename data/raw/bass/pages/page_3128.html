    naturalsizeflag="3">We have a number of lakes in addition to
    our &quot;home lake&quot; on which we keep boats for our
    guests.</p>
    <p><b><i><u>GOWGANDA LAKE</u></i></b> - Our &quot;Home Lake</p>
    <p>Gowganda Lake is one of the area's largest lakes with some
    35 miles of shoreline to work. The bottom consists of several
    basins. The average depth is approximately 27 feet although
    there area number of holes ranging from 60 feet to 160 feet.
    It is also characterized by a number of shoals, drop offs,
    weed beds and sunken islands. The small townsite of Gowganda
    is located at its northeast tip and the remainder of the lake
    is relatively uninhabited. This lake boasts a variety of fish
    species including Walleye, Pike, Jumbo Perch, Lake Trout, and
    an excellent supply of Small mouth Bass, as we have no closed
    season on Bass and Pike, Bass can be fished as soon as the
    ice is off the lake through to the end of the season. This
    productive Bass fishing area has spawned (excuse the pun) our
    very popular Gowganda Spring Fling Bass Tournament.</p>

    RIVER</u></i></b> - (West branch of the Montreal River)
    /PENASSI LAKE</p>
    <p>Due to its easy access, we do not keep a boat here, but
    many of our guests take one of our boats, or their own boat,
    and enjoy a wilderness trip experience along its miles. As
    well as its frequently viewed wildlife such as moose, bear,
    beaver, the waters yield Walleye, Northern Pike and Small
    Mouth Bass as well as Perch. The river is quite rocky with an
    average of depth of 10- 11 feet, its maximum depth being
    approximately 2 2 feet.</p>
    <p><b><i><u>STUMPY LAKE</u></i></b></p>
    <p><img src="photos/fishing2.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
    width="150" height="218" naturalsizeflag="3">Old
    &quot;Stumpy&quot; is reached by portage from Gowganda Lake
    and is one of the area's renowned Walleye lakes. It is
    man-made by a log dam, is about 3 miles long by 1 mile wide,
    with an average depth of about 10 feet. And it is well-named,
    there being no shortage of stumps and logs to troll around or
    cast into and great weed beds.</p>
    <p><b><i><u>HANGINGSTONE LAKE</u></i></b></p>
    <p>The water from this lake feeds by a waterfall into
    Gowganda Lake and getting to it involves a portage to the top
    of the waterfall. This lake is I mile wide by about 2 miles
    long and right full of feisty Small Mouth Bass. This is a
    great lake for a sunny day and one of the best lakes you can
    find to enjoy with your children.</p>
    <p><b><i><u>OBUSHKON LAKE</u></i></b></p>
    <p><img src="photos/fishing4.jpg" align="left" hspace="0"
    width="150" height="216" naturalsizeflag="3">This lake is
    accessed by driving to Edith Lake, boating cross Edith and
    walking a 150 yard portage. Small Mouth Bass can be caught by
    the falls and along the rocky shoreline; Walleye on the
    shores and dropoffs, or Pike in the river at the end of the
    lake, where you can also boat through a narrow channel into
    Davidson for Pike and Walleye.</p>
    <p><b><i><u>ELK HORN LAKE</u></i></b></p>
    <p>Bass anglers rejoice. The rugged shoreline, rocky shoals
    and many islands of this 3 half mile long by 3/4 mile wide
    lake yields some great Bass. Elkhorn has a maximum depth of
    about 75-80 feet and average depth of about 20 feet.</p>
    <p>FOR LAKE TROUT</p>
    <p>A few of the more remote lakes within driving distance in
    the area offer plentiful lake trout, however the main lake in
    recent years has also been stocked with Lake Trout offering
    opportunity right at your door step.</p>
    <p>These are just some of the lakes you can explore and fish
    in the area, and there are lots more.</p>
