          <p><strong>by Karl Malik</strong></p>          
          <p><img src="images/mexico_bass_fishing1.jpg" width="150" height="225" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Reel Mexican Adventures - Karl Malik">I
            was staring out my office window watching an early-January rain gradually
            change to a wet snow when the phone rang. &quot;Hello,&quot; I answered.
            On the other end my friend <strong>Gary Laden</strong> immediately blurted &quot;Hey,
            you want to go fish for bass in <strong>Mexico</strong> next week?&quot;</p>
          <p> I was taken
            aback momentarily by the abrupt question. I needed to noodle through
            the proposal and its repercussions for a few seconds so I stalled
            by grunting &quot;Ahmmm, well&quot; a couple of times. Anywhere in
            <strong>Mexico</strong> was certainly better than dreary Maryland in January. However,
            there were work obligations, plane fare, and the wrath of my wife
            to consider.</p>
          <p>&quot;Uh, well, I would love to go to <strong>Mexico</strong>, but I don't know if
            I can,&quot; I finally said. &quot;Exactly where would we be fishing?&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>Gary</strong> explained that he was excited because the opportunity just
            came up. The trip was to <strong>Lake Huites, Mexico</strong> and we would be staying
            at <strong>Lake Huites Lodge</strong>. <strong>Lake Huites Lodge</strong> has a great reputation as
            the best facility on <strong>Lake Huites</strong> and <strong>Lake
            Huites</strong> itself has been
            quickly developing a reputation as one of, if not the, best bass
            lakes in <strong>Mexico</strong>.</p>
          <p>Now I was excited. I did a quick check of fares to <strong>Los Mochis,
              Mexico</strong>            on the Internet while we were chatting
              and discovered that even at this late date the price as was very
              reasonable - bordering on cheap.</p>
          <p>&quot;OK, I'm in!&quot; I said. I knew there would be some fall
            out at work and at home, but this was a great opportunity and I was
            betting that the trip would be worth dealing with the repercussions
            later.</p>
          <p><b>Lake Huites Lodge</b></p>
          <p><strong>Lake Huites</strong> located high in the <strong>Sierra
              Madre</strong> mountain range near
            the town of <strong>Choix</strong> in the state of <strong>Sinaloa</strong>. It is an impoundment that
            provides power and irrigation to the surrounding region and is one
            of the most beautiful and remote lakes in all of <strong>Mexico</strong>.</p>
          <p>After flying into <strong>Los Mochis, Mexico</strong> (the closest
            city to <strong>Lake Huites</strong>) in the late afternoon, we were transported several
            hours in a comfortable
            van across flat desert and then into the mountains to <strong>Lake
            Huites Lodge</strong>.</p>
          <p>Upon arrival in the evening, our group was welcomed with cocktails
            and delicious meal. After dinner, <strong>Rene Salazar</strong>, the camp manager
            was making the rounds making sure that we were settled and comfortable.
            The rooms were excellent, but <strong>Gary</strong> and I were curious about the fishing
            that we could expect in the morning. We had been warned before coming
            that recent rains had turned the lake very muddy and the fishing
            had become tough; we were all given the choice to travel or to visit
            another time when the conditions improved.</p>
          <p>&quot;Well, the water is starting to clear at the far end of the
            lake and where feeder creeks enter the canyons,&quot; he said, &quot;but
            the fishing has been tough.&quot; Tough? What exactly did that mean? &quot;The
            last group here only averaged ten to twenty fish each per day and
            the fish size was down to about a three-pound average,&quot; he said
            with a wince.</p>
          <p>Ten to twenty fish per day and the average is 3lbs? Back home that
            would be a banner day, but at <strong>Lake Huites</strong> that is embarrassingly
            slow fishing. In typical conditions one hundred fish days are not
            uncommon on <strong>Lake Huites</strong>. While the fish in the three-pound range
            are most common, many fish are caught each day in the 5- 7-lb range,
            and 8- to 10-lb fish are uncommonly common.</p>
          <p>While we were on the subject, I asked <strong>Rene</strong> about the baits that
            were the best producers. &quot;<strong>Bill Dance Fat Free Shad</strong>,&quot; he
            said without hesitation. I asked if there was anything else that
            was producing. &quot;You'll catch a few fish on almost everything
            you throw, but if you want to catch numbers run from point to point
            and crank a <strong>Fat Free Shad</strong>.&quot;</p>
          <p><b>Fishing Lake Huites</b></p>
          <p>The next morning <strong>Gary</strong> and I were woken by a knock at the door and
            the delivery of coffee to our room-a very pleasant little lagniappe.
            We dressed quickly, ate a hearty breakfast, and rushed down to the
            waiting boats to begin fishing.</p>
          <p><img src="images/mexico_bass_fishing2.jpg" width="150" height="146" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Reel Mexican Adventures _ Largemouth Bass">Our guide had us zipping across the lake before sunrise but a full
            moon over a totally clear sky illuminated the lake as if the sun
            were already up. The air was a little nippy and I hunkered down into
            my coat as I watched the sky turn purple and blue behind the cactus-studded
            mesas as the sun finally began its ascent.</p>
          <p>On
            our way to Huites <strong>Gary</strong> and I made a pact. We wanted
            to catch at least one fish using every common bass-fishing technique
            that we had equipment
            to try. <strong>Spinnerbaits, buzzbaits, Zara Spooks, lipped-crankbaits,
            lipless-crankbaits, worming, flipping Texas-rigged tubes, jigging
            heavy brush, and twitching a Slug-Go</strong> - we were committed
            to figuring out a way to catch fish with everything we had in our
            box.</p>
          <p>Our guide made his first stop in a canyon that snaked to and terminated
            in a wide shallow bay with weeds on the edges and flooded brush.
            It looked like spinnerbait water to us and we hit the water with
            a vigor that is only reproducable in the first few hours of a trip.
            We soon discovered that chartreuse with gold blades was the color
            combination that the fish wanted and took several nice bass. We scratched
            spinnerbaits off our lists and moved on.</p>
          <p>Next we moved on to a large flat that had flooded brush. The tops
            of the dead bushes stuck out of the water several feet and in most
            places the bushes were spaced 16- to 20-feet apart. &quot;This looks
            like worming water to me,&quot; <strong>Gary</strong> said. Not being much of a bass
            angler I had seldom fished a worm and <strong>Gary</strong> promised to demonstrate
            the technique and help me become proficient.</p>
          <p>We were fishing twelve-inch purple <strong>worms</strong> and <strong>Gary</strong> missed several
            short bites. However, after over an hour of fishing we hadn't landed
            a fish. Finally, I decided to go back to using a spinnerbait and
            just as soon as I made my first cast, <strong>Gary</strong> struck hard and was into
            a nice fish. After making a couple of swashbuckling moves to keep
            the fish out of the brush, <strong>Gary</strong> landed a 5-lber.</p>
          <p>&quot;You gave-up too quick,&quot; he said after taking a big self-satisfied
            sniff. I agreed and went back to worm fishing. Within five minutes
            I saw my line move towards the boat and set the hook. Not to be outdone,
            just before I landed my fish, <strong>Gary</strong> nearly fell out of the boat setting
            the hook on yet another fish. Immediately, the fish ran full steam
            towards open water and I could see from the bow in <strong>Gary's</strong> rod there
            was considerable pressure being applied but the fish did not seem
            to be taking much notice. After a battle that lasted several minutes
            and featured a thrilling gill-flaring headshake just out of the water,
            <strong>Gary</strong> finally landed a ten-pound whopper. What a way to start a fishing
            trip! It wasn't even noon of the first day yet and we had already
            boated a ten-pound trophy and a fist full of smaller fish each.</p>
          <p>At <strong>Lake Huites Lodge</strong>, anglers return to camp each day at noontime
            for a cocktail (if you wish) and a leisurely lunch. You then return
            to the water to fish until dark. On our ride back from lunch on the
            first day we saw <strong>Rene </strong>fishing a cove that was formed by a point that
            followed a line perpendicular to a very narrow spot in the canyon.</p>
          <p><img src="images/fat_free_shad.jpg" alt="Bill Dance Fat Free Shad" width="150" height="67" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="1" align="left">As
            we were passing-by <strong>Rene</strong> began waving to us wildly and motioning that
            we should come toward him. As we approached we could hear him yelling, &quot;<strong>Bill
            Dance! Bill Dance!</strong>&quot; <strong>Rene</strong> had found a huge school of fish and
            was hooking up on nearly every cast of a <strong>Fat Free Shad</strong>. <strong>Gary </strong>and
            I grabbed our cranking rods and threw into the cove. As soon as our
            crankbaits dove near the bottom they were inhaled. For the next hour
            we caught fish after fish-nearly on every cast--a true fishing blitz.
            The fish were all cookie cutter replicas, weighing just over 3-lbs.
            What fun! We finally grew board with taking fish on each cast and
            moved on to find some bigger fish that would present a greater challenge.
            It isn't often that you willingly leave fish to find fish.</p>
          <p>The rest of our trip to <strong>Lake Huites</strong> included some fast fishing when
            we would find a roving school holding over a point, interspersed
            with some challenging fishing along banks or flats filled with brush
            and stumps. It was truly great fishing in that for most of the day
            it was just challenging enough to keep us on our toes with steady
            action--and then occasionally a roving school would provide a thrilling
            blitz bite.</p>
          <p><b>Grand Finale</b></p>
          <p>The highlight of our trip occurred in the waning hours of our final
            day. <strong>Gary</strong> and I asked our guide to run-and-gun points. We would approach
            a point, cast a crankbait five or six times each and then move on
            if we did not get a bite.</p>
          <p><img src="images/mexico_bass_fishing3.jpg" width="140" height="260" align="left" hspace="10" alt="Lake Huites Lodge - 14 pound largemouth bass">The
            fourth point that we fished extended from horseshoe shaped island.
            A deep channel separated a high canyon wall from the island on one
            side and the other side of the island opened into a long and wide
            flat that finally dropped off into the deeper part of the lake. The
            wind had kicked up and a strong current was created in the channel.
            After six casts our guide suggested that we move-on but this spot
            looked too good to leave. As we drifted in the current within the
            channel, we suddenly saw bait boiling in the shallower water between
            the arms of the horseshoe. For the next two hours we caught fish
            after fish-nearly on every cast. When the action finally slowed,
            we switched from crankbaits to spinnerbaits and made a circuit around
            the island plucking individual fish from pockets along the island's
            bank. We then returned to the inside portion of the horseshoe and
            discovered that the school had reformed once again and enjoy another
            round of blitz fishing. We finally left the fish at dark still biting.
            Our arms and hands were sore from battling fish and our thumbs raw
            and bleeding from lipping so many fish. It was a perfect end to a
            great trip.</p>
          <p>What of our pact to fish with everything in our tackle box? We nearly
            succeeded. We caught at least one fish on every bait except for some
            odd reason, I was unable to get a bite on a pig-n-jig combination.
            I blew it. As a penalty I am going to force myself to go back to
            <strong>Lake Huites Lodge</strong> later this spring and practice with a jig-and-pig
            combination until I get it right.</p>
