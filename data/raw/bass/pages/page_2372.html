<h3>Current photos of the Lotz bass</h3>

<p>I will be taking some current photos of the Lotz fairly soon...</p>

<h3>Photos from when I accquired the Lotz bass in 1989</h3>

<IMG SRC="photos/scroll.jpg" ALT="Loin head scroll of the Lotz bass.">

<p>
Photo of the Lion head scrol of the Lotz. If you look at the heel, you will notice that there is a small chip missing. When the new fingerboard was installed in 1993 I had that repaired. The tuning gears have an interesting feature: small knobs that can be adjusted by hand instead of needing a screwdriver. I have seen other versions of this head on different basses, so I suspect that it was not carved by Louis Lotz. One of those heads still had the tounge was still intact, whereas on this instrument there is only small stump at the back of the mouth.</p>

<h3>Photos from when the top was taken off</h3>

<p>
Soon after I accquired this instrument I had the top taken off and several issues were dealt with. There are a lot of cleats, but that is typical for an instrument that is over a hundred years old. Most importantly, there are not any bass bar or soundpost cracks, and the general health of the top is pretty good. Some cracks were dealt with, the edges of the top were relined, missing cleats were replaced, and some of the older cleats that were larger were trimmed to help free up the sound.

<p>
Looking towards the endblock. Note the square patch that is larger than the other ones. That was put in to repair a rather awkward crack. This cleat had the effect of stiffening the side which cleared up some of the notes in the lower end. You can also see that some of the patches are whiter than the others. Those were new patches that had just been installed.

Looking towards the neckblock. Here you have a good view of the distictive cleats that were on the Lotz bass with a label... the only time that I have ever seen that on any instrument other than this one.

<p>
Looking at the underside of the top. Note that the soundpost area is in good condition and that there is no soundpost crack.
