CURRENT BASSES-

<A HREF="http://www.aslindane.com/" TARGET="_blank">
ASLIN DANE AMB-200</A> - This is a cheap Music Man copy bass, but it's THE best inexpensive MM ripoff I've ever played.  
The pickup is passive (which I prefer), but to get that MM "active" sound I usually play this bass with my Sadowsky outboard preamp - the combination sounds GREAT!  WOW!  Even without active electronics this bass sounds very good though for popping and slapping as well as fingerstyle or pick playing.  And it PLAYS good, too!  It has the "feel" of a bass that would cost WAY over the $260 I paid for mine (with a gigbag).  If you're looking for a MM style bass and don't want to spend a lot of CASH, this would definitely be my recommendation!  Don't even waste your time looking at "Jay Turser"... (see below)...  They are available at most "Music-Go-Round" stores, at least here in Wisconsin anyway...

I've only had a chance to use it at one show so far, but I like it a lot!  Close string spacing, 2 octave neck, very cool all black look.  I'll play it some more, then post more comments...

<A HREF="http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0196500844" TARGET="_blank">FENDER ROSCOE BECK SIGNATURE 5 STRING</A> 
(3-Color Sunburst) - This is my main bass for use with my band <a href="http://www.roadtripband.com/" TARGET="_blank">
ROAD TRIP</a>, I either use this bass or the Lakland 5 listed below.  I really tend to use whatever one has the newest 
strings or sounds best in the particular setting we're playing in.  No matter what basses I try I always seem to come back 
to Fender.  These basses feel like "home" to me...  The Sunburst bass seems to have a "bassier" tone than the Shoreline Gold model I had from 1997-2001 (see below).  For live shows I plug into a Sadowsky outboard preamp, then right into my Ampeg SVT classic setup.<BR>

1966 FENDER JAZZ BASS</A> - GREAT bass.  I have it modified with a Badass bridge, brass nut, 
and a Fathead.  Vintage 4 string Fenders are still my favorites, especially Jazz basses.  I 
bought this bass in Cudahy, WI from the original owner and it's in great shape.  The only thing
better would be a pre-CBS (1964) Jazz bass.  KILLER sound in the studio.  You just CAN'T go wrong with 
vintage Fender basses - they're fantastic.<BR>

<a href="http://www.hofner.com/" TARGET="_blank">HOFNER 5000/1 DELUXE BEATLE BASS</a> - 
I had the opportunity to go through Boosey & Hawkes in 1999 - they are the North American distributor 
of Hofner Guitars & Basses.  I really like the Deluxe Beatle Bass.  The ebony fingerboard is great and 
this would be an excellent choice for bassists with small hands as well.  Great classic tone with flatwounds!<BR>

<a href="http://www.lakland.com/basses/osborn.htm" TARGET="_blank">LAKLAND JOE OSBORN SIGNATURE 5 STRING: SKYLINE SERIES</a> - Well, in July 2003 I went Lakland crazy and purchased THREE new Skyline series basses, including the JOE OSBORN model.  The US made basses are great, I own a passive 55-63, but I gotta say - for the amount of abuse I put a bass through i'm almost more comfortable playing a Skyline series on stage.  This bass plays GREAT, sounds GREAT - I love it!  AND - Laklands LOOK cool, too (mine is sunburst with a maple neck)!  This bass is passive, a lot like a Fender Jazz bass.  The Fralin Pickups *really* sound good.  All my Skyline basses sound good.  These are VERY nice basses at an extremely fair price, The Skyline Osborn 5 lists for $1499.  $120 extra for the Lakland SKB hardshell case, I got one for all my Skylines - I actually like the SKB cases better than the tweed cases that come with the US models (I always break the latches on the tweed cases).

<A HREF="http://www.lakland.com/basses/scheff.htm" TARGET="_blank">LAKLAND JERRY SCHEFF SIGNATURE 5 STRING: SKYLINE SERIES</A> - This bass immediately became my #1 bass for stage use after the first show I did with it - WOW!  Wow...  It PLAYS great & it SOUNDS *REALLY* good.  I usually don't like active basses all that much, but what I do with this one is run it with the tone controls almost all flat (little extra treble) through my Sadowsky outboard preamp and HO-LY CRAP this bass sounds great!  VERY even sound throughout the neck, even in the 7th fret "D" area of the G string where most passive basses have a bit of a dead spot.  Two Kent Armstrong lipstick tube pickups set in different areas of the bass than most Laklands - they're further apart.  I can't rave enough about this bass... REALLY LOOKS COOL, too - mine is candy apple red with a rosewood neck... I liked this bass so much that I ordered a 55-02 Skyline active 5 as well to compliment it (see above).  GREAT bass, $1599 list.

<A HREF="http://www.modulusguitars.com/v2/products/quantum/index.html" TARGET="_blank">MODULUS QUANTUM 6 TBX NECK-THROUGH W/EMG PICKUPS</A> - 
Well, I owned a Quantum 6 once before that I really liked but it didn't have fret dots.  I started 
playing in 1974 and played Fenders for so long I don't like playing basses without them.  
So I traded my old Modulus on a Curbow 6 which had three great strings, the B, E and A.  Too bad about the D, G and C - 
they just didn't cut through at all (see below).  So I traded it for a neck-through Modulus with FRET MARKERS!  
The Quantum 6 basses are very nice and even, killer B string, this is a GREAT bass!  I almost 
traded it for a couple of Warwicks, but I wound up backing out of the deal - I just COULDN'T get rid of this bass...<BR>

OVATION CELEBRITY CC074 ACOUSTIC BASS</A> - I was looking to get a five string acoustic bass, but I 
got a deal on this bass that I just couldn't pass up. We did an extra set on New Year's Eve 1998  
"unplugged", so it gave me the incentive to finally pick up an acoustic bass.  This is one of the 
least expensive models out there, but seems to be very good quality for what I spent.  List is 
around $800, I got it for less than half that new.  Acoustic basses are a lot of fun to play, I 
really enjoy having one in my collection.  There's more and more high-end acoustic 
basses coming out, if you're looking to spend some serious cash for an acoustic bass the Taylor 
seems to be the most popular model.  List prices from $2750-3000 kept me from seriously looking 
at one, though.  Martin has a very nice one right now, too.  As do several other companies...<BR>

FORMER BASSES-
<P>
ARIA PRO II AVB-40 - 
This bass was extremely light, it had an alder body, a bolt-on maple neck, 24-fret rosewood fingerboard and PJ pickups.  
For a cheap bass it played very well.  I had it set up as a tenor bass (tuned A, D, G, C) to use partly just for fun, and 
also to work on some of Victor Wooten's stuff from the Bass Extremes series.  It's really fun to fool around with this 
tuning, try it whenever you can!  I never used it much and wound up selling it though...<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.curbow.com/" TARGET="_blank">CURBOW INTERNATIONAL PETITE 6-STRING</A> - 
I never really bonded well with my Curbow bass.  I really like the sound from the B, E and A strings.  
The top strings (D, G and C) would just get BURIED, though - they were very weak.  Bartolini pickups... 
I really liked the feel of the neck as well - WIDE fingerboard!  The body shape and the top three 
strings made me trade this in on my current MODULUS six string (see above).

<a href="http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0194260700" TARGET="_blank">
FENDER AMERICAN DELUXE PRECISION BASS 5 STRING</a> - I'm usually not a big 
fan of active electronics, but I really like this bass.  I played it on 1/19/01 at a music store in Wisconsin through an Ampeg SVT Classic head and 4x10 bottom & I DIDN'T want to stop.  I bought this bass on 1/22/01 and had to sell one of my Roscoe Becks to pay for it (see below)...  something I never thought I'd do.  It plays great! The one I bought has a maple neck and sunburst finish - a classic Fender look and feel.  And there ain't NOTHING wrong with that!  Fender's got another winner here!  List price is $1650 - this bass is a STEAL at that price!  Better than many of the higher priced basses I've played.  About a month after purchasing this bass I got a deal on a passive Lakland 5-string (see below) that I couldn't pass up and this bass wound up getting passed on to my stepson (still in the family anyway)...<BR>

FENDER AMERICAN DELUXE JAZZ BASS 5 STRING</A> - 
The deluxe Jazz has a three-band active EQ electronics system.  It's set up
a little closer to a 4 string Jazz bass, but still feels a lot like the
Roscoe Beck.  Both have graphite reinforced necks and Pao Ferro fretboards.
The bridge seems to be a standard Fender bridge with strings through the
body.  The first weekend I used this bass I had more people asking me about my system and 
complimenting my sound and playing than I'd had in the entire year before that.  Coincidence?  
Maybe.  I liked this bass, but wanted a Lakland 55-94 (see below) enough to trade it in on 3/18/99.<BR>

FENDER MARCUS MILLER JAZZ BASS</A> - I really liked this bass the first 
time I played one, it has some features I thought were very good.  You can switch from active to 
passive, a Badass bridge is standard and it has two volume controls as well as a separate bass and 
treble control when using it in the active mode.  They all have maple fretboards.  I got it to use 
mostly for slapping and popping, but I found that I don't like the active sound as much as I had hoped 
I would.  And I got some weird static/electrical noise if I take the pickup cover off.  I traded 
this bass in on my Lakland 55-94 (see below) 3/18/99, which had a much better sound for slapping and popping, 
and could be used at live gigs as well!<BR>

<A HREF="http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0196500844" TARGET="_blank">FENDER ROSCOE BECK SIGNATURE 5 STRING</A> 
(Shoreline Gold Metallic) - 
This was one of my main basses for use with my band <a href="http://www.roadtripband.com/" TARGET="_blank">ROAD TRIP</a>, 
for 4 years (1997-2001).  I need the low B too much to use a 4 string at gigs.  Nice features,
humbucking or single coil pickups, strings through body or bridge, 22 frets, Gotoh bridge.  
Feels like a Fender Jazz.  I think Roscoe Beck basses are the best 
passive five strings I've ever played - I <I>really</I> like them!  I used it one three or four songs 
for our CD <A HREF="http://www.roadtripband.com/cds/cowboys.htm" TARGET="_blank">COWBOYS AND MANIACS</A> 
and almost all of our 2001 release PLEASE DISTURB - it's a good bass for studio use.  VERY nice bass.  I wound up selling 
this bass on 1/30/01 to pay for the purchase of my Fender Deluxe Precision five string.  TOUGH to do!  But I still have 
my other Roscoe Beck and owning two of them seemed redundant...<BR>

FENDER STANDARD JAZZ BASS (Fretless)</A> - It's no secret that I love Fenders, especially Jazz basses.  
I usually wouldn't foray into the world of the Mexican made Fenders, but since I don't often use a 
fretless bass except for noodling around this bass was fine for that.  It was the first fretless I ever owned with the 
fake fret markings - certainly made it easier to stay in tune, especially in the upper registers (where 
I seem to have the most problems).  Very nice bass for $500 list.  I sold this bass on eBay (1/23/01) to help pay for my 
new Fender Deluxe Precision 5 (see above)...<BR>

<a href="http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/Bass/nikkisixxbass.html" TARGET="_blank">GIBSON NIKKI SIXX SIGNATURE BLACKBIRD/THUNDERBIRD BASS</a> - This is a VERY cool bass!  I don't like 97% of the basses made by Gibson but I've always had a soft spot for the Thunderbird bass - it's a GREAT bass for rock & roll!  The Nikki Sixx bass features ONE control - an ON/OFF toggle switch.  That's it!  VERY cool!  Who needs knobs?  It's ALL black and comes with a well made hardshell case that has a cover for the bass when stored with the Thunderbird logo.  Played & sounded great - I got one cheap and sold it on eBay right away but I'd consider owning another one some day! :)

<A HREF="http://www.lakland.com/55-94.htm" TARGET="_blank">LAKLAND CLASSIC 55-94 5 STRING</A> - I traded in two Fenders for this bass (see above).  Laklands are great basses, there are many different settings are 
available through the Bartolini active electronics designed specifically for them.  The feel is very Fender-like.  
This was my main bass for playing with my band <a href="http://www.roadtripband.com/" TARGET="_blank">Road Trip</a>.  
I had Bartolini pickups in it when I got it (3/18/99) and I switched over to Seymour Duncan 
Basslines on 4/15/99.  I liked them better for my style of playing (straight rock, 
no slapping and popping).  I have never liked Bartolini pickups for live gigging - they did 
sound GREAT for slapping, and I used this bass on four of the songs on Road Trip's CD 
<A HREF="http://www.roadtripband.com/cds/cowboys.htm" TARGET="_blank">COWBOYS AND MANIACS</A> 
while the Bartolinis were still in it - the engineer I was working with LOVED the 
sound of it.  I liked the Basslines pickups better for live shows, though.  Laklands are 
very high quality instruments all the way around - they play great & look cool.  And they seem 
to be an excellent company to deal with as well, it's nice to know you can talk with them 
if & when you need to and they'll do whatever they can to help you with problems &/or modifications 
to your instrument.  I had the opportunity to pick up a Warwick Streamer Stage II 5-string on 
6/23/99 and had to trade this bass in on that deal, though.  The Warwick was short-lived (see 
below), and I have since purchased (and sold) a passive 5-string Lakland and I also have a 
Jerry Scheff signature model on order (see above)...

<A HREF="http://www.lakland.com/basses/55-02.htm" TARGET="_blank">LAKLAND SKYLINE 55-02 ACTIVE 5 STRING</A> - I got a chance to play this bass at a store here in Wisconsin and was VERY impressed with the job Lakland did in making an "affordable" version of their 55-94 series basses.  The Skyline series is made in Korea, but it's a HIGH quality instrument.  List on the 55-02 is $1599, they also make a Skyline 55-01 bass that lists at a mere $999!  Holy crap!  The 55-02 really feels, looks and sounds like the 55-94 Classic bass at less than half the price.  If you're a bass player on a budget you GOTTA check these out!  I have a SILVER one with a rosewood neck, I also have Duncan pickups (special order direct from Lakland) instead of the standard Bartolini pickups on mine.  Many people have commented to me how nice this bass sounds out front since I started using it!

LAKLAND CLASSIC 55-63 PASSIVE 5 STRING</A> - I picked this bass up on 2/14/01, the serial number is #6!  Laklands 
PLAY great, they have the Fender "feel" that I like, but I think they actually play better and they're a very high quality 
instrument as well.  This bass has two Duncan Bassline "J" style pickups, a maple neck (Lakland's maple necks KICK ASS!), 
and volume and tone controls that match a Fender Jazz bass.  Great looking and sounding bass & the alder body is a few 
pounds lighter than my Fender Roscoe Beck bass listed above...  As is the case with my Roscoe Beck bass, I run this bass through a Sadowsky outboard preamp then directly into my Ampeg SVT setup for live shows.<BR>

<A HREF="http://www.modulusguitars.com/v2/products/flea/index.html" TARGET="_blank">MODULUS FLEA SIGNATURE 5-STRING</A> - 
I saw this bass on eBay and I just HAD to check it out so I bought it on 7/5/01.  It was unusual because it had a MM/J pickup configuration and was also a custom silver flake color. Modulus doesn't advertise this pickup option and they told me they've only made about 12 Flea's this way.  The pickups and the color made this a ONE OF A KIND bass!  I'm not a big fan of Bartolini pickups OR active electronics, though - so I pulled the active circuitry out and made it a passive bass.  I liked it a LOT better passive (one of our sound companies said it was the best SOUNDING bass I've ever used!).  The string spacing was a little closer than I'd like and the bridge wasn't so great as the low B and E strings were very hard to load through.  Modulus has informed me that they are aware of the problem and will be replacing the current bridge style with a new bridge design by 2002.  As is you can NOT use a tapered B string on this bass.  You also cannot string through the body.  VERY different bass for me.  I didn't own it very long.

MUSIC MAN STINGRAY 5-STRING</a> - I never bonded well with this bass - I only kept it for about two weeks.  I did use it 
on "The Chocolate Song" from ROAD TRIP's 1999 release "COWBOYS AND MANIACS" and it sounded pretty good in the studio.  I 
never got used to playing it live, though.  I guess I like a split pickup design better than just having one pickup.  And 
the strings were spaced pretty close together, too - closer than I'm used to. I think the Stingray basses are better for 
players who do a lot of slapping and popping, this isn't the bass for me...  On the plus side, it is definitely a quality 
instrument and I'd consider getting a Stingray or similar design 4 string to use as a slap/pop bass - GREAT for that!
<P>
REVEREND RUMBLEFISH 5L - I bought this bass off eBay and I liked it a lot, but I already had two other 5-strings that I preferred for live shows (Lakland 55-63 passive and Roscoe Beck 5 listed above) so this bass became expendable rather quickly.  Well made, fairly inexpensive and VERY cool looking basses!  They play nice, too.  My only complaint is that the Rumblefish 5's don't come with single-coil as a pickup option.  If I was going to keep this bass I would've modified it so that one of the switch positions would be single coil instead of neck pickup only.  I believe that the Reverend Brad Houser bass has the single coil pickup option, but I've never seen one to try at all.

This bass was made in March 1997 - I bought it in August of that year and never really used it much.  It wound up with 
my stepson when he started playing bass and that's where it stayed until he got my Fender Deluxe Precision 5 string.  
I've always liked the Rickenbacker look and feel, but since I prefer Fenders & Laklands I sold this bass to help pay 
for my passive Lakland 5-string (see above)!<BR>

<a href="http://www.warwickbass.com/basses/streamer_2.html" TARGET="_blank">WARWICK STREAMER STAGE II 5-STRING</a> - 
Warwick is making some of the BEST bass gear I have ever seen.  
Because their basses usually don't come with fretboard dots I never looked at them seriously, but 
the Streamer Stage II comes with dots as a standard feature (and they're really COOL yin-yang dots 
as well!).  I traded my Lakland 5 string in on this bass, I liked it THAT much.  It played GREAT - 
it made me WANT to play.  The string spacing was a little closer together than I'm used to, 
I guess I prefer a wider spacing even though my hands are small for a bass player.  I liked the sound 
of this bass as well.  Why did I trade it?  A combination of things - I had a problem with it right away, 
liked the sound of the Roscoe Beck basses better than this one, and wanted to get some other things that 
I wound up trading this for.  I traded it on a Roscoe Beck 5, Standard Jazz fretless 4, X-Wire

ARIA PRO AVB-SB-6 STEVE BAILEY SIGNATURE 6 STRING FRETLESS - 
I really like the way this bass looks.  
It's probably not for everyone, but I think they LOOK great.  Too bad that the positive vibes about 
this bass can fade so quickly simply by picking it up.  A $2000 list price for this bass is a joke.  
The tuners suck, it sounds like crap, and the workmanship is nonexistent.  I think a list price of 
$1000 would be closer to reality for this bass.  I wouldn't put MY name on this bass, I can't understand 
why Steve Bailey would want to be associated with this product.  He's one of my FAVORITE players - I 
was so excited when I saw this bass, what a disappointment.  I took it home for the weekend (6/25/99) 
to check it out & I tried eveything I could to make it sound good with very little success.  I wanted a 
fretless bass, but this wasn't it.  I got a Mexican Fender Jazz bass instead...

This bass is great - VERY fun to fool around with!  I have small hands and this bass definitely 
has a WIDE neck, but I still like it a LOT!  If I was doing more solo shows I'd be looking very hard 
at getting one.  $2395 list price is very fair for this instrument - it plays & sounds great!  
Worth checking out whenever the opportunity presents itself!

DEAN JEFF BERLIN SIGNATURE BASS</A> - 
Well, this bass played OK but I wasn't crazy about the overall sound.  No matter what I tried it sounded like Jeff Berlin 
to me (tone-wise anyway).  And although I LOVE his playing I'm not crazy about his tone (for ME).  But if you LOVE his sound 
than this would be the bass for you!  It's got a nice bridge - Leo Quan Badass II - one of my favs.  And two Bartolini 
soap bar pickups.  The action is good - it plays very nice.  Nothing I'd be interested in. though.  The "Bassic" model lists for 
only $499 - pretty good price, might be a nice bass for a 4-stringer on a budget! (no Bartolini's on that model)...

<a href="http://www.fodera.com/" TARGET="_blank">FODERA</a> - Fodera makes a five string Imperial bass that very well 
may be the BEST bass I've ever played, but list prices somewhere between $5,000 - $10,000 have 
kept me from actually purchasing one.  Not because I don't think they're worth it, but coming 
up with that kind of cash can be next to impossible when living on a musician's income...  Their 
other basses are great as well (Monarch, Emporer, Anthony Jackson 6-string, etc...).

I'm NOT a big fan of Ibanez, but I tried this bass at a music store in August 2001 and was TOTALLY impressed with this bass.  
It played and sounded GREAT!  Then I saw that the list price is $799.95!  HOLY CRAP!  The value for the cash paid is TERRIFIC on this bass!  You should be able to buy it new for $560 or less, THAT'S a great deal!  An excellent choice for the bassist with a limited budget!  Nice, quality parts are used including the bridge.  18v active electronics require two 9-volt batteries.  The pickups are passive, though - so it would probably not be hard to switch this to a passive bass if you prefer passive (like me!).

BASS (GWB1NTF)</A> - I've tried theses basses on a couple occasions now and I think they stink.  
I don't like the light weight - it makes it feel like a toy.  I never was able to get a sound that 
I enjoyed from this bass, either.  And the knobs were loose on one of the basses I tried as well, 
overall craftsmanship didn't seem that great.  Way overpriced.  Nossir, don't like it.

This bass is a lot of fun to play!  BIG departure from the norm for Lakland, but it's probably the best hollow body bass I've ever played.  The one I played had flatwounds on it and it played & sounded GREAT!  Don't ALL the Laklands play & sound great?  I haven't played a bad one yet...

<a href="http://www.lakland.com/basses/osborn.htm" TARGET="_blank">LAKLAND JOE OSBORN SIGNATURE BASS</a> - I went to the 
Lakland manufacturing facility to have the pickups switched in my 5-string and was able to try some of the new Joe 
Osborn 4-strings at that time.  I found the Joe Osborn basses to be extremely nice.  They really feel like the pre-CBS 
Fender Jazz basses.  Worth looking into if you ever have the chance!  Try a passive bass with flatwounds... that's what Joe 
uses!  I own a Skyline series 5-string myself (see current basses list above)...

I had the opportunity to play one of these basses recently - you can get either 
4 or 5 string models, the one I played was a five string.  They feature two Kent Armstrong Split-Tube lipstick 
style low output pickups along with Laklands on-board preamp (yep, it's active).  This is one of the best looking, feeling 
and sounding active basses I have ever played, I was TOTALLY impressed with this bass! Check it out if you ever get the chance, it's a really FUN bass to play!  I own a Skyline series 5-string version of this bass (see current basses list above)...

I'm not the best slap/pop player around, but even I sound pretty good on a Flea Signature bass.  
It's a very well made instrument & is fun to play fingerstyle as well as slapping.  I'd probably 
already have one if I did slap more often, it's one of my favorite basses to play in that style.  
I recently tried one side by side with Music Man Stingray and Sterling basses and I MUCH preferred 
the Flea bass - it played and sounded better to me.  List price of $2199 for the 4's seems about right.  
These basses have the tendency to get reamed on in stores, though - 
I've seen several of them in very bad shape for a new bass.  I think every Flea-loving kid who ever 
picked up a bass whacks away on these things and they sometimes get some hard use before they're even 
sold once.  At that price I'd want one in pristine shape...  VERY nice bass...

<a href="http://www.peavey.com/products/shop_online/browse.cfm?action=final&wc=1A1A212&fam=1A31&tcode=2" TARGET="_blank">PEAVEY CIRRUS 5-STRING</a> - I've tried these several times now at the store I deal with and I'm very impressed with the overall quality of these 
basses.  I've tried both the fretted and fretless models and I like the fretless a bit more I guess.  
The fretted models don't come with fretboard dots & Peavey has told me that they can't even be ordered that way - 
which would effectively keep me from buying a fretted model, but I really like the fretless version 
of this bass - it plays & sounds GREAT!  Probably the best instrument I've ever seen put out by Peavey.

Terrible.  Don't waste your time OR money checking this bass out.  VERY cheap MM ripoff.  Get an Aslin Dane instead 
(see above)...

YAMAHA TRBJP JOHN PATITUCCI SIGNATURE MODEL</a> -  I had the opportunity to check out this 
bass at a music store here in Wisconsin and I loved it!  I have small hands for a bass player and 
this bass seems to be designed with "big" hands in mind, but it reminded me of the Yamaha TRB-6P 
I used to own.  I got rid of that bass because I thought Modulus 6-strings had a much better low B.  
I did have a chance to plug this bass in and try it and it seems that the low B "problem" has been 
addressed - sounded good to me!  The strings seemed to maintain a normal 4-string spacing and it 
has an extremely wide neck because of that - might not be the bass for you if you have small hands.  
There are two eq settings that you can set up yourself which is a cool feature (you can set one up 
for finger-style and the other for slapping and go back and forth, there's also a "normal" eq setting 
on the same knob).  Worth looking into either way, though.
