<b>The Roland GR Series Analog Bass and Guitar Synthesizers</b></h2>
<img SRC="GR300.JPG" height=224 width=329>
<p>In the early 1980s Roland Corporation made some of the most innovative
and interesting developments in guitar synth history. A few instruments
were produced that actually combined guitar playing and synthesis in a
fluid and organic manner. Of course this technology was then "improved"
and subsequent interfaces failed to track satisfactorally. It took almost
fifteen years before a truly playable instrument was again produced.
<p>This web page is dedicated to the happy accident of the first and only
fully polyphonic analog guitar synthesizer that actually worked like a
guitar. Other similar products and monophonic guitar synthesizers and processors
may be added as time goes by.

<p><b>The Beginning of it all:</b>
<br>The first Roland guitar synth was the GR500 a Les Paul styled guitar
that hooked up to a traditional type synthesizer complete with sliders,
etc. This unit was monophonic and the 24 pin cable was wired differently
than the next generation of guitar synths.

<p><b>What makes these instruments so special?</b>
<p>There have been dozens of guitar synths and midi interface systems since
the introduction of the early analog synth units. Everything from the Arp
Avatar to the Korg X911 and even to Roland's rack mounted SPV355 pitch
to Voltage unit have sought to bring the world of synthesis to the practicing
guitar player. However most of these early units (and many of the later
ones) all forgot one key element: <i>Guitarists play like guitarists</i>.
<p>Be it due to a result of the available technology or a flat out design
limitation, most guitar synths track poorly at best. Some do not allow
string bending and others mistrigger if you hold a note too long or in
some cases if you don't hold it long enough. This forces the guitarist
to play very slowly and deliberately. Picking must be precise. Strings
must be muted and in the case of held notes if you move your hand while
the note is held even a bit the note will either cut off abruptly or mutate
into a totally wrong note before you can correct the problem. Forget slides,
harmonics, and even sloppy but spirited playing entirely. If you couldn't
play every note clearly and directly you might as well turn the unit off.
<p>Enter the Roland GR300 and GR33b floor units and the GK1 and BK1 pickups.
This unit was the only guitar synth of it's time to track a guitar accurately
and fast enough to let a guitar player concentrate on playing and phrasing
rather than cleanly triggering the module. It also mixed various signals;
clean guitar, processed guitar via the hexfuzz distortion and filter, and
the actaul intenal VCO in the floor unit which could also be set to play
root and harmonic duets.
<p>In effect, the GR300 allowed guitarists to sound like themselves and
also use a guitar synth rather than forcing them to conform to a playing
style the synthesizer wanted to hear. This makes all the difference in
the world to a musician and it is why the GR300 and GR33b are still considered
one of the greatest guitar synths ever manufactured and explains why they
were lauded as the only <i>true</i> guitar synths for guitar players. While
the synthesizer engine is limited due to it's minimal filter and envelope
settings, its clean and fast tracking allowed guitarists of all types to
enjoy what it offered without the headaches other products forced musicians
to accept and deal with.

<p><b>Guitar and Bass Controllers:</b>
<p>One of the things that made the GR300 and GR33b guitar and bass units
so playable and attractive to guitarists was the series of controllers
Roland offered. This was the only time a company sold a variety of guitars
with the electronics inside them so users could pick their favorite instrument
and still have access to any of Roland's floor units.
<p>Controllers include a number of models that were fashioned after popular
guitars by major companies. All actual guitars were manufactured by Hoshino
Inc otherwise known as Ibanez. In fact, the Roland G303 guitar is identical
to a model from the the Ibanez 1981 Artsist series. Both Andy Summers and
Robert Fripp have praised the G303 guitar as a perfect marriage of the
guitar as an instrument mixed with a new world of synthesis
<p>The G202 was a unique blend of a Fender type body with pickguard and
dual humbucking pickups. This was a favorite of Jeff "Skunk" Baxter.
<br>The G303 was a double cutaway glue on neck that was remarkably similar
to playing a Gibson Les Paul.
<br>The G505 was a copy of a Fender telecaster with three single coil pickups.
<br>The G808 was this same basic design as the G303 with a neck through
body.
<p>The G707 was noticibly different from the others as it added a stabilzer
bar running from the top of the neck to the bottom. This was created supposedly
to defeat "dead spots" on the guitar where a neck might not send full tracking
info to the floor unit. Love it or hate it the G707 was a great guitar
in it's own right as well as something that looked like it walked off a
sceince fiction show. Perhaps this is why it was nicknamed the "Dalek's
Handbag".
<p>The G33 and G88 bass contorllers were thick almost Fender P-bass type
necks with an exaggerated double cutaway body. An actual Fender Pbass type
body was also available at one time as well (possibly the B33??)
<br>The G77 was the bass equivilent of the G707 guitar and also had a stabilier
bar. For whatever reason the G707 came in three colors (Silver, Red, and
Black) and the G77 came in Silver, Black, or Cream.

<b>GLITCH!</b></h3>
<b>The next generation of floor units:</b>
<p>After the perfect tracking of the GR300/GR33b series Roland went on
to create new floor units that were a huge leap forward in their synthesis
technology. Unfortunately they also abandoned the tracking system that
made the 300/33b such a useful and playable instrument. These silver monsters
are great synths but the tracking systems inside them is mediocre compared
to the previous generation.
<p>The GR700 Guitar Floor unit (front and Side view):
<br>This was idenitcal to the synth engine in the JX3p keyboard.
<br><img SRC="GR700.JPG" height=198 width=300><img SRC="GR700S.JPG" height=87 width=203>
<p>The GR77b Bass Guitar Floor unit. This was identical to the JX8p Keyboard.
<br><img SRC="GR77.JPG" height=165 width=300>
<p>A few famous users of the GR300/GR700 guitar synthesizers include: Andy
Summers, Jeff Baxter, Pat Methany, John Scofield, Robert Fripp, and Adrian
Belew. All of these players lament the fact that later versions of Roland
guitar synths lost the guitar friendly interface and tracking that existed
with the GR300. Pat Methany still uses his GR300 to this day.
<p>Examples of the GR300 and series in action:
<br>"Don't Stand So Close to Me" - The Police. The break in the song where
the thick arpeggio mutates into a sweeping wash of sound is Andy Summers
switching from processed guitar to the GR300. This is achieved by setting
the VCF attack and decay settings to sweep up and then simply turning on
the unit via the mode switch.
<p>Anything from King Crimson's <i>Discipline</i> album. Both Fripp and
Belew used the Gr300 extensively on these recordings. Robert Fripp used
a G303 controller in concert while Adiran Belew had the electronics from
the G series guitars installed in a custom Fender Jaguar body. Later Crimson
albums such as <i>Three of a Perfect Pair </i>used the GR700 quite a bit
as well.
