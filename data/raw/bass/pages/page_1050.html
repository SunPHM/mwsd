<p align="center">This was my first woodburned guitar. It's a stripped down
Charvel. I woodburned it, put chrome knobs and a new Jackson/Schaller Floyd on
it.</p>
<p align="center">This one I still, and will always, own.</p>

<p align="center">This is the second one I did. It was my friend's bass. It was
some old, ugly-ass junker from the early, early '80s (if not earlier).&nbsp; Trying to get pictures of the bass put back together. It's quite
nice. The Chinese kanji (or whatever the hell the Chinese call it) are the names
of my friend, his wife (now ex-), and two sons. The pagoda is the &quot;Golden
Pagoda&quot; in Japan.</p>

<p align="center">So, here's #3.&nbsp; The guitar player for Esucarys is Steve
Sorrell. Sorrell bought this piece from me about 18 hours after I had posted
pics on his band's forum and mentioned that it was for sale. I didn't really
think anyone was going to shell out several hundred bucks for this, so it was
just mentioned in passing. Sorrell didn't hesitate. Still waiting on pics from
Sorrell of the finished guitar. Bet that's gonna be bad ass!!! The &quot;Dragoncaster&quot;.
I was thinking of calling them Pyrocasters. I dunno....</p>
