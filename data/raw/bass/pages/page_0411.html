<h3><a name="33a"></a>Storey's Cabinet Works,Ramsey.</h3>
<p> In a favourite residential resort like Ramsey, where there is a constant coming 
  and going of visitors, a great amount of wear and tear of household furniture 
  is unavoidable, and the renewals must consequently be a matter of importance 
  to hotel and boarding house proprietors. Ramsey has, besides, a large and refined 
  residential community, whose wants have also to be catered for in the best possible 
  manner.</p>
<p>A very useful and obliging firm, who are well spoken of 
all round Ramsey and district, is that of Mr. William Storey, 
the energetic and up-to-date cabinet maker and upholsterer, of 
Parliament Street, Ramsey. Here, in large, well-lighted showrooms, is displayed a fine collection of useful and ornamental 
household furniture, all well made and finished, and sufficiently 
varied in style to suit the most fastidious tastes. Bedding of 
superior quality, made of selected materials beyond suspicion, 
and of guaranteed sanitary purity, forms a large element in the 
production, his clients including the New Infectious Hospital, 
hotels, and hosts of other residents. Another very prominent 
feature is the display of cosy bedroom suites in a variety of 
styles ; and good, substantial dining-room furniture. Although 
everything partaking of the nature of shoddy is carefully 
excluded from the stock, prices in general rule below the 
average, and are noted for their extreme moderation. Visitors 
to the handsome Mooragh Hydro, which is noted for the 
perfection of its interior arrangements, unanimously admire the 
stately and luxurious furniture of the building, and, when we 
mention that the whole of the equipment, which bears eloquent 
testimony to the skill of the craftsman in the perfection of its 
finished workmanship, was produced by Mr. Storey, any 
further remark would be superfluous, so that our readers will 
do well to bear this firm in mind whenever any new article of 
furniture or any repairs are required.</p>
<h3><a name="33b"></a>R. S. Corlett, Corn Exporter,Ramsey.</h3>
<p>As a grain producing' centre, the fertile land of Mona has become a valuable 
  source of supply to the mainland, hence the exportation of cereals yearly increases 
  in volume, Ramsey being by far the most important port of shipment. Manx wheat 
  and oats are gaining. a high position in the markets of the U.K., whilst the 
  demand for Manx barley has attained extraordinary dimensions, its value for 
  malting purposes being widely recognised. On referring4o statistics, we find 
  that the principal exporter of barley and other grain in Ramsey, and, indeed, 
  on this island, is Mr. R. S. Corlett, whose mill and stores on the West Quay, 
  Ramsey, we recently visited. The barley, as it is brought in by the farmers, 
  is stored on the upper floors of the spacious stores. Passing through ducts, 
  it is led to the excellent screen by Roby & Co., a machine driven by steam, 
  and capable of cleaning and separating all the small grains from the malting 
  barley. After being duly screened, the barley falls into sacks placed under 
  neath the screen. When filled, the sacks are loaded into vessels stationed at 
  the wharf in front of the building, and cargo after cargo are thus promptly 
  despatched to their different destinations ; oats, wheat, etc. being handled 
  with equal facility.</p>
<p>Besides the export trade, there is an immense output of 
feeding stuffs of all kinds, the place being fitted with an 
extensive plant for kibbling, grinding, cruAing, and cleaning 
all kinds of grain, the motive power being supplied by a 
powerful steam engine. Seeds of all kinds, feeding cakes, 
manures, etc., are heavily handled ; whilst, as wool buyer, it 
may truly be said that fully three-fourths of the wool grown 
on the island passes through his hands. Liberal and straightforward in his business transactions, Mr. R. S. Corlett 
enjoys the support of a large clientële in all parts of the 
island. The telegraphic address is, " Sayle Corlett, Ramsey."</p>
<h3><a name="34a"></a>Quine & Son, The Silverdale Corn Mill,Castletown.</h3>
<p>The ancient village of Ballasalla, nestling amongst its verdant woods, with 
  its picturesque old corn-mill fed by the brawling Silverburn, may justly be 
  described as one of the most Arcadian spots on the island. The Silverdale Mill 
  has furnished for generations the surrounding district for miles with grist 
  and flour, its capacity having been largely augmented when it came into the 
  possession, some thirty years ago, of William Quine & Son, by whom it has been 
  fitted with a modern steam plant of effective character. Taking a foremost place 
  amongst native millers, the various commodities supplied by this energetic firm 
  are now widely known. Briefly stated, they consist of household flour, groats, 
  oatmeal, barley meal, pearl barley, maize, and all manner of feeding stuffs. 
  The manufacture of Rolled Oats-the firm's latest productionrepresents an entirely 
  new department in Manx milling, and the firm certainly deserve congratulation 
  in introducing what is bound to become an important industry on the island, 
  where every addition to its industrial resources is so essential to its future 
  well-being. Although of comparatively recent introduction, Manx Flavour Rolled 
  Oats-a wholesome and sustaining article of diet, whether for breakfast or supperhave 
  evidently "caught on" with the general public, and are rapidly being introduced 
  into many of the principal towns of the United Kingdom. A striking success gained 
  in so short a time proves conclusively that Manx oats are fully equal to the 
  best Scotch, and superior to American oats. Probably, one of the principal factors 
  to this success is that the distinctive flavour possessed by Manx oats is, owing 
  to the exceeding care bestowed upon it during the process of preparation, retained 
  in all its fulness.</p>
<p>From personal experience, we may truly say that a daintier dish for delicate 
  digestions does not exist, and that as a delicious, appetising, and sustaining 
  article of food Manx Flavour Rolled Oats will require a lot of beating, as they 
  please the popular palate.</p>
<p>As one of the prominent Manxmen of the day, Mr. William Quine, the principal, 
  is highly respected, having been an active member of the House of Keys for eight 
  years, representing Rushen Sheading ; a guardian of the poor, etc. For z r years 
  he has served on the School Board in the interests of religious equality. A 
  staunch advocate of Temperance, he takes a deep and abiding interest in all 
  social and philanthrophic movements all over the island. The junior partner, 
  Mr. T. F. Quine, has had wide foreign experience, and is the only Manxman, so 
  far, who has successfully passed a searching examination in the science of milling 
  at the City of London Guild School, being also an Associate of the Society of 
  British and Irish Millers. Scientific milling, as practised by Messrs. Quine 
  & Son, of Silverdale, Ballasalla, and Bank Street, Castletown, is, indeed, one 
  of the most beneficial industries which find a home in Mona.</p>
<h3><a name="34b"></a>Billown Lime Works,Castletown.</h3>
<p>Of the mineral wealth of Mona &#151; although Lead is by far the most extensively 
  worked &#151; the carboniferous limestone, which crops up here and there, is 
  perhaps one of the most valuable and, at the same time, one of the most useful 
  resources of the island. The finest deposits are in the southern portion of 
  the island, the largest and most important quarries being situate about a mile 
  north of Castletown. The Billown Lime Works, as they are called, have been worked 
  for many generations by the Moore family, the present proprietor being Mr. Thomas 
  Moore, of Billown. These quarries are noted for producing lime of the greatest 
  tenacity and of most admirable colour, rendering it specially valuable for building 
  purposes and for plastering, for which they are in great demand all over the 
  island. There is also a very large output of lime very suitable for agricultural 
  uses.</p>
<p>In reviewing the mineral resources of the island, special mention must be made 
  of the Billown lime quarries, which, under the energetic and enterprising proprietorship 
  of Mr. Thomas Moore, are capable of turning out lime at the rate of 10,000 tons 
  a year with the present kilns, an amount which can even be exceeded whenever 
  the occasion demands it. Being adjacent to the railway, every facility exists 
  for cheap and rapid transmission, hence a very thriving industry is in full 
  swing at the Billown Lime Works, Castletown.</p>
<h3><a name="35"></a>Mylchreest & Co., Castletown.</h3>
<p>Castletown, the ancient Wholesale Provisions, &c., capital of the island, has 
  never cultivated what may be termed mechanical industries within her borders. 
  On the other hand, however, she has always taken a leading part in distributing 
  the food supplies of the island in the form of groceries, provisions, wines, 
  etc. A widely-known and old-established house, which has always taken a prominent 
  position in the handling of these commodities, is that of Mylchreest & Co., 
  of Malew Street and Market Place. Ever since its inception, in 1848, honest 
  and straightforward methods of doing business &#151; so dear to a Manxman's 
  heart-have prevailed here, with the result that year by year the most gratifying 
  progress has been made, so that at the present day it is generally conceded 
  in trade circles that the firm of Mylchreest & Co. hold a very high position 
  in the trade. As one of the largest buyers on the island, they certainly hold 
  a command of the market, which enables them to treat their customers with liberality, 
  and to hold their own against any competitor whatever. Being the finest business 
  establishment in Castletown, Mylchreest & Co.'s handsome retail department arrests 
  the attention of all passers along quaint Malew Street. The contents of the 
  ample show windows indicate the nature of the internal arrangements of the place, 
  for here is always a tempting display of choice groceries, Italian goods, and 
  the thousand and one appetising dainties which can only be obtained in a high-class 
  establishment. As skilful blenders of tea (taking the water of each district 
  supplied into consideration), Mylchreest & Co. have a very high reputation; 
  and for fine coffees fear no rival on the island. As wine and spirit merchants, 
  guaranteeing the purity and genuineness of all they supply, their trade is consequently 
  very large. Passing through the great storage warehouse in the Market Place 
  (formerly the Barracks), we find that the requirements of the agricultural community 
  receive every attention, judging from the great piles of provender and feeding 
  stuffs of all kinds that are held here. Dark would be the lot of farmers and 
  villagers in places where gas is unknown without a few cheerful lamps, so Mylchreest 
  & Co. again step in with their selection of safe burning oils, such as " White 
  Rose," " Royal Daylight," and other noted brands. Passing the coffee-roasting 
  and grinding, fruit cleaning, and bottling machinery, we come across the firm's 
  electrical installation, the only one of the kind out of Douglas, we believe. 
  The dynamo is of great power, being used for lighting not only the warehouse, 
  but the whole of the Malew Street premises, and is driven by a Crossley's 6-h.p. 
  gas engine.</p>
<p>On every hand, in fact, we find evidence of enterprise on the part of the two 
  present principals, Messrs. Richard Cain and William Duggan, by whom the business 
  has been conducted since the retirement of its honoured founder (J. Mylchreest, 
  M.H.K.) with conspicuous ability and energy. The telephone number of the firm 
  is 5, Castletown, and of the branch establishment, No. 12, Port St. Mary.</p>
<h3><a name="36a"></a>John E. Crellin, Miller, Mullin-e-Clie,St. John's.</h3>
<p>Nestling under the giant sides of Slieau-wallian (the mountain of the whelp), 
  in the historic vicinity of the Tynwald Hill, at St. John's, is one of the most 
  active little grist mills in the island. This mill has lately come into the 
  hands of an enterprising proprietor, Mr John E. Crellin, who seems determined 
  to leave no stone unturned in order to secure his proper place amongst Manx 
  millers. We question if a better equipped mill exists in the interior of the 
  island, both as regards plant and power, the latter being derived from a constant 
  stream from Foxdale, which drives a large overshot wheel, from which as much 
  as 20-horse power is frequently derived. True, the old mill has been extended 
  from time to time and partly re-built; so it is now in first-rate going order, 
  and though it presents an unimposing exterior, its great capacity for work is 
  proved by the variety and extensiveness of its productions. Indeed, for good, 
  sound household flour and properly prepared oatmeal, the Mullin-e-Clie has gained 
  a reputation unsurpassed by any grist mill on the island. The production of 
  high-class and reliable feeding stuffs for horses, cattle, dogs, and poultry 
  is made a special feature here, many 'improved modes of preparation having been 
  introduced by Mr. Keig, the active manager, a practical miller possessed of 
  a wide experience gained in some of the largest mills in England and America. 
  Hence it will be easily understood that the supply of these valuable feeding 
  stuffs is by no means confined to the immediate district, supplies being sent 
  in daily increasing quantities to Peel, Castletown, Ramsey, Douglas, and other 
  parts of the island. We may say that the business of the Mullin-e-Clie is carried 
  on straightforwardly, with pluck, enterprise, and ability; hence we can only 
  forecast for it a future of increasing usefulness and prosperity.</p>
<h3><a name="36b"></a>J. T. Cowell, Stock and Share Broker,Douglas.</h3>
<p>During the nineteenth century the financial world has seen many innovations, 
  by far the most f a r reaching of all being the introduction of the Limited 
  Liability system, to which we owe the great amalgamations, combinatidns, and 
  flotations of vast industries and commercial enterprises which now benefit the 
  world, owing to the favourable facilities they present for the profitable investment 
  of capital. There are, indeed, no movements of modern times better calculated 
  to secure the greatest good of the greatest number than the limited liability 
  movement, by means of which so many thousands of large and small capitalists 
  are enabled to participate in the prosperity of the period. Mercantile Manxland 
  has not been slow to take advantage of the system, as is witnessed by the number 
  of flourishing companies on the island, operating in shipping, banking, brewing, 
  trading, gas, water, rails, mines, trams, ferries, hotels, and pleasure: resorts, 
  etc.</p>
<p>Naturally there is a very active business conducted in stocks, shares, debentures, 
  and other securities, and in connection with these operations no name stood 
  higher in the public esteem than that of the late George Atkins, of Athol Street, 
  Douglas. As the leading stock and share broker of the island, he enjoyed the 
  confidence and the valuable patronage of the most influential members of the 
  community for over thirty years; and in Mr. J. T. Cowell, M.H.K., J.P., he has 
  a worthy successor, who, armed with keenness, shrewdness, and a widespread knowledge 
  of the business and an unimpeachable reputation for probity, is well calculated 
  to sustain the high reputation of the firm for upright and straightforward methods 
  of business. Mr. Cowell is in connection with the National Telephone, No. 109 
  ; the telegraphic address being, " Investment, Douglas."</p>
<h3><a name="37a"></a>Spence Brothers, Cabinet Makers,Douglas.</h3>
<p>Although, perhaps, most widely known as the premier health resort of the kingdom, 
  Douglas, the modern capital of the Isle of Man, is also a very active business 
  centre, wherein are focussed the principal industrial enterprises of the island.</p>
<p>Amongst these, the domestic art of cabinet-making is by no means neglected, 
  as will be found on visiting the factory of Messrs. Spence Brothers, of Athol 
  Street, Douglas, the largest manufacturers on the island. Viewing the fine equipment 
  of the various workshops, and examining the quality and condition of all materials 
  employed, we are not surprised that Spence Brothers should be regarded as facile 
  princeps in the trade. At the time of our visit we found many fine pieces of 
  work in hand, including some handsome bedroom and dining suites, and we were 
  particularly struck with the stately massiveness of a lofty sideboard and other 
  articles of furniture which, we were informed, were part of a contract for the 
  furnishing of the new Town Hall and Free Library of Douglas. Upholsterers were 
  busy on easy chairs and the most luxurious Chesterfields, some of them covered 
  in very elegant fabrics. In a busy place like Douglas, where there is, during 
  the season, a constant influx and eflux of visitors, the wear and tear is enormous, 
  as would be apparent to anyone passing through the repairing, upholstering, 
  and polishing rooms. Bedding, of course, forms a large portion of the output, 
  the valuable reputation of the firm for using only the purest materials attracting 
  a large amount of support from all who value sanitary bedding.</p>
<p>It will easily be seen from the foregoing, that here every requirement for 
  furnishing will be not only available, but obtainable on the most moderate terms, 
  owing to the facilities the firm enjoy on account of the extensiveness of their 
  operations. All over the island Spence Brothers have the reputation of being 
  the principal directors of funerals at moderate rates, and we have the highest 
  testimony as to their reverent and careful methods, and their thoughtful regard 
  for the feelings of all concerned.</p>
<p>We may not close this review without a brief notice of the department devoted 
  to Antiques of all kinds, in which the senior member of the firm, Mr. J. J. 
  Spence, is acknowledged as an expert and virtuoso. Visiting and resident connoisseurs 
  should not fail to examine the superb collection Mr. Spence has on hand, and, 
  being in touch with the best sources of supply, he can furnish all that is desired 
  at short notice. The telephone number, we may add, is 119.</p>
<h3><a name="37b"></a>Nicholson Bros., Decorators,Douglas. </h3>
<p>The marked improvements to he noted in recent years in every branch of decorative 
  art are strikingly evidenced to the most casual observer by a comparison with 
  the older styles yet in existence with which the artistic tastes of bygone generations 
  were satis fied. The distinguished position which the firm of <a href="../../people/artists/jnichol.htm">Nicholson 
  Brothers </a>have gained throughout Douglas and district may be attributed to 
  the success with which they have, from time to time, introduced such innovations 
  in interior decorative styles, and improvements in the treatment of exteriors, 
  as place them in the front rank of modern decorators.</p>
<h3><a name="37c"></a>Albert Kitto, Ship-Broker, etc.,Ramsey.</h3>
<p>Owing to the extent of her import trade in coal, timber, etc., and her valuable 
  export trade in cereals, lead ore, and other native produce, Ramsey is Justly 
  regarded as the chief shipping port of the island. To all requiring the services 
  of a thoroughly reliable ship or insurance broker in the port of Ramsey, we 
  can suggest nothing better than to write or wire to " Kitto, Ramsey, Man."</p>
<h3><a name="38"></a>Heron &amp; Brearley, Limited, Wines &amp; Spirits,Douglas.</h3>
<p>Whilst crossing over from the mainland in the luxurious steamers of the I.O.M.S.P. 
  Co., or in their hotels and lodginghouses, and at the various pleasure resorts 
  of Mona, we question if there be even a tithe of the hundreds of thousands of 
  visitors who annually flock to the Isle of the Sea who have not, at one time 
  or another, become familiarised with certain receptacles of liquid refreshments 
  -bottles, to wit-bearing the red triangle of Bass or the harp of Guinness, and 
  the name " Heron and Brearley, Ld."</p>
<p align="center"><img src="bass.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="bass labels"></p>
<p>A famous old firm is this, dating back over half a century, their name being 
  always associated with reliability and genuineness in all the articles they 
  supply. At the Castle Mona and Royal Stores, the firm's ale and stout bottling 
  departments, we see how studiously they cater for the general public, in the 
  strict cleanliness with which all bottling is conducted, and the care with which 
  the ales of Bass and the extra stout of Guinness are brought to perfectly fine 
  condition before being bottled, and how carefully they are stored until thoroughly 
  matured. Throughout the year the lofty bottling rooms, sweet with the breezes 
  that blow in from the sea, present a lively sight, as, seated on convenient 
  benches, the corkers, with their patent machines, rapidly apply the conserving 
  cork ; the bottling lads being kept quite busy, often wishing it were six o'clock 
  before dinner-time comes round. The question of corks is rather important, as 
  bottled ale drinkers all know the nuisance arising from the use of rotten, cheap 
  corks ; hence Heron and Brearley, as behoves the premier bottlers on the island, 
  always make a point of employing the most carefully-selected kinds.</p>
<p>We may mention, en Passant, that this firm are sole contractors for the catering 
  on the I.O.M.S.P. Co.'s fleet of steamers, this department being under the personal 
  supervision of one of the directors, Mr. J. Ritchie, jun., whose fame as a caterer 
  is unsurpassed. The better to meet their growing requirements, a new department 
  has during the last few months been added to the firm's extensive business in 
  the shape of a mineral water factory with up-todate equipment.</p>
<p>As for wines and spirits, the firm, being one of the oldest houses in the trade, 
  possess undoubtedly one of the finest selections of fullymatured Scotch Whiskys 
  on the island, as connoisseurs who have tested their A. Usher's famous O.V.G., 
  or Special Reserve, will freely admit. If a "drop of the crathur" be preferred, 
  the stock includes some very fine "John Jameson " and other leading makes; so 
  that here every palate has the chance of being suited. It is hardly necessary 
  to say of an old firm like this, that they are holders of many fine old wines, 
  vintage ports, and champagnes ; still they are alive to the advantages and requirements 
  of the present time, and are in a position to supply the lower-priced light 
  wines now so much in vogue, including a very fine range of selected Australian 
  and Californian wines of all the leading brands. A full list of all the sole 
  agencies held by this firm, and of their various specialities, will be found 
  on the cover.</p>
<p>The high position in the trade held by Heron & Brearley is, 
doubtless, the result of many years' honourable trading, and 
of late years great extensions have become necessary, to 
facilitate which the firm has been converted into a flourishing 
limited company, with a powerful and experienced directorate, 
which consists of Mr. J. C. Brearley, Mr. W. J. Kelly, Mr. 
J. M. Cubbon, Mr. J. Ritchie, jun., with Mr. Henry Brearley, 
T.C., as managing director.</p>
<p>Dealing honourably and generously with their numerous clients throughout the 
  island, and guaranteeing the genuineness of everything they supply, it is not 
  surprising that the firm of Heron and Brearley, Limited, daily increases in 
  popularity. Visitors and new residents who have not been supplied with the firm's 
  latest price list will find it to their advantage both in health and pocket&#151; 
  to make application at either of the offices of the firm at Castle Mona Stores, 
  28, Castle Street (T.N., 63) ; or the Royal Stores, as, Drumgold Street (T.N., 
  17). Telegrams, " Heron, Douglas."</p>
<h3><a name="39"></a>Kissack Brothers, Builders, &amp;c., Crosby.</h3>
<p>One of the most prominent and enterprising business firms operating in the 
  interior of the Island is that of Kissack Brothers, of Crosby. This business 
  is, we believe, one of the oldest established on the Island. Steadily advancing 
  year by year, opening new departments, and growing, as it were, with the district 
  it serves, we find it one of the most comprehensive or all-round businesses 
  with which we have come in contact during our survey of mercantile Manxland. 
  Here we find in active operation an extensive building and joinering, sawmilling, 
  wheelwrighting, blacksmithing, painting and decorating, farriering and corn 
  crushing industry, all carefully calculated to meet the varied demands of the 
  agricultural and residential community, not only in the immediate district, 
  but in distant parts of the Island. The firm, we are pleased to note, received 
  , a very favourable mention at the late Agricultural Exhibition held in the 
  Nunnery Grounds, Douglas, for their fine display of practical and advanced wheelwrighting 
  in the form of lurries, carts, and trucks, built to the order of the St. Helen's 
  Colliery Co., for their new depõt in Douglas.</p>
<p>Many of our readers will no doubt have in remembrance various statements which 
  were made at the recent meeting of the Industrial Commission in Douglas. Great 
  stress was laid on the growing necessity for more poultry raising and egg producing 
  on the Island. Truer words were never spoken, these paying businesses being 
  shamefully neglected here ; for in most cases there is not the slightest provision 
  made for the dry and warm housing of fowls, without which it is impossible to 
  breed successfully and profitably. This is a matter which can very soon be remedied, 
  for Kissack Brothers, who are nothing if not enterprising, are now arranging 
  for the production of safe, warm, dry poultry houses, built on the latest scientific 
  lines, and of varying capacity to suit individual requirements. Particulars, 
  plans, and estimates of these will be sent on application, the number of fowls 
  requiring accommodation being stated in each case.</p>
<p>We may add that, when the hand of death is heavy, Kissack 
Brothers step in, supplying every requirement without that fuss 
and bother which is so distressing in times of bereavement, 
making themselves useful in this as in every other branch 
of their business, which is conducted on straightforward and 
honourable lines, and is a credit to the two active principals, 
Messrs. William Louis Kissack and John Wilfred Kissack.</p>
<h3><a name="40a"></a>Archer, Evans, & Co.,Silk Mercers Douglas.</h3>
<p>The comprehensive character of the business and the immense stock of up-to-date 
  goods, which is always displayed, can only be realised by a visit to Archer 
  and Evans' fine establishment, which always presents a busy, lively aspect, 
  particularly in the season, when Victoria Street becomes the most crowded and 
  fashionable shopping resort in the island. The dress and mantle departments 
  are great features here, whilst in the millinery and ladies' outfitting departments 
  there is always a smart and wondrous display of stylish goods, so graded as 
  to suit all pockets, so that visitors of all ranks may be sure of finding all 
  their wants most studiously catered for at the old establishment of Archer, 
  Evans, & Co.</p>
<h3><a name="40b"></a>The Baby-CarriageDepot.</h3>
<p>The wonderful strides which have been made in every branch of domestic industry 
  during the last half century are noticeable on every hand, and in no industry 
  is this improvement more manifested than in that of the making of baby-carriages. 
  Reflecting on the crudeness of the ancient go-cart and such like, we wonder 
  what our forefathers would have thought of the luxurious and elegant little 
  vehicles in which our babies are so cosily transported now-a-days. The greatest 
  credit is, indeed, due to the principal makers of these useful little domestic 
  accessories. In the whole of the Island we could not find a more charming or 
  a more thoughtful assortment than is to be seen daily at Collister's Bassinette 
  Bazaar, at No. 30, Finch Road, Douglas. It is a place well known to hundreds 
  of mothers resident on the island, for has it not supplied them with the best 
  of baby-carriages for nearly thirty years ?</p>
<p>So long as the human race continues bassinettes of some sort or another will 
  be required; but, judging from a glance round Collister's show-room, it will 
  be indeed difficult to improve on the models at present, in vogue, for here 
  may be found bassinettes in all the most fashionable colours and materials, 
  all rubber-tyred and built on scientific lines, and as they are produced at 
  prices to suit all pockets, the workingman's baby has as good a chance of having 
  a straight, welldeveloped spine as the son of the merchant prince. Now-a-days, 
  when mailcarts are used for the daily "airing " of our babies, Collister's show 
  of well-appointed vehicles-ranging in price from half-a-guinea up to six guineas-has 
  only to be seen to be appreciated, and the same remark applies to the display 
  of toy-bassinettes, mailcarts, and bicycles, which are calculated to give such 
  wholesome exercise to their happy recipients. Rich uncles, and fathers, and 
  godmothers, please take note, and let the lisped words, " Tank Oo," be an overflowing 
  reward. Needless to add, the ease and comfort of invalids are ever first considerations 
  with Mr. Collister, who regularly supplies, at lowest rates, any desired form 
  of Merlin, Bath, or Invalid Chairs or other appliances. An active and most useful 
  department is carried on at 27 and 29, Finch Road-opposite the show-room-and 
  here all kinds of repairs are efficiently and promptly executed, and a well-patronised 
  hiring department conducted, mainly for the convenience of visitors.</p>
<h3><a name="40c"></a>Webb's Counters and Public Lounge, Douglas.</h3>
<p>are the useful ornamental souvenirs of the Island exposed for sale at that 
  popular resort known as Webb's Public Lounge,. (vhich is undoubtedly the finest 
  establishment in Strand Street, Douglas. In the season, and all the year round, 
  the place attracts all who desire to make presentations of all kinds, for where,
