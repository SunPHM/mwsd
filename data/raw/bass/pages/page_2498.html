	<b>issouri Valley Guide Service</b>
	is nestled in the scenic rolling hills of south central South Dakota along the beautiful Missouri River.&nbsp;
	This area of the Missouri River is home to some of the best fishing and hunting in the United States.  There
	are hundreds of	shoreline miles for your hunting and fishing enjoyment.&nbsp;
	Missouri Valley Guide Service offers light tackle fishing for trophy Walleye, Largemouth and Small mouth Bass on rivers and lakes in
	south central South Dakota.&nbsp; 
	<br><br>
	&quot;For the past 12 years I have been fishing the Missouri River and other	area lakes, and I will
	make it a point to go the extra mile to make your trip memorable, enjoyable, and successful.&nbsp; Check
	out the packages listed below, or I can customize a trip for you.&nbsp;  Spring, summer, or fall, there
	is always great fishing on the Missouri River.&quot;

	<h1><i>Walleye Fishing</i></h1>
	Our outings can be tailored to the novice or experienced fisherman, and our packages can accommodate
	businesses or family outings.&nbsp; Our Walleye trips take place on Lake Francis Case above the Fort Randall
	Dam in Pickstown, South Dakota.&nbsp; Lake Francis Case is well known for being one of the best Walleye
	fishing areas in the United States.&nbsp;
	<br><br>
	A South Dakota fishing license is required.&nbsp; Visit the South Dakota

	<p>If you are heading to the Black Hills for a family vacation, think about spending a few days fishing
	on your way there.  Also ask about our &quot;corporate package&quot; and consider making us a part of your next business trip.&nbsp;
	We'll pick you up at your place of lodging.

	<p>Our Bass trips can be custom designed to fulfill your desires.&nbsp;
	If you are looking for a fight, Lake Francis Case above the Fort Randall Dam is known to be
	one	of the best areas for producing Trophy Small Mouth bass in  the central United States.&nbsp;  It is not uncommon to have a 50+ day
	from early March to July.&nbsp;
	<p>If you want to go for quality, Roosevelt Lake outside Gregory, SD has a couple of 7 pounders waiting to be
	landed or the Missouri River has some big ones waiting too.&nbsp; 
	If you want to go for a consistent Large Mouth population, there are a lot of area Lakes where it is not unusual
	to have a 50+ day ranging from 1 to 3 pounds with an occasional 5 pounder.

	<p>
		We have prime deer hunting land available for your next whitetail deer or mule deer
		hunting trip.  South Dakota has little public hunting ground and it can be hard for
		a non-resident to gain access to the &quot;good&quot; ground.  We have taken care of that for
		you. We have sought out and acquired some of the very best hunting ground in our part
		of the state.
		<br><br>
		We have several large tracts of land that allow us to have an impact on the management of the deer.
		If you have always dreamed of having a place to yourself, your dreams have come true.
