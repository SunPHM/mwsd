          <p><b>TACKLE TIPS FOR LAKE HUITES' LUNKER BASS</b></p>          
          <p><strong><img src="images/mexican_bass1.jpg" alt="Lake Huites Lodge Largemouth Bass" width="125" height="186" hspace="10" align="left">Lake Huites</strong> is about as close to the mythical &quot;dream bass lake&quot; as
            you'll ever experience. This lake affords anglers the opportunity
            to use a variety of lures and fishing techniques. </p>
          <p>If topwater fishing is your forte, you'll find excellent surface
            action during most of the fishing season at <strong>Huites</strong>. And many of the
            fish that explode on surface lures are true trophy bass. If you're
            a spinnerbait afficionado, there are plenty of prime pieces of cover
            for you to probe on this bass factory. Perhaps deep crankbaiting
            is more to your liking. You'll find no better crankbait fishery in
            the world than <strong>Huites</strong>. Maybe it's bumping a worm across a point that's
            your preferred method for tempting lunker bass. <strong>Huites</strong> has been described
            as a worm angler's dream lake. So, as you can clearly see, <strong>Lake
            Huites</strong>            will offer you tremendous opportunities for you to practice your
            tried and true fishing techniques, as well as develop new techniques,
            because one thing is for certain - you'll have plenty of rod bending
            and drag screeching action! </p>
          <p><b>Topwater Techniques</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/mexican_bass2.jpg" alt="Lake Huites Lodge Largemouth Bass" width="124" height="139" hspace="10" align="left">The visual image of enticing a huge bass to take a lure on the surface
            is one of the most exciting and challenging methods of fishing on
            Huites. However, whether it's <strong>Lake Huites</strong> in <strong>Mexico</strong> you are fishing,
            or a bass lake in Connecticut, the fact is that bass do not feed
            on the surface all day long. Anglers, therefore, must recognize when
            conditions are favorable to practice this method of fishing. In general,
            early morning hours, late afternoon hours and during periods of cloud
            cover find bass most susceptible to a topwater assault at <strong>Huites</strong>.
            Typically, when the sun is high overhead and the temperature is hot
            and sultry, <strong>Huites</strong> bass prefer the comfort of deeper water, so it
            would be foolish to fish topwater baits under these conditions when
            other patterns would be so much more productive. </p>
          <p>Although a bass might hit a topwater lure in just about any location
            you cast it, there are certain high percentage areas that will increase
            your odds of tempting more bass on <strong>Huites</strong>. Concentrate your efforts
            in windblown pockets and coves, standing timber, shoreline brush,
            points and stumps. Bass tend to use cover and structure (such as
            brush, stumps, points or standing timber) as ambush points. It is
            always wise to either cast as close to these forms of cover and structure
            as possible, or, alternatively, actually cast beyond them and work
            the topwater baits right up to them, almost attempting to glance
            the cover with your baits.</p>
          <p>In some instances, the bass on <strong>Huites</strong> prefer a slow, deliberate
            retrieve of topwater lures, while other moments find them desiring
            a lure that is aggressively worked across the surface. Let the fish
            tell you how to present your baits. The guides will also be helpful
            in this regard as well.</p>
          <p> <b>Buzzbaits</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/buzzbait_5.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on buzzbaits" width="150" height="72" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left"><strong>Buzzbaits</strong>            are basically a lure comprised of a durable wire frame and plastic
            or rubber skirted material. It possesses a propeller that rotates
            around the wire shaft and creates much surface commotion. Bass experts
            simply cannot equate a buzzbait to anything in nature, however they
            all agree that it is a bait that tends to attract a big fish. <strong>Buzzbaits</strong>            can be worked very fast and aggressively across the surface or, alternatively,
            you can slow the bait down during your retrieve and raise your rod
            tip to work them just fast enough to keep the prop turning and the
            bait on the surface. <strong>Huites</strong> bass will take them either way, so use
            varying retrieves until the bass tell you how they want the <strong>buzzbait</strong>            presented. </p>
          <p><img src="images/buzzbait_6.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass - buzzbait skirts" width="200" height="96" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Typically,
            anglers will use a rod from 6 to 6-1/2 feet long and of medium/heavy
            action. A slightly flexible tip will allow the bass to engulf the
            buzzbait before your rapid hook set causes you to pull it out of
            its mouth. A fast retrieve reel will allow you to work them more
            effectively. Because you will typically be working these baits around
            thicker cover and because bass tend to hit them very aggressively,
            consider using line ranging from 17 to 20 lbs. </p>
          <p>When possible, try to cast the <strong>buzzbait</strong> beyond the cover, such as
            a stump or brushpile, then work the bait up to the cover and actually
            try to glance off the cover with the bait. This caroming action off
            the cover will often trigger a strike. When a fish strikes your bait,
            try to resist the tendency to immediately set the hook. Although
            easier said than done, wait to feel the weight of the fish before
            setting the hook. Work the bait all the way back to the boat as,
            in many cases, a fish may follow it from the cover and then strike
            it just feet from the boat. If you are generating strikes, but missing
            fish, consider adding a trailer or &quot;stinger&quot; hook that
            extends out beyond the regular hook. In some instances, the <strong>buzzbait</strong>            is made more enticing by adding a large grub, plastic twin-tail or
            lizard as a trailer. </p>
          <p><b>Walking Baits</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/spook.jpg" alt="Mexican  Bass on Walking Baits" width="200" height="67" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Many
            believe that <strong>walking baits</strong> are the most underutilized baits in the
            arsenal of the bass angler. These baits typically require the most
            work (not strength) in terms of getting the best action, and anglers,
            typically novice ones, shy away from them because of this. These
            types of lures are extremely effective when you impart the famous <strong>&quot;walk
            the dog&quot;</strong> retrieve, basically a coordinated series of wrist snaps
            that cause the bait to zigzag across the water and resembles an injured
            or disoriented baitfish . The gold standard of walking baits is the
            <strong>Zara Spook</strong>, although others are very productive as well, such as
            the <strong>Gilmore Oddball</strong> and <strong>MirroLure Top Dog</strong>. The key to these lures
            is that they emit a lot of action, but stay in the strike zone for
            long periods of time. Cast these lures beyond the target or over
            a point and &quot;walk the dog&quot; so that you allow the lure to
            almost come in contact with cover. </p>
          <p> <b>Poppers</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/poppers_c.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on poppers" width="150" height="90" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left"><strong>Huites' </strong>bass have a strong affinity to slam popping plugs. These concave
            mouthed lures bite the water and then spit or push it forward, creating
            a tantalizing sound and site similar to bass feeding on the surface.
            These lures, such as the <strong>Rebel Pop-R, Storm Chug Bug, Gilmore
            Hoodler, Mann's Chug-N-Spit</strong> and <strong>Yo-Zuri Popper</strong>, come in an array of sizes
            and colors and you will need to experiment to see which they prefer.
            These baits can be worked very slow and deliberate, or can be worked
            fast and erratic. As with all baits, let the fish tell you if they
            want it fast or deliberate. Again, these baits are most effective
            when casted beyond cover or structure and retrieved very close to
            the cover. </p>
          <p><b>Propeller Ripping Baits</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/propellor_1.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on propellor baits" width="150" height="50" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">These
            plastic or wooden lures have rotating propellers that allow you to
            rip the baits across the surface and displace water and create visible
            and audible commotion. These baits are best used when the fish are
            really aggressive and attacking topwater lures with a fury. Some
            of the very best on <strong>Huites</strong> include the <strong>Gilmore
            Jumper, Gilmore Go Getter, Hedden Baby Torpedo, Smithwick Devil's
            Horse</strong> and &frac12;-ounce
            <strong>Luhr-Jensen Wood Chopper</strong>. When bass do not seem to be aggressively
            chasing baits, these prop lures are best worked slow and deliberate,
            allowing a pause between each twitch of the wrist to move these baits.
            When the fish are chasing bait, you can work them more aggressively
            with a faster ripping cadence. In some instances, props on the nose
            and tail end of the baits produce better, while other situations
            finding that bass only prefer baits with props in their tail section. </p>

          <p><img src="images/soft_plastic_jekbaits.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on soft plastic jerkbaits" width="129" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Popular
            baits like the <strong>Lunker City Slug-Go, Bass Assassin Shad Assassin</strong> and
            <strong>Zoom Fluke</strong>, as well as other variations of this lure, can best be
            described as soft plastic jerk baits. These baits are most noted
            for their ability to entice shallow oriented bass, or those feeding
            or schooling near the surface. </p>
          <p>&quot;Baits like the <strong>Slug-Go</strong> are so effective because
            of their unpredictable or random action,&quot; points out professional
            guide <strong>Dave
            Masterson</strong>,
            a frequent visitor to <strong>Huites</strong>. &quot;This is one
            of the primary reasons why they consistently catch fish when other
            lures fail to do so.
            Most of the wood or hard plastic baits we use are very mechanical
            in their action, certainly the opposite of the hapless, erratic action
            that one observes of an injured or fleeing baitfish. When bass are
            actively feeding, just about any lure will tempt them. However, when
            they are negative or neutral, I want a bait that offers a more realistic
            action. That's when I turn to a soft plastic jerk bait like the <strong>Slug-Go</strong>.&quot; </p>
          <p>Very few baits come in such an outrageous array of colors as the
            soft plastic jerk baits. These bright colors do not appear to repulse
            fish and serve the purpose of allowing anglers to carefully observe
            the baits during a retrieve. In clear water, many anglers, however,
            do prefer natural shad type colors. In off colored water, anglers
            might want to consider a bright color such as merthiolate, hot pink
            or highway stripe yellow. </p>
          <p>&quot;I believe that the key to the success of these soft plastic
            jerk baits,&quot; offers <strong>Dave Masterson</strong>, &quot;is that they can be
            worked across the surface, or allowed to descend or suspend a foot
            or two below the surface, a depth where may shallow water oriented
            bass tend to cruise, especially during the spring and fall months. &quot;On
            many occasions, I have observed bass honing in on a floating hard
            plastic or wood topwater bait, only to nudge it, but never aggressively
            strike it. For some reason, bass can be hesitant about breaking the
            surface to strike a floating bait. When working the soft plastic
            jerk baits you can alter your speed or retrieval depth to reflect
            the mood of the fish.&quot; </p>
          <p>The most common retrieve is to keep the rod tip pointing towards
            the water. This serves to keep the line out of the wind and allows
            you to work the bait unimpeded by slack line. Use six inch sharp
            snaps of the wrists to retrieve the bait. When the fish are aggressively
            attacking the bait on or near the surface, you'll be astonished of
            how many strikes you'll observe, so keep the bait within site during
            the entire retrieve.</p>
          <p> &quot;Initially, try letting the baits flip across the surface
            like a wounded shad,&quot; says <strong>Dave Masterson</strong>, &quot;especially
            if you are fishing a school of feeding bass or shad fleeing at the
            surface. If the fish are hesitant about taking the bait on the surface,
            work it about one to three feet deep, a depth where you can still
            visualize the bait. I find this to be the most effective retrieve
            and depth range. I don't do anything fancy, I just snap the wrist
            and pause, snap the wrist and pause. The only real alteration is
            the speed in which I retrieve the bait. Sometimes they want to chase
            it, other times call for you to work it slowly, literally tantalizing
            the fish with the erratic action.&quot; </p>
          <p>When initially learning how to fish floating unweighted worms, such
            as the <strong>Zoom Trick Worm</strong>, it probably is best to rig it <strong>Texas
            style</strong>.
            As one becomes proficient with the floating worm, you may want to
            experiment with various rigging modifications, including fishing
            it wacky style by hooking it through the egg sac or center of the
            worm. </p>
          <p><img src="images/plastic_worms.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on soft plastic worms" width="225" height="40" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">&quot;I
            always recommend fishing the floating worm on spinning gear,&quot; says
            <strong>Dave Masterson</strong>. &quot;It will afford you greater distances on the
            cast, so you can avoid spooking shallow fish. According to <strong>Masterson</strong>,
            probably the number one problem novice anglers have when working
            floating worms is that they set the hook as soon a they feel the
            strike or see the fish take the baits. He advises hesitating a few
            seconds to allow the fish to inhale the bait and start swimming away
            with it. </p>
          <p>If the fish are deeper, you may elect to fish the stern weighted
            hooks from <strong>Mustad</strong> or the <strong>Lunker City </strong>insert weights. The inserts
            are either pierced across the body of the bait and then clipped so
            that no portion of the insert remains outside the baits or inserted
            near the bend of the hook to make them stern weighted.</p>
          <p><b>Subsurface Techniques</b></p>
          <p><b>Plastic Worms and Lizards</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/plastic_worms_3.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on soft plastic worms" width="150" height="128" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Probably
            no other lure has been responsible for landing as many <strong>Mexican</strong> bass
            as the <strong>plastic worm</strong>. It is probably so productive because it can
            probe the mid to deep water haunts of <strong>Huites' </strong>bass more efficiently
            than just about any other lure. The most popular and productive way
            to rig worms for the bass of <strong>Huites</strong> is via the <strong>Texas
            rig</strong> method.
            The <strong>Texas rig</strong> allows you to fish the worm in a weedless manner, as
            the hook point is not exposed to snag into various forms of cover,
            but rather is buried into the body of the worm. When fishing shallow
            water and thicker cover, worms in the five to seven inch category
            are most effective, as they will not tend to get hung up in the cover
            as longer versions. When fishing shallow water, consider a pegged
            slip sinker that is between 1/8 and &frac14;-ounce in weight. Pegging
            will not allow the worm to be disassociated from the weight and will
            make it more streamlined when going through cover like brush or trees. </p>
          <p>One of the best methods for catching a true <strong>Huites</strong> trophy bass is
            to fish plastic worms within and across deep structure, such as humps,
            points, old road beds and submerged standing timber. For this deep
            structure approach, consider using plastic worms from 7 to 11 inches
            in length and up the weight of your slip sinker to between &frac14; and &frac12; ounce
            so that you can effectively feel the worm and weight carom across
            the bottom. </p>
          <p><img src="images/lizard_2.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on plastic lizards" width="150" height="56" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left"><strong>Plastic
            lizards</strong> are also very appealing to <strong>Huites'</strong> bass. The <strong>lizard</strong> offers
            the same  lifelike action of a <strong>plastic worm</strong>, however
            might have a slightly larger profile. The <strong>lizard</strong> is rigged in the
            same manner as the <strong>plastic worm</strong>. </p>
          <p>When <strong>worm</strong> fishing, consider rods from 6-1/2 to 7 feet in length.
            Rely on line weight between 14 and 20 lbs. Keep in mind that deep
            <strong>Huites</strong> bass have an affinity to head for cover once hooked on a <strong>plastic
            worm</strong>, so you've got to really horse them once hooked. The heavier
            line will allow you to do so more efficiently. Productive colors
            of <strong>worms</strong> and <strong>lizards</strong> on <strong>Huites</strong> include: pumpkinseed, pumpkinseed
            with chartreuse tail, Tequila Sunrise, grape, red shad and blue shad.
            Of course, always consider fishing the style and color worms you
            have confidence in as the bass on <strong>Huites</strong> are not very finicky.</p>
          <p><b>Crankbaits</b></p>
          <p><strong>Crankbaits</strong> are basically wood or hard plastic fish
            imitating treble hook laden lures. They are usually categorized into
            three depth ranges
            - shallow, medium and deep. Typically, shallow running <strong>crankbaits</strong>            possess
            either no lip or a small one. The deeper running lures tend to be
            heavier, with elongated lips. <strong>Crankbaits</strong> are a must
            for any angler visiting <strong>Huites</strong>, especially if he or she is in search
            of
            a trophy bass. </p>
          <p> <b>Lipless Crankbaits</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/lipless_crankbaits_3.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on lipless crankbaits" width="150" height="80" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">For
            simply fancasting the water and attempting to locate fish, few lures
            will produce as well as the <strong>lipless crankbait</strong>, basically a moulded
            plastic crankbait that has an internal sound chamber with shot or
            BB's to produce an attracting rattling noise on the retrieve. These
            baits produce a tight wobble and can be casted great distances. Although
            anglers have had very good success using a yo-yo (rise-and-fall)
            retrieve, the majority of these anglers cast these lures and retrieve
            them straight back to the boat using a medium to fast retrieve. Very
            effective <strong>lipless crankbaits</strong> include the <strong>Bill
            Lewis Rat-L-Trap, Cordell Hot Spot</strong> and <strong>Rapala Rattlin'
            Rap</strong>. The &frac12;-ounce size range seems
            to work best on <strong>Huites</strong>. </p>
          <p> <b>Lipped Crankbaits</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/crankbaits_1.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on crankbaits" width="150" height="67" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">You
            should rely on a <strong>lipped crankbait</strong> when you want to get lures to deeper
            water, say from 6 to 20 feet or when you want the lure to carom off
            submerged objects with less chance of getting hung up. Cast shallow
            running crankbaits to banks, shallow points and ridges. Don't be
            afraid to cast near cover, but not directly into it. Bring an array
            of shallow oriented baits such as the <strong>Rapala Shad Rap, Bill
            Dance Fat Free Shad</strong> in the 2 inch, 3/8-ounce size, <strong>Bomber
            model 6A and 7A</strong>, <strong>Bill Norman Deep Little N </strong>and <strong>Rapala
            Fat Raps</strong>.</p>
          <p><img src="images/fat_free_shad.jpg" alt="Bill Dance Fat Free Shad" width="150" height="67" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Without
            question, the most popular, as well as most productive, medium to
            deep running crankbait on <strong>Huites</strong> is the <strong>Bill
            Dance Fat Free Shad</strong>.
            Although <strong>Huites'</strong> bass will take other large crankbait offerings,
            the <strong>Fat Free Shad</strong> continues to outcatch anything else. Two must sizes
            of this bait to bring on your trip to <strong>Huites</strong> are the 2-1/2 inch, &frac12;-ounce
            model and the 3-inch, &frac34;-ounce model. Must colors include the
            threadfin shad, pearl white, pearl body with red back, firetiger,
            citrus shad and blue shad. Fish these baits on ridges, bars, points
            and humps. A medium to fast retrieve seems to be the most productive
            method to entice <strong>Huites'</strong> bass. <strong>Huites</strong> bass tend to school, so if
            you land a lunker fish on a deep diving <strong>crankbait</strong>, keep these fish &quot;hot&quot; and
            active by continuing to saturate the water with these baits. These
            baits will trigger a bite unlike any other lure on <strong>Huites</strong>. </p>
          <p><b>Spinnerbaits</b></p>
          <p><img src="images/buzzbaits_2.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on spinnerbaits" width="148" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left"><strong>Spinnerbaits</strong>            are extremely effective lures, as they can be fished in a variety
            of ways. They basically resemble a safety pin in design. A lead head
            of varying weight is combined with a wire framework, sharp hook and
            one or more flashing spinner blades which may range from an oval
            shape to a long slender willowleaf shape. A soft-rubber, plastic,
            silicone or &quot;lumaflex&quot; skirt is added to cover the hook
            and to add color and bulk to entice bass. </p>
          <p>A few basic rules apply when fishing <strong>spinnerbaits</strong>, however these
            are not set in stone and a savvy angler will let the fish dictate
            what bait to use and not simply follow the guidelines set down by
            other anglers. In general, however, you should consider a white or
            baitfish colored skirted <strong>spinnerbait</strong> in clear water. In off colored
            or dingy water, consider a chartreuse or dark colored skirted <strong>spinnerbait</strong>.
            If you are fishing in clear water, the flash of a <strong>spinnerbait</strong> is
            more important then when you are fishing in dingy water (where sound
            and vibration might be more important), so consider a bait that offers
            willowleaf blades. These blades are known for their flash. In off-colored
            water, consider a <strong>Colorado</strong> or <strong>Indiana</strong> blade, as they give off more
            vibration. In clearer water, you should initially try chrome, gold
            or white colored <strong>spinnerbait</strong> blades, while in off-colored water,
            consider chartreuse, gold, black or copper colored blades. </p>
          <p><img src="images/spinnerbaits_4.jpg" alt="Mexican Bass on spinnerbaits" width="150" height="114" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="1" align="left">Because
            <strong>Huites</strong> is such a deep lake, consider a heavier headed <strong>spinnerbait</strong>            (at least a half ounce), so that you can get the baits down quicker
            to cover that might be in 3 to 5 feet of water. You don't necessarily
            have to use a super-large bodied bait, just a heavier head. Bring
            a selection of <strong>spinnerbaits</strong> ranging from &frac14; to &frac34; ounces
            and with a variety of colored skirts and blades and with a good selection
            of the various shapes of blades. Experiment with single bladed <strong>spinnerbaits</strong>            as well as tandem bladed baits.</p>
          <p>When fishing shallow water cover, cast past the cover and work the
            <strong>spinnerbait</strong> up to the cover and bump it before continuing the retrieve.
            You may want to also consider &quot;killing&quot; the bait after
            it bumps the objects before continuing the retrieve. In deeper water,
            consider using single bladed baits and use a yo-yo or rise and fall
            retrieve or a slow crawl retrieve. If the fish are not holding tight
            to shallow water cover, consider backing out and working the <strong>spinnerbait </strong>around submerged cover in 4 to 8 feet of water. The fish will let
            you now just how fast to retrieve these baits and whether they want
            a steady or stop and start retrieve. </p>
          <p>Consider using a rod that has a flexible tip, as too many anglers
            using stout worm type rods and do not give the fish a chance to inhale
            the bait before setting the hook and pulling it away from them. Typically,
            with <strong>spinnerbaits</strong>, you should rely on line ranging from 14 to 25
            lb test on <strong>Huites</strong>. </p>
