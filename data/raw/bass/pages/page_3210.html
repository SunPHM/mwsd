                            through the &quot;Official World Fresh Water Angling Records&quot; booklet, I noted that most of the Suwannee bass line classes were vacant without a single 
                            qualifying fish.&nbsp; The fish is endemic to the north central part of Florida, near where I lived at the time, so I was somewhat familiar with tactics to catch the Suwannee 
                            bass.&nbsp; Careful planning was all that was needed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The booklet also reveals information on how to establish a record catch.&nbsp; Line class divisions for each 
                            species were outlined and vary according to the maximum size of a particular species.&nbsp; For example, more divisions are set up for the flathead catfish than 
                            for a bluegill.&nbsp; Since the line classes for the Suwannee bass were open, I spooled five different reels with eligible line weights in two-pound increments from 6 to 14 pound test.&nbsp; The same type of 
                            monofilament was used for consistency of breaking strength.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rare bass does not grow much larger than a couple of pounds, and the all-tackle record at the 
                            time was only 3 1/2 pounds, smaller than the bluegill, crappie and redear sunfish all-tackle records.&nbsp; I had caught specimens of the bass up to almost two pounds, so I was optimistic about establishing a record.<BR>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my first record-hunting trip to the Suwannee watershed, a friend and I had about five hours of 
                            fishing.&nbsp; We selected crankbaits that were painted to resemble crayfish, the little bass' predominate forage.&nbsp; We chose to fish the lower 30-mile stretch of the Santa Fe River that joins the Suwannee just 
                            south of Branford, Florida.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoals of exposed irregular limestone are common on the Santa Fe, and those areas are where 
                            the Suwannee bass congregate.&nbsp; Elsewhere along the river, largemouth frequent lily pads, fallen trees and mud banks off the current.&nbsp; The river is influenced by several springs, including the Ichetucknee 
                            River, a crystal-clear run popular among snorkelers and inner tube drifters.&nbsp; The Santa Fe, though, is tannic-stained over most of its 70-mile length.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I launched my boat about 7 a.m. that morning, and my partner and I began casting the crankbaits around all limestone outcropping.&nbsp; We caught and released two 
                            largemouth bass before fooling a small Suwannee bass that would not make one pound.&nbsp; The rocky shoals took their toll on our lures.&nbsp; With a strong current pushing us along, hang-ups were all too frequent.<BR>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend was the first to connect with a record fish.&nbsp; The 1 1/2 pound Suwannee grabbed the crankbait and was soon resting in my live well.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later, my crayfish 
                            imitation hooked another Suwannee, this one later weighing 1.3 pounds.&nbsp; Both fish were taken to the local grocery store 
                            and weighed on certified scales.&nbsp; Record forms were filled out, according to the instructions, and the line sample and applications mailed to the Hall the next day.<BR>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About four weeks later, we were notified of our fishes' acceptance in the record books.&nbsp; Mine was 
                            short-lived, but my friend's mark lasted almost two years before it was broken.&nbsp; I took another friend about three months after setting those records, and she set a line-class mark for the Suwannee bass 
                            with another that weighed 1-pound, 4-ounces.&nbsp; All three fish were caught on different weights of line.<BR>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing which outfit has which line strength is vital to setting a record, as I learned during a later 
                            trip to the Suwannee River.&nbsp; I had launched my boat at Branford and was making a few casts near the ramp while waiting for a photographer from National Geographic Traveler to join me for an 
                            exploratory/photo trip on the river.&nbsp; My fifth cast with a crayfish-colored crankbait was jolted by a Suwannee bass.<BR>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I carefully fought the fish to the boat on my 12-pound test line and quickly realized it was my 
                            largest Suwannee ever.&nbsp; I emptied out my cooler, filled it with river water and the fish and I headed for the local grocery, about a block away.&nbsp; I had my record application along and got the signatures and 
                            certified weight needed for submitting it to the Hall.&nbsp; The 2-pound, 10-ounce Suwannee bass was a monster.<BR>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one problem when I got back home with the fish and application.&nbsp; I checked the 
                            Official Records booklet and found that the all-tackle record was caught on 12-pound test.&nbsp; My fish would not qualify in that line class.&nbsp; My mistake in using 12-pound test that day was a major one.&nbsp; 
                            That fish would have netted me another record in any other line category!<P><B>Limestone Spring Belt</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                            exist on land areas that were once covered by the ocean.&nbsp; In this region of northern Florida and southern Georgia, deposits are very near the surface and both springs and sinkholes are numerous in many locations.
                            <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many springs are sources of large, navigable rivers, with mouths often 100 feet across.&nbsp; Thousands of lesser springs and sinkholes are also found in most of the river systems.&nbsp; 
                            The &quot;belt&quot; is bounded on the north by Valdosta and Waycross, Georgia, and on the east by the St. Johns River.&nbsp; The range extends westward through the panhandle and 
                            south almost to Orlando.&nbsp; The territory includes several watersheds where the fishing can be exciting.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 20 Florida springs in the &quot;belt&quot; area discharge 
                            at least 65 million gallons of water daily.&nbsp; The springs erupt from ground water through the lime deposits.&nbsp; As limestone is washed away, cavities are formed 
                            through the soil, resulting in the development of runs and sinkholes.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinkholes are formed as the water is 'sucked' into the earth.&nbsp; When surface water trickles down 
                            through a thin crust of lime to a cavity below, the structure weakens and a cave-in results.&nbsp; The underground water action, formed when a head of pressure builds and pushes water to the surface, 
                            gives birth to 'runs.'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most spring runs in the region contain largemouth bass of up to 12 pounds, and many other 
                            springs yield particularly impressive specimens as well.&nbsp; The largemouth record for each of the Homosassa and the Withlacoochee rivers exceeds 18 pounds.&nbsp; Bass weighing 15 pounds have been 
                            caught from the Oklawaha, Crystal, Apalachicola, Econfina and Hillsborough Rivers in this limestone spring 'bass belt.'&nbsp; These rivers are well known for their fishing opportunities, but they are just a few of 
                            the many waterways spawned from the spring/sinkhole network in Florida's limestone base.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Okeefenokee Swamp, just north of the Florida line, is the headwaters for the Suwannee and 
                            St. Mary's Rivers.&nbsp; The scenic 630-square-mile tangle of vegetation and twisting tributaries provides excellent angling for medium-size bass in its numerous 'deep holes.'&nbsp; The bass fishing here, like on so 
                            many of the spring-influenced waters, is generally neglected.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the small town of Fargo, GA, the Suwannee River stretches south for 100 miles.&nbsp; Twisting, 
                            quiet swamp water changing occasionally to white-water shoals above the Florida town of Branford makes its personality and bass fishing opportunities interesting.&nbsp; Its lower reaches are placid and 
                            picturesque with many limestone springs lying back from its banks.&nbsp; Excellent bass angling exists from the Gulf northward, and while spring water areas are incredibly clear, the better fishing is found in 
                            the tannic acid stained water.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Santa Fe River joins the Suwannee 10 miles below Branford and is navigable for seven or eight 
                            miles upstream.&nbsp; Above that, travel is dependent on high water, as rapids and shoals are numerous.&nbsp; The beautiful Santa Fe River offers excellent angling for largemouth and for the tough-fighting Suwannee bass.
