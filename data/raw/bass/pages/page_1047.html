This is the Limited Edition Fender Sting Signature P-Bass Reissue. It is
modeled after Fender's '51 Precision Bass. It is in pristine condition and
includes Fender '51 Precision Bass Reissue chrome pickup and bridge covers.
These covers are very difficult to find and provide a more accurate look
of a bass from this era.

In keeping with it's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first Precision
Bass in 1951, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) will honor the
musical accomplishments of two artists and their very distictive instruments
with Signature Models. This summer, FMIC announces the introduction of the
Sting Signature Precision Bass. &nbsp;For fans of Sting, one of the world's
most visible bass playing front men, the image of his 1953 P-Bass is one
that transcends a musical career of more than 25 years - from The Police
to very illustrious solo career. The new Sting Signature Model is a faithful
recreation of that 1953 P-Bass. Manufactured at Fender Japan, the Sting Signature
Model features a lightweight, contoured ash body with a single-ply white
pickguard. The maple neck has a fretboard radius of 7.5" and features
Sting's signature in a block inlay on the 12th fret. There is one vintage
single coil design pickup, with one volume and one tone control. Completing
the look and feel of Sting's own bass are the vintage two saddle bridge and
two-color Sunburst finish. US MS Retail Price is $849.99.
