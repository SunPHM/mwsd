<p><font color="#663300"><font size=+1>The Smallmouth Bass, a member of
what is called the "black Bass" group of fishes, is widely recognized as
one of the hardest-fighting of all sportfish.&nbsp; Smallies are found
primarily in rivers and streams in the Midwest, exceptions being the BWCAW
lakes and the huge expanse of Lake Michigan.&nbsp; Lake-dwelling bronzebacks
tend to be found over deep structure (mid-lake humps, rock bars, etc.),
and the electronics and gear associated with this type of fishing doesn't
typify our definition of Roughfishing.&nbsp; Therefore, I will discuss
the smallie in the environs in which he is best pursued, in the ever-moving,
ever-changing waters of streams and rivers.&nbsp; The typical smallmouth
stream is slightly different than a trout stream, although populations
do coexist in some fisheries.&nbsp; Smallies need clean, oxygenated water
but tolerate warmer sections in order to take advantage of larger and more
abundant forage such as chubs and crayfish.&nbsp; "Marginal" brown trout
water is often suited nicely for a population of smallmouths.&nbsp; Whatever
waters they occupy, they seek out areas of rock and rubble.&nbsp; An area
with fist to head-sized rock interspersed with stretches of gravel is going
to be a prime area for both numbers of bass and also large fish.&nbsp;
Like trout, smallies tend to be just out of the main current, like in the
eyes or current seams on either side of a hole's tongue.&nbsp; Any large
boulder or stump that breaks the current will hold fish, behind the obstruction
where a pocket of dead water exists, and also in front of the boulder where
the current has scoured a depression which acts as the perfect ambush spot
for a bass to utilize.&nbsp; They will be found in these faster-water stretches
throughout the warmer months, where they key in on hatching caddis or mayflies.&nbsp;
However, large deep pools are always worth a good working over as large
bass may be cruising the depths terrorizing baitfish.&nbsp; A lot of anglers
target only pools, though, so learning to take fish from faster water will
put you on less-pressured, more opportunistic feeders.&nbsp; Larger rivers
are more difficult to read, but where a small stream may hold only a few
fish over 15" in several miles, a big river may hold a dozen or more trophy
bass on a single structure.&nbsp; Look for the same type of current breaks
and obstructions as on a small stream, on a grander scale, but put emphasis
on the shoreline. Most of my success in big rivers comes less than 5 feet
from shore, or rock points a bit farther out.&nbsp; Riprap is a goldmine,
especially below a dam.&nbsp; Smallies will charge into schools of minnows
here, sending them flying through the air. I've often waited for a few
anglers to fish a stretch of riprap, then followed them and taken a dozen
or more nice smallies.&nbsp; They cast far out into the river, oblivious
to the hungry smallies right under thier feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these
spots see a lot of pressure, but if you sneak up the bank and present a
subtle fly or lure at specific spots, fish are always to be had. You'll
get some jealous glances from unsuccessful anglers as you release bass
after trophy bass while they break off on another snag.&nbsp; I may be
a bit biased, but to me a flyrod is the ultimate way to present a bait
to river smallmouths.&nbsp; Your flies can be designed to stay on the bottom
yet out of the snags associated with good smallie water, and you can effectively
imitate various forage types with only your flyrod and a small box of flies.&nbsp;
Before you begin fishing, find out what forage is available to the bass.&nbsp;
You may take a few steps into the stream and see crayfish or sculpins fleeing
from under your feet.&nbsp; Shiners may be seen leaping from the water,
with the occasional swirl from a bruiser Bronzeback.&nbsp; Maybe a hatch
of dark hendricksons is in progress, and you can be sure rare sport is
to be had if you can effectively imitate the natural.&nbsp; Target the
eyes and tongue of the pools, boulders and logs that obstuct flow, and
sections of riffles that are home to aquatic insects in thier nymphal or
adult forms.&nbsp; Along with the enormous variety of these aquatic insects,
fly selection should include deep clouser minnows and mid-water streamers
imitative of natural baitfish, some type of crayfish-imitating flies, and
a few poppers or deer-hair bugs for topwater action.&nbsp; This selection
will catch smallies anywhere in the midwest.&nbsp; Lures for spinning tackle
would include spinners, jigs and minnow-imitating crankbaits.&nbsp; Use
a light enough rod and line to be able to cast light lures and control
them in the current.&nbsp; A topwater of some sort should also be in your
arsenal. Giant spinnerbaits, cranks and jerkbaits are more suited for Largemouths
and will reduce your catch rate for smallies.&nbsp; We often catch smallmouths
incidentally while targeting redhorse or mooneyes with nightcrawlers.&nbsp;
They are often deeply hooked, as bass tend to inhale thier prey. If you
must fish for smallies with live bait, please consider using circle hooks
to reduce fish mortality.</font></font>
