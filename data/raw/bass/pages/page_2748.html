      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="../Fishes/other.html">butterfly peacock</a> (also 
      called peacock bass) is an extremely popular freshwater game fish 
      introduced to south Florida in 1984. It is readily caught by bank and 
      boat anglers using a wide variety of tackle and bait that ranges from 
      live shiners to artificial lures and flies. Butterfly peacock prefer 
      live fish and fish-imitating baits often used by largemouth bass 
      anglers, but they rarely hit plastic worms commonly used to catch 
      largemouth bass. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Fishing is typically good throughout the year; however, most 
      butterfly peacock heavier than four pounds are caught between 
      February and May.&nbsp; Shaded areas provided by bridges, culverts and 
      other structures generally are productive fishing spots, along with 
      fallen trees, canal ends, bends and intersections. Nearly all 
      butterfly peacock are caught during daylight hours. <br>
      <p>
      <img border="0" src="../images/butterfly-tackle.jpg" 
      alt="light spinning tackle with a shiner works well." align="right" width="300" height="244">&nbsp;&nbsp; The easiest way to catch butterfly peacock is by using live 
      bait. A favorite choice is a small golden shiner about three inches 
      in length, referred to locally as a “peacock shiner.” These can be 
      fished below a float or free-lined while either casting or 
      slow-trolling with an electric motor along canal edges. A small split 
      shot weight may be required to fish the shiner at the proper depth.
      <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Topwater lures (with and without propellers), minnow-imitating 
      crankbaits and a variety of jigs fished on casting or spinning tackle 
      are good&nbsp; choices for artificial baits. These include floating and 
      sinking Rapalas and Yozuri minnows, Rat-L-Traps, Shad-Raps, Jerk’n 
      Sams, Wobble Pops, Tiny Torpedos and Pop-Rs. A plastic, twin-tailed 
      minnow and jig combination buzzed across the surface or tossed at 
      fish sighted in deeper water also can be productive. Small tube lures 
      and jigs frequently are used to sight-fish butterfly peacock, 
      especially when they are aggressively guarding spawning beds near the 
      shoreline. Although bigger baits (up to five inches) may entice more 
      trophy-sized fish, baits less than three inches in length will 
      produce more consistently than larger ones. However, even big 
      butterfly peacock will take baits smaller than largemouth bass 
      anglers typically use. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dahlberg divers, deceivers, Clousers, epoxy minnows, zonkers 
      and poppers are all popular selections of flyfishers. Many anglers 
      prefer gold, fire-tiger or natural-colored lures; fly fishermen like 
      chartreuse or yellow flies with flashy strips of mylar-type 
      materials. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Most butterfly peacock anglers use light spinning tackle with 
      six to eight-pound test line. Light lines and tippets generate more 
      strikes than heavier ones, and heavier lines aren’t necessary because 
      canal-caught butterfly peacock tend to be open-water fighters. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The butterfly peacock can be handled by its lower jaw, using 
      the same thumb-and-finger grip used for largemouth bass, although 
      this will not immobilize them. By the end of the day, successful 
      anglers using this grip will have many minor thumb scrapes caused by 
      sandpaper-like teeth. These can be avoided by using tape, a leather 
      thumb-guard or a fish landing device like the Bogagrip. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The current bag limit for butterfly peacock is two fish per 
      day, only one of which may be greater than 17 inches long. This 
      17-inch length regulation gives added protection to large fish, which 
      is essential for maintaining a high quality sport fishery. If the 
      popularity of butterfly peacock fishing continues to grow as 
      expected, it may be necessary to consider even more restrictive 
      regulations to protect this fishery (e.g., the bag limit may be 
      reduced to one fish). All regulations for sport fish are subject to 
      change, so always check to be sure of current <a href="../rules.html">
      rules</a>. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) 
      encourages anglers to practice <a href="release.html">
      catch-and-release</a> when fishing for butterfly peacock. Overall, 
      this species is a hearty fish and nearly 100 percent will survive 
      being caught and released when properly handled. However, butterfly 
      peacock do not survive as well in live wells or as long out of water 
      as do largemouth bass. It is important that they be released quickly 
      to maximize their chances for survival.

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Low water temperature is the most important factor for 
      butterfly peacock in Florida. Laboratory temperature studies have 
      documented that butterfly peacock die in water colder than 60 
      degrees. In fact, the first attempt to study butterfly peacock in the 
      1960s failed when all fish died due to low pond temperatures. <br>
      <img border="0" src="../images/Butterfly-fishing.jpg" 
      alt="Fishing from a boat in a south Florida canal." align="left" width="300" height="266">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early 1980s, it was discovered that canals of coastal 
      southeast Florida were warmer than other waters during the winter, 
      and some rarely dropped below 65 degrees. The main reason for this is 
      the Biscayne Aquifer that lies just a few feet below the ground. 
      During winter, the warmer water flowing from this aquifer into canals 
      creates the warm temperatures critical to the survival and success of 
      many exotic fishes. The butterfly peacock is no exception. In fact, 
      of all exotic fishes currently established in Florida, the butterfly 
      peacock is the least tolerant of low water temperatures.
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Butterfly peacock have over-wintered and reproduced successfully 
      every year since their introduction in 1984. No additional fish have 
      been stocked since 1987. Although butterfly peacock occasionally 
      experience partial winterkills, coastal southeast Florida canals 
      provide conditions that should permanently support a high quality 
      sport fishery for this important species. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike some of their relatives, butterfly peacock do not venture 
      into salt water and are restricted to salinities similar to those 
      tolerated by largemouth bass. This intolerance to salt water and low 
      water temperatures prevents butterfly peacock&nbsp; from becoming 
      widespread outside the metropolitan southeast Florida area. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The best and most up-to-date fishing reports for butterfly peacock 
      are available from local bait and tackle shop operators. However, 
      quarterly fishing
      <a href="http://www.floridafisheries.com/forecast/sor.html#m-wp">
      forecasts</a> are also available on our website.&nbsp; A few tackle 
      shops cater specifically to butterfly peacock anglers. There also are 
      several professional guides who specialize in fishing for this 
      species. Experienced guides are especially helpful for visiting 
      anglers and those who want to quickly learn the basics, plus a few of 
      the best canals to fish. For first-time, non-guided butterfly peacock 
      anglers, it is strongly recommended to check with local freshwater 
      tackle shops for the best locations and baits to use. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../images/butterfly-map.jpg" align="center" width="470" height="500"><br>
      These maps also are available in Acrobat PDF format on
      our <a href="../pdf/index.html">fisheries publications</a> site.<br>
      <p><strong><font size="5"><a name="History">HISTORY</a>:&nbsp; Why Are They Here?</font></strong> <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; About 20,000 butterfly peacock fingerlings were stocked into 
      major canal systems of southeast Florida between 1984 and 1987 by the 
      FWC. These fish were introduced to increase predation on illegally 
      introduced and abundant exotic forage fishes, especially the African 
      spotted tilapia, as well as to enhance freshwater sportfishing 
      opportunities in the metropolitan Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area. This 
      project has been extremely successful, and butterfly peacock 
      currently represent a multi-million dollar sport fishery in Florida.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; The butterfly peacock was introduced by FWC staff only after many 
      years of research. Fisheries scientists are opposed to introductions 
      of exotic fishes that have not been thoroughly studied. A species 
      that has been beneficial in one location may be harmful elsewhere. 
      All introductions need to be scientifically evaluated before any 
      species is released into a new area. For this and other reasons, it 
      is illegal for anglers to release live butterfly peacock anywhere 
      other than back into the waters from which they were caught. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Because of careful planning and preliminary evaluations, Florida’s 
      butterfly peacock fishery has been cited as a model program by 
      several state, national and international environmental groups. In 
      light of this success, it is important to re-emphasize the caution 
      with which this introduction was approached. The butterfly peacock is 
      a justified exception to the FWC’s general rule of prohibiting 
      introductions of exotic fishes. <br>
