<img src="16.tr2_2.gif" width="210" height="386" alt="TR2"><p><b>15. TR2/63<p></b></b>The first semiacoustic guitar from Burns. It is really a solid guitar with built on hollow sidepieces. Remarkably, it was the first electric guitar with amplifier. TR2 is short for Transistored 2 pick-up. You get a lot of guitar for your money. Was produced in 1963-64, and a corresponding bass was also available. <p><img src="linje.jpg" width="567" height="2" alt="linje">

<img src="21.gb55delu_2.jpg" width="200" height="386" alt="GB de Luxe"><p><b>20. GB 66 de Luxe /65<p></b></b>Very rare Burns guitar. Similar to the G.B.66 in terms of design, but with a thicker body and different pick-ups and circuit / density control. Only a few were made before Burns was sold to Baldwin in 1965. It is a jazz guitar based upon a Charlie Christian model. Exquisite sound! <p><img src="linje.jpg" width="567" height="2" alt="linje">

<img src="22_virginian.jpg" width="200" height="386" alt="Virginian"><p><b>21. Virginian / 65. </b><p>One of the better Burns guitars, though the Burns version is fairly rare since most were sold under the name of Baldwin after 1965, when Burns was sold to Baldwin. It has the same Bar-o-Matic pick-ups as the GB 66 de Luxe. 1965.
