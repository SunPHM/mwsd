 <font color="#660000"><font size="+1">Well, I've gotten the body contoured, 
except for the ergonomic sculpting on the bass side of the lower bout and 
on the back. Basically, the bottom left corner (looking at the picture on 
the left) gets trimmed back at an angle to make it more comfortable for the 
right forearm, and the back gets scooped out in the area of the waist(the 
narrow part) and on either side to make it more comfortable against the ribcage. 
That won't be too much trouble to do, my belt sander will take care of the 
front, and my small drum sander and microplanes for the back. Then smoothing 
off with my random orbital sander.</font></font> <br>
 <font color="#660000"><font size="+1">&nbsp;On the right is the pickup kit 
I got from <a href="http://www.carvin.com">Carvin</a>. Included in it are 
two pickups, one humbucker and one single coil, one volume and one tone control, 
one three-way switch, two knurled chrome knobs, a tone capacitor, output jack,
and a shielding kit that includes copper foil tape and some shielded wire.
It's simple and I did want to use active electronics, but this was the only
thing I could find that was within my price range. It should sound pretty
good.</font></font> <br>

<p><font color="#660000"><font size="+1">Now it's time to rout the body for 
the pickups and control cavities. The picture in the top left is my pickup 
routing template attached to the guitar body. The template is made from 3/4" 
MDF (Medium<br>
   Density Fiberboard), and is attached using screws into the holes where 
the bridge will be attached. You can see on the template the layout lines 
I used to set it up. Below that shows a close-up of the cutout around the 
fingerboard. The top right is a scrap piece of pine that I used as a test 
piece to try out the template before I cut into the body. I also attached 
the bridge there in position just to see how it looked. Below on the right 
is a view of the back of the guitar showing the additional screw and blocks 
I used to make sure the template wouldn't move. You can also see where I drew
the outline of the control cavity on the back.</font></font></p>

 <font color="#660000"><font size="+1">And here are the two templates used 
for the control cavity. The bottom one is for the main part of the cavity 
and the top is for the ledge the cover sits on, as well as a template for 
the cover itself. I attach the template to the back of the guitar using double 
sided tape and rout out the main cavity, about 1/8" at a time, until the bottom
is about 3/16" from the front face of the guitar. Then I remove that template
and attach the cover template and rout out a ledge about 3/16", or the thickness
of the cover.&nbsp; That leaves the four protrusions on the sides for attaching
the cover with screws. I used 4 threaded brass inserts and worked real well.
In case you're wondering, the templates are sitting on wax paper because
I had just pulled them off the test piece and was trying to save the tape.
It turned out to be a bad idea though, the tape stuck to the wax paper and
so I ended up having to remove the old tape and replace it anyway.</font></font>

You can see the jack plate I made out of a piece of aluminum. I also went
ahead and attached the strap pins so I could see how well balanced it is,
preferably more so than the builder, shown in the picture below.</font></font>

 <font color="#660000"><font size="+1">Here I've attached just about everything 
and it felt real good, nicely balanced and not too heavy. I'm actually beginning 
now to think about doing a natural finish instead of the translucent blue 
burst I've been planning to do. I wiped it down the other night to remove 
the dust and when it was wet it didn't look too bad, except for the black 
lines inside the horns. A natural finish would definitely be much easier, 
but I still don't know. Next I have to finish sculpting the body, install 
the fingerboard marker dots, and radius the fingerboard. It's getting close!</font></font>
