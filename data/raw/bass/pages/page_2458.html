<p align="left">
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Designing new instruments can 
be a real challenge, especially when you work for a well established and 
respected company like Dean. Mick Donner has been creating new guitars for many 
years and is up to the task! Just back from another successful NAMM show, Mick 
took some time from his hectic schedule to tell us about Dean's new basses and 
much more. Thanks Mick!</span></font></p>
<hr color="#CC99FF" width="79%">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#FF00FF" face="Arial">Tell us about your 
new 10-string bass that you introduced at the recent NAMM show. Is it a USA-made 
bass or an import? What finishes / options are available? How is it strung?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Because this bass is part of 
our “Hammer” family, the neck and body are made from solid mahogany with a 
rosewood fretboard. I really hate covering up all that natural wood so the 
Hammer basses are only available in a natural oil finish. The bass is an import 
so we aren’t really able to offer much in the way of options for it. </span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">What led up to the 
introduction of the 10-string? Was there a specific consumer demand you were 
looking to fill, or is this a first 'test' step into a potential new market?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">This was one of those things 
that I actually was thinking about before last year’s Anaheim show but, at that 
time, I’d only been with Dean for about a month so I really didn’t get a chance 
to work out the details before NAMM. The <span class="GramE">Summer</span> show 
was consumed with the Stylist bass and the reissues of the Z and Caddy basses 
along with several new guitars so the 10-string had to wait for 2004. The 
10-string just seemed like a no-brainer to me. There were plenty of guys out 
there playing heavy music on 5-string so the 10 just seemed like a natural 
extension of the instrument.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">I worked for Parker guitars for 
a number of years and when we <span class="GramE">debuted</span> the Parker Bass 
at Winter NAMM a couple of years ago I met Jauqo III-X. He was really interested 
in the Parker and I was really taken with his pop/slap/pick technique (you have 
to see this to believe it!). We started talking and eventually we got around to 
the 15 string that the guys at Warrior had made for him. That’s probably the 
spark that lit the fire under this project. Jauqo and I stayed in touch and, 
when we met again last Summer in Nashville, I started seeking serious input from 
him and other multi-string bassists so I could start putting this thing 
together.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">The Rhapsody 12-string bass is now 
well established, perhaps thanks in part to its very affordable price. Since its 
introduction it has only been available in the Transparent Black finish. Are 
there any plans to offer other finishes? Or maybe even another body style?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">The Rhapsody is an import bass 
and the sad fact with imports is that it’s a numbers game. Because 12-strings 
are going to sell in limited numbers at best, we needed to pick a color that 
would appeal to the greatest number of players. As always, it’s black. The 
Rhapsody’s popularity has weakened a little so we’ve pared the line down to the 
semi-hollow version in fretted and fretless, the 8-string in bubinga, and the 
12. I haven’t ruled out the possibility of doing a 12 in another body style, but 
it’s not on my immediate to do list right now.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">The neck width on the 
Rhapsody is a bit wider than most 12's. What feedback have you received about 
this?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">For the most part, everybody I 
talk to is grateful for the extra room and most would like it even wider. At 
that point, I really start getting into hardware concerns and finding a bridge 
that will support wider spacing.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">Have you considered 
offering a USA-made 12? Do you think the demand for 8 and 12-string basses is 
sufficiently large at this point to warrant new models, or are these still a 
very small niche market?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">These basses are still, 
largely, a niche market. However, Dean has never shied away from niche markets. 
We make 6 and 12-string banjos and even a 9-string mandolin so there really 
isn’t too much that we’re afraid to take a shot at.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">

a Production Line company?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">

We’ve also started doing some exotic wood tops like spalted maple and burled 
redwood.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">How important are 
artist endorsements?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Artist endorsement is always a 
big part of being in this end of the business but I’ve always seen endorsements 
as more of a partnership. Most of my past relationships with artists have really 
been more give and take than anything. They let me know what they need and I 
learn a lot in the process of trying to give it to them. I’ve never done a 
stadium gig in front of thousands of people but I’ve built basses for guys who 
do. They bring that experience into my shop and we all end up with better 
basses.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">Dean recently started 
using Everly strings on the 8 and 12-string basses. How do the Everly strings 
compare to other brands of strings you've used?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">I want to clarify that the 
strings I buy from Everly are just for our set up guys and most of the basses 
you will see in stores have the stock Korean strings on them. That said, I can’t 
say enough about Joe Iacobellis and Everly. These guys are a lot like us. 
They’re just not afraid to try stuff and when I asked them for certain gauges of 
strings they were up to the task. I’ve been buying them ever since. I know that 
GHS has made some strings for us in the past and that SIT is working on a 12-string set with Jauqo that’s going to really be good. I don’t have much 
experience with any other companies.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">Before you joined 
Dean you were a designer for Peavey. How long have you been creating guitars? 
What got you interested in instrument design?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Actually, I’ve been around the 
industry for a LONG time. I started at Washburn in 1986. I still have the 
original drawings for the Washburn Acoustic Bass Guitar stashed at home 
somewhere. After that, I worked at Gibson for a year and then to Peavey for 6 
years. While I was at Peavey I worked on Jeff Berlin and Brian Bromberg’s basses 
as well as the Midibase and CyberBass. I got to build basses for a really long 
list of players while I was there. After I left Peavey, it was my great fortune 
to work for Ken Parker for 6 years. Ken is probably one of the smartest guys in 
our industry and I learned volumes from him about everything from composites to 
hot sauce. Ken was kind enough to let me help in the development of the Parker 
Bass. <span class="GramE">Again, a great learning experience.</span> When Parker 
downsized a little over a year ago, I was let go. At that time Jeff Berlin and 
Brian Bromberg were both Dean endorsers. They both recommended me to Elliot 
Rubinson (owner of Dean and also a great bass player) and the rest is history.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">I got started in design back 
when I first started as an independent builder. I was a road musician and, when 
I came in off the road for the last time, I started doing some repair work at Ye 
Olde Guitar Shoppe in </span></font>

<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Des Moines</span></font></st1:place></st1:city><font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">. 
I got the opportunity to apprentice with an archtop builder named Lyle Haldy 
after which I started doing some custom builds for local pros. Washburn hired me 
out of the shop and one day Rudy Schlacher (Washburn’s owner) asked me to make a 
drawing of an updated Strat body for the Korean factory. This drawing became the 
Washburn KC series. Later I did some work on the Stephens extended cutaway 
basses and eventually worked on the Washburn ABG basses. My career just 
snowballed from there.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">
<img border="0" src="Mick3x.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" width="280" height="439">How do you design a 
new instrument? Where do you get your inspiration? Do you start with a specific 
look in mind or just start in a general direction and see what develops? Do you 
use a computer and CAD software in the process?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Designing an instrument is all 
of the above. I never really know where the inspiration is going to come from. 
Being a former working musician, most of the time necessity is my greatest 
impetus for a new instrument. For me, new stuff usually starts as a concept and 
then I try to shape the actual instrument to best fit the concept functionally, 
physically, and aesthetically. </span></font>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Up until recently I’ve been a 
paper and pencil guy but last year I decided to join the 20th 
Century 
and bought a drawing program. So far, it’s been a lot of fun.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700">So tell me about your electric 
upright bass. 
Is that one of your original designs? Do you get many calls for 
uprights? And when will we be seeing this in the stores?</span></font><br>
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF"><font size="4">We're going to 
call it the Pace Bass. The Pace Bass is a short scale 
(prototypes were 34” but I think production will be 35” to save time on the 
eventual 5-string) electric upright. That’s based on an instrument that I built 
for myself over 10 years ago. It has an electric piezo bridge with a buffer 
preamp exactly like the original. The only real improvement I’ve made is in the 
hardware. The stand has a universal ball joint that allows for an infinite 
number of playing positions. We introduced it at this NAMM show along with the 
Hammer 10, the Sledgehammer, and the Edge Quilt archtop basses. We got a very 
favorable reaction to the concept and the price (SRP $1000) and this should be 
in stores in 90 to 120 days.</font></span><font size="4"></font></font><div align="center">

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">Are there any new 
developments in materials that may be incorporated into future Dean instruments? 
How do you decide upon new finishes?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Sometimes it seems like new 
instrument materials are surfacing on a daily basis. I try to investigate as 
many as I can but usually I end up coming back to good old miracle fiber W 
(wood). If something comes to my attention and it really validates itself in the 
design and building processes I’ll probably give it a fair shot.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Finishes are the passing 
fancies of our industry. They’re really fashion driven like our clothing 
because… we wear them. Of course, the finish needs to be in line with the 
instrument. I’m not going to put an opaque chartreuse finish on a nice piece of 
burled wood.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">What do you think is 
your best work? Is there a specific design or project you take a special pride 
in?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">That’s a tough question to 
answer without sounding too full of myself. First, I need to say that I’ve 
probably only done one or two instruments totally alone. Most of what I’ve done 
has always been some sort of team effort because I’ll be the first to tell you 
that I don’t have all the answers. <span class="GramE">My favorite 
collaborations have been with Steve Chick on the Peavey Midi and Cyber Basses, 
Brian Bromberg on both Peavey B Quad and Dean B Squared basses, Ken Parker on 
the Parker Bass, and, most recently, with Elliot Rubinson on some of the new 
Dean stuff.</span> It’s great to have a boss that really gets bass and he’s 
really been great about giving me a lot of creative freedom. Most days my 
marching orders from him are, “Go do stuff”.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">You and Dean
<span class="GramE">president</span> Elliot Rubinson both play bass. What models 
of basses do you play, and do either of you spend much time with the 12?</font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Elliot has an extensive 
collection of vintage basses that includes a few of the old Dean instruments 
from the 80’s. I know that, up until recently, he was playing a Razor and now is 
playing the Edge Pro most of the time. I have a lot of proto stuff that I play. 
I have a Stylist bass which is loads of fun, the prototype to the new electric 
upright, and I’ll probably pick up a Hammer 5-string some time this year. The 12 
is a lot of fun but, having been a musical mercenary most of my professional 
life, I’ve never been called to play much 12. Elliot probably has a 12 I don’t 
know if he plays it much or not.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF">

Finally, I have to ask you about the Dean Girls. Many different guitar companies 
have incorporated beautiful women into their advertising and at trade shows over 
the years, but the Dean Girls really stand out from the crowd. How important are 
they to calling attention to and keeping attention on Dean guitars? Where do you 
find your girls? And do you have any phone numbers you could email me? (Better not 
tell my wife about that last one!) </font></b><br>
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">Here’s the interesting part: 
I’m not sure if this is still true but back in the 70’s when Dean was just 
getting started, the percentage of men reading <i>Guitar Player</i> was higher than the 
percentage of men reading <i>Playboy</i>. Dean Zelinsky was smart enough to recognize 
this fact and capitalized on it. The girls have been part of the Dean
<span class="GramE">booth</span> at trade shows for so long, people just expect 
them to be there. It wouldn’t be a Dean <span class="GramE">booth</span> without 
them.</span></font><p class="MsoNormal">
<font size="4" color="navy" face="Arial">
<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #FFFFFF">The Dean girls stand out because we simply have more experience in picking 
the girls and knowing what to tell them to do during a show. Dean finds them 
through local modeling agencies. The girls we had in </span></font>
