After years and years of careful analysis, I've figured out that one thing about myself.  I'm not quite sure whether it is a good thing or a bad thing.  In this particular situation, however, I think it's a good thing.  You see, it's this very trait that is moving my fingers at this very moment.  Today I got an email from a concerned and slightly disappointed friend, justin.  <br><br>

Here it is:

----
<br>
what's the deal with the weblog, man? it's been almost 6 months! you can't 
tell me there hasn't been any interesting stories since then! how about your 
personal review on sunsets and sushi or praise habit? maybe some thoughts on the upcoming CD? maybe some behind the scenes stories about gear, god, or band creativity?<br>
its a link on my toolbar favorites that get clicked daily. the 
disappointment that follows is beginning to become unbearable...
<br><br>


*grief*

And it got me thinking, and acting. It's been too long! How can so much time pass without so much as a hello?  That's just wrong! Cruel! Unusual! Things like this should not be allowed to come to pass in this world!

It’s one of those chairs with a verifiable personality. I would say about a third of it’s personality comes from the look and texture of the cloth covering it.  The other full two-thirds certainly stems from it’s odor – there’s such a story expressed through those particles of smell.  It’s Sunday, and as is common, if not a law of Nature, I’m holding a cup of coffee in my left hand.  I’m ambidextrous, I don’t know if you knew that or not, but I am.  The sun is shining it’s morning rays through the glass – it was way before 10, but the sun is still melting my face off.  I catch a glimpse of the steam literally gushing out of the top of my cup.  For some reason – I don’t know if it was the lighting or the fact that got no sleep last night or what – I’m able to discern each and every individual miniscule particle of water that is escaping from my cup.  There are so many of them.  It’s a swarm of tiny magical bees, hovering and swirling and disappearing into thin air. It’s beautiful.

<br><br>
So now, I’m in the air, on my way back home to Chicago.  I’ve been watching the clouds.  They’re just out there being their cumulonimbus little selves. An alarming majority of them look like poodles (miniature) to me. I sit here and I can’t help but wonder…hope…expect that one of those little critters that jumped out of my cup and  vanished this morning has reemerged in that one laughing poodle’s tail down there.

It was at the end of the recording of <i>Illuminate</i> on Franklin Avenue in Waco, TX.  It was a cool May night, not long after the lunar eclipse in 2003.  The recording was coming to an end, and Crowder and I were standing out back, reflecting.  Really, we were just standing there in silence, knowing that we were both thinking the same thing…that this was one of the greatest times of our lives and that we were different, and our lives were more complete as a result of our experiences over the previous month. 
<br><br>
I was sitting backstage yesterday, at the very end of nearly two months of hard touring with the smitty dudes and the guys from mercyme.  Smitty was playing “healing rain,” and I knew…I’m a different person than I was 2 months ago.  So much beautiful history was made.  I will never forget it…so many moments that have changed me…moved me...inspired me.  It was the same feeling I had over a year ago, and it means so much to me.
<br><br>
Thanks to all of you who have changed my life!  Glen, Anthony, Smitty, Caviezel, Mark (the staples of the tiki lounge)…Mel, Todd, Snooch, Nick, Seth (my skydiving friends)…and everyone else!

I finished a book a few weeks ago, and ever since, I’ve been sort of out on a mission, following leads, making life more colorful, enjoyable, exuberant, tasty, not letting little things get in the way. Or maybe I’m just more aware.  Maybe it’s not so much trying to make life better, it’s just noticing how good it is.  Or maybe not. Anyways, here's a little taste of how it's gone down...
<br><br>
Jet skiing in northern California.  The ride was great.  There were so many do-nuts done, so tight that the stream of water shooting up from the back of the machine was constantly raining down on my face. I mean, hauling at 47 miles per hour over rough waters, past the “don’t go past there” buoys was pretty exhilarating, but the thing I will always remember the most about that day was when I wasn’t moving.  I cut the engine, stood up and jumped into the water.  The silence. There I was in the middle of this vast lake, one of only 2 people out there at the time. It felt so great to immerse myself in the medium that I’d been gliding upon for the last half hour.
<br>---<br>
The next day, it was Crowder and me, making our way up into the woods above the Greek Theater in LA.  There was a full moon out, low in the sky. The “path” was all loose sand/dirt. And it was steep.  Dark.  And there were twelve-foot-tall chain-linked fences that had to be climbed. And there were inch-wide spiders hovering in the air that were avoided…narrowly, and not without panic.  And there were empty beer cans and torn bags that had, some time ago, held Doritos. And they were scattered about, in and amongst the suffocating ivy that was crawling across the sand/dirt.  And there was a log to sit on.  Around this log there was a higher proportion of beer cans and Doritos bags, almost as though they were the first atomic energy level, and the log was the nucleus.  And there was a clear view of the stage far below, from this log.  Well, almost clear.  A sapling had grown up and was obscuring about one third of the view.  I wanted to cut that tree down, but, alas, I didn’t have a saw, or even one of those Swiss Army knives with the two-inch toothed blade on it.  Yes, I would have spent the ten minutes it would have taken me to cut it down—it would have been worth it.  Then, later, the chain-linked fence was climbed again, spider was passed, moon was admired, hill was slid down, congratulations were exchanged.
<br>---<br>
The next day, it was yelling at the top of my lungs out of the top of a convertible on the highway late at night.
<br>---<br>
It was watching someone get tackled on the grass just past the parking lot (not more than ten feet away from me) by undercover officers at the mall.  I guess he forgot to pay for something.
<br>---<br>
Then it was eating salmon and halibut in Seattle.  Oh yea, and climbing up this ramp-like thing (very steep) that goes up to the roof of Key Arena and playing catch with those still on the ground.  And getting told that we shouldn’t do that anymore by whoever that person is who’s worried about liability.
<br>---<br>
It was more salmon and halibut in Portland.  And watching Thom Yorke flap his hands like wings, mocking, when his record label president said something about flying toward a platinum selling album. And the tiki lounge.  Oh the tiki lounge.
<br><br>
<img src=images/grill.jpg>
<br>---<br>
Then, oh yes, then it was.  A little less conversation, a little more action.  The two-hundred-and-fifty foot Elvis rising from the depths, with thousands of crazed fans surrounding, spinning around, and the go-gos, and the column of energy.
<br><br>
<img src=images/elvis.jpg>
<br>---<br>
And then, it was standing in the front of the bus, watching the balls of ice come from the sky pummeling the ground with loud, very loud, crashes.  And that one that landed on the roof not more than a foot from my head.  And the brightest blue sky right next to the darkest sky I’d ever seen. And the wind shifting it’s direction every minute or so.
<br>---<br>
Then it was the spinning machine, hurling me and Crowder hundreds of feet into the night sky.  How could it accelerate so fast?  
<br><br>
<img src=images/spinning.jpg>
<br><br>
We were way up in the air, we were flipping and spinning, both hands were raised, constant laughing-yelling-screaming.  Amazing view.  
<br><br>
<img src=images/tv.jpg>
<br><br>
And then, not ten minutes later, still giddy, it was fireworks being hurled from the Earth 50 feet from me.  There was running out of the bus, jumping up onto a flat roof, there was laying down.  It was huge, so powerful.  There were exploded remains falling all around, and on me, us.  Then there was me – and only me – still laying there.  Some of the loudest most glorious bangs I’ve ever heard.  The brightest light I’d ever seen. A falling piece of burning cardboard landed ten feet to my left.  The sky was wild, the night was on fire.
<br><br>
<img src=images/fireworks.jpg>
<br>---<br>
Then it was walking through the back gate at Kings Island, directly onto the tower that takes like 50 people up to around 250 feet. The sun was setting behind me, we were the highest thing in the whole park, a little too high.  Nervous. Then it was falling, falling fast.  
<br><br>
<img src=images/tower.jpg>
<br><br>
Then getting beat up on that wooden roller coaster that had a loop in it (is that possible?).  Then “The Beast.”  It was dark outside, no lights around. It went so fast, through the woods, into a tunnel, pitch black, and out – now going much faster than before.
<br>---<br>
Now it’s today.  What’s to come? More roller coasters? Sure. Sky Diving? Why not.

A good portion of my day was spent riding said coaster or others.  
<br>
I’ve figured it out, and about an hour each day is spent “working.” This time is divided as follows:
<br><br>
6 minutes:  Plug in various cables to my bass rig <br>
2 minutes: Tune guitars <br>
4 minutes: Line check <br>
30 minutes: Play music <br>
10 minutes: Roll up various cables and put them away <br>
<br><br>
I estimate that the other 8 minutes is taken up walking between bus and stage and catering.  So pretty much the rest of the day I’m left to my own devices. 
<br><br>
On to today.
<br><br>
So today, I woke up perched on the side of a hill surrounded by other hills, a baby blue sky, and overlooking a gorgeous lake. I spent the better half of this day sitting in a lawn chair, facing the lake, reading, and getting lost in the view, and wishing those jet-skis weren’t so loud. About an hour of my day was spent racing atop waves at 47 mph, trying to hang on, and realizing why those jet-skis are so loud.

I just got to thinkin’…this has got to be the greatest “job” on earth right now.  <br>

<br><br>
1. Whichever governmental or regulatory agency decides where to place warning labels and what information said labels shall contain have overlooked something.
<br><br>
2. With respect to devices or machinery designed for transportation, it is logical to have a key (or security device of similar function) to deter theft.  It is also logical that said machine should, while in use, prohibit, or at very least restrict, the removal of the key that is required for ignition.

Ladies and gentlemen, we’re perched right smack dab on the dawn of a new era.  You know how you used to have to walk out your front door, down the sidewalk, sky still black and empty, to retrieve that newspaper so dreadfully early in the morning?  Or maybe you make that same trek later in the day only to find a stack of bills courtesy of the fine folks at the Postal Service.  Better yet, maybe a few of you venture out and take the dog on a walk from time to time.  That act of lugging yourself around, hurling one foot forward, then the next…it’s so 20th century!  In case you haven’t noticed, we are in an age of technological supremacy, one in which you should not have to exert yourself so.  The unsurpassed genius of one man has ushered in the future and lead us into these great times which are destined to be utterly devoid of physical exertion of any kind.

Gentlemen behold…the Segway!  (the crowd roars)

No, it’s not a flying car…but really, it’s revolutionary. Really.  The perfect marriage of form and function. It’s what you’ve been waiting for. You can’t live without one. It’ll change your life. Really.
<br><br>
Hmmm.
<br><br>
Let’s get down to the point.  Yesterday, I was lucky enough to get a taste, first hand, of the best the 21st century has to offer.  One of the kind folks on the tour brought his two Segways to the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Virginia Beach and offered them up to takers backstage.  Solley and I quickly took the plunge, but not without a crash course in safety and proper operation first.  Within minutes, it was like they said. All of a sudden you’re thinking, you’re moving.  Forward. Back. Forward. Back. Turning, however, required a bit more in the motor function department than I expected. I mean, can’t you invent something that goes left when I think left. Oooohh, or maybe even up when I think up. Maybe we need flying Segways.  They would look something like those things in the biodome-lab-thing of the Ben Affleck film <i>Paycheck</i>, only with out the cables hoisting them and moving them around.  Anyways, within moments, we’re off, traversing the hills and valleys of the amphitheater, quickly finding the tightest possible places to squeeze through, just to see if we could.  We come across Toni, and she notifies us that there’s a great market not far from the rear entrance.  “You’ll pass a high school, people playing basketball, take a right at the light, and it’s the next light down, on the left”  Here’s where the warning label comes in.  Don’t panic, I didn’t fall or anything. They already thought of that one, and they notified us with a kind note emphasizing the extreme danger of serious injury or death to which passengers were subjecting themselves. I’m sure that if I’d had my two feet planted firmly on solid ground I would’ve thought better of it, but it was something about the swaying motion, back and forth, back and forth. 
<br><br>
“WARNING! This device may impair your ability to think rationally.” Surely it would be yellow, with bold black lettering.  And it would have a faceless stick figure of some sort with clouds above its head, or a bunch of question marks, or something.
<br><br>
This is what should have been going through my head: “That sounds like a long way away…surely there are others who would wish to experience the futuristic power of mind-propelling that this machine offers…I should give them a turn too, they would like that.”
<br><br>
I’m hypnotized. Forward. Back. Forward. Back  I hear this, droning in my head—“You will do what I say. Obey Segway. You go where I lead you.”  I’m sucked in. Any last morsel of logic is lost, and we’re on our way. Out the back entrance, down the rough, winding, night-black asphalt road.  Make a left. Along the new, smooth, concrete road. Pass the high school. Swerve over onto the four-foot-wide path. Pass the basketball courts. Turn right at the light. This is a long way. Down the sidewalk. Trying to avoid the manhole covers. So many of them. So inopportunely placed. Pass the park on the right. See the market across the street on the left. Press the crosswalk button. Glad that the world is Segway accessible!  Speed down the ramp and across the ladder painted in white on the road.  Feel cool.  Pull into the market. Hover over some speed bumps.  I think the warning label said not to do that. Oh well.  I’m thirsty.  Want to stop for a fountain drink. Dilemma. Step off of the machine. It won’t stay still! I think harder. “stay still…STAY STILL!!!” It’s feeling uncooperative. See the red button. Solution! Press the red button. Machine finally listens. Go in for a drink.  Door is locked. Try another door. Locked. People inside. Little neon sign that says “OPEN.” Waitress won’t make eye contact. Maybe they’re scared of my technology. Yep, that’s it. Oh well, their loss. Let’s move on. Press red button. Nothing. Press red button. Nothing. Press, press, press, pressssssssss. It’s feeling uncooperative. Look for the key.  Nothing. Look for the key hole.  Nothing.  Start scouring that little bin that’s in front of the handle bars. Nothing, nothing, nothing. There’s no key!  There’s no key hole! That’s Genius! Leave it to the 21st century! I’m stuck. My guess is that the little circle with a magnet in the middle is someone’s bad idea gone worse.  Sure enough, I make a phone call and confirm my suspicion. The “key” is back where I started! What year is this again? What century, what millennium? You call this technology?!?!?! 
<br><br>
Well, after a layover of about 45 minutes, the so-called key was in my hands, and the archaic machine came to life again.  I wanted to punish it, kick it, something. But I needed it, so I held back my aggression.  Back across the crosswalk. Over the manhole covers. Down the path. Down the road. Down the other road. Saying sorry, sorry, sorry. The machine defeated me. It was calculating, conniving. We went to war, and it won. <br>

                      <td><font color="#FFFFFF" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Four days ago, I was in Nashville.  We spent a good portion of  the week tooling around the Opryland hotel eating barbeque and wondering where all those rivers ended up.  Tuesday had arrived, and I was heading to Chicago for two days off prior to the marathon that would be the One Nation Tour, with Michael W. Smith and Mercy Me.  Storms were fast approaching from the west and I knew if our plane didn’t take off in time, I’d be stuck on the ground for at least an hour past the scheduled 5:50 departure.  That thought didn’t really concern me, however, because I was so content, lounging in one of those vinyl airport seats, feet up against the glass, enveloped in a good book and watching nature unfold mere millimeters from the soles of my shoes.  The storm came and went, and the gate agent was on the horn announcing general boarding for flight 4377 direct to O’Hare.  I made my way to the tenth row of the small regional jet, plopped down in my window seat and rejoiced at the fact that the plane wasn’t completely full.  We pushed back and taxied toward the runway only to be told that the weather in Chicago was horrendous.  Updates came about every half hour, each one a catalyst for passengers’ frustration.  The final update, one that no one seemed too pleased about, declared the cancellation of our flight.  The next flight to Chicago’s O’Hare would leave in the morning.  Moans and hisses, grunts and groans. All the while, I’m content, pleased almost that the day is turning into an adventure. I exit the plane at a leisurely pace, not an ounce of urgency in my step, and watch as all of the passengers jockey for position at the gate’s counter.  A middle-aged, casually dressed man seemed to congratulate himself on his first-place finish.  I veered off and meandered toward the baggage claim.  On my way, I looked to the right and saw that a southwest plane was leaving at 9:35 pm.  A quick conversation with the agent reveals that there are plenty of seats and that the going rate is 116 dollars. “Thanks,” I said, and I was off again towards the baggage claim, calling customer service and receiving a $112.50 refund on the way.  Down the escalator – letting it do all of the work for me. I make a wide turn to the right and spot my luggage, on perfect pace to reach my outstretched hand. It was as though we were both being controlled by the same conveyor belt.  Not one millisecond of pause and I’m now making a wide left turn, hideously large bag in tow - up the escalator and to the desk. This is too easy.  I snake my way through the empty line and am immediately greeted by the ticket agent.<br>
“One ticket to Chicago, please.” <br>
“I’m checking one bag.”<br>
“Sure.”<br>
“Ok, thanks.”<br>
And I was off, hideously large bag now off my hands. One of the TSA fellas at security, apparently very observant, asked me if I was ever going to leave Nashville.  I don’t know how he took notice of me amongst the hoard of holiday travelers that was crowding the lines earlier in the day, but he did. I responded with an affirmative. Back inside, I dive into some more barbecue and sip on a diet coke.  Maybe dive isn’t the right word. I eat at a comfortable pace, avoiding only the suspect coleslaw.  As I finish up, it’s onto the plane.  Window seat again, this time a 737 (of course). The nighttime flight on the nearly empty plane was relaxing.  We landed at 11:20, the conveyor belt apparently directing my every move once again.  The luggage rounds the corner into my completely unsurprised grip.  The only thing that would’ve surprised me -  if, for some reason my luggage <i>wasn’t</i> there, ready to collide with my world at just the right time.
