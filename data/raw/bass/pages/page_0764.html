      <h4>11/18/2003</h4>
      <p>Today was one of the best bass fishing days in a long time, certainly
      the best of this season.&nbsp; Seymour and I had about 30 bass up to 30
      pounds on plugs in the morning.&nbsp; We then did about 15 fish to 25
      pounds on live bait in the afternoon.&nbsp; It was non stop action all
      day.&nbsp; The fish on plugs were incredible.&nbsp; They were crashing the
      big plugs and going wild.&nbsp; We had them in water only a couple of feet
      deep at times and when they jumped on the plug and felt the hook they
      would go ballistic and crash and run fifty yards of line.&nbsp; It doesn't
      get any better.&nbsp; I think I will call it a season and hang up the
      rods.&nbsp; Duck season opens Friday and its time to get the Benelli Black
      Eagle 12 gauge off the rack and do some hunting with my buddies.&nbsp; I
      can't promise however that I won't sneak out and throw a plug or two
      during the next week.</p>

      <h4>11/17/2003</h4>
      <p>Another good day of bass fishing.&nbsp; Tim Smith and I worked on
      shooting video for the new Bass Fishing DVD.&nbsp; Bait was a little
      tougher to get today than yesterday but it was there and the fish were on
      them.&nbsp; I caught about a dozen bass and Tim was able to get some good
      underwater footage.&nbsp; We did some action shots with me catching fish
      and it worked out well.&nbsp; The fishing is still hot with fish up to 25
      pounds today.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>11/16/2003</h4>
      <p>Had another great day of bass fishing.&nbsp; The bait was all over the
      place and the fish were on them.&nbsp; we landed about a dozen fish up to
      25 pounds.&nbsp; In the morning we went out into the ocean to the west of
      the inlet and there were 100 pound bluefin busting water in 40 feet south
      of Gilgo Beach.&nbsp; We didn't mess with them and ran to the east of the
      inlet.&nbsp; We found schools of bass and blues but no bass of any great
      size.&nbsp; My neighbor did troll fish to 30 pounds on spoons just south
      of the inlet in 40 feet.&nbsp; We went back inside and got on the bait
      schools and had our fun.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>11/12/2003</h4>
      <p>Today was probably the best day of the year for striped bass
      fishing.&nbsp; Two of us fishing boated about 30 fish up to 30
      pounds.&nbsp; The bait was everywhere and the fishing was super hot.&nbsp;
      I have been experimenting with a new version of the clip rig and it works
      very well.&nbsp; The presentation is totally natural and it produces fish
      even under tough conditions.&nbsp; No more hooks getting snagged in the
      bait and it conforms to the IGFA guidelines for setting world
      records.&nbsp; I will be marketing it through this website in the near
      future.&nbsp; I am working out the manufacturing and patent process for
      the &quot;Original Captain Al's Live Bait Clip Rig&quot;.&nbsp; Will keep
      you posted.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>11/11/2003</h4>
      <p>Went out and slammed the bait and bass.&nbsp; We had a nice day with a
      bunch of bass up to 38 pounds on live bait.&nbsp; We also plugged a few up
      to 20 pounds over the schools of peanut bunker.&nbsp; The weather got a
      little nasty so we headed for the hills at about 3 pm.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>11/10/2003</h4>
      <p>Tim Smith and I worked on shooting some video.&nbsp; We got some stuff
      that we needed to finish up the fly fishing DVD.&nbsp; Underwater footage
      of bluefish on the fly worked real well.&nbsp; The fish were thick under
      the birds southeast of the inlet.&nbsp; We also did some sequences with
      the Lowrance x-104C machine which is pretty incredible, and shot some
      sequences for the new &quot;Live Bait Striped Bass&quot; DVD that should
      be finished in a couple of months.&nbsp; The &quot;Saltwater
      Fly-Fishing&quot; DVD should be on the market next month, just in time for
      the Holidays.&nbsp; Keep it in mind for a good present for your fishing
      buddies.</p>

      <hr>
      <h4>11/9/2003</h4>
      <p>Had a good time today with the big bluefish on jigs offshore southeast
      of the inlet.&nbsp; We caught a couple of bass also but not very
      large.&nbsp; We then found some shad and stopped off on the way in to
      catch a few nice bass to about 25 pounds.&nbsp; A good day of fun on the
      water.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>11/8/2003</h4>
      <p>Fished for blackfish today and did a job on them again.&nbsp; We kept
      about 15 fish from 2 to 5 pounds.&nbsp; We stopped and fished for bass a
      little while on the way home and banged a couple of fish about 20
      pounds.&nbsp; The wind howled all day up to 30 knots.&nbsp; It was
      definitely a day that you appreciate the canvas enclosure.</p>

      <h4>11/7/2003</h4>
      <p>Had a great day of fishing today.&nbsp; 6 bass 20 to 25 pounds on live
      bait and a limit of blackfish from 3 to 6 pounds.&nbsp; Beautiful weather
      also made is nice.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>11/6/2003</h4>
      <p>Had a couple of bass to 18 pounds today on live bait.&nbsp; Big
      bluefish up to 15 pounds on jigs in the ocean to the east of the
      inlet.&nbsp; Steven has fun with his 15 pound blue on light tackle.</p>

      <hr>
      <h4>11/1/2003</h4>
      <p>Same deal as yesterday with the lack of bait.&nbsp; We decided to troll
      bunker spoons to the east of the inlet.&nbsp; We caught a bunch of
      bluefish but no bass.&nbsp; We stopped where the fish were thick and
      jigged them which was fun.&nbsp; We called it a wrap and made it a short
      day.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4><font size="3">10/31/2003</font></h4>
      <p>Fished for bass again today and it was kind of slow.&nbsp; The shad
      bait became scarce and most left the inlet and the bass moved out with
      them.&nbsp; The water is dirty because of the heavy surf and the fish
      don't like that either.&nbsp; We did have a couple of nice fish on
      plugs.&nbsp; The big one was about 32 pounds.&nbsp; Live bait produced
      only one smaller fish.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4>10/30/2003</h4>
      <p>Fished striped bass with live bait today and did just OK.&nbsp; It was
      tough getting bait but we managed a some baits and the did some
      fishing.&nbsp; We caught a few fish but nothing to brag about.&nbsp; Fish
      maybe up to 21 pounds.&nbsp; It was a pick all day but OK by us.&nbsp; The
      bait moved out of the inlet and so did most of the fish.&nbsp; We just
      have to wait for another bunch of fish to move down the beach and into
      Fire Island Inlet.&nbsp; It could be tomorrow.&nbsp; I will be there to
      find out if it happens because I will be there.</p>

      <hr>
      <h4><font size="3">10/28/2003</font></h4>
      <p>Fished with John and Pat today.&nbsp; We had a good time with the bass
      on live bait.&nbsp; Bait was a little tough to get this morning but we did
      OK with it and caught some nice fish.&nbsp; We had about 8 fish to the
      boat and dropped a bunch of others.&nbsp; Most fish were 18 to 24
      pounds.&nbsp; We found a bunch of bait late in the day and had a few more
      fish.</p>
      <p><font size="4"><b>Captain Al Lorenzetti</b></font></p>
      <hr>
      <h4><font size="3">10/25/2003</font></h4>
      <p>Fished with Seymour today.&nbsp; Seymour thought we should have some
      fun and lighten up the atmosphere since we were fishing the Babylon Tuna
      Club Striped Bass Tournament.&nbsp; Considering that it is near Halloween,
      we changed our appearance a little.&nbsp; We also figured that no one
      would recognize us and that we could fish incognito.&nbsp; It worked
      pretty well and we had a lot of laughs.&nbsp; Tim C. Smith took some good
      photos.&nbsp; We caught a bunch of bass up to 26 pounds on live bait and
      had fun doing it.&nbsp; Everyone is too serious about this fishing stuff
      so we thought we would lighten it up a bit.&nbsp; Billy Turnbull of West
      Islip won the tournament with a real nice 38 pound bass.&nbsp; After
      Billy's fish all the other placing fish were in the upper 20 pound
      range.&nbsp; It was a good tournament and should be much bigger next
      year.&nbsp; Top prize money with Calcutta was near four grand.</p>

    not very good but the fishing was excellent.&nbsp; Another good day on the

      <p>Fished with John Dall today.&nbsp; We beat up on the bass pretty good
      on live bait.&nbsp; We also had lots of problems with equipment failures
      but it was in large part due to the weather.&nbsp; We were fishing in 25
      to 30 knot winds against the tide and out lines crossed a couple of times
      when big fish were running off the baits.&nbsp; We dropped a fish well
      into the 30's and another about 28 pounds at the boat.&nbsp; we boated a
      bunch up to 22 pounds however and had a good time despite the terrible
      wind and cold.&nbsp; It was a tough but good day on the water.</p>

      <p align="left">A couple of odds and ends.&nbsp; I didn't fish today but
      other people did.&nbsp; Scott Leonard the new owner of Augie's Custom
      Tackle fished today and captured a nice 35 pound bass (picture
      below).&nbsp; Also got a message from a fellow fishing buddy Ed Simonetti
      about a striped bass that was caught that was very disfigured.&nbsp; He
      calls it a frog fish.&nbsp; It looks like some damage happened in its
      early stages of development but it wasn't lethal and the fish survived and
      obviously did pretty well.&nbsp; Also, judging from the way its two eyes
      are both looking forward or could at least both be directed toward the
      front without its snout in the way, it could be the first fish with
      stereoscopic vision and depth perception.&nbsp; I wonder if it would have
      been a superior predator.</p>

      <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Flounder season is off to a slow
      start.&nbsp; The water is still very cold from the prolonged and very cold
      winter.&nbsp; A few fish are being caught however with the afternoon hours
      on sunny days proving to be most productive.&nbsp; Heavy chumming is a
      must and you must give each spot at least a half hour in order for the
      cold and sluggish fish to respond to the chum.&nbsp; Fish are being caught
      on the Heckscher Park Grounds and West Channel.&nbsp; Good luck in the
      upcoming fishing season.</font></b></p>
