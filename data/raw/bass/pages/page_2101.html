On April 30, 1998, I participated in an extraordinary event at the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts.  
<P> Those who know me or who have read my article <A HREF ="/articles/serpent/serpent.html"><STRONG>Tempted 
  by a Serpent</STRONG></A> know of my interest and love for that ancient musical 
  instrument that has survived over 400 years in its original form. As a trombonist, 
  there is something quite special about playing an insrument made of wood and 
  leather, accustomed as I am to usually holding something of brass. 
<P>
When Darcy Kuronen, Keeper of the Musical Instrument Collection at the Boston 
Museum of Fine Arts asked if I would be willing to participate in a lecture/demonstration
about the serpent, it was easy to say an emphatic <STRONG>YES!</STRONG>  The
evening turned out to be great fun - those who came heard Gary Stewart, Conservator
at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami Beach, speak about serpent construction and history 
while I performed several pieces on various instruments and discussed the instrument's
playing characteristics.
<P>
By examining the collection of serpents and related instruments in the Boston MFA 
collection, I learned a great deal and my interest has been piqued to learn even more.
This was especially nice as the MFA only has room to display one serpent in its 
public collection - this was an opportunity to see all the instruments the museum
owns.
In a few months, I will be adding a page of photographs of all the serpents I can find in 
Boston, along with a bit of their history in an effort to share with the internet
community the fine instruments that our city boasts.

 <P>
 
The following photos will give viewers an idea of what happened on the "Serpent
Night" at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

      Several days before the lecture/demonstration, I visited the MFA Musical 
      Instrument Gallery to talk things over with Darcy Kuronen. I brought along 
      my Baudouin serpent (1801) to test out the acoustics of the room (which 
      were quite nice, although the low frequencies caused the light fixtures 
      to rattle occasionally). In this photo, you can see several brass instruments 
      behind me, including an E flat tuba on the right and keyed bugles and other 
      trumpet-like instruments. </td>

      I brought with me two church serpents to demonstrate at the program. The 
      first (left) is my 1996 church serpent in C, made by the Christopher Monk 
      Workshop in London. It is a copy of a 1810 Church Serpent by Baudouin, constructed 
      of walnut and covered with leather. The closeup below shows the beautiful 
      walnut and the engraved bell mount, which reads, "Douglas Yeo, Boston Symphony 
      Orchestra - September 1996 - Made at the Christopher Monk Workshops by Keith 
      Rogers and Nicholas Perry." The bell mount, bocal and receiver are brass 
      with silver plate. <IMG ALIGN=LEFT height=201 width=220 border=0 SRC="/articles/serpent_night/dymonkint.jpg">

      The other church serpent I brought to the MFA is a new item I acquired in 
      Paris on the 1998 Boston Symphony European tour. It is an 1801 Church Serpent 
      in C by Baudouin (France), made of pearwood covered with leather, with two 
      keys (for b natural and f sharp). This is an extraordinary instrument, with 
      its original ivory mouthpiece. The closeup (below) shows the stamp of Baudouin's 
      workshop and evidence of a repair that was made over a century ago - the 
      small pyramid shape pin gives a clue that a violin maker repaired the bottom 
      bow of the instrument. <IMG ALIGN=LEFT height=201 width=220 border=0 SRC="/articles/serpent_night/ckinterior.jpg">

      As I mentioned earlier, the MFA only has room to display one serpent in 
      their permanent collection. Here is the museum's Baudouin serpent (1820) 
      in situ, next to a buccin (International Trombone Association members will 
      recognize this instrument as the "logo" of the ITA, based on a buccin owned 
      by New England Conservatory). The serpent and buccin can be found immediately 
      to one's left as you enter the gallery along with a "pavillon chinois" beter 
      known as a "Jingling Johnnie" or a "Turkish Crescent," a percussion instrument 
      used by Berlioz in his "Symphonie funebre et triomphale" and by John Philip 
      Sousa in his march, "Nobles of The Mystic Shrine." </td>

      For the presentation, Darcy Kuronen had displayed six serpents and related

      The serpent jewel of the MFA collection is their 1820 Baudouin keyless serpent 
      (on the left end of the table). The card reads: <STRONG>Serpent, C. Baudouin, 
      Paris, About 1820. Pearwood covered with leather. Leslie Lindsey Mason Collection, 
      17.1954</STRONG>. The bocal and ivory mouthpiece are not original to this 
      instrument. While it has a bit of "worm rot" and is leaky, it is a fine 
      specimen. Next to it (moving to the right, and shown only partially) is 
      the museum's other serpent, another Baudouin which tag reads: <STRONG>Serpent, 
      C. Baudouin, Paris, About 1820. Pearwood covered with leather. Gift of Joseph 
      R. Coolidge in memory of his wife, Peggy Stuart Coolidge. 1981.760</STRONG>. 
      Note the ivory inserts in the six holes on the serpent which were added 
      sometimes to either improve pitch (the technique usually did not succeed) 
      or help the player locate the holes more easily. </td>

Moving further down the table to the right, this photo shows the collection's
second Baudouin serpent mentioned above and an interesting instrument (I don't recall
the details about this instrument) made of an animal horn with brass mouthpiece
and brass bell - a truly remarkable sound.  On its right is an
upright serpent (known also as
a "Russian Bassoon" although it is neither Russian nor a bassoon) - basically
a serpent that is made in two straight tubes with a curve at the bottom.  It is 
described as: <STRONG>Upright serpent (Russian bassoon), unknown maker,
possibly Belgium, about 1820.  Maple body, brass trim, 4 round keys in saddles.  
Leslie  Lindsey Mason Collection, 17.1955</STRONG>. This instrument was 
recently restored by Gary Stewart and is a truly beautiful instrument.

At the end of the table are two bass horns (above), a bit further down the

      Following Gary's presentation, I took the floor to demonstrate serpent playing 
      and discuss their playing characteristics. I performed several serpent etudes 
      from French serpent method books, some plain chant (serpents were created 
      originally to accompany the singing of chant in the Roman Catholic Church). 
      I also performed an excerpt from Berlioz' <STRONG>Messe solennelle</STRONG> 
      and some of Simon Proctor's <STRONG>Serpent Concerto</STRONG> which I performed 
      in 1997 with the Boston Pops Orchestra and the Boston Classical Orchestra. 
      Between my live excerpts, I played recorded examples of serpent playing 
      in context, featuring performances by the great French serpentist, Michel 
      Godard, and myself. </td>

      I had yet two special surprises for those in attendance at the event. Commissioned 
      by Phil and Connie Palmer, and through Connie's generosity, the Anaconda 
      serpent, "George" (so named because he was completed on St. Georges' Day 
      - April 23, 1991) had been shipped to Boston for the evening. The Anaconda 
      is 16 feet long, twice as big as a regular 8 foot long church serpent. Made 
      by Christopher Monk in 1989, it is not an exact copy of the only other Anaconda 
      (1840, Huddersfield, England; now in the Edinburgh Museum), but was inspired 
      by it. It was one of the last serpents Christopher Monk completed before 
      his death in 1991. [NB. In 2000, Connie Palmer made a decision to part with 
      "George" and in November 2000, I was happy to welcome this remarkable instrument 
      to my collection.] </td>

      "George" has a remarkable sound, an octave lower than a C church serpent. 
      His six keys have pads rather like a saxophone that cover the large holes. 
      I played several pieces for the audience including the <STRONG>Dies irae</STRONG> 
      chant, <STRONG>Old Man River</STRONG> (somehow it just seemed appropriate) 
      and the "Hornpipe" from Handel's <STRONG>Water Music</STRONG>. When I played 
      the pedal 16 foot C, George's lowest note, at least one person present reported 
      his sinuses cleared! </td>

      There was yet one surprise left for the audience. Since I had the world's 
      largest serpent in the room, it only seemed appropriate that the world's 
      smallest serpent make an appearance. Through the generosity of my friend, 
      Craig Kridel, I was able to demonstrate one of Christopher Monk's "worm" 
      serpents - one that was owned by Christopher Monk himself. </td>

      I played <STRONG>La Marseillaise</STRONG> on the "worm" which was great 
      fun - it is a soprano serpent, 1/4 the size of a standard 8 foot long serpent. 
      While Christopher Monk originally made the "worm" as a novelty item, I felt 
      it important to actually play some music on it which I did, with some difficulty 
      (my bass trombone trained embouchure was not entirely happy with the small 
      wooden mouthpiece on the "worm"!). There has been, in fact, a piece composed 
      that utilizes the "worm" (the <STRONG>Amherst Suite</STRONG> by Simon Proctor. 
      As you can see, the "worm" is a bit awkward to hold (and also is without 
      any historical precedent) but playing it made a great conclusion to a memorable 
      evening. </td>

One of the nicest things about the event was the fact that many friends came to
watch and listen.  Among them were two serpentists who travelled great distances
just to be a part of a gathering that was about the serpent.  Pictured above are
Therese (Tra) Wagenknecht (left) from Virginia who is the person who most frequently 
played "George" when that instrument was owned by Connie and Phil Palmer,
and Paul Schmidt (right, holding my Baudouin serpent) of Illinois,
Editor of the "Serpent Newsletter."  It was wonderful of them to come and
lend their support.

<P> The evening ended too soon, but the good news is that I will be back at the 
  MFA to further explore their serpent collection, and those which are owned by 
  the Boston Symphony as well. Watch my site for further serpent updates, and
