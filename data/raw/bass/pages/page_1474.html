<p>Phil Galitzine stands perched on the Case Green stage, his hair tucked beneath his trademark red bandana, as he plucks the strings of his bass guitar. Around him students play frisbee or strum guitars of their own; yet Phil is playing for an audience of only one person, himself. Phil rips through a few chords of his favorite classic rock tune, or maybe a track of the Counting Crows' "Recovering the Satellites," before packing up bass, turning his powerful instrument into a shield that he wears upon his back.</p>
<p>Such an image is typical of many fall and spring afternoons, whose spirit seems to live between the strings of Phil's bass. To some he is that kid who plays the bass on sunny afternoons, while to others he is the quietest rock star playing the college circuit.</p>
<p>Phil is not always quiet. One must only mention the name of one of his favorite bands, Radiohead and Bjork, in order to unleash the sounds once expressed solely through his instrument. A small, unabashedly honest smirk begins to arise across Phil's face as he discusses a song he just heard or learned how to play. Though not a rock star yet, Phil is plucking his way through the college rock scene.</p>
<p>Phil first picked up a bass in the spring of tenth grade, with the hopes of playing in a band. "I chose bass because I figured that if all my friends played guitar, I would be in higher demand than if I just played guitar as well," admits Phil. After taking lessons for a year, Phil began practicing on his own. "I acquired the majority of my skills from learning the baselines of the entire Red Hot Chili Peppers album, 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'," he continued. Since 1996, Phil has made good use of his self taught skills by playing with his band, Velvet Frogg, named after a episode of Seinfeld. The group began playing together in high school for fun, though Phil says a career in music is his ultimate goal. Now juniors in college, the group draws 200 people to shows throughout New York City and the greater metropolitan area. Velvet Frogg has packed notable clubs, such as the Lion's Den, on numerous occasions and even shared a bill with popular jam band Conehead Buddha. The group also recorded a well received album, Faces, which mixed studio material and live tracks. On November 21, Phil and Velvet Frogg will take one step closer to rock stardom when the group plays on the main stage of the legendary Wetlands Preserve, the same week as Dispatch and Phish's lyricist Tom Marshall.</p>
<p>Though a music major, Phil has also taken his love of sound into the world of theater. "I can't help it," Phil says , "I have theater in my blood." Phil can often be seen sitting on the couch in the JKB green room, replacing his bandana with a pair of headphones, given to him by the cast of last Fall's "The Book of Tink," as a testament to his love of the sounds which help bring theater to life. As the headphones pump music into Phil's open ears, he muses over his most recent theater position, that of sound designer for "The Misanthrope." Though Phil designed sound for the studio productions of "Before Breakfast" and "Rodents and Radios," this project will be Phil's first as sound designer on the main stage. "There are a lot of punctuation noises and ambient noises in the play," says Phil, who is utilizing JKB's computer sound program to digitally edit the material. Right now Phil is trying to define the role of "comic sound," which he feels is an important part of the play's poetic rhythm and pace.As his busy semester winds down, Phil plans on working on a new album with his band and continuing to expand their already loyal following. Phil also hopes to compose music of upcoming theater productions at Skidmore, a task he has prepared for by taking numerous courses in music theory and technology. Though one day people may pay to hear Phil play his bass on the Case Green stage, their presence will never fully capture the enjoyment one senses when they quickly pass by Phil and his trusty low thumping steed. For, as Phil plucks the strings of his bass, he is not just bringing a well-rehearsed song, but a love of music, to the ears of those who are lucky enough to hear his phatty sounds.</p>
