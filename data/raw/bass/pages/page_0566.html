<p><!-- <img src="images/gorilla.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="This is one big hummer of a bass to drag out of the jungle that is a chestnut bed." width="222" height="341"> --><b>Water Chestnut</b> <i>(trapa natans)</i> is an aquatic vegetation found in the northeast US -- primarily in the Hudson River and attached waterways (Mowhawk River/Erie Canal, and the Champlain Canal and lower end of Lake Champlain). <img src="images/chestnut.jpg" width="313" height="420" border="0" alt="This is some NASTY stuff" align="left">It is also  found in some sections of the Connecticut River in Massachusetts, and in the Charles River in Massachusetts. In the past, water chestnut has been reported in the Chesapeake, but to my knowledge, it's not currently found there.

<p>When it was found establishing itself in a cove off the Connecticut River in Connecticut in the summer of 1999, the <a href="http://www.newstimes.com/archive99/aug1299/lco.htm" target="blank">Department of Environmental Protection people just about wet themselves they were so worried about it.</a> Spokesman David Leff -- never one to pass up an opportunity for <i>on camera face time </i> --held a news conference about how important it was to eradicate this plant. He called a water chestnut bed <i>&quot;an aquatic wasteland&quot;</i> and said that <i>&quot;absolutely nothing&quot;</i> lives in water blanketed by water chestnut.</p><p>While I admit I'm not sympathetic to the position, I do understand the concern, because from a <i>non-fishing</i> perspective, water chestnut certainly fits into the <i>noxious weed</i> category. But as far at it being an <i>&quot;aquatic wasteland&quot;</i> is concerned, the statement is 100% counter to reality. I don't know if it's a matter of ignorance or intent to mislead. If the former, it is an absolute embarrassment that an official of the DEP could be that clueless regarding a subject in the field in which he supposedly has expertise. If the latter... well, that's something I don't even want to think about. If Mr. Leff had ever actually gone into a chestnut bed with a fishing rod, he might have some clue just how much life exists in one.</p>

<p>Water chestnut is fast growing, but does not tolerate cold water. It doesn't begin to show itself until the water passes the 60 degree mark in the spring, and starts to die off rapidly in the fall as soon as the water drops into the low sixties. It does tolerate <i>(even seems to prefer)</i> dingy water, moderate current, and fluctuating water levels. Thus its domination in tidal environments.</p>

<p>Among bass anglers who ply these waters the vegetation is more commonly referred to as just <i>chestnut</i>, or simply <i>'nut</i>. The last few years, I've noticed a tendency among some anglers to pluralize it, but it's not the plural you want here, but the cumulative, and that's the same spelling as the singular.</p>
 <p>For those not familiar with water chestnut, it is the nastiest, and maybe the  <i>toughest-to-fish</i> aquatic vegetation on the planet. In my opinion, it's also the most productive and most fun, once you've mastered it. It's been described as <i>&quot;pads on steriods&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;barbed wire with leaves.&quot;</i> Neither term really does the stuff justice. The surface and above surface leaves are tough, and can present what seems an impenetrable surface layer. But it's the mess underneath that <b>really</b> makes it challenging. Air bladders, thick, stringy stems in the upper &quot;crown&quot; portion, the nut itself, and then the &quot;vine&quot; that looks and feels like a big, strong, hairy rope. This is good stuff, from the fish's point of view. But be careful not to let the bow of the boat into the bed unless you've got a really ballsy electric motor, because if it doesn't stop the electric cold, it'll just shake it out of its mount.</p>
<h1>Gearing up for the Nut</h1>
<p>Flipping stick at a minimum. You're going to have to lean on some fish to get them out. Might as well have a rod you can lean on with confidence. I've given serious consideration to a 7-&frac12; foot Musky rod, but the handle seems too long. May have to look into a flipping stick built on a musky rod blank.</p><p>

If you're serious about fishing chestnut, avoid mono and spool up with Fireline or the like. Mono strong enough to handle the load is too thick to slice the vegetation, so you end up dragging 30 pounds of assorted chestnut plant parts to the boat with most every fish, and you land far fewer of the ones you get a hook in at all. When you start fishing the 'nut, odds are, your first reaction will be to go too heavy as far as line size. <img src="images/leaning.jpg" width="355" height="275" border="0" alt="You're going to have to lean on fish to move them out of the jungle, so use tackle sturdy enough to lean on." align="right">I'd rather have line thin enough to slice  the stuff than line strong enough to rip 30 pounds of it free and drag it to the boat, which is what you end up doing all too often with line that's too thick. I guess it's always a compromise, but I have pretty much settled on 30 pound Fireline, although I keep 20 on my backup rod and that sometimes sees to work even better. I <b>have</b> broken the 20 on a hard hookset with a short line, but I've also had 30 not slice the nut easily enough, and had fish get off because of it. Like I said, it's always a compromise. Which way you lean is up to you. Thirty pound Fireline works great for me, but I'll continue to experiment as superlines continue to evolve. One way or another though, I guarantee you'll land more fish from the nut with a thin, no-stretch, superline than mono of any test.</p>
<h1>Nut lures</h1>
<p>As far as lures and terminal tackle are concerned, more than 90% of my chestnut bass are caught on soft plastic lures, most of which fit into the &quot;creature bait&quot; category.  In past years, about half of them came on a Zoom <a href="http://www.zoombaits.com/lures.cfm?m=Brush%20Hog" target="blank">Brush Hog</a>, and most of those on a green pumpkin Brush Hog with the twister tails broken off. But as of 2004, I have switched over to <a href="http://www.lunkercity.com/lures/ozmo.gif">Lunker City's new Ozmo</a> creature bait. It just looks nastier and more like something that should live in the nut.</p><p>


<p>Other soft plastics I use regularly in the nut include Lunker City's <a href="http://www.lunkercity.com/widow.html" target="blank">Water Widow</a> and 7" <a href="http://www.lunkercity.com/hg.html" target="blank">Hellgie</a>, Zoom's <a href="http://www.zoombaits.com/lures.cfm?m=Speed%20Worm" target="blank">Speed Worm</a>, and SnakeBite's 4" <a href="http://www.snakebite.net/Flippincraws.htm" target="blank">Flippin' Craw</a>. Green pumpkin is the favored color in all of these, but I also use the Widow in Red Shad, and both the Brush Hog and the MegaCraw in Black Emerald. The common thread running through my soft plastic lure selection is a relatively fat body or fore-section to take the abuse without needing re-rigging every time you have to jerk it free of a hang, and a relatively short body to direct the strikes towrd the hook. I believe the 2nd factor is espicially important in situations where the fish is unlikely to get a clear look or shot at the &quot;prey&quot; it's attacking.</p><p>
<img src="images/texposed_tucked.jpg" width="175" height="167" border="0" alt="sample 'Texposed & Tucked' rigging" align="left">All of these lures are rigged "Texposed and Tucked" on a 3/0 Lunker City <a href="http://www.lunkercity.com/tph.html" target="blank">Texposer</a> hook that I've <a href="../fishtips/rebarb.html" target="blank">rebarbed</a>, behind a pegged slip sinker of 3/8 to 1/2 ounce.</p>
<p>I know guys who flip just about nothing other than a fat, flipping tube in the nut. I guess I have a sour taste in my mouth as far as flipping tubes in this stuff goes, because I missed several fish in a row the first time I tried it, then switched back to a tail-less brush hog and never missed any. Personal prejudice, but I'm stuck with it. I used to flip a jig into the nut quite a bit, but just find the Slip sinkered/T-rigged plastic to go through cleaner in both directions, so I don't often go there any more.</p>
<p>My most current presentation experiments deal with drop shotting the chestnut. Using  a 3/4 or 1 oz Bakudan drop shot weight, if the depth under the nut is fairly consistent, it works well, quickly pulling the lure into the exact position I want it. The Bakudan Magnum is designed to penetrate cover cleanly on the way in <b>and</b> on the way out, and works really well.</p>
<p>Of course there is some application for a lure sliding across the top<img src="images/nut_salad_spoon.jpg" width="307" height="397" border="0" align="right" alt="When they'll hit something sliding over the top, take advantage of their aggressiveness."> of the stuff, rather than poking down beneath it. Lunker City's <a href="http://www.lunkercity.com/sal.html" target="blank">Salad Spoon</a> is prime for this, as is any metal weedless spoon, of which my favorite (by a long shot) is the Rexx Spoon. Then again, some days, we'll just drag the same weighted plastic that we're flipping into the pockets, across the top of the nut. The bass sure can't see much through the stuff, so it's more a matter of them just striking at the movement. Which also means that 90% of the time, even when they are smashing something sliding over the top of the salad, you don't get hooks into most of them. You're really just looking for a fish to show itself, so you'll have a high percentage place to flip, and actually hooking and landing one with the spoon is something of a bonus.</p>

<h1>Anatomy of a Nut Bed</h1>
<p><b>The Surface Salad</b> Most well formed water chestnut beds have at least two edges. The edge of the weedbed itself, of course. But there's most often another edge, depending on the age of the bed, the time of the season and a host of other factors. Around the deepest growing edge of the bed, the leaves are usually one layer thick, laying flat on the surface. In the middle of the bed, they are often several layers thick and curled up away from the surface a bit. And there is typically a distinct edge there. That edge is a key element, and is often instrumental in helping us develop a pattern as to where in a chestnut bed the fish are. Are they in the single layer stuff, or back in the really tough stuff? If they are in the single layer stuff, are they in areas where it's a band only a few feet wide, or areas where it's a long cast back to the edge of the curled up stuff?</p>
<p><b>Under the mat</b> What we see on top is not really indicative of what the fish deals with underneath. This isn't some namby-pamby lily pad bed where individual stems reach up to a single leaf on the top. The 6 to 12&quot; just under those floating leaves is a dense tangle of tough, fibrous &quot;branches&quot; each equipped with a flotation bladder. The nut itself is in there, too. Beneath that mess are the rope-like main stems, with those hairs hanging off, flowing in the current. An aquatic botanist once explained to me that those hairs are pretty unique, and that there's really no structural difference between them and the roots of the plant, yet the ones higher on the stem create clorophyl, so they technically function as leaves, while the ones in the bottom mud absorb nutrients and function as roots.</p>
<p>In waters where the level fluctuates, the underwater stems will be long enough to reach the surface at the highest water levels, so at any other time in the cycle, they are either slack or laid out more horizontally, as the bed flows with the current to the end of the stem &quot;tether&quot; This is probably why chestnut does so well in tidal water as compared to most other aquatic vegetation.</p>

<p><b>Outside the bed.</b> You really have to consider the area just outside a chestnut bed as part of the bed, because predator and prey alike will move in and out of chestnut at times. Especially if there's other weed growth outside the bed (typically scattered milfoil patches), you have to consider it part of the overall pattern.</p>
<p>One pattern I've noted time and again is that the depth of the water immediately adjacent to the chestnut bed is a key element in quickly locating productive areas. But don't make the mistake of assuming it's always better where there's decent water depth available. I've seen as many days where the key seemed to be limiting my efforts to areas where there was less than 3 feet of water outside the bed as those days when the fish seemed most active in areas where the bed reached out to 10 feet or more of water. Best thing to do, is whenever you catch a fish, roll a fish, or even see baitfish flipping around on top of the nut in an apparent escape attempt, make note of the depth you're in at the time. Pay attention and patterns will emerge.</p>
<h1>Dissecting a Nut Bed</h1>
<p><b>Edges</b> Duh.<img src="images/nut_bass.jpg" width="250" height="352" border="0" align="right" alt="Bass are creatures of the edge. Don't forget that when you're attacking a chestnut bed."> We're talking about bass here, right? Is it possible to overstate the importance of edges in any type of fish holding habitat when the subject is bass? The edge of the nut bed itself. The edge where two different densities of nut bed meet abruptly, or where another type of vegetation abuts a bed of water chestnut. All are important. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the most logical place to bring this up, but there's another edge related deal that occurs in 'nut fishing that bears keeping in mind. If you've got chestnut, odds are you've also got an ongoing weed harvesting program. New York and Vermont each have weed eating crews working on Lake Champlain in the summer. There's several on the Hudson as well, and I've seen the weed choppers out there trying to contend with the stuff on the Oxbow section of the Connecticut River in Massachusetts as well.</p>
<p>Most bass anglers avoid the weed eaters. <b>Don't!</b> A chestnut bed might be the most food rich area of a lake. But the food is tough to get at. When the vegies are ripped from the water and piled on the deck of the weed eater, huge amounts of prey -- minnows, frogs, bugs, invertebrates -- everything that lives in the nut --  gets displaced. Some of the food escapes from the jaws of the weed eaters. Some comes squirming out of the pile of greenery on deck and finds its way back into the water. Either way, there's a glut of displaced and disoriented prey, including lots of injured prey in the open water behind the path of the weed eating machine. If you don't think that bass (as well as whatever other predators live in the area) will take advantage of that windfall feeding situation, then maybe you should consider golf.</p>

<p><b>Holes</b> Axiom one in nut fishing. Never pass up a hole. Whether it's a 6&quot; hole or a 6' hole; whether it's caused by a change in bottom contour, or it's left over from someone catching (or missing) a fish there earlier; Even if it was caused by your partner at the other end of the boat setting the hook 2 minutes ago, <b>flip a lure into every hole in the mat you can!</b></p>

<p>I guess I should differentiate between existing holes and <i>fresh rippage</i>. As far as existing holes are concerned, what we see as a hole in the surface cover, the fish see as a beam of light in their shaded world. Any prey or forage out in the light is easily visible to them, but cannot see into the dark. It's an easy capture for the predatory bass. Especially on bright days, actively feeding bass position themselves in prime ambush spots. It would be dumb to not put our lures into the spots they are positioned to ambush in.</p>
<p>Rippage is what we call the holes in a 'nut bed created by yanking a fish through, or by setting the hook and coming up with a big wad of vegetation. Most of the time, rippage &quot;<i>heals</i>&quot; in a couple days. And day old rippage is pretty much like any other existing hole. But <i>fresh rippage</i> holes are important for another reason. Bass -- even under a heavy cover mat -- are often found in groups. I don't think large fish in ambush feeding situations can be thought of as a school, but I do contend that the conditions that make one part of a vast area of seemingly similar cover attractive to one feeding bass, probably make it attractive to more feeding bass as well. Where one is feeding, odds are that several are feeding. Slow down and try to tempt a few more bites when you're in a spot that you know a fish fed recently.</p>

<p>I also suspect that the sound of a fish trying to feed in this cover attracts nearby bass that are looking for an easy capture. How often have we seen more bass following a hooked bass or even attempting to grab the lure away from a hooked bass? Why would the same thing not happen in a nut bed? The initial commotion of a fish getting hooked doesn't scare other fish away, it attracts them.</p>

<p><b>Floating &quot;stuff&quot;</b> Logs, boards, basketballs, broken docks, whatever you've seen floating around in the lake or river somehow seems to find its way into chestnut beds, where it gets "trapped". Don't be a dummy. Fish it.</p>

<h1>The Methods</h1>
<p><b>Over the Top</b> Your weedless spoon, Salad Spoon<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> or other Texas rigged plastic, cast across the thinner spots or areas where there are holes or gaps, or where the nut is spotty. Experiment with cadence, but for the most part you want to swim it across the surface at a fairly steady clip. An exception would be working it across a fairly solid expanse, then pausing to let it linger (or sink, depending on the lure) at the edge of a hole in the surface mat.
</p>
This can be a really exciting way to fish when the fish are aggressive. There will be days during the course of the year that the fish seem to really lock in on the top of the salad, and you might even approach a 50% hookup ratio. But more often, you're just looking to draw strikes or make fish move. When a fish gives away its location by responding to something sliding over its head, go back as quickly as possible with something that penetrates into its world.<img src="images/nut_pike.jpg" width="275" height="420" border="0" align="right" alt="Largemouth aren't the only predators living under that expanse of water chestnut">

<p><b>Flipping the Thicket</b> If you include pitching, this is what about 95% of nut fishing is all about. Take something that looks edible and jiggle it through a hole in the nut. Sometimes, precision flipping to tiny holes and pockets pays off. But 90% of the time, I do better by pitching onto the mat, dragging the lure to a thin spot or hole, and letting it settle. I believe the commotion of the lure coming across the top alerts fish in the immediate area that something is alive up there.</p>
<p>Other than looking for holes, irregularities, floating debris and rippage, the most important thing to watch for is activity. Sometimes you'll see movement of the nut -- a bulge or just a few leaves moving sideways as a sizeable fish swims through the jungle beaneath. Sometimes you'll see (or hear) a fish actually take a meal out of the greenery. Other times, you might notice a baitfish or two flipping and flapping about on top of the surface mat. Caught between a rock and a hard place, as it were - chased out of the water, trying to get back through, but almost sure to be eaten when it does. Whatever the case, when you observe activity in the nut bed, fish the immediate area thoroughly.</p>
<p>OK, here's the biggie. <img src="images/nut2.jpg" width="276" height="295" border="0" alt="When you see activity, get a lure in there NOW!" align="left">The single piece of information that will help you more than anything else when it comes to flipping the nut. Don't let your lure sink more than a 12&quot; to 18&quot; beneath the surface. There's a tendency whenever we're fishing a weighted plastic or a jig type lure to let it sink all the way to bottom. Some anglers go so far as to use excess weight to get it to plummet through the cover even faster. Don't do it. Well, don't do it except when your lure is within a foot or so of the outermost edge of the nut bed, anyway.</p>
<p>Here's the deal. Most of the cover is at the top and the shade is most dense immediately under the thick canopy. That's where the predators lie in wait, scanning the open, &quot;lit&quot; water in the holes, waiting for  unsuspecting prey to happen by. They look out. They look up. They don't look down. So don't let your lure sink past where the bass in that nut bed are looking for food!</p>
<p>I'm not saying there are never any bass closer to bottom in a chestnut bed. But <b>feeding</b> bass will be tight to the canopy, or patrolling the outer edge. Bass on bottom, way back in the heavy stuff aren't feeding. Fishing inactive fish in cover this heavy over such a broad area is self defeating. If the thick nut is worth fishing, you don't have to go to the bottom. Just pitch, flip or drag the bait to an opening, jiggle it through, let it sink a foot or so, jiggle it a few times, raise it till you feel it contact the bottom of the heavy tangle of "stuff" just under the floating mat, and try to hold motionless there for a few seconds. Maybe drop it back down a bit once or twice. If you haven't been bit, lift it out and put it in the next likely crease. On the other hand, when working the edge of the bed, you're always in a high enough percentage spot that letting the lure sink all the way into the crease at the base of the vegetation is a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>When you get bit with a lure pitched into a hole in the chestnut, <b>if</b> the fish moves, let it pull the rod tip down before you rear back. But often as not, I just sense &quot;something&quot; in the resistance on the other end, and there's no actual movement. Like a fish just swims up to the bait nuzzling against the bottom of the thickest tangle <i>(as a small fish foraging on whatever lives there might do, perhaps?)</i> and closes it's mouth on it. My best advice, is whenever something doesn't feel right, swing, and <b>swing hard!</b> You'll lose far more fish by letting them swim 5 or 6 feet under the stuff, than you will miss by setting too soon.</p>
<p><b>Off the Edge</b> There will be days -- particularly in very late summer, it seems to me, but possible any time the nut is up -- when most of the fish will come right off the edge, or out of the bigger holes or the thinner patches. When you get a feel for an <i>edge bite,</i> there are a few different strategies that will often increase your catch rate dramatically.
<ul><img src="images/fin-s_bass.jpg" width="290" height="451" border="0" alt="A golden shiner Fin-F fish is the author's first choice for catching them just outside the cover." align="right"><li>Move the boat back a few yards, and concentrate on the outermost foot or two of the nut growth, and let your lure sink all the way to bottom. Feel for clumps of milfoil or other vegetation just outside the nut bed.<li>Cast ahead of the path of the boat with a soft jerkbait <i>(the <b>only</b> soft jerkbait I use around the nut beds is a 5-3/4" Golden Shiner Fin-S Fish.)</i> dropping the lure on the edge, then sliding it off, letting it sing a bit, then darting it away quickly.<li>From a similar position to that described above, toss a rather large single bladed spinnerbait and let it flutter down just outside the nut, then slow roll it back to the boat.</ul> All of these methods have produced quality fish for me when the bite seemed related to the nut bed, but not within its boundaries per s&eacute;. All though, are secondary to the main nut busting pattern -- flipping and pitching the holes and creases. <p>When moving across an area of thin, scattered growth between heavier beds, I will usually just swim my Texas rigged soft plastic lure from clump to clump as I boogie across the area, pausing it for a few seconds as it hits a patch of nut. But if I get bit -- or even just rolled at -- as the lure is swimming between clumps, I'll take it as a sign the fish are out and roaming, which tells me to kick the electric down off high speed and grab my spinnerbait rod.</p>
<p><img src="images/spinnerbait.gif" width="246" height="200" border="0" alt="" align="left">Speaking of the spinnerbait, in October or thereabouts, when the chestnut beds start to really deteriorate as the water temperatures drop, grab a big, nasty, bright colored spinnerbait, and fish through the dying beds. There's a few day period each year when it seems like the entire population of 'nut bass is exposed as their home dies off, but they haven't left the area yet. Just as they find themselves out in the open, so does the prey that lived in the nut bed. The bass (and pike) hang in there to take advantage of the easy pickins. So should you.</p>
<h1>That's pretty much it.</h1>
<p>Water Chestnut is despised by lake front residents. By DEP and DEC types, too. Even by fishermen who don't know how to fish it. But the bass flat out love it. In fact, that might be why anglers who can't cope with it don't like it. Because most of the bass in the area will use it if it's there, so its presence often seems to make fishing tougher in other likely looking spots. But learn to fish it, and you'll love it too.</p>
