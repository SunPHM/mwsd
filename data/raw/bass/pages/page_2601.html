<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Dear Ron,<BR>
Thank you for setting up a great fishing and hunting trip for
my boy, Spencer, and me last week on Lake Okeechobee. Everything
worked out fine. Spencer, who is twelve, and I were thrilled to
find out we were going to use an air boat with you for fishing.
It was exciting to see how dense the glades and lake were with
wildlife. The fish were abundant.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">The hog
hunt was excellent. Our guides, Dick, and his son John, were totally
professional people all the way. They were great to be with. All
their dogs knew the program. Dick and John made us feel right
at home and handled all aspects of the hunt just right. They never
fussed over Spencer's age. He acted right with his weapon so they
pretty much treated him as an adult. That made it possible for
me to have a really good time.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">We shot
two boar hogs in wooded rough patches in the cane fields. Spencer
was up first and used a Winchester Trapper .44 magnum with a 246
grain copper jacketed hollow point that took the hog down on the
first shot. I used the same round in my Marlin .44 magnum but
it took two shots since he didn't seem to notice the first one
that went trough the shoulder area while he was fighting with
the dogs. I didn't get their weights.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">Dick and
John did a careful and thorough job of skinning and butchering
both hogs. John cut a five inch front section off the snout of
my hog so we could get the tusks; the top and bottom front sections
of the jaw bones are almost clean after only one week of leaving
them in the back yard with a cover over top and dousing them with
a pot of boiling water every other day or so. We brought the head
of Spencer's hog to Tyson's to mount. He was very easy to deal
with. We probably could have used a map to help find Tyson's house
down a farm road in Okeechobee.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Comic Sans MS">I would
highly recommend Dick and John as guides and we hope to come back.</FONT></CENTER></P>
