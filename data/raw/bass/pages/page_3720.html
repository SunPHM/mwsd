    Sunk by fire on July 9th, 1898</p>
    <p>We headed out to celebrate the anniversary of the sinking of this steamship as we do 
    every year. This year the project was not only dive the wreck and look for artifacts, fish 
    and lobsters, but salvage her bow bits or deck cleats. For this project we planned to use 
    two 500 pillow float bags from <a href="http://subsalve.com" target="_blank">SubSalve, Inc</a>. 
    to float the bits to while on the surface and one 500lb <a href="http://subsalve.com"
    target="_blank">SubSalve Commercial</a> lift bag to raise the bits from the wreck to the 
    surface. The bits were deemed 'light' enough to use the boat gin pole and tackle and lift 
    the bits onto our stern and bring them home. Weight was estimated at 300 pounds.</p>
    <p>Conditions on the wreck were a very dark, but clear 20ft vis. Barbara &amp; I found a 
    leaded glass dessert cup, brass latch, some brass shoe buttons and several brass deck 
    spikes. Jeff found some bell shaped copper weights. A few lobster, Sea Bass and a few 
    Blackfish were also caught.</p>

    John Moffatt ( center ) did the bulk of the dive work attaching the bags. Jeff and Bill 
    worked on the surface insuring that they stayed there!<br>

    SubSalve liftbags made the job easy enough a 5 year-old could do it!</p>

    the Delaware tied up at her ports of call, mooring lines were tied around these very bits, 
    making safe her docking at such harbors as Havana, Cuba, Charleston, SC and New York City.</p>
