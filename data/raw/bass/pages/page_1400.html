<font size="2"><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.blogblogblog.com/2003/11-15-mammoth/Images/IMGP0226.jpg" width="500" BORDER=0 ALT="Me and matt playing music for someone's feet"></CENTER><br /><br />So I played mixes of the songs for a bunch of people this weekend up in Mammoth, and they seemed to like it.  <A HREF="http://www.kenlayne.com/blogarchives/week_2003_11_16.html#003618">Ken blogged some real nice things</A>.  This project has been created in such a vacuum, it's hard to have any perspective on it.  Playing it for people is very helpful because I can get their reactions, even if they are non-verbal.  Plus I hear it differently when people are there.  Plus the mixes always sound different on different stereos.  So it's helpful at this stage.<br />In the end I recorded 16 songs, but the finished product is only going to be 12 songs.  "Memory Street" is cut for sure because I never really was satisfied with the words, plus it is the only one which has computer drums on it.  "Pause-Record" will be cut because even though it's a good song it just really doesn't fit with the others thematically or musically.   Another song called "Your guess is Better Than Mine" is probably going to be cut because while it's pretty good it's just a novelty song, and the novelty song slot is already taken up by "Race Day in the Garden."  Plus I'd like to save it and record it again with some kind of gang vocals on the choruses, and changing singers for each verse.  The last song I've decided to cut it "Mr. Berry," a song that everyone really liked but which is a bit too melodramatic and again doesn't fit with the mood of the album.  I'll probably post the cut songs as MP3's when the record is done.<br />I also decided to edit out one verse of an as yet untitled song.  It was going to be called "Box Full of Pictures," a line from a verse I wrote for it but didn't use, but then I was reminded that Wilco has a song called "Box Full of Letters."  The similarity is too much, considering that the line isn't even in the song.  Now I'm thinking of calling it Carton of Photos, or Collection of Snaps, or Tonight I'm Dreaming, or Email from Seattle, or Holding You.... Anyway, I hope to be able to edit the verse out on the computer.  I wrote it with three verses before the chourus, and it just isn't working that way.<br /><br />So, with those songs eliminated, the album should have a strong underlying theme and a relatively coherent sound, considering the range of a full-band sound to acoustic/voice folkyness.  <br />I'm very excited to have it finished, but there are a couple more things to do.  I am going to re-record the lead vocals on two songs, and record Molli and her sister doing backups on one more song.  I could keep futzing with it forever, but I really want to get it done and move on so I'm going to stop myself.  The thing about recording this slowly is that there's always one more song brewing that you could wait for.  But alas, it'll have to wait for the box set.</font><br>

<font size="2">I know I haven't been updating the studio blog lately, but I have been recording.  I figured a bunch of posts along the lines of "I recorded two vocal tracks when I got home from work yesterday" would be kind of boring.  But I've been making progress of the slow but steady kind, and in fact the end is in sight.  I've been sneaking in an hour here and two hours there, which is much different than how I've recorded before.  But it seems to be working. Sean seems to like it:<br /><br /><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.mcilvanity.com/blogs/pix/seancans.jpg" BORDER=0 ALT="Sean mit cans"></CENTER><br /> <br />I finished up with the third hard drive worth of songs, except for a couple backup vocals which I'm going to get some help on.  That disk had five songs on it, the three difficult ones with finger picking on them, one song I didn't have much hope for but which came out pretty good, and a total re-recording of a song which I'd done on the second disk.  I wasn't happy with the arrangement so I did it over.<br />I've now loaded the songs from the first disk which I was having technical difficulties with on to an entirely new disk.  I did lose some parts, but was able to salvage more than I thought I would.  These are the songs with drums on them.   I now have to do a couple rhythm guitar tracks, lead guitar tracks, and vocals on them.  There was one non-drums song on that disk which was a little messed up, so I decided to try to re-do it from scratch.  I created a drum loop using Steve's playing and it just may work.  Yesterday I recorded the acoustical guitars for that one, so now it needs bass, electric guitar, and vocals.<br />So there's light at the end of the tunnel.  I predict I'll be done tracking in a couple weeks.  <br />I've been doing a lot of vocals at 8 in the morning on the weekends when Molli takes Sean for a walk, which is an interesting time to be recording, or right when I get home from work and they are at the park.  In the end I have 16 new songs recorded.  I will probably take out a few when I do an official release.  It remains to be seen how the acoustic songs will sound next to the electric songs.  And who knows, perhaps I'll come up with a couple more.</font><br>

            <blockquote><a name="106262540589832902">&nbsp;</a> <font size="2">So, 
              I got a lot done recording over the weekend, but not quite as much 
              as I could have due to technological difficulties. The hard drive 
              I was using for the electric songs started doing weird things, cutting 
              out tiny bits of different tracks. I'd put in a larger disk than 
              I'd used before, and it seemed to be running much hotter than normal. 
              Once I noticed this, I spent valuable time backing stuff up, then 
              recorded more, noticed more problems, and backed up again. At that 
              point I switched disks and started in on the acoustic stuff. <br />
              The new (actually old) disk seemed to work fine, and I was able 
              to record the bulk of 7 songs on it. A few are done, a few need 
              a couple tracks added/redone, and I think one song needs to be re-done 
              completely due to an unsatisfactory arrangement.<br />
              I will load the electric tracks on to a new (old) disk at some point 
              and see if they are salvageable. If not, I still have the drum tracks 
              backed up and could start again from there. It was sort of a bummer, 
              but looking back I did get a lot done.<br />
              The good news is that the Taylor sounds awesome recorded. I used 
              a combination of mostly condenser microphone about a foot out with 
              just a touch of the internal pickup to add prescence. It sounds 
              really good and clean, and very dynamic.<br />
              In total I worked on 12 out of 15 finished songs, but depending 
              on when I can find time to work on them it is going to take awhile 
              to get the whole thing finished. I did record all three waltzes 
              though.</font><br>

              spent the weekend finalizing some lyrics and practicing. Mostly 
              I was trying to regain my guitar chops by playing along with the 
              bass/drums tracks over and over. This is good in two ways: it's 
              good practice and it makes it so you know the recording of the song 
              inside and out. When the time comes to lay down the rhythm guitar, 
              I know what both guitars (left and right channel) will play, and 
              I have a pretty good idea on what I'm gonna do with the solos. <img src="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/David_Boldinger/leftwine.jpg" border=0 alt="Hey Melanie, how do you get to Carnegie Hall?" align="right"><br />
              I listened to Willie Nelson's Spirit and IRS tapes and to Melanie's 
              Live at Carnegie Hall album to get an idea of how a well recorded 
              nylon string guitar should sound. Since the Melanie album is live 
              it didn't apply so much, but it was still fun to listen to. The 
              Willie, on the other hand, gave me something to shoot for. Of course 
              he has his own studio and probably some incredible mics and boards, 
              but still I think it was instructive. The IRS tapes is a great record 
              of just Willie and Trigger (his guitar) in the studio running through 
              a ton of his songs. Spirit is a real stripped down record with just 
              Willie, piano, and some sparse violin and steel string acoustic, 
              and is one of my favorites.<br />
              I did mess with the computer again, and I'm getting mysterious pops 
              in the recordings. I've pretty much decided to put it aside for 
              these sessions, unless I can learn anything on the discussion boards 
              today.</font><br>

              night I recorded bass tracks for all the songs with drums. I think 
              it came out pretty good but it was late when I finished so I'll 
              have to listen to them again to see if they're OK. At least I came 
              up with some good bass lines so if I have to do it again it should 
              be easier. <img src="http://www.mcilvanity.com/blogs/pix/recording4.jpg" border=0 alt="The Musicmaster" align="right"><br />
              I used my buddy Pete's old Fender Musicmaster bass, which is a short 
              scale economy bass from the 60's with one pickup. His is unfortunately 
              painted green, but other than that and a replaced knob I think it's 
              original. It sounds pretty good and the short scale makes it very 
              easy to play. My white Squire jazz bass is missing - I think I leant 
              it to someone but I can't remember who. I don't know, maybe it was 
              stolen out of the garage. Maybe you know where it is?<br />
              Writing bass lines is an interesting science. Sometimes you follow 
              the guitar, sometimes you follow the bass drum, and sometimes you 
              follow the vocal melody. Usually it's some combination of all of 
              the above. A good bass line can really compliment the song and be 
              something people listen to, but a lot of times the bass ends up 
              blending in so that it's ignored. Sometimes that's the best thing 
              for the song. I did one on Just a Kid where during the chorus it 
              follows the vocal melody and departs a bit from the chords. It sounds 
              good now but we'll have to see later with full guitars and vocals.<br />
              I also spent some time yesterday recording figerpicked guitar on 
              the computer using the Cubasis multitracking software that came 
              with the soundcard. Fingerpicking is not my strong suit, so I thought 
              that if I recorded it on the computer I could cut and paste and 
              put together a "perfect" track. It went OK, I'm just learning the 
              software so I spent much time figuring out how to actually cut and 
              paste. <br />
              This computer cut and paste method is how most recordings are made 
              these days, and I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand 
              I figure it's just another tool and it makes it possible to do certain 
              things very quickly and to create music in a way that was never 
              possible before. On the other hand I find it annoying when I listen 
              to the radio and instead of hearing a guitar line I hear a guitar 
              phrase copied and repeated over and over. I miss the human element.<br />
              Molli used to work for a company which made this software called 
              Mixman where it came with a bunch of samples and you had 16 tracks 
              to load with samples which you could turn on and off in real time 
              to create music. It was programmed so that each sample would wait 
              till the beginning of the bar to start rather than when you actually 
              hit the button so you didn't have to be on time and it would still 
              sound perfect. It was a lot of fun, but ever since I used it certain 
              music just reminds me of mixman. All disco, dance, electronic music 
              is like this, and lots of KROQ type music is starting to sound that 
              way.<br />
              On the other hand, I've been listening to a lot of Led Zepplin lately. 
              There's a block they play on KLOS right as I'm driving home from 
              work so I get a good assortment, plus I got the new live DVD. Zepplin 
              is one of the most "live" bands ever, even in the studio. Especially 
              Jimmy, probably the sloppiest guitar hero. But they're so great, 
              such an argument for being able to play your instrument and playing 
              together.<br />
              As I wrote before, I'm no stickler for hi-fidelity, and I even named 
              one of my bands after "Mystakes." Some of my favorite records are 
              raw and primitive: Dylan's Basement Tapes, Neil's Tonight's the 
              Night, Thee Headcoats, GBV, Deep Purple Made in Japan, plus all 
              the Jimmie Rodgers, Woody Guthrie, and anything else recorded before 
              1960. I love the sound of sitting around playing the tune, and I 
              try to capture that energy in my recordings.<br />
              Another issue is that it takes a lot of time once you start cutting, 
              pasting, and tweaking with the computer, especially if you're just 
              learning like I am, and I don't have that kind of time. Last night 
              I was thinking, well, it would take me 10 minutes to cut and paste 
              this one together and it might sound weird and not work, or I could 
              just record three more takes in that time and hope I got a good 
              one. (Another good thing about the computer is that there are limitless 
              tracks, so you can just keep going until you get a good one.) You 
              can easily get sucked into the tweaking and trying out different 
              effects, and fixing every little vollume change and performance 
              glitch. The family is leaving for a few days next week and that's 
              when I'm hoping to get a lot of tracking done, so I have to be wary 
              of the learning curve. I don't want to spend my time learning software 
              when I could be laying it down on the Fostex. Plus I kept hearing 
              tiny glitches, and it made me wonder if my setup was OK, or if it 
              was just a playback glitch and the recording was ok, or what?<br />
              All this is to say I'm not sure how much I'll be using the computer 
              for the actual recording. I think I will use it more in the future 
              once I learn how to do it better, but for now I'm going to keep 
              it simple. I will definately use it for the mastering though.</font><br>

              night I layed down some scratch (temporary) guitar tracks on the 
              songs with drums. I wanted to get some guitar down so that I could 
              record the bass lines. It's been awhile since I recorded but I definately 
              felt it coming back to me. I've spent a lot of time tracking with 
              the Fostex, going back to Bobby McStone. It's sort of an antique 
              as far as digital recorders go, with no effects and an archaic backup 
              system, but it still works and has good sound quality.<br />
              When you play songs over and over like I have started to, you get 
              to know them very well. Especially with live drums, you have to 
              match your playing to the track, and the only way to do this is 
              by doing it over and over. Because these were scratch tracks, I 
              didn't get too picky, but I did notice some things I'll have to 
              keep in mind.<br />

            <blockquote><a name="106131381255541874">&nbsp;</a> <font size="2">I'm 
              on the verge of another big project, this time a CD. Probably not 
              a full run production, but I'm thinking more of a limited edition 
              of 100 with hand painted covers or something. We'll see. <br />
              I have decided to directly copy Doktor Frank and keep a studio journal. 
              I'll be honest and say right here that the purpose of this journal 
              is to make myself look cool and interesting. It also may be useful 
              or inspiring to other musicians, and additionally it will provide 
              a place to gather my thoughts and be a good record that I can look 
              back on when it's all done. This is similar to the journal I kept 
              when I was doing my paintings for the Pursuit of Happiness show.<br />
              I've been planning this album for quite a few months and have already 
              started recording it. It's the first song cycle since Bobby McStone 
              with so many songs to think about at the same time. Since then, 
              I've recorded one or a couple few songs at a time, but at this point 
              I have about 14 songs in various stages of completion. The album 
              has a vague theme of remembrance or nostalgia, a looking back but 
              also a looking forward. Some of the songs don't fit that theme at 
              all though. I look at it sort of like The Kinks great Village Green 
              Preservation Society album, which also has a nostalgic theme but 
              contains many songs having nothing to do with that theme.<br />
              One thing I've done in preparation which I've never done before 
              is have my guitars professionally set up. This included fret dressing, 
              setting the action (height of the strings off the fretboard,) and 
              most importantly intonation. (intonation means that the guitar is 
              in tune up and down the fretboard, not just at the nut. It is set 
              by increasing or decreasing the lenghth between the bridge saddle 
              and the nut on each string. It's hard to do correctly.) It will 
              be interesting to see how this makes the tracks sound compared to 
              tracks recorded in the past with incorrect intonation. I think it 
              will be a lot better, especially on solos where I'm playing high 
              up on the neck.<br />
              I also bought a new soundcard for my computer and may use it to 
              reord some of the mellow songs. I bought the Creative Audigy 2 Platinum 
              with the breakout board so I can connect my mixer/mics/recorder 
              directly to the front of the computer. It came with Cubasis VST 
              recording software, and I've been spending some time the last few 
              nights trying to learn how to use it. I think it will come in handy 
              for some things, but I still have to experiment with it more.<br />
              Right before Sean was born I bought a new Taylor nylon string guitar, 
              and I've played it almost every day since then. I love the sound 
              of nylon strings in folk/country music (Willie Nelson and Melanie 
              both use nylon) and always wanted a good one, and this guitar is 
              everything I hoped for. It has great dynamic range (loud/soft) and 
              sounds great plugged in. Now that it's worn in I had John the guitar 
              tech tweak it a little so that it's plays perfectly. I plan to use 
              it a lot on the record.<br />
              Because I'm not currently in a band and because most of these songs 
              were written with the Taylor while watching Sean, there are many 
              more or less mellow songs. A lot of them will just be voice and 
              guitar, with some electric guitar, steel string acoustic, half size 
              acoustic (Sean's letting me borrow it,) and lap steel added where 
              appropriate. I did also write a few rockers which will be in there. 
              <br />
              My influences lately are running towards Townes Van Zandt for the 
              feelings he evokes with minimal words, John Prine for his funny/sad 
              mix and great wordplay, The Kinks for their songs from character's 
              points of view or about unusual subject matter, Burl Ives for the 
              way he can make a compelling record with just a voice and guitar, 
              Jimmie Rodgers for the emotions he can evoke and the pictures he 
              can paint within a super simple song structure, and the usual suspects 
              such as Hank, Dylan, Neil, and Willie.<br />
              The weekend before last I went into the rehearsal studio with Steve 
              to record drum tracks for the rockers:<br />

              <font size="2"><br />
              <br />
              It was a great session and we layed down tracks for 4 songs in as 
              many hours. I brought in my Fostex digital 8 track and my Behringer 
              mixer and some microphones. I used my two Radio Shack PZM boundry 
              mics panned left and right and placed about ten feet out on the 
              sides of the room to capture the complete drums sound with and emphasis 
              on the cymbals. I placed a mic directly on the snare, bass, tom, 
              and floor tom and mixed those through the mixer. I played clean 
              guitar at a low volume for Steve to follow along, as he was just 
              learning the songs that day. This is the way I've recorded demos 
              for a while now, and I like the results. It would be nice to have 
              a discreet track for each microphone, but the Fostex only records 
              two tracks at a time, so I have to mix it there and can only tweak 
              the EQ later. I'm not a stickler for hi fidelity and I like the 
              energy you get from a live room sound, so it works out pretty good.<br />

              Steve is an awesome drummer and played great and came up with some 
              good ideas that really helped the songs. I'd given him some very 
              raw guitar/voice demos of 3 of the songs and he was good enough 
              to actually listen to them and come up with some ideas beforehand 
              which helped a lot. We've played toghether for so many years that 
              even though it had been a while it felt real natural and we had 
              a good time.<br />
              Of the four songs we recorded, two have finished words, one has 
              words which I may or may not use, and one has three sets of words 
              of which I probably won't use any. <br />
              Here is a quick songlist:<br />
              Just a Kid - Power pop with drums. This song looks back at decisions 
              made in the past without regret but questioningly, in order to evoke 
              a feeling.<br />
              G and T - Garage rocker with drums. This song was directly inspired 
              by an episode of Connections on the Science channel about malaria 
              and quinine and colonialism. It's sung from the Kinks-esqu perspective 
              of a British colonial official in the Carribean during the 1800's.<br />
              Fast song in A - Power Pop with drums. No words yet, but it calls 
              for something anthemic.<br />
              Flying With Your Feet on the Ground - Neil Youngy boom boom crack 
              guitar solo song with some lyrics at the end, a metaphor for playing 
              music.<br />
              Friend's Waltz - Acoustic waltz looking back on a relationship with 
              a friend who is gone. Inspired by a Jimmie Rodgers song called My 
              Old Pal.<br />
              Mr. Berry - Acoustic song about a bitter neighbor who gets drunk 
              all the time. Sad.<br />
              Whatever Happened to Dave? - Acoustic waltz about the friend from 
              high school who you lost touch with but never forgot.<br />
              Castle by the Sea - Acoustic fantasy song about being a king in 
              the middle ages.<br />
              Your Guess is Better than Mine - Acoustic waltz with a country feel 
              that is funny/sad.<br />
              I Won't let you Down - Acoustic song encouraging a friend to do 
              what's right even though it's painful.<br />
              Squirell Song - Acoustic song about dreamers in la-la land.<br />
              Race Day in the Garden - A talk/singing folk tune. Pure fantasy. 
              I was thinking of John Prine when I wrote it.<br />
              There's a couple more which I need words / music / titles for. And 
              I might record my older song Black Blue and Red because it fits 
              the theme and was never properly recorded.<br />
