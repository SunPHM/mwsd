 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  </b>Marc Guizol's résumé outlines an impressive and steady climb up the culinary ladder, from cooking school right to his current position as chef of the Palace Court restaurant at Caesars Palace. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  At every step along the way -- from his first full-time job at an Italian resort, to his work for an upscale catering company, even to the time he spent as personal chef to the military governor of Marseille -- Guizol has made it a point to make his next position not just better-paying, but, more challenging, more educational and more creatively satisfying. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Guizol, 32, who has worked at Caesars since July, was born in Avignon, France, and had what he characterizes as a middle-class upbringing. While he's the first member of his family to pursue a culinary career, Guizol recalls that his mother was a "very good cook," and that Sunday lunches at his home were major affairs. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Sometimes, as many as 14 people would show up to dine and socialize, he says. "The neighbors, the friends, the one who lives in front, the one who lives behind. I think (it's) the same thing as barbecues in the United States." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Guizol began to help his mother out in the kitchen when he was about 12, making appetizers, soups and cold dishes. He enjoyed it, but hadn't yet thought of cooking as a way to make a living. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Then, Guizol says, "after a little bit, more and more I started to like doing it. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  "And maybe one of the (reasons) was the fact that each time we would go on vacation or holiday, anyplace we'd stay I'd often spend at least a couple hours in the kitchen. My mother, she always asked to be able to go into the kitchen." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  During his midteens, Guizol worked weekends at a neighborhood restaurant. "I used to help with all the food," he recalls. "It was a very small restaurant close to the house and, of course, known by my parents." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  By the time he was ready to receive his secondary school diploma, Guizol had decided to pursue a culinary career. He enrolled in Marie Curie College, earning a certificate in classic cuisine there, then spent another year studying at the Academie de Montpellier. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The appeal of cooking then was the same as the appeal now, Guizol says: It's satisfying work, it requires skills both physical and intellectual, and it's a good avocation "if you like competition." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  It's also, Guizol adds, a profession that brings rewards "if you're good at what you do and really want to do it properly and try to be innovative." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; For about a year following his course of studies, Guizol was chef at a restaurant in Sardinia, Italy, in charge of serving hot and cold buffets for 200 to 300 people per day. Then, from 1987 to 1988, while fulfilling his national military service commitment, he was personal chef to the military governor of Marseille while stationed at Chateau Saint Victor, France. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Actually, Guizol had been hoping to serve out his hitch as a military diver, "because I grew up in the south of France and I always did scuba diving." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Instead, he says, smiling, "they were looking, at that stage, for a chef for the general." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  But, Guizol notes, "that was fun. It was him, his wife and the dog." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  The job included overseeing dinners -- one was for 500 people -- for military officials, political figures and representatives of embassies and consulates. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  "It was very funny, because we used his car to go buy the food, with the (military escorts) in the front and the back," Guizol says. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  From 1988 to 1990, Guizol worked at the Four Seasons in London. He then spent a year as sous chef for a French catering company that cooked for such events as the French Grand Prix and at dinners for visiting heads of state and dignitaries. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Other positions at restaurants in France, Portugal and England followed from 1991 to 1997, with Guizol staying a year or two at each. At each stop along the way, Guizol was careful to choose as his next restaurant one that was better than the one preceding it. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  For Guizol, that meant a restaurant that was considered more prestigious, with a chef he could learn from or a new cuisine to which he could be exposed, or even, Guizol says, a restaurant that was simply "more top-of-the-moment" than the preceding one. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  "I'm, maybe, lucky, but I've gotten approached (for new positions) several times in my career," Guizol says. Still, he adds, "you make sure that each time you are at the right place."
<!-- TEXT of COL2 -->
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   The goals are to continue to learn and face new  challenges. "If you do not have that type of challenge (in) what you do every day, you don't have the same intensity," he says. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   "It's important not to be closed and say, `I'm French,' and that's it. You have to be interested. You have to be open to what's going on." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  In 1997, Guizol's ascension up the culinary ladder took him to Naples, Fla., and the Ritz Carlton hotel, where he was recruited to oversee a 90-seat French gourmet room. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  "I always loved to travel," Guizol says, and coming to Florida was "good for me not only professionally, but that was where I met my wife." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  The restaurant won numerous awards during his tenure, including AAA Five- and Four-Diamond awards and the 1998 Ivy Award for Food and Beverage. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Then, earlier this year, he finally accepted an offer -- he'd passed on a few others -- to come to Caesars Palace, 3570 Las Vegas Blvd. South. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  When he returned to Naples after the interview at Caesars, his executive chef called him into the general manager's office for a meeting. The GM, Guizol recalls, "said, `We're very pleased to tell you we've received word of (AAA's) Five Diamonds.' <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  "I had my resignation letter in my pocket," Guizol says, smiling. "I said (to myself), `Well, I'll wait a day,' and then I resigned. So it was very strange." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   At Palace Court, Guizol's clientele is a mix of longtime customers -- people who, Guizol says, "know the restaurant more than I do" -- and diners who are just becoming acquainted with the room. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Guizol describes the menu as classical French, but adds he's "trying to bring (to Palace Court) things a little bit different, like the smoked bass we do (with a) house caviar sauce." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Guizol is preparing to introduce his first Palace Court menu, which will include the restaurant's signature dishes and some of his own creations. One item that it currently isn't slated to include is a cocktail Guizol created for the 1998 National Bacardi Recipe Classic. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Guizol won the competition's $10,000 grand prize with his rich amalgam of layered rum, apple marmalade and panna cotta topped with apple ice cream, a whipped cream rosette and a caramel-dipped hazelnut. And, even though it won't be on the menu, it illustrates Guizol's classic but adventurous approach to dining. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Guizol and his wife, Caroline, have two sons, Zachary and Theodore. They're moving into a new home this month, and Guizol enjoys traveling, tennis, cycling, swimming and scuba diving, photography and wildlife in his spare time.  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>FILET DE SEA BASS FUMÉ <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(lightly smoked sea bass <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;with horseradish sauce) <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Sauce ingredients: <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1 tablespoon olive oil <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 4 sliced shallots <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 3 ounces freshly grated horseradish <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 8 ounces heavy cream <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fish ingredients: <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 4 Chilean sea bass filets, about 6 ounces each <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Olive oil <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1 pound wood chips <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Garnish ingredients: <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2 cucumbers, peeled and sliced  1/8-inch thick <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2 tablespoons sea salt <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 2 pounds peeled potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1 tablespoon olive oil <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Salt and pepper, to taste <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 1 ounce Beluga caviar <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 4 fresh dill sprigs</b></b> <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To make sauce, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in saucepan and add shallot slices and fresh horseradish.
