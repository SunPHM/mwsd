margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><font face="Century Gothic">Chance's music is acoustic-based rock/pop with raw electric elements; it is honest and personal, catchy and accessible.

The band is fronted by two singer-songwriter-guitarists, Mark Nensel and David Chambers, and also features Joe Basso (on bass) and Matthew Richkus (drums).  Mark and Joe are long-time DC-band music vets who have joined forces with their younger cohorts Dave and Matthew to create a band that blends rock and pop elements from several decades into a seamless and enjoyable new sound that goes down easy.
Chance has been playing the DC-VA-MD area regularly for the past two years. They are regulars at the Staccato in Adams Morgan, they've played Jammin' Java in Vienna, VA; Zig's in Alexandria; the IOTA in Arlington; the Velvet Lounge in DC; Parker's in Bethesda; the Vault in Baltimore, among many other venues.  They've been interviewed by Damian on WRNR radio in Annapolis, and played on-air.  And the band was thrilled to perform at the Taste of DC festival in downtown Washington this past Columbus Day weekend.</b></P>
