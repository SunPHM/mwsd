Oscar Wilde, a writer of fine plays and a king of wit, died 100 years ago this year. He wrote the play The Importance of being Ernest in 1884 while staying at a seafront boarding house in Worthing. The site at 5 The Esplanade, now a car showroom, has a blue plaque. Lady Goring was the name he gave to the stern mother of the house.

<b><font size="+1">Jefferies Lane Path now sorted</font></b><br>
For two years Mr Wicks of Sea Lane, Goring has tried to get the council to do something about the footpath behind Malthouse Cottages in Jefferies Lane. Purely by chance he met a lady who said she had used the path for 67 years - apparently the council will take ownership if no one claims it for 50 years so that was fine. So now it will be trimmed and swept, and Caffyn's have been asked to prevent the oily water draining onto the path.<br>
The lady says that in the old days before main drainage the dung cart used to use the path to service the privies of the cottages; a rather smelly but necessary service, now thankfully no longer required.

The comments still rumble on. Though the immediate work is now complete, cyclists are still worried about cars parking in the cycle lane along Goring Road, and cars drive apparently uncaring into the lane when having to pass cars which are waiting to to turn right. Is the road wide enough for a cycle lane anyway? As your webmaster here is a new cyclist, yes I use the lane and ride along the pretty red colour. But I don't think we have the full answer yet.<br>

At 7.30am Saturday 19 August, fire broke out in Petworth Avenue, Goring destroying most of the roof. It started through a fault in the frig-freezer sited in the conservatory at the back of the house. Four fire engines, three police cars and an ambulance attended, followed by the fire department tower crane. The owner Mrs Neeson suffered from smoke inhalation and received immediate help from the medics but was not detained.

Beach hut 112 at Mudeford is for sale, a two mile hike over the dunes, no water, no sanitation, no gas, no electricity, only to be used March to November, annual fee &pound;1000. Price &pound;60,000.  This has got to be a record even if they are twice the size of the Goring huts.<br>
A garden shed costs about&pound;550, perhaps a bit more if it is the WBC standard 8ft x 6ft x 8ft high and fully lined. They are selling on Goring sea front for about &pound;1500.  Plus &pound;160 per year site fee to WBC, and annual painting in the standard white marine paint, plus optional but desirable &pound;40 insurance. So we are getting good value here - and there are some sites empty at the moment.<br>
On a historical note, during the wartime invasion threat, rows of beach huts were filled with shingle as a primitive and first line tank obstacle. This could happen anyway during a gale if you leave the doors open!
<p>
<b><font size="+1">Storms bring in the seaweed</font></b><br>
As soon as the holiday season ended, the rains came, and wind blew, and the seaweed was pretty bad. North winds and high tide have taken most of it away again now but it was not nice while it lasted. We haven't had bad seaweed for some time now and it was a bit of a shock.<br>
The seaweed is said to grow on the Kingsmere Rocks on the bottom of the sea five miles off Goring, torn loose by rough seas, and if the wind is from the south, dumped on the beach.<br>
Back in the early days of the last century, the farmers used to collect it and use it as fertilizer. Now the farmers use chemicals which can be spread with government subsidy and with less labour.<br>
In April 1952 they used a crop-spraying helicopter to spray the beach with DDT to kill the sandflies. They would not do this again as they now know that DDT is bad for humans as well as for flies.<br>
In 1973 they sprayed the seaweed with perfumed deoderant in a bid to mask the smell. They have not repeated this exercise so it was probably not very effective.<br>

<b><font size="+1">The Travellers move on</font></b><br>
This time the travellers stayed just seven days 25 Aug to 1 Sept 00. And only a moderate amount of litter.<br>
We suspect that Farmer Langmede left the security gate open when he finished harvesting the linseed on the Goring Gap, and in a flash the travellers were back. 10 caravans arrived  overnight on Friday 25 August, and another 10 over the weekend. It may be that these are the people recently expelled from the Reading area. We expected them to stay here for the statutory 10 days the law seems to allow. The neighbours were not pleased.<br>
By chance this local invasion happens at the same time that a new Conservative document <i>Common Sense on Travellers</i> is launched.

<b><font size="+1">Anchor washed up at Plantation</font></b><br>
A very large anchor appeared 500 yards out at sea near the Plantation. We think it was exposed by the storms on Christmas Eve, then dragged there by a fishing boat. The seven foot iron crosspiece stuck up out of the beach and obviously it could not just stay there, a hazard to passing jet-skis. A bulldozer waded into the sea and hauled it to the top of the sea wall. Where is it from? The Evening Argus says that it is from a three-masted schooner Kingshill which ran aground carrying a cargo of manure at that spot on Feb 17th 1915. The Worthing lifeboat twice capsized during the rescue and one of the lifeboat crew was drowned.<br>
But perhaps it was the Indiana which sunk off Worthing Pier in 1901 and scattered thousands of oranges and lemons on the beach.

<b><font size="+1">New Rolls Royce car factory at Goodwood</font></b><br>
German car manufacturer BMW this week announced it plans to build the worldwide headquarters for Rolls-Royce as well as a hi-tech design studio and craft workshop at Goodwood. A museum is also part of the plans for the &pound;60 million development.<br>
BMW will take over the rights to the Rolls-Royce marque in three years’ time and has been investigating various locations in Britain and abroad to base it. Being chosen to be the home for what remains one of the most famous car names represents a major coup for the Chichester area. The site chosen is currently a field alongside the old A27 at Westhampnett, owned by the Goodwood Estate Company, near to the famous motor racing circuit. BMW is looking to develop eight acres of land.<br>
If given planning permission, the scheme will create 350 jobs in development, design, production, marketing and sales as well as commercial and office operations.<br>

<b><font size="+1">Pair Trawling still not a good idea</font></b><br>
Pairs of trawlers, dragging a large net between the two boats, have been fishing for cod off the beach flying a flag that looks like the French Tricoleur, but actually is not. The flag they fly is red, white, blue stripes (not the same order as the French flag) and is the international warning flag for boats pair-fishing. It says you will be unwise to sail between the two boats. Local fisherman are not enthusiastic. These boats come along from Newhaven and take all the fish, disturb the weed on the bottom, and leave nothing for the locals. Why cannot they fish further out in their powerful boats.  Tim Loughton MP was going to take this matter up with MAFF to see if something can be done, but the pair-fishing continues.<br>

<b><font size="+1">Warning - Bulldozers at Work</font></b><br>
A large yellow, and noisy, Gamble bulldozer is now at work re-profiling and compacting the sea wall working East from the Goring Gap. A yellow-coated banksman is on hand to keep children and dogs from being run over. They have been bringing in boulders to the seafront at West Worthing, and then trucking them a mile along the beach to the Goring Gap. It is not quite clear what the eventual plan is, but certainly the whole of the sea wall here is under threat.

<b><font size="+1">Sea Lane tree controversy brews</font></b><br>
The Holm Oak trees in Sea Lane Goring have been inspected 
by the Sussex Forester Wally Jones in conjunction with WSCC 
and the Ilex Conservation Group. Remedial work will start 
within the next two months. As part of this, the lower branches on all the trees will be pruned. This will improve the sight lines for 
traffic, improve visibility to aid the Neighbourhood Watch, 
and encourage the trees to grow tall and beautiful. Wally 
Jones said "There will be controversy; you cannot do 
anything to trees without someone getting upset. But the 
long term health of the trees requires attention now."<br>
As a part of the problem here, one of the Holm Oaks that requires attention is occupied by a Tawney Owl and this tree therefore cannot be interfered with.

<b><font size="+1">Goring Vicar Hits Headlines</font></b><br>
In a jokey vein, The Rev Michael Hore, vicar of St Mary's Church Goring has come up with a list of changes which a typical trendy management consultant would produce:
<UL><LI>hymns sponsored by local companies
<LI>special luxury pews for corporate worshippers
<LI>performance related pay for vicars
<LI>cash prizes for the 1000th worshipper to pass through the door, with a rollover if the number fails to reach this number each month
<LI>sell redundant churches brick by brick to the Americans
<LI>letting the church out on weekdays as a sports hall
</UL>
But this bit of fun was written to make a point; that the church worries too much about image. The message, he says, is simple: be faithful to God, trust in the promise of salvation through Jesus Christ, live as members of God's kingdom. These are the things the church needs. These are no gimmicks.<br>

<b><font size="+1">Conservatives re-gain Worthing</font></b><br>
The previous WBC council was hung with no clear majority rule. Now Conservatives have 20 seats, and LibDems 16. Labour came no-where.<br>
Results - Goring: Steven Waight (C) 1755, Nick Rogers (LD) 542 (no change - turnout 34.4%). <br>
Castle: Nick John (C) 816, Mark O'Keefe (C) 793, Graeme Cornell (LD) 533, Robert Smytherman (LD) 500, Antony Bignell (L) 453, James Deen (L) 431. (C hold 1, gain 1 from LD - turnout 30%)<br>

Sunday 26 March and a cool but sunny day saw the Worthing Harriers 20 mile road race attracting nearly 1000 entrants. Four laps of Goring led them back to the start and finish point in the Goring Gap. There must have been a thousand cars parked along Marine Drive and roads nearby, but some were even more energetic and jogged from home in order to warm up.

<b><font size="+1">Business or Burgers?</font></b><br>
West Sussex coastal strip planning departments are trying to resolve a conflict in the role and purpose of the seaside towns. The residents want it to remain a residential area, the hotels want to encourage tourism, and business wants to encourage Economic Regeneration, with more business and industry, and better communications. WBC have reduced the Tourism Department budget from &pound;100K to &pound;50K. Central Government want more housing. Can all these things live together?
