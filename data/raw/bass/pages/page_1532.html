<b>Bass Summit IV was hosted by Mark of <a href=http://www.xush.net style=text-decoration:none>Xush Studios</a>. It was held at the <a href=http://www.analogmissionary.com style=text-decoration:none>Analog Missionary</a> Studio in Silverhill, Alabama. Analog Missionary is the band that Mark drums for, the members of which we are very grateful to for allowing the Bass Summit to be held at their excellent studio. Not only did they provide the venue, they also provided some excellent music during the many jam sessions that were held that day. Anstrom, Tony, Kevin and Mark... thanks guys!</font>

<font size=2 color=purple> <b>At The Summit</b> <br> </font>
<font size=2>Bud and I arrived at the Analog Missionary studio having driven a little off the beaten track, but we did get to see some really pretty views. We pulled into the driveway and around the back to recognize Rob Kloka's jeep - with the slightly faded a.g.b. sticker on the rear window. Then we knew we had really made it. I grabbed my Warmoth (PL1) and Bud's Status, he grabbed the rather large cooler and we entered the studio. Then the fun started...

<b>The Chapman Stick</b>
<br>
<font color=purple>
Some of you may recall when I had asked questions about the Chapman Stick on a.g.b. It was something that had tickled my interest and something that I was keen to try out. Mark had said that his band's bassist, Tony Novak, would be at the summit and that he would have his stick there too. I had seen Tony play it at one of the jam sessions and had chatted with him about it. He was willing to spend a little time giving me some guidance and allowing me to have a go when I was ready. Well, there were so many people around that it was as much as I could do to avoid playing a four string bass in front of the likes of JT, let alone playing a twelve string stick in front of everyone! Bud came up with the idea of creating a quiet area for those that weren't so keen to jam in front of everyone else. He dragged his Fender bassman in from the car and with the help of the others, set up a little area where upto three people could play at once.
<br> <br>
Having avoided the stick as long as I could and three Bud Lights later, Tammy tells me that Tony is setting up the stick in the quiet room ready for me to have a go. I can avoid it no longer... I borrow a belt from Tony to sit the stick in, put the strap around my shoulder and get amplified through the two outputs - one for each side of the stick. Tony explained the tuning to me and that he had marked each 'E' with a star. That was a great help and gave me a foundation... at least I could tap a couple of E's an octave apart and get a good harmony sound... that and some other two note harmonies is about all I managed to do. After several minutes, I realized that this beast would take some familiarizing and that I shouldn't get too disheartened that I couldn't do the amazing things that I have seen others do with it. However, I do think that it is something that I would grow to enjoy playing as I became more familiar with it. Maybe an eight string would be a better place to start.
<br> <br>
Did I sound good? Not at all. Do I want one? You betchya. Can I afford one? Not a hope. Is it my birthday soon? Yep :-)

<b>Who Else Was There?</b>

As much as it was an awesome experience to finally get together with these agbers, it was also very cool to meet bassists from other communities too. John Turner, a.k.a. JT - Mr. Conklin Extraordinaire and Talkbass.com moderator - and his wife, Barbara, attended with an awesome display of Conklins.

<br> <br>

Barbara and I chatted (as only us girls know how to...) and she explained that the white monster of a Conklin in JT's repertoire is one that she had had made for him as a first anniversary wedding present. That is obviously one special axe.

<font size=2> <b>The A.G.B. Gang</b> <br>
<font color=purple>It was an absolute honor to finally meet more agbers. Mark, as always, the host with the most and his wife Tammy, were bimbling around keeping everything together. Tammy stoked up the BBQ pit and although I didn't sample any, I understand that there was some rather tasty morsels being consumed in the sustenance area. <br> <br>
It was an absolute pleasure to finally meet Rob Kloka, his twin Zons and his baby Fender. What a nice guy... but we all knew that anyway! His upheaval to New Orleans made it possible for him to attend the summit - that couldn't have been timed more perfectly. To have him stay over and join us for breakfast in the morning was an added bonus. It will be good to see him settled and back on the group when the dust has settled after his big move to New Orleans.
<br> <br>
Did you ever realize how tall Brian Running is? He has to be seven foot tall if he's an inch... well okay, maybe six and a bit. Upon first meeting Brian, it felt like meeting someone really famous from T.V. I can't be the only one who admires his way with words and his ability to create an aura of sheer dignity?! It quickly became apparent that he is probably one of the most down to earth guys you could want to meet. I know he won't be offended at my words as we chatted about the use of humor, sarcasm and the moods that create them. I shall never take him seriously again!
<br> <br>
The leather clad dude on the Harley pulled up, turned off his engine and kicked down his sidestand before casually walking over to where Tammy and I were standing outside. "Lynda?" Space Cowboy asked as he approached. There was no mistaking who this was. He had been caught in the rain and dryed himself with a towel. "I brought a towel bass" he joked as he held the towel in a bass like position. "Didn't Joey Arkenstat play one of those?" I quipped. Only those that were familiar with Gov't Mule appreciated that one. Again, another great guy that brought more flavor to the richness of a great day.
<br>
<br>

<font size=2>
<b>Um... What Else?</b>
<br>
<font size=2 color=purple>
There were plenty of folks milling around and I was told most of the names, but sadly, remember few. I should have suggested to Mark to get everyone to wear name tags. You know..."Hi, I'm Purple Linny from a.g.b." Would you have worn one?! Ahem, anyway... one guy that sticks out in my mind is Robb from, I believe, Talkbass. A modest fellow that made an effort to chat to people and find out who they were and where they were from. When I say modest, you know, one of the ones that say they're not great bass players then rattle of some amazing little riff. Whereas when I say I'm not a good player, I'm happy to pick up a bass and prove my point - haha!
<br> <br>
Which reminds me... about Barry. He was the man with the camera. He was filming parts of the summit with a view to including it in a music series that he is putting together to be televised on Comcast. He mosied around and filmed various people doing their thang, including a few seconds of me playing PL1 - eek! This will be part of the series that Mark's band has already been filmed for. That will be something to look forward to.
