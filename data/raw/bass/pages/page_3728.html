<P><B>There are three sea bass known. The sea bass as named "wolf" in
Mediterranean, that raised to the hatchery, the lengthened sea bass
of Egyptian coasts, called carousse and, the speckled sea bass
.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Description :</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>The body of the sea bass is slender, almost cylindrical. Its
name of sea perch is perfectly appropriated ; it has coins operculars
thorny ; the two dorsal separated, but nevertheless very close, the
first is sustained by eight or nine thorny rays ; the second, to soft
rays. Flippers ventrales, to soft rays, are placed under pectorals.
The mouth is largely splited and well armed of teeth. One notes the
three rigid rays of the anal flipper. The operculars are bristled of
two points.</B></P>

<P><B>The sea bass low bit to reach 1m and to weigh 12 kg but the
average size situates between 60 and 70 cm. It is a beautiful fish to
scales large enough, to silvery center, and placed of rectilinear
manner, what gives an impression of force, strengthened by the
coloring ; the back is gray somber bluish ; gray flank money ; the
white stomach shows splendid vivid reflections. To signal a deepened
brown stain, behind the opercular. Dorsal flippers, anal and caudal
somber, pectorals and ventrals clear. One small stain black on the
back of the young subjects.</B></P>

<P><B>The profile of the sea bass offers a line regular enough until
the muzzle, with, nevertheless, a light depression between the two
dorsal. The line of the stomach swells a bit to the anal flipper. The
lateral line lifts to mi - body, to reach almost the level of eyes.
The head of the bar increases again the power of this fish. The
cranium and defers it the head are supplied scales cyclo&iuml;des.
The inferior jaw is slightly prominent, lips are fragile. Teeth,
forts and sharp, are card some to jaws.</B></P>

                  <P ALIGN=right><B>The sea bass lives along of all
                  our coasts, it abounds. Its distrust is great, its
                  catch, by the layman, is only accidental. The sea
                  bass is a carnivorous type , it has an attack
                  lightning, it enjoys to be in the breaker and near
                  rocks advanced. It adopts, in fact, enough long the
                  same territory, the long of rocky coasts. It is a
                  hunter to small distance. The sea bass lives
                  practically always in company others sea bass
                  similar size. </B></P>

 Feeding :</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>The sea bass is the carnivorous by excellence, rapid and very
voracious. By strong sea, in stirred water, it throws with violence
on all what moves, baits included. </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Spawning :</B></FONT></P>

<P><B>The period of spawning moves according to the habitat and the
increase of the temperature of the water (13&#176; - 14&#176; C) at
the end of the winter. The growth is relatively rapid, particularly
in the first period of life.</B></P>
