                    mythical "dream bass lake" as you'll ever experience. These 
                    lakes affords anglers the opportunity to use a variety of 
                    lures and fishing techniques. </p>
                  <p>If topwater fishing is your forte, you'll find excellent 
                    surface action during most of the fishing season. And many 
                    of the fish that explode on surface lures are true trophy 
                    bass. If you're a spinnerbait afficionado, there are plenty 
                    of prime pieces of cover for you to probe on this bass factory. 
                    Perhaps deep crankbaiting is more to your liking. You'll find 
                    no better crankbait fishery in the world than Huites. Maybe 
                    it's bumping a worm across a point that's your preferred method 
                    for tempting lunker bass. Huites has been described as a worm 
                    angler's dream lake. So, as you can clearly see, Lake Huites 
                    and Lake Baccarac will offer you tremendous opportunities 
                    for you to practice your tried and true fishing techniques, 
                    as well as develop new techniques, because one thing is for 
                    certain - you'll have plenty of rod bending and drag screeching 
                    action! </p>
                  <p><strong>Topwater Techniques for Lake Huites &amp; Lake Baccarac</strong></p>
                  <p><img src="images/vertanglerbass3_000.jpg" alt="lake baccarac mexico largemouth bass" width="125" height="166" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="left">The visual image of enticing a huge bass to take a lure on 
                    the surface is one of the most exciting and challenging methods 
                    of fishing on Huites and Baccarac. However, whether it's Lake 
                    Huites in Mexico you are fishing, or a bass lake in Connecticut, 
                    the fact is that bass do not feed on the surface all day long. 
                    Anglers, therefore, must recognize when conditions are favorable 
                    to practice this method of fishing. In general, early morning 
                    hours, late afternoon hours and during periods of cloud cover 
                    find bass most susceptible to a topwater assault at Huites 
                    and Baccarac. Typically, when the sun is high overhead and 
                    the temperature is hot and sultry, Huites bass prefer the 
                    comfort of deeper water, so it would be foolish to fish topwater 
                    baits under these conditions when other patterns would be 
                    so much more productive. </p>
                  <p>Although a bass might hit a topwater lure in just about any 
                    location you cast it, there are certain high percentage areas 
                    that will increase your odds of tempting more bass on Huites. 
                    Concentrate your efforts in windblown pockets and coves, standing 
                    timber, shoreline brush, points and stumps. Bass tend to use 
                    cover and structure (such as brush, stumps, points or standing 
                    timber) as ambush points. It is always wise to either cast 
                    as close to these forms of cover and structure as possible, 
                    or, alternatively, actually cast beyond them and work the 
                    topwater baits right up to them, almost attempting to glance 
                    the cover with your baits. </p>
                  <p>In some instances, the bass on Huites prefer a slow, deliberate 
                    retrieve of topwater lures, while other moments find them 
                    desiring a lure that is aggressively worked across the surface. 
                    Let the fish tell you how to present your baits. The guides 
                    will also be helpful in this regard as well. </p>
                  <p><strong>Buzzbaits for Lake Huites and Lake Baccarac</strong></p>
                  <p><img src="images/buzzbait_5.jpg" alt="buzzbaits at lake huites lodge, lake laccarac lodge mexico bass fishing" width="150" height="72" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="left">Buzzbaits 
                    are basically a lure comprised of a durable wire frame and 
                    plastic or rubber skirted material. It possesses a propeller 
                    that rotates around the wire shaft and creates much surface 
                    commotion. Bass experts simply cannot equate a buzzbait to 
                    anything in nature, however they all agree that it is a bait 
                    that tends to attract a big fish. Buzzbaits can be worked 
                    very fast and aggressively across the surface or, alternatively, 
                    you can slow the bait down during your retrieve and raise 
                    your rod tip to work them just fast enough to keep the prop 
                    turning and the bait on the surface. Huites bass will take 
                    them either way, so use varying retrieves until the bass tell 
                    you how they want the buzzbait presented. </p>
                  <p><img src="images/buzzbait_6.jpg" alt="buzzbait skirts lake huites lodge, lake laccarac lodge mexico bass fishing" width="200" height="96" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="left">Typically, 
                    anglers will use a rod from 6 to 6-1/2 feet long and of medium/heavy 
                    action. A slightly flexible tip will allow the bass to engulf 
                    the buzzbait before your rapid hook set causes you to pull 
                    it out of its mouth. A fast retrieve reel will allow you to 
                    work them more effectively. Because you will typically be 
                    working these baits around thicker cover and because bass 
                    tend to hit them very aggressively, consider using line ranging 
                    from 17 to 20 lbs. </p>
                  <p>When possible, try to cast the buzzbait beyond the cover, 
                    such as a stump or brushpile, then work the bait up to the 
                    cover and actually try to glance off the cover with the bait. 
                    This caroming action off the cover will often trigger a strike. 
                    When a fish strikes your bait, try to resist the tendency 
                    to immediately set the hook. Although easier said than done, 
                    wait to feel the weight of the fish before setting the hook. 
                    Work the bait all the way back to the boat as, in many cases, 
                    a fish may follow it from the cover and then strike it just 
                    feet from the boat. If you are generating strikes, but missing 
                    fish, consider adding a trailer or "stinger" hook that extends 
                    out beyond the regular hook. In some instances, the buzzbait 
                    is made more enticing by adding a large grub, plastic twin-tail 
                    or lizard as a trailer. </p>
                  <p><strong>Walking Baits for Lake Huites and Lake Baccarac</strong></p>
                  <p><img src="images/spook.jpg" alt="Walking Baits lake huites lodge, lake laccarac lodge mexico bass fishing" width="200" height="67" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="left">Many 
                    believe that walking baits are the most underutilized baits 
                    in the arsenal of the bass angler. These baits typically require 
                    the most work (not strength) in terms of getting the best 
                    action, and anglers, typically novice ones, shy away from 
                    them because of this. These types of lures are extremely effective 
                    when you impart the famous "walk the dog" retrieve, basically 
                    a coordinated series of wrist snaps that cause the bait to 
                    zigzag across the water and resembles an injured or disoriented 
                    baitfish . The gold standard of walking baits is the Zara 
                    Spook, although others are very productive as well, such as 
                    the Gilmore Oddball and MirroLure Top Dog. The key to these 
                    lures is that they emit a lot of action, but stay in the strike 
                    zone for long periods of time. Cast these lures beyond the 
                    target or over a point and "walk the dog" so that you allow 
                    the lure to almost come in contact with cover. </p>
                  <p><strong>Poppers for Lake Baccarac &amp; Lake Huites</strong></p>
                  <p><img src="images/poppers_c.jpg" alt="poppers at lake huites lodge, lake laccarac lodge mexico bass fishing" width="150" height="90" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="left">Huites' 
                    and Baccarac bass have a strong affinity to slam popping plugs. 
                    These concave mouthed lures bite the water and then spit or 
                    push it forward, creating a tantalizing sound and site similar 
                    to bass feeding on the surface. These lures, such as the Rebel 
                    Pop-R, Storm Chug Bug, Gilmore Hoodler, Mann's Chug-N-Spit 
                    and Yo-Zuri Popper, come in an array of sizes and colors and 
                    you will need to experiment to see which they prefer. These 
                    baits can be worked very slow and deliberate, or can be worked 
                    fast and erratic. As with all baits, let the fish tell you 
                    if they want it fast or deliberate. Again, these baits are 
                    most effective when casted beyond cover or structure and retrieved 
                    very close to the cover. </p>

                    plastic or wooden lures have rotating propellers that allow 
                    you to rip the baits across the surface and displace water 
                    and create visible and audible commotion. These baits are 
                    best used when the fish are really aggressive and attacking 
                    topwater lures with a fury. Some of the very best on Huites 
                    include the Gilmore Jumper, Gilmore Go Getter, Hedden Baby 
                    Torpedo, Smithwick Devil's Horse and a &frac12;-ounce Luhr-Jensen 
                    Wood Chopper. When bass do not seem to be aggressively chasing 
                    baits, these prop lures are best worked slow and deliberate, 
                    allowing a pause between each twitch of the wrist to move 
                    these baits. When the fish are chasing bait, you can work 
                    them more aggressively with a faster ripping cadence. In some 
                    instances, props on the nose and tail end of the baits produce 
                    better, while other situations finding that bass only prefer 
                    baits with props in their tail section. </p>

                    baits like the Lunker City Slug-Go, Bass Assassin Shad Assassin 
                    and Zoom Fluke, as well as other variations of this lure, 
                    can best be described as soft plastic jerk baits. These baits 
                    are most noted for their ability to entice shallow oriented 
                    bass, or those feeding or schooling near the surface. </p>
                  <p>"Baits like the Slug-Go are so effective because of their 
                    unpredictable or random action," points out professional guide 
                    Dave Masterson, a frequent visitor to Huites. "This is one 
                    of the primary reasons why they consistently catch fish when 
                    other lures fail to do so. Most of the wood or hard plastic 
                    baits we use are very mechanical in their action, certainly 
                    the opposite of the hapless, erratic action that one observes 
                    of an injured or fleeing baitfish. When bass are actively 
                    feeding, just about any lure will tempt them. However, when 
                    they are negative or neutral, I want a bait that offers a 
                    more realistic action. That's when I turn to a soft plastic 
                    jerk bait like the Slug-Go. </p>
                  <p><img src="images/verticleanglerbass2_000.jpg" alt="lake huites mexico largemouth bass" width="99" height="133" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="left">Very few baits come in such an outrageous array of colors 
                    as the soft plastic jerk baits. These bright colors do not 
                    appear to repulse fish and serve the purpose of allowing anglers 
                    to carefully observe the baits during a retrieve. In clear 
                    water, many anglers, however, do prefer natural shad type 
                    colors. In off colored water, anglers might want to consider 
                    a bright color such as merthiolate, hot pink or highway stripe 
                    yellow. </p>
                  <p>"I believe that the key to the success of these soft plastic 
                    jerk baits," offers Dave Masterson, "is that they can be worked 
                    across the surface, or allowed to descend or suspend a foot 
                    or two below the surface, a depth where may shallow water 
                    oriented bass tend to cruise, especially during the spring 
                    and fall months. "On many occasions, I have observed bass 
                    honing in on a floating hard plastic or wood topwater bait, 
                    only to nudge it, but never aggressively strike it. For some 
                    reason, bass can be hesitant about breaking the surface to 
                    strike a floating bait. When working the soft plastic jerk 
                    baits you can alter your speed or retrieval depth to reflect 
                    the mood of the fish." </p>
                  <p>The most common retrieve is to keep the rod tip pointing 
                    towards the water. This serves to keep the line out of the 
                    wind and allows you to work the bait unimpeded by slack line. 
                    Use six inch sharp snaps of the wrists to retrieve the bait. 
                    When the fish are aggressively attacking the bait on or near 
                    the surface, you'll be astonished of how many strikes you'll 
                    observe, so keep the bait within site during the entire retrieve. 
                  </p>
                  <p>"Initially, try letting the baits flip across the surface 
                    like a wounded shad," says Dave Masterson, "especially if 
                    you are fishing a school of feeding bass or shad fleeing at 
                    the surface. If the fish are hesitant about taking the bait 
                    on the surface, work it about one to three feet deep, a depth 
                    where you can still visualize the bait. I find this to be 
                    the most effective retrieve and depth range. I don't do anything 
                    fancy, I just snap the wrist and pause, snap the wrist and 
                    pause. The only real alteration is the speed in which I retrieve 
                    the bait. Sometimes they want to chase it, other times call 
                    for you to work it slowly, literally tantalizing the fish 
                    with the erratic action." </p>
                  <p>When initially learning how to fish floating unweighted worms, 
                    such as the Zoom Trick Worm, it probably is best to rig it 
                    Texas style. As one becomes proficient with the floating worm, 
                    you may want to experiment with various rigging modifications, 
                    including fishing it wacky style by hooking it through the 
                    egg sac or center of the worm. </p>

                    always recommend fishing the floating worm on spinning gear," 
                    says Dave Masterson. "It will afford you greater distances 
                    on the cast, so you can avoid spooking shallow fish. According 
                    to Masterson, probably the number one problem novice anglers 
                    have when working floating worms is that they set the hook 
                    as soon a they feel the strike or see the fish take the baits. 
                    He advises hesitating a few seconds to allow the fish to inhale 
                    the bait and start swimming away with it. </p>
                  <p>If the fish are deeper, you may elect to fish the stern weighted 
                    hooks from Mustad or the Lunker City insert weights. The inserts 
                    are either pierced across the body of the bait and then clipped 
                    so that no portion of the insert remains outside the baits 
                    or inserted near the bend of the hook to make them stern weighted.

                    no other lure has been responsible for landing as many Mexican 
                    bass as the plastic worm. It is probably so productive because 
                    it can probe the mid to deep water haunts of Huites' and Baccarac 
                    bass more efficiently than just about any other lure. The 
                    most popular and productive way to rig worms for the bass 
                    of Huites is via the Texas rig method. The Texas rig allows 
                    you to fish the worm in a weedless manner, as the hook point 
                    is not exposed to snag into various forms of cover, but rather 
                    is buried into the body of the worm. When fishing shallow 
                    water and thicker cover, worms in the five to seven inch category 
                    are most effective, as they will not tend to get hung up in 
                    the cover as longer versions. When fishing shallow water, 
                    consider a pegged slip sinker that is between 1/8 and a &frac14;-ounce 
                    in weight. Pegging will not allow the worm to be disassociated 
                    from the weight and will make it more streamlined when going 
                    through cover like brush or trees. </p>
                  <p>One of the best methods for catching a true Huites and Lake 
                    Baccarac trophy bass is to fish plastic worms within and across 
                    deep structure, such as humps, points, old road beds and submerged 
                    standing timber. For this deep structure approach, consider 
                    using plastic worms from 7 to 11 inches in length and up the 
                    weight of your slip sinker to between a &frac14; and a &frac12; 
                    ounce so that you can effectively feel the worm and weight

                  <p>When worm fishing, consider rods from 6-1/2 to 7 feet in 
                    length. Rely on line weight between 14 and 20 lbs. Keep in 
                    mind that deep Huites bass have an affinity to head for cover

                  <p>Crankbaits are basically wood or hard plastic fish imitating 
                    treble hook laden lures. They are usually categorized into 
                    three depth ranges - shallow, medium and deep. Typically, 
                    shallow running crankbaits possess either no lip or a small 
                    one. The deeper running lures tend to be heavier, with elongated 
                    lips. Crankbaits are a must for any angler visiting Huities 
                    or Baccarac, especially if he or she is in search of a trophy 
                    bass. </p>

                    these are not set in stone and a savvy angler will let the 
                    fish dictate what bait to use and not simply follow the guidelines 
                    set down by other anglers. In general, however, you should 
                    consider a white or baitfish colored skirted spinnerbait in 
                    clear water. In off colored or dingy water, consider a chartreuse 
                    or dark colored skirted spinnerbait. If you are fishing in 
                    clear water, the flash of a spinnerbait is more important 
                    then when you are fishing in dingy water (where sound and 
                    vibration might be more important), so consider a bait that 
                    offers willowleaf blades. These blades are known for their 
                    flash. In off-colored water, consider a Colorado or Indiana 
                    blade, as they give off more vibration. In clearer water, 
                    you should initially try chrome, gold or white colored spinnerbait 
                    blades, while in off-colored water, consider chartreuse, gold,

                    quicker to cover that might be in 3 to 5 feet of water. You 
                    don't necessarily have to use a super-large bodied bait, just
