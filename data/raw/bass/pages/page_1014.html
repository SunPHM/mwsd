        best part of their show is the silence before the performance begins. 
        While you wait for them to come on stage you stand in complete darkness

        to wave through your ears awakening the hairs on the back of your neck. 
        Exactly three bars later, and in perfect unison, the warm presence of 
        a bass guitar accompanies the dancing sound of the lead. &#8220;The second 
        heartbeat,&#8221; as Digital Analog calls it, takes over in your chest.

    Digital 
      Analog is an experimental band based out of Toronto, Ontario. Dave Maguire, 
      23, and his younger brother Andrew, 20, are the only permanent members of 
      the ambient-music band. The multi-talented musicians do all their recording 
      in Follow Your Ears Studios - their own recording label. The brothers do 
      all their own recording in the basement of their house in Scarborough - 
      a suburb in Toronto. They play lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, 
      drums, synthesizer, and piano. Their set lists have very few vocals, but 
      for the songs that do require singing, they do that as well. When performing 
      at a live show, Digital Analog usually gets one or two close friends to play 
      backup guitar or bass. However, when recording, they record multi-tracks 
      and play every instrument themselves.</td>

      categorized because both the listener and the musician can interpret what 
      they hear differently. Experimental music ranges anywhere from banging pots 
      and pans together, to simple percussion, to noise and feedback, to rave 
      music, to hip-hop, and even includes some dance and freestyle music. &#8220;Experimental 
      music is essentially just art in an audible state,&#8221; says Andrew Maguire, 
      &#8220;it&#8217;s different for everyone.&#8221; Depending on the listeners 
      and their musical tastes, many first-time listeners perceive experimental 
      music as an odd type of music and many consider it to be just plain noise.<p>&nbsp;<p> <font color="#FFFF00" size="5">The History:</font></td>

    <td width="70%"><p> <font size="6">A</font>lthough the history of ambient or experimental 
        music can be attributed to a collection of many different types of music, 
        most experimental musicians recognize a man named John Cage as the pioneer 
        of ambient and experimental music. Cage was born on Sept. 5, 1912 in Los 
        Angeles, California. In the mid-thirties Cage took classes taught by a 
        very famous classical music composer named <a href="http://www.schoenberg.at/1_as/bio/biographie_e.htm" target="_blank">Arnold 
        Schoenberg</a>. After many lectures and lessons, Schoenberg told Cage 
        that he had a lack of a feeling for harmony and it would stand in his 
        way of becoming a successful composer. However, Cage pursued his dream 
        to compose music and in 1940, he composed his first piece. The piece was 
        called &#8220;Living Room Music,&#8221; and was composed as a percussion 
        quartet but involved no percussion instruments. Instead, Cage had the 
        bizarre idea that using household objects like books, magazines, tables 
        and window frames would make a better sound. Cage very quickly became 
        focused on finding different ways to compose and perform music and even 
        began to develop mathematical equations for structuring his compositions. 
        He began to experiment with music and dance and became focused on creating 
        a structural relation between them. He experimented with electronic music 
        and other percussion instruments. Cage&#8217;s most famous creation was 
        probably an invention called the prepared piano. The prepared piano is 
        a grand piano that has assorted objects placed between the strings in 
        order to create a percussion orchestra that one person could control. 
        Throughout his life Cage composed hundreds of musical pieces and developed 
        many ways to perform music. He died at 89-years-old in New York. Although 
        experimental and ambient music are most often attributed to John Cage, 
        he also pioneered many of the other types of music. His experiments with 
        electronic sound and percussion paved the way for a lot of the techno 
        and rave music we have today. <br>
