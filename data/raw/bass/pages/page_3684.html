	 <H1><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS" SIZE="+2"><B>Minutes of the 15th meeting of
		the Mr.Hanky Gastronomic Society.</B></FONT></H1> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>28th-September-2002</B></FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Another Curry Club day arrived with great
		excitement in the air, and that was only the adult members. The junior members
		had been plotting with secret notes all week to provide their usual cocktails
		and very good they were, very cooling and refreshing, particularly in view of
		the vindaloo. We think the same recipes as last meeting, but with a little
		tweak here and there to accommodate Mrs KNH's tastebuds. But did they look like
		the pictures? The day started with the sun rising in the east, not that any of
		our members were up to see it&#133;&#133;.correction&#133;&#133; our
		Chairperson had intimated a working day could be on the cards and his car did
		go missing rather early. (The writer is in no way trying to show that he was
		also up early as well).</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Despite some consternation during the cooking
		time, most of it went well but after only 50 minutes we found ourselves 60
		minutes behind in the preparation?? Work that out if you can! The impossible we
		can do&#133;&#133;miracles take 60 minutes longer.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">AP managed to splash turmeric over 20% of his
		very best golfing trousers, and 99% of PS's cooker, so any suggestions on
		turmeric stain removal would be appreciated. Otherwise it will cost him
		&pound;2.99 for new trousers and &pound;999.99 for a new cooker. Now this is
		considered to be a MAJOR incident in the CURRIE world and PRESIDENT BUSH and
		COLIN (pronounced ko as in go and lyn, stupid man!!!! ) POWELL should be made
		aware that any HANKY PANKY is not good for your image. Search Engines ready,
		steady, go.</FONT></P>

	 </TABLE> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The Hon Pres is obviously taking her position
		more seriously these days as the customary bottle of wine appeared at the table
		somewhat late it must be said due to what is referred to as out of sight out of
		mind. That is, someone had hidden it as a surprise and then forgot! THREE
		CHEERS FOR THE HON PRES. And if you read this tripe we missed
		you&#133;&#133;creep creep.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Chicken Dhansak</FONT></B></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Apparently well worth the high effort score.
		For those who know Chicken Dhansak it tasted just like Chicken Dhansak. For
		those who haven't tasted Chicken Dhansak, you guessed it, it tasted just like
		Chicken Dhansak. Despite a late start Friday night on the marinade, AP's magic
		potion did the business and during Saturday KNH's onion peeling prowess came to
		the fore, but not before he demolished 4 bottles of Becks and two cans of John
		Smiths (What's that I hear 'Wot no French Beer.' Nope, not until the Cross
		Channel Ferry goes into Winter tariff. Cries of Shame&#133;.
		Disgraceful&#133;.take away his title.</FONT></P>
	 <P><IMG SRC="P9280333.jpg" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Lamb Vindaloo</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">A Vindaloo to behold. In the best tradition
		very hot, extra hot, no triple hot and more. Not that this had anything to do
		with the recipe. Half way through the cooking our official taster declared 'not
		much bite, have we done this right?' Out with AP's Hotty Bits and into the pot
		with gay abandon. Then with backs to the wall, well the Welsh
		Dresser&#133;..too late lads he's gay as well&#133;. someone suggested that
		during the cooking it would get more bite. It did, and some. Well for anyone
		who knows the locale, our playing fields are high up and usually very windy,
		not usually vindaloo windy. Sunday morning football will never be the same
		again. We have heard that the referee is recovering slowly and looking for two
		shifty characters; one carrying a mobile and a red book, the other still
		ravishing a win by QPR over Bristol City.</FONT></P>
	 <P><IMG SRC="P9280332.jpg" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="853" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Pilau Rice</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">What can be said about this? The same as in
		minutes past. The first one to find reference in previous minutes and text me
		the answer receives half a bowl of the aforesaid Pilau Rice, now cold but
		suitable for microwave warming. (text message charged at &pound;99.99) KNH did
		up his effort score in view of his onion peeling marathon, poor chap, no
		stamina, It's enough to make a grown man cry. So are the onions. </FONT></P>
	 <P><IMG SRC="P9280331.jpg" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="853" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Aloo Mattar</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Rather a plastic flavour, but this was put
		down to the fact that whilst cutting the corner off the bag of frozen peas the
		corner of the bag disappeared. Potatoes diced so delicately into precise one
		inch (25.40mm) cubes you would have thought PB had brought a micrometer. Pity
		he wouldn't lend it to AP to prepare a one inch (25.40mm) cube of root ginger.
		Do the people who write these recipes know how root ginger grows? All knobbly
		bits! Perhaps we should go to Brussels and get the rules changed. If we must
		have uniform bananas, why can't we have root ginger in 25.40mm cubes.

	 <P><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Action:</FONT></B></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">CS to be sponsored for a trip to Mauritius to
		investigate and lobby MEPs. Mauritius? Surely you mean Brussels? No, I don't
		like Brussels.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Whole Roast Sea Bass</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Right on the dot of 15.00 hours according to
		the meal plan PB arrived, refused a beer and asked for coffee(must be ill) and
		then quickly dived into the preparation of crushed garlic, chopped parsley and
		other bits in the recipe. Communication being one of our good points we waited
		20 minutes to tell him that the Sea Bass had been given an early start and was
		sat in the fridge just longing to be popped into the oven at
		200&deg;C/400&deg;F(Gas mark 6) Under the trades description act we could be in
		trouble here again. Due to PS's weak stomach and hatred of eyes looking at her
		whilst eating, 'off with their heads' was the order. Anything waving about
		causes her dizziness so the second order was 'off with their tails' Whole Roast
		Sea Bass then becomes Mogified Sea Bass. Get it ..Modified&#133;&#133;Mogified.
		Those that don't just forget it. Lots of sea salt , lots of parsley, lots of
		butter. Not too much garlic, she hates that as well (heaven help us) and only
		thirty minutes in the oven. Wonderful. Selection of fresh vegetables, carrots,
		baby sweet corn and Uncle Ron's last of the season homegrown runner beans
		cooked to perfection made this dish even more wonderful. Anyone interested in
		recipe for Uncle Ron's last of the season homegrown runner beans take note:
		take newspaper wrapping off, wash, slice in automatic bean slicer gadget,
		discard edgy bits and cook in boiling salted water for 6 minutes 37 seconds.
		Not forgetting to put the water in a pot first. Followed by the beans, but not
		before the salt. This information is purely academic as you are not likely to
		get any of Uncle Ron's last of the season homegrown runner beans until next
		year and even then it would be easier for you to win the National
		Lottery.(search engines go&#133;.) </FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Saut&eacute;d Sea Salt
		Potatoes</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Lightly boiled new potatoes, peeled and cut
		into chunky quarters. Pan cooked in olive oil until golden and then unsalted
		butter until crispy, with a good helping of parsley and sea salt. </FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Action</B></FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Cook three times more next time or cancel
		AP's official taster's contract.</FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Nutty Apple Crumble</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Simple recipe &agrave; la Gary Rhodes
		Classics. Crumble baked in oven separately to give more crunch.</FONT></P>
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Should have had Cherry Crumble as well but no
		cherries available except in tins and we don't like packaged food do we?
		</FONT></P>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Talking of which:-</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Custard Sauce aux Messieurs
		Birds</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Generally well received but given a high
		effort score by Mrs KNH because she missed two glasses of wine whilst tending
		to this wonder of modern factory culinary technology in the microwave. She made
		up for it by having a glass in each hand and one waiting on the table. She then
		complained that there were an awful lot of glasses to wash! </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Website Review</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Webmaster extolled the virtues of the website
		with superbly produced graphs on the number of hits, where ,why, when and by
		whom. Strange searches have brought some very fortunate people to enter our
		hallowed pages. Searches for: Bendick's Bittermints; Brioche pudding; Norman
		Gold; Turmeric stains etc etc. Even bums, cleavage and pants!!!! Mrs KNH
		suggested we incorporate groin, but we were not sure who she meant. That's what
		you get when holding two glasses of wine and no free hand to articulate. Apart
		from anything else we haven't got any groin recipes!</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Financial Review.</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">PB's face had a smile on it, so finances must
		be good. He doesn't smile that often, but rumour has it that he smiles in his
		sleep! Not much smiling there then because rumour has it he doesn't get much
		sleep these days. &pound;82 in the kitty. A question was raised as to whether
		we should dispose of the desiccated coconut with a use by date of March 2001.
		Treasurer agreed, provided we could find someone willing to pay current shop
		price.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Any Other Business.</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">No comments of special note, so thanks to Hon
		Pres for the wine, and also thanks to PS for use of the kitchen and SG for
		hosting and the French dark chocolates. Huge applause for the junior members
		cocktails.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"><B>Date Of Next Meeting.</B></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Next meeting is an away day to the Bath Arms
		and then onward to collect presents for the junior members from Father
		Christmas. Home grown curry will be on the menu sometime in January 2003 around
		the 25th. Venues to be finalised nearer the time. Meeting closed to enable the
		washing up sub committee to proceed in an orderly fashion towards the sink.
