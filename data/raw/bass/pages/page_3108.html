        can hold a candle to the MUSKIE ACTION on the Lake of the
        Woods. The guys from far to the north to the guy from the
        south, east or west. Lake of the Woods hold the largest
        concentration of both numbers and size.</p>
        <p align="left">And you'll be glad to know, it's not a
        fish of 10, 000 casts on our lake. A true northwoods
        trophy. We have recorded releases to 57½&quot; long.
        They must be 54&quot; long to be a legal catch. This
        assures both good numbers and large fish in our lake.
        Last year alone we saw 3 legals caught, none were kept
        and a great many more to the boat side. They were
        released by fisherman with a modern day attitude and a
        better understanding of the fish itself. Just so they
        could fight again another day. MUSKIES ... all other fish
        are just bait!</p>

        Pike ...</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left">Routinely producing both in size and
        numbers. Great Northern Pike, with the average being in
        the 5-10 lb. range. True trophies, both taken and
        released up to 37 lbs. Fish need both the water and
        forage to become big. They also need the longer growing
        seasons - a norm on Lake on the Woods. The further north
        you go, the shorter the growing season. If you are
        looking for consistent Northern Pike fishing, and a great
        probability of catching that trophy, come fish with us.
        We have some real nice fish awaiting you arrival.</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#D7041A" size="4"><strong>Walleye
        ...</strong></font><font color="#D7041A"><strong><br>
        World class walleye found in Lake of the Woods</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><img src="images/walleyeshow.jpg"
        alt="Man shows a Walleye" align="left" hspace="10"
        vspace="5" width="233" height="199">More and more anglers
        are discovering that Lake of the Woods is a great place
        to fish for walleye. So good, in fact, that two of the
        premier fishing magazines in the country have written
        special articles naming this area as a
        &quot;world-class&quot; fishery.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>&quot;A solid 5 pound 'eye (is)
        so common on Lake of the Woods these days that even a
        cooler full wouldn't get a second look.&quot;</strong></p>
        <p align="left">The 1991 edition of &quot;In-Fisherman's
        Walleye Guide&quot; highlights this all-star lake as
        being one of the continent's hottest bites. The article
        focuses on eight lakes that are becoming renowned for
        fantastic numbers of good fish couple with excellent
        numbers of trophies.</p>
        <p align="left">Lake of the Woods is the first lake
        featured in the article. &quot;In-Fisherman's&quot;
        magazine explains that the resurgence of the walleye
        population, credited by some of the ban on commercial
        fishing, &quot;rockets (Lake of the Woods) to a top spot
        on our number chart.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">And the average size of fish in the lake
        has rocketed also. Since 1984, the average size of
        walleye taken has risen from one to two pounds. The
        Ministry of Natural Resources reports that &quot;the
        number of three to five-pound walleye is on the upswing
        and that trophies of up to 14 pounds are within reason.</p>
        <p align="left">An article also appears in the March
        edition of &quot;Peterson's Fishing&quot; magazine. In
        that edition, a special section is given to the sport of
        walleye fishing with a special article on Lake of the
        Woods fishing.</p>
        <p align="left">In the article, it is mentioned that Lake
        of the Woods is perhaps the only &quot;world-class&quot;
        walleye fishing left in the world!</p>
        <p align="left">Come and find out for yourself what the
        pros are talking about!</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#D7041A" size="4"
        face="Times New Roman"><strong>Slab Crappie ...</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left">Excellent for sure! In the spring we
        catch them in very shallow water. Mid-summer they are
        suspended. Then in the late summer they start moving to
        deep holes. Average sizes from ¾ lb. to 1¼ lb., with
        Crappie up to 2¾ lb. taken each year. In the fall, the
        schools can be graphed - up to 100 yards long and 20
        yards wide. They make for fantastic pan fishing and they
        are the tastiest treat to eat. Because of our fine
        structure, we can boast the finest Slab Crappie fishing
        anywhere.</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#D7041A" size="4"><strong>Lake
        Trout ...</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left">Deep, cold water is what Lake Trout like.
        Just a 10 minute ride from the lodge, you'll find one of
        the finest, most beautiful trout lakes you'll ever want
        to fish.</p>
        <p align="left">Though this is the ONLY fish that we
        can't brag about catching more of and bigger than our
        friends further north, we do boast action in the 3 - 10
        lb. range. Crow Lake is very deep and crystal clear with
        visibility of 25' or better. It's filled with lots of
        islands and reefs, although it is not as protected as
        Lake of the Woods. Best catches are in the early spring
        and late summer.</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#D7041A" size="4"><strong>Small
        Mouth and Large Mouth Bass ...</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><img src="images/bass.jpg"
        alt="Man with bass" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"
        width="184" height="217">Islands, shallow rocky
        shorelines, weedy back bays and hundreds of reefs. These
        are what make up our lake. They are also the favorite
        places for big bass to be. Lake of the Woods just doesn't
        have bass, it has EXCELLENT BASS'N. OUTSTANDING .. with
        more structure and cover than anyone could ever fish.
        Small mouth run in the 2-5 lb. range, with bass caught up
        to 7 lbs. just last year, very close to the lodge.</p>
        <p align="left">Our large mouth bass fishing just keeps
        getting better as well, ranging from 2-5 lbs. The largest
        caught this year was 7.9 lbs. Let's see Florida grow them
        that big with only the same length of growing season we
        have!</p>
