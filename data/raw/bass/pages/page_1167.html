      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;More Jack Than God&quot; is a thought provoking title is it
          not? Jack Bruce is back with another studio effort and it is his finest work in a very
          long time. Actually, I think the title is easy enough to understand, he is saying that
          this album is all Jack and he is doing an ego check, he is not a God. The fact that he has
          Vernon Reid (Living Colour) playing lead guitar and Bernie Worrell on the Hammond is
          definite plus for Bruce. The man always surrounds himself with the very best. When one of
          your first gigs was playing with Eric Clapton, where do you go from there? I think he has
          chosen his band mates very well over the years. This album is an utter work of genius
          combining rock, blues, jazz and world influences for a tastefully well-done smorgasbord of
          music. Even the rehashed &quot;I Feel Free&quot; and &quot;Politician&quot; sound sparkly
          new and refreshing. The best track is the curtain closer &quot;Lost in the City (Jam
          Mix),&quot; it is a flat out rockin' progressive-blues-rock workout. Surely, its one of
          the best tracks I have ever heard from Bruce. His voice sounds great, and although it has
          mellowed with age, he is a master at enunciating and putting proper emphasis on key words
          in a song. Jack Bruce has proven once again (as if he had to) that he is unequivocally one
          of the best bass players on earth, easily in the top five of active recording artists in
          the world today...</font></p>
