Here's Tom giving a quick drum lesson to one of the girls
who showed up at the <i>DoubleInn</i> to see

for the first time.

Wait a second!  How the hell is Tom giving anyone lessons...
he can't even play the drums himself!

It didn't take long before the bra was back in the picture.
<br/>
<br/>
This picture was taken a couple minutes after Bill placed
the bra on top of the Pumpkinhead in mid-song.
<br/>
<br/>
He sort of looks like a deranged Mickey Mouse, doesn't he?

To the left, it's Johnny D. the Roadie sitting down with Ray 
as Ray tries to play Russ' bass guitar minus
one string.  (Hmmm... the Roadie's
never too far from the bass.)

To the right, it's the Caveman doing his famous
shout at the moon.  'Nuff said.

Ray &#38; Russ switched their instruments for a few songs towards
the end of the night at <i>The DoubleInn</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's Ray playing the bass... he just doesn't seem as
animated as Russ, does he?

We hope to see everyone there too (and hopefully some
more people as well... shut up John).

Ooops!  Bill did you forget the air holes again!
