<b>This instrument is one of the most incredible things I have ever seen played in 
my life. Incorporating a bass guitar and a 6 string guitar, it is played by 
simply touching the strings to the frets.</b></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left">
<b>There are numerous patents on the design, the bridge, the electronics and the 
construction process. The guitar uses noise gate technology to create it's 
distinctive tone and sound.</b></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left">
<b>This guitar is available for sale, please contact Ed Roman for more information.</b></p>
