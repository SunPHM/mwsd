<font size="1" FACE="Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Tahoma,Trebuchet MS,Lucida Console,Arial,Geneva,Swiss,Comic Sans MS,Helvetica,Helv,MS Sans Serif,Sans Serif,sans-serif">Danny spent his youth in London where he was exposed to Celtic music, which influenced his musical taste, and English food, which influenced his stubborn opinion that McDonald&rsquo;s food &ldquo;tastes pretty good.&rdquo; </font></span></font>
<font size="1">
Although the youngest member of <i>Dicey Riley</i>, Danny is by no means the brightest, having given up a lucrative and critically acclaimed act as a Curly Howard impersonator, only to form the punk rock band <i>Smell My Fingers</i> a pitiful seven years after the punk music fad died. His passion for music also forced him to give up a lucrative career as the &ldquo;Before&rdquo; model in ads for just about anything.</font><FONT FACE="Abbess,Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Tahoma,Trebuchet MS,Lucida Console,Arial,Geneva,Swiss,Comic Sans MS,Helvetica,Helv,MS Sans Serif,Sans Serif,sans-serif" ><span style="text-decoration: none"><font size="1" FACE="Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Tahoma,Trebuchet MS,Lucida Console,Arial,Geneva,Swiss,Comic Sans MS,Helvetica,Helv,MS Sans Serif,Sans Serif,sans-serif" COLOR="GREEN"> </font>
<font size="1" FACE="Trebuchet MS,Verdana,Tahoma,Trebuchet MS,Lucida Console,Arial,Geneva,Swiss,Comic Sans MS,Helvetica,Helv,MS Sans Serif,Sans Serif,sans-serif">
Bitter, despondent and angry at the “Establishment” that he felt was holding him back, Danny was arrested in the Fall of 2001 for faxing letters containing anthrax to various government agencies. His philosophy on playing the bass is that &ldquo;you have to treat it like a woman&rsquo;s body, stroking, rubbing, plucking and tweaking it until it makes a loud, deep groaning noise, after which you wind up with a headache and blistered fingers.&rdquo; </font></span></font><font size="1">Danny's main regret is life 
is that he is not dead.</font></TD>

John, the band&rsquo;s drummer, is also <I><B>Dicey</B></I>&rsquo;s main lead singer. He plays something called a &ldquo;cocktail drum set,&rdquo; an unusual set up that allows him to sing lead while drumming standing up. John is from Northampton, Massachusetts. During the day he is a lawyer. While he does all kinds of litigation, his specialty is Federal District Court antipiracy litigation&mdash;so don’t steal cable TV or download music without paying for it when he&rsquo;s around!  

<BR>
<BR>

John has been drumming since he was 8 years old. He has been in marching bands, including the East Hartford Police Fife and Drum, the East Hartford High School Marching Band and the University of Connecticut Marching Band. While at UConn he played (drumming and some singing) in the wildly popular, original jazz-rock band &ldquo;Zax.&rdquo; After college he played in a number of rock bands, all of which emphasized originals (as opposed to the &ldquo;live jukebox on stage&rdquo; mode). In the mid-&rsquo;90s John was a singer (out front, no drums) in the jazz band &ldquo;Busman&rsquo;s Holiday&rdquo; doing straight-ahead jazz standards <I>&aacute; l&agrave;</I> Sinatra.

<BR>
<BR>

In 1998 John was one of the founding members of <I><B>Dicey Riley</B></I>. John does most of the arranging and, along with Danny, he writes many originals. He grew up big city (Hartford) Irish Catholic and listened at an early age to equal parts Beatles and Clancy Brothers. His most important musical influences are Shane McGowan, Elvis Costello, the Beatles, Van Morrison, The Chieftains and Motown.

<font size="1">decided early last year to give up the sousaphone and learn a more &ldquo;girly&rdquo; instrument. Failing to get the hang of the accordion, Jew&rsquo;s harp or clavichord, Katherine opted for the fiddle because it&rsquo;s small, melodically expressive, 
and looks really cool on stage. A respected Professor of Smartness at Smith College and the renowned Worshipful High Priestess of the local Ashur-Du-Smelbad pseudo-Asian ashram/sex cult, Katherine insists on pretending it&rsquo;s &ldquo;only an accident&rdquo; when she repeatedly bashes Michael in the teeth with her elbow during a typical <i>Dicey Riley</i> performance. In her spare time she listens to <i>Jerky Boys</i> albums and colors the pictures on Abdow&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s menus; her favorite color is mauve, her favorite food is Chinese-style cat fritters, and she hopes someday to live in a yurt on a freeway median strip. </font></TD>

<font size="1">Talented, urbane, witty and handsome, Michael rose to fame in the 
early 1970s when he surreptitiously donned blackface to perform on a national 
concert tour as Jimi Hendrix until word leaked out that Hendrix had died. Known as the artistic member of <i>Dicey Riley</i>, Mike 
subsequently pursued a long, illustrious career as an interior decorator until the tragic day in 1999 when he made the horrifying discovery that he wasn&rsquo;t gay. After bumming around for several years painting drunk women&rsquo;s tits at street fairs in New Orleans, Key West and Ft Lauderdale, Michael decided to settle down in the staid, conservative village of Northampton and opened a painting and wallpapering business as a front for a Sinn Fein terrorist training facility.&nbsp;His eclectic interests also include translating classic existential literature into Pig Latin and competitive yawning. He&rsquo;s been strumming guitars for 30 years and one day hopes to purchase one with strings.</font></TD>

<font size="1">Few people realize that &ldquo;Dr Frank,&rdquo; as he is laughingly known by his friends and patients, was originally a gynecology student, but was thrown out of medical school for attempting to introduce the controversial &ldquo;taste test.&rdquo; He went on to study chiropractic, alchemy, palm reading and homeopathic psychic surgery at the Art Bell Institute. Billing himself as the world&rsquo;s only Italian bagpiper who wears a kilt from Victoria&rsquo;s Secret, Frank is the band's &ldquo;babe magnet&rdquo;...until the occasional ill-timed stray breeze reveals to revolted female fans the result of the horrendous playground accident that cost him his genitalia at age 10.</font></TD>
