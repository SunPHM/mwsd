Basitar?&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A basitar is a normal (six string) guitar body and neck with only
two somewhat large strings.&nbsp; According to official specifications (as dictated by
Chris Ballew, the originator of the Basitar, and former frontman of the Presidents of the
United States of America or PUSA) the top (or lowest pitched) string is .060 gauge and the
bottom (highest pitch) string is .036 gauge.&nbsp; These strings are tuned to C sharp (or
D flat if you're one of those half empty people) and G sharp.&nbsp; A basitar is played
much like one would play, well, a bass guitar.&nbsp; The beauty of the tuning is that by
fretting both strings across any fret (<a href="images/finger.jpg">see the illustration</a>),
one can make a chord. Chris was most often seen playing <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/products/epiphone/">Epiphone</a> <a href="http://www.epiphone.com/cgi-bin/epiphone/epi-inst.pl?ID=EGV2">Flying V</a> basitars,
but also at one time or another played from the following assortment:&nbsp; Hofner Violin
Guitar, and these <a href="http://www.gibson.com/">Gibson</a> guitars:&nbsp; Les Paul
Junior, <a href="http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/SG/">SG</a> Melody Maker, and <a href="http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/Designer/EDS1275.html">Double-necked SG</a>.</p>

Guitbass?&nbsp; </b>A guitbass is a normal (six string) guitar body and neck with only
three strings.&nbsp; According to official specifications (as reported by various webpages
and guitar magazine interviews with Dave Dederer, the originator of the Guitbass) the top
(or lowest pitched) string is .065 gauge, the middle string is .045 and the bottom
(highest pitch) string is .035 gauge.&nbsp; These strings are tuned to C sharp, G sharp
and C sharp (an octave higher than the low C sharp).&nbsp; This tuning style is commonly
referred to as &quot;Dropped D tuning, down half a step&quot;.&nbsp; If you are a newbie,
disregard that last sentence unless someone who knows something about guitars asks you how
you are tuned.&nbsp; Guitbasses can be used to perform the same one finger across all
strings on a single fret power chord thingy mentioned in the basitar discussion above (<a href="images/finger.jpg">see the illustration</a>). &nbsp; Dave Dederer almost exclusively
played <a href="http://www.fender.com/">Fender</a> Stratocaster and Telecaster Guitbasses.</p>

<b>Where do these instruments come from?&nbsp; </b>The basitar and guitbass were
introduced to the world by Chris Ballew and Dave Dederer (respectively), who at the time
were members of The Presidents of the United States of America. Chris also plays the
basitar on his recent solo project, <a HREF="http://imusic.com/labels/myownplanet/giraffes/index.html">The Giraffes</a>.&nbsp;
They have credited Mark Sandman of <a href="http://www.morphine3.com/">Morphine</a> with
the original idea for 2 strings, but Ballew had been fiddling with string setups and
tunings prior to being &quot;turned on&quot; to the 2 string idea.&nbsp; The guitbass was
developed to complement the basitar.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://209.35.77.118/cbnet/articles/9703BassPlayer.htm">this
article</a> from <a href="http://www.bassplayer.com/">Bass Player Magazine</a>
for a pretty good chronicle of the whole development.&nbsp; The article is on <a href="http://Chris.Ballew.net">http://Chris.Ballew.net</a>,

<b>Why should I play one?&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>There are several reasons for playing a basitar
or guitbass: 

<ol>
  <li><b>You love PUSA music and want to play it.&nbsp; </b>This is how i got started playing
    the Guitbass.</li>
  <li><b>You are a novice guitar player, you want to rock, but are impatient and don't want to
    learn all those damn chords.&nbsp; </b>I also fall into this category.</li>
  <li><b>You know how to play the guitar or bass, but popped a few strings and can't afford
    replacement strings.</b></li>
  <li><b>You're an established guitar player and you've got lotsa guitars laying around, and
    are bored with the regularity.</b></li>
  <li><b>You have a tendency to get really drunk and can't play very well while intoxicated.</b></li>
  <li><b>You've got an old guitar that you bought while in high school, (which is now doing a
    bang-up job of taking up closet space) but never play it because you couldn't learn all
    those damn chords.</b></li>
</ol>

<hr size="5">
<b>

<p align="left">How do I get/make one?&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>If you go to a music store and ask
for a Basitar or a Guitbass, you probably won't do very well.&nbsp; The salesman will
either give you a blank stare, or laugh uncontrollably.&nbsp; Your best bet, if you don't
already have a guitar to turn into a Guitbass or Basitar is to get a second-hand guitar
from either a pawn shop, or a music store that sells used instruments.&nbsp; If you're
filthy rich, just go buy whatever the hell you want.&nbsp; Slight, mostly non-permanent
changes need to be made to set it up correctly. &nbsp; See the definitions of <a href="#basitar">Basitar</a> and <a href="#guitbass">Guitbass</a> for proper string size
and tuning.</p>

<p align="left">Here's some tips from Chris Ballew on the proper setup: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">...Well you need to file down the saddle at the bridge and at the head
  stock &lt;the nut&gt; to accomodate the larger strings. Otherwise the string will sit too
  far off the fretboard and the intonation will never be right...&nbsp; ...The best
  situation is to have a floating bridge that is not attatched to the guitar or the hard to
  find Leo Quan Bad-ass bridge for guitars. Truss rod is not usually a problem but it may
  need tightening because the 2 strings don't have the tension of 6.<br>
  hope that helps...<br>
  chris</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">More tips (from me):</p>

<ul>
  <li><p align="left">A VERY IMPORTANT TIP:&nbsp; when filing the nut (at the headstock), go
    VERY slowly.&nbsp; You are essentially trying to widen the slot, not deepen it.&nbsp; You
    don't want to make the slot too deep.&nbsp; If you do, your strings will buzz like crazy
    when playing open notes, and the only way to fix this is to replace the nut. &nbsp;
    Replacing a nut is not something you want to try yourself.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">For a basitar the strings are located in the slots normally occupied by
    the D and B strings, for a Guitbass, you put the strings in the A, D, and G string
    positions.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"><a href="http://www.inthequeue.com/guitbass/images/g_head.jpg"><img src="images/g_head_small.jpg" alt="g_head.jpg (16166 bytes)" border="2" align="left" hspace="2" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="191"></a><a href="http://www.inthequeue.com/guitbass/images/b_bridge.jpg"><img src="images/b_bridge_small.jpg" alt="b_bridge.jpg (13217 bytes)" border="2" align="right" hspace="2" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="154"></a>As an added touch, remove the extra hardware from the bridge and the
    headstock.&nbsp; It looks cool, and prevents you from having a bunch of pieces of metal
    rattling about as you play.&nbsp; <br>

<ul>
  <li><p align="left">Is the string size important?&nbsp; YES, when I first set up my
    Guitbass, the store gave me a set of <a href="http://www.ernieball.com/">Ernie Ball</a>
    Super Slinkys.&nbsp; The three largest strings were .042, .032, and .024 gauge. &nbsp;
    These were ok, but didn't produce that punchy PUSA sound.&nbsp; After playing those for a
    while, (and breaking a string) I moved up to the Power Slinkys (.048, .038, .028). &nbsp;
    It is amazing the difference in sound and tone that the larger strings produce. &nbsp; As
    soon as I run out of my Power Slinky stockpile, I plan to move to even larger
    strings.&nbsp; My friends at a local music store, <a href="http://www.victorlitz.com/">Victor
    Litz</a>, in Gaithersburg, MD, were able to special order me strings for my Guitbass from <a href="http://www.ernieball.com/">Ernie Ball</a>.&nbsp; I ordered strings sized .064, .044,
    and .036 to put on my guitbass.&nbsp; If your store is an <a href="http://www.ernieball.com/">Ernie Ball</a> dealer, they should be able to hook you
    up.&nbsp; When I set up my Basitar, I went for the Jugular, using the .060 and .036
    gauges.&nbsp; When played through the right amp, It sounds perfect!</p>

<b>What songs can I play?&nbsp; </b>Really, just about anything.&nbsp; Obviously, PUSA
songs!&nbsp; <a href="http://come.to/pusa">The White House of PUSA</a> is a place with
quite a few PUSA tablatures, most of which are transcribed for Guitbass!&nbsp;&nbsp; I
purchased 'Guitar Recorded Versions' songbooks for the first two PUSA albums from <a href="http://www.harrismusic.com/">Harris Music</a>, they were published by <a href="http://www.halleonard.com">Hal Leonard</a>.&nbsp; These books include lyrics, music,
tablature, and chord charts (as well as cool photocopies of the original lyric sheets).

  <p align="left"><strong>TAB Translation</strong> - Many guitarists use what are called
  tablature to read/write music.&nbsp; I'm not going to attempt to give a full explanation
  on how to read tabs, because that has already been done here: <a href="http://www.endprod.com/tab/">Tablature Explained</a>.&nbsp; A good example of a tab
  that can be easily translated to guitbass is the song &quot;Closing Time&quot; by
  Semisonic from the album <em>Feeling Strangely Fine</em>.</p>
  <p align="left">The song basically has 4 chords throughout:</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G5

  to the number of the A and D strings (5+1 = 6) and fret across all the strings on your
  Guitbass or Basitar (just like the picture to the left).&nbsp; The translation for the D5
  is a little more tricky, as it is played on the A, D, and G strings. &nbsp; If you see
  something like this, you need to add 6 to the value for the D and G strings (7+6 = 13),
  and fret across all the strings on that fret.</p>

      shape, the neck feels nice, but as far as Stratocaster goes, it is a little odd, (no
      pickguard, 2 single coil pickups, and 1 humbucker instead of 3 single coils, different
      knobs etc.) It has the proper body and neck shape, the neck is a one piece maple, and the
      body appears to be laminated something or other. It makes a great Guitbass though.&nbsp; I

      Flying V, to recreate the actual instrument played by Chris.&nbsp; Plus Flying V's are
      just plain awesome looking guitars. &nbsp; New Epiphone Flying V's list at ~$600, can be

      taken the time to take a &quot;before&quot; photo, but I was in too much of a hurry to fix
      this thing up.&nbsp; When I bought it, the pickguard was covered with black tape, the dot
      inlays on the neck and pickups had green glow-in-the-dark paint, it had stickers all over
      it, parts of playing cards glued to it, one pickup was flopping around in the pickguard,
      and the tone pot was broken!&nbsp; After a couple of hours I had resurrected the thing and
      converted it to a beautiful Basitar. &nbsp; The differences between mine and Chris
      Ballew's is that mine is black, Chris preferred the red ones. &nbsp; Also he used
      different pickups than the stock ones.&nbsp; He told me that he &quot;had Epiphone put in
      one p-90 &lt;at the neck&gt; instead of the 2 humbuckers that the flying V comes
      with.&quot;&nbsp; I won't be doing this real soon, as it would cost me almost as much as I
      paid for my guitar for one of those pickups.&nbsp; </p>
