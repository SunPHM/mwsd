      We managed only one dive on the <a href="../shipwrecks/brunette.html">Brunette</a> 
      today, as the ocean went from 3 to 4 ft seas to 4 to 6ft seas by 1 O'clock.&nbsp; 
      Good vis and 60 degree bottom temperature made the dive bearable, even in 
      the rough seas.&nbsp; We collected more brass trinkets from the wreck.

  We sailed today, despite the warnings of a

      flat seas and modest NW wind.&nbsp; It doesn't pay to watch the weather

 Rough Seas kept the MAST student

      the crowd as we elected to wait until next week.&nbsp; It was good to get   
      out after three weeks of no diving.&nbsp; Here was a forecast that hit   
      it's mark, when strong gusty winds appeared right on time and made the   
      ocean extremely sloppy, very quickly.

    &nbsp; Vis was an astounding 50-60ft on the wreck with 56 degree water temps.&nbsp; The 
    only downside seems to be the slow emergence of the Lion's Mane jellyfish which are 
    beginning to show-up once again.&nbsp; Several big bugs and fish were caught.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    href="../shipwrecks/emerald.html">Emerald</a>.&nbsp; This was the first time on this wreck 
    for us this year.&nbsp; We enjoyed calm seas and great bottom conditions with 40 foot 
    visibility and 55 degree bottom water temperature.&nbsp; We used two scooters and our air 
    dredge to look for artifacts, finding an odd assortment of brass and glass.</p>

    This was a private/fun trip for our crew and some friends to visit this great wreck, 34 
    miles out of Manasquan Inlet.&nbsp; Conditions were great, seas flat and once we cleared 
    the early morning fog the worst of the day was overcast skies keep the 40ft+ vis dark on 
    the wreck. &nbsp; Divers filled the two game coolers with lobsters and sea bass.</p>

    Today's open boat started out pretty good, but the forecast was ominous and by noon time 
    had been proved correct and had changed our morning flat seas into 4-5 footers ! The ride 
    home in beam seas was almost as good as the water park rides at Great Adventure. We did 
    get to make two offshore dives at the lobster condo and a nearby smaller rock pile.&nbsp; 
    The <a href="2001_condo.html">Condo </a>continues to live up to it's name. Divers bagged a

    APC ( armored personnel carrier ) off her stern.&nbsp; Their 2nd dive was on the <a

    Offshore Dives on the Silver Barge. Traveling offshore on a private dive we visited a 
    wreck we hadn't dived in over 10 years. In 147ft on the east end of the Mud Hole we found 
    that the wreck has broken-up quite abit but we were treated to 50ft+ vis and plenty of 
    lobsters. We filled 4 coolers with over 40 lobsters between 12 divers. Most were over 2lbs 
    with the largest at 7lbs.&nbsp; Take a look at some the lobsters, <a
