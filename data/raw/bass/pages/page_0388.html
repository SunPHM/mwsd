To explain this condition, first think of the lake during the heat of the summer. <p></p></p><p>The intensity of the summer sun heats the water, and by midsummer it becomes stratified in layers. <p></p></p><p>The bottom layer is made up of colder water, and colder water is denser water. <p></p></p><p>The upper layer is much warmer, and since warm water is less dense than cold water, in effect it "floats" above the cold layer. <p></p></p><p>Where the upper and lower layers meet is a narrow layer of water that is called the "thermocline." <p></p></p><p>This layer is often only a few feet thick, yet it experiences a rapid drop in temperature of about 6 to 8 degrees from the water above it.<p></p></p><p>Bass fishermen need to understand this phenomenon if they want to improve their ability to locate their quarry. <p></p></p><p>During the summer, water above the thermocline contains the majority of the aquatic life that bass require. <p></p></p><p>Sunlight kick-starts photosynthesis, allowing algae to reproduce, and the summer winds create waves that dissolve oxygen in the upper layer. <p></p></p><p>Baitfish thrive in this environment until the water gets too hot, and then they descend to the thermocline.<p></p></p><p>In many cases these baitfish, and the bass that follow them, do not travel below the thermocline because the water isn't suitable. <p></p></p><p>Below the thermocline the water is often low in oxygen, and colder than bass prefer. <p></p></p><p>The thermocline effectively functions as a barrier to the bass, which at times they may ignore, but not for any length of time.<p></p></p><p>Finding bass during the summer can be as simple as determining how deep the thermocline exists, and then fishing at that depth or anywhere above it. <p></p></p><p>A quality depth finder that is properly adjusted can actually show the thermocline on the screen as a narrow band of gray at mid-depth. <p></p></p><p>This gray shows because the suddenly denser water at the thermocline prevents lighter nutrients and dissolved oxygen from sinking to the bottom, and these reflect the sonar signals. <p></p></p><p>Baitfish often travel at this depth since their food source is concentrated there, and the water quality is healthy. <p></p></p><p>Anytime bait is concentrated, you can expect hungry bass to be close at hand.<p></p></p><p>As fall progresses, the surface layer starts getting colder and denser. <p></p></p><p>In simplified terms, turnover can be described as a time when the surface layer of water becomes colder (and eventually heavier) than the water below it. <p></p></p><p>When it gets too heavy, it suddenly flip-flops with the lower layer, and mixes in the process. <p></p></p><p>Turnover happens quickly and thoroughly, blending not only the water temperature, but also pH, oxygen and nutrients equally from the bottom of the lake to the surface.<p></p></p><p>Since there is no thermocline after turnover, baitfish and bass are now free to roam into depths that previously were unattractive. <p></p></p><p>Now bass can be found shallow, in middepths or in very deep water. <p></p></p><p>The key to locating these bass is to move often and locate the bait.<p></p></p><p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td rowspan=2 width=13 ><spacer type=block width=13></spacer></td><td width=193><img src="http://espn.go.com/winnercomm/outdoors/fishing/i/P2_f_fea_transition_bass3.jpg" height=250 width=193 alt="Smallmouth bass" border=0 vspace=4><br><font class=storyphoto>What's better than catching a bass? Why, catching two bass!</font><font class=smalllead>&nbsp;</font><br></td></tr></table>During the cold months of fall and winter, your most important tools for locating bait and bass are your underwater eyes. <p></p></p><p>Most modern boats are equipped with sonar, which is the time-proven method of "seeing" beneath the surface. <p></p></p><p>In the past 10 years our underwater eyes have become even better with the development of affordable underwater cameras.<p></p></p><p>Take, for example, the underwater camera that I was viewing, hundreds of yards from the shoreline on a northwest lake. <p></p></p><p>Large schools of 3- to 6-pound smallmouth bass were cruising between 25 and 35 feet deep. <p></p></p><p>Apparently these bass had not read the book on bass fishing, as they were not relating to any kind of cover such as sunken logs, or to typical structure like drop-offs, rockpiles or underwater humps. <p></p></p><p>They weren't stationed where they could ambush passing minnows, but seemed to be aimlessly wandering back and forth over a sandy flat. <p></p></p><p>"Flat" was an understatement, as the bottom looked like the Mojave desert, with only an occasional sprig of vegetation that never seemed to amount to anything.<p></p></p><p>Moments before the stranger spoke to me, I noticed something I didn't expect to see: A crayfish about as big as my fist was crawling along the bottom! <p></p></p><p>While studying the defensive crustacean with the camera lens, I began to see something that the big smallmouths had undoubtedly known for years. <p></p></p><p>This crayfish was leaving a trail where the sand and silt was disturbed from its crawling. <p></p></p><p>These prowling smallmouth could spot these trails and following them to an easy meal!<p></p></p><p>After treating the intruding stranger like he was trying to steal a newfound secret, I acted cool until he was out of sight. <p></p></p><p>Then I studied the camera again and spotted more crayfish, and more trails. <p></p></p><p>Apparently I was witnessing a migration of crayfish from their shallower summer homes down to their wintering homes now that the thermocline was gone. <p></p></p><p>Since these crayfish were big, only the larger bass were taking advantage of the easy pickings.<p></p></p><p><font class="subhead">Dragging for bass</font><p></p></p><p><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 align=right><tr><td rowspan=2 width=13 ><spacer type=block width=13></spacer></td><td width=250><img src="http://espn.go.com/winnercomm/outdoors/fishing/i/P2_f_fea_transition_bass4.jpg" height=189 width=250 alt="Crayfish" border=0 vspace=4><br><font class=storyphoto>Don't be afraid &#151; this little beastie could be the key to your fall bassin' success.</font><font class=smalllead>&nbsp;</font><br></td></tr></table>Being human, I quickly swapped the camera for my Lamiglas rod and lowered a Yamamoto soft plastic crayfish on a ½-ounce football-head jig to the bottom. <p></p></p><p>The instant it hit the bottom, a thump signaled that Mama Pesce had crushed it.<p></p></p><p>Despite several spirited runs, the Gamakatsu jig hook did its job and almost 6 pounds of angry smallmouth made a handsome picture on my deck.<p></p></p><p>By making long casts and dragging the fake crayfish through the bottom silt 30 feet deep, I was able to continue to pick up quality bass. <p></p></p><p>Even though more than 40 other bass boats were sharing the lake for a local tournament (which I was not participating in), I was all alone on the "barren" flat while others were probing underwater structure.<p></p></p><p>Life is sweet when you're sitting on top of big, hungry bass and nobody is trying to horn in on you!<p></p></p><p>Despite the fun of catching big smallmouth, my curiosity got the better of me, and I lowered the camera again to study the underwater world. <p></p></p><p>Although water temperatures were still in the low 50s, some bass had already moved as deep as 60 feet. <p></p></p><p>These bass were stationary rather than prowling around, and they appeared to be less than 2 pounds in size. <p></p></p><p>Later I learned that some of the tournament anglers also caught smallmouth within range of a crankbait, but these were also smaller fish. <p></p></p><p>At least on this day the big bass were focused on eating a tasty target of opportunity: migrating crayfish in the 30-foot depths.<p></p></p><p>So the next time you encounter someone hunkered over a small box in the middle of the lake, instead of asking if he is "alright," you might ask if he is finding crayfish or bass.
