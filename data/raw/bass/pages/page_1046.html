  <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Columbus Jazz Bass</font></h3>
  </FONT> 
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roger 
    from the record shop showed me this bass which his mate was selling, he'd 
    been thinking of buying it and had it in the back room there, but had decided 
    he didn't want it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was 
    ninety quid which was cheaper than the second hand shops but quite a lot of 
    money for me in those days.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everything 
    I'd learned about the need to consider modification and bodging was applied 
    to that bass, which sounded terrible the first time I tried to play it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
    was a chrome cover over the front pickup getting in the way of where you'd 
    want to pick or pluck, and an even bigger cover over the bridge and rear pickup 
    which made it impossible to damp the strings while playing them or, indeed, 
    change the strings in a hurry. <em><font color="#990000">[Jazz players don't 
    change their strings, do they? - cynical Ed.]</font></em></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presumably 
    these are features of the original Fender Jazz Bass design and I understand 
    these covers have some effect on the way the pickups work. But they came off 
    straight away anyhow along with the lump of foam concealed beneath the rear 
    cover, which was killing the sustain on the strings.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you 
    wanted the bass guitar to play dead thumpy notes in a poor imitation of a 
    tuba (as, doubtless, some people do) then that piece of foam would be a life 
    saver. For anyone with expressive musical intentions it was a stinker.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That bass 
    guitar worked really well and withstood all kinds of abuse, including being 
    hurled off stage a couple of times (there was usually a large space of empty 
    dance floor in front of us when we played, and a handful of baffled onlookers 
    keeping well back, arrayed around the far edges of the room). I had a double 
    length curly lead attached and it went down like an overweight glider&#8230;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I took 
    all the sunburst finish off with a sanding disk which made it quite a bit 
    lighter, and revealed the inner beauty of the plywood body. Future plans had 
    been to re-wind one of the pickups so that separate outputs could be had from 
    each string, for individual effects treatment and stereo panning. A quarter 
    of a century later I'm still babbling on about this, though at least I now 
    have the required four-way PA system to send the finished results through&#8230; 
    </font></p>
  <h4 align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Postscript 
    on the Jazz Bass </font></h4>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few 
    years later, after it got stolen and I was later unexpectedly offered another 
    bass gig (I thought I'd retired from performance) I leaned on my next door 
    neighbour to sell me his copy Jazz Bass, which he never played, but it was 
    a plank compared to the Columbus. After a few gigs I bought the real life 
    Fender Jazz Bass which I still use today (which, as well as having had the 
    chrome covers, scratch plate etc. removed at birth also had a set of Precision 
    pickups added and a custom bridge).</font></p>
  <h3 align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Antoria SG copy</font></h3>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A bloke 
    at the chemical factory where I worked sold this to me. I didn't have guitar 
    playing ambitions but I wanted to work out what it was that guitarists did 
    in order to figure out what I should be doing on the bass.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So instead 
    of working my way through &quot;Play bass in a week&quot; (by Whoever) I picked 
    up the Antoria instead and learned some chords from a guitar chord book. Some 
    of the (altogether very few) songs I contributed to the Instant Automatons 
    were written on the SG copy. It was mostly cherry red but a lump was missing 
    and had been painted over in a non-matching red colour. I took all the finish 
    off with a sanding disk and revealed the beautiful plywood body beneath. I 
    swapped this guitar for a copy Les Paul Junior and had the joy of seeing someone 
    else smash it to pieces at a gig in Hammersmith, a few years later (as the 
    saying goes). </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both these 
    guitars can been seen in their plywood conditions in the photo of the <a href="../photos/images/reallynice.jpg">Really 
    Nice People</a> and in their original conditions in the photo I have hilariously 
    captioned <em><a href="Guitarshop.jpg">guitar shop</a></em>, along with a 
    not-totally-dreadful acoustic guitar. The truly awful acoustic guitar which 
    had been unsuccessfully converted into a three string bass is hiding in the 
    tartan guitar bag.</font></p>
