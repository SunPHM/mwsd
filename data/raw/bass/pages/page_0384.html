      </strong>Fished with my old buddy Tony Mazzara from High School that now resides in
      Tucson, Arizona.&nbsp; He and his son Anthony and I had a good mixed bag catch while
      jigging artificials around the Inlet area.&nbsp; Caught 4 weaks from 4 to 7 lb., a couple
      of bluefish and a whopping 10 lb. blackfish.&nbsp; A fun day!</p>

      </strong>A week of fishing at the <strong>&quot;Andros Island Bonefish Club&quot;</strong>
      on Andros Island in the Bahamas.&nbsp; Great bonefishing with my friend Len Lapsys and
      extraordinary guide <strong>Barry Neymour</strong>.&nbsp; Andros Island has hundreds of
      miles of flats and we fished many places and caught many bonefish.&nbsp; I boated about 30
      bones up to 8 lb. with the average weight about 6 lb., all on fly tackle.&nbsp; I had one
      shot at a tarpon about 70 lb. but as the tarpon headed for my fly, a needlefish picked it
      up and spoiled the attempt.&nbsp; The owner and head guide <strong>Rupert Leadon</strong>
      did a wonderful job of making everything perfect during our stay.&nbsp; If you like to fly
      fish then this is the place to go for bonefish that take you down to the backing.&nbsp; If
      you might be interested in such a trip just e-mail me for more information.</font></p>

      In the morning small Bluefish were in the coast guard station area. I then Went fluke
      fishing with only 2 Keeper to show for my effort. The 2 keepers where caught just south
      east of the inlet in 38 feet of water. I then difted sun dials around looking for big bass
      but not a touch.</p>

      There are fish everywhere the best bite is at night regardless of the tide. Most of the
      fish are coming up in the range channel and east. Its a slow pick in the AM, but some big
      fish are coming up, in the 9 lbs. range now. They are starting to switch from artifices to
      bait. Most of the fish now are coming up on sandworms .<br>
      <br>
      If you are interested in flounders, the thumb is the place to be. Set up at the second
      jetty from the west in 12 -13 ft of water. Bloods seem to be the bait of choice .Chum will
      help but just banging up the bottom is enough ...<br>

      of small Stripers to 24&quot; were busting water and chasing bait. I used a surface popper
      with only one treble hook to entice the bass. The hook up ratio is less but it's great fun
      watching the school bass swipe the plug. I lost count after my first 6 fish and my finger
      had a blister from casting so much. After the breakfast bite I used a white bucktail with
      white pork rind to catch 3 Weakfish up to 4.5 pounds. I made back to work by 9am.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Yesterday Al and I took advantage of the incredible
    clean water that has been in the bay lately. With Capt. Al's shallow&nbsp; draft utility
    boat we explored the thin back water of the Great South Bay. We estimated the visibility
    to&nbsp; be between 15 to 20 feet. Now is a great time to investigate the lumps and bumps
    that you have only seen on your fish-finder just by looking into the gin clear water. We
    also helped clean up the islands around the Great South Bay.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Now to the fishing. Al and I tried for flounder in
    the sore thumb pocket with only one 1 fish for the effort.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Last night was a great chance to explore in the back
    again. With no wind and the start of the ebb tide, the conditions were perfect. You could
    see a ripple a quarter mile away. Once again the clues were obvious, bird life and the
    occasional fish breaking water, but just like the previous morning the stripers had no
    interest in my lure. What was needed was a women's touch. My long time friend Tara made
    the perfect cast and presentation. Tara made the lure pop and dance across the mirror
    surface of the water. Ten feet from the boat we watched the Striper streak up from the
    clear water and inhale the popping plug. The scrappy schoolie bass fought hard but was no
    match for Tara as she released her day's frustration&nbsp; through the rod and reel. We
    released the bass at the boat and enjoyed a great sunset and cruise home, and for Tara she
    made the best of a bad day.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Went scouting around in the back bay early this
    morning and came across a boiling school of Striped Bass, For about 2 hours I tried to
    entice the schoolie bass to take a lure. I finally hooked up with a white bucktail pork
    rind combo. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana">After a below average day of fishing in front of the
    sewer plant on Sunday and news of good catches off of Amityville I decided to fish West on
    Monday. I fished the East West channel in 13' feet of water, the only action I had was a 5
    lb. Striper. The wind picked up by noon and to escape the slop I set up in the Lindenhurst
    cut. Once I was set up, my parents and I picked 9 Flounder up to 1.5 lbs. My mother was
    high hook with 4 fish.</font></p>

    Anthony DeBlasio and I decided to clear our heads with a little fishing. The first hour
    was a little slow, when Anthony finally came to and wet his line, the action heated up.
    Anthony caught 2 Flounder the first one was 1.5 lbs. and the second was a 2.44 lbs.
    behemoth. Anthony DeBlasio is now the leader in the skimmeroutdoors.com monthly fishing
    contest. We fished in front of the sewer plant. Total catch 3 Flounder.<br>
