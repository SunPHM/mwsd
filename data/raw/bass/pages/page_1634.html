            </table>
            <p class="body"> Relatively little is known about the instrument maker 
              T. Davies. The Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers by D.G. Plowright 
              does mention that his 'Violins and violas are quite well made' and 
              from the quality of this instrument this certainly can be said of 
              his double basses. Davies was obviously quite a prolific maker of 
              the double bass for the Contrabass Shoppe has in the recent past 
              sold two other instruments by him and proprietor Anthony Houska 
              knows of the whereabouts of at least three or four others that are 
              currently being used by professional players in London.</p>
            <p class="body"> Located on the central back brace of this exceptional 
              instrument is Davies's original label. In hand written black ink 
              it reads 'T. Davies Maker Birmingham 1874 No3'. The question we 
              must ask ourselves is - is this instrument Davies's third double 
              bass or is it the third instrument made in that particular year? 
              If it is only the third double bass that he ever made then it is 
              a sure thing that he took a lot of care and pride over its making. 
              Indeed, this is not the work of somebody who is learning from his 
              mistakes as he goes along. The model is big and bold, there is a 
              certain flamboyancy to the style and then there is the arching to 
              the table that makes one gasp with admiration at its sheer perfection. 
              Like all the other instruments known to be made by Davies this one 
              bears his brand 'T. Davies' on the back button.</p>
            <p class="body"> Another brand can be found on the root of the bass 
              side neck. It is not the Davies brand but that of the maker and 
              repairer William Calow of Nottingham. Carlow's obviously had high 
              thoughts with regard to his own repair work for the inside of this 
              instrument is absolutely littered with his pencil inscriptions. 
              Unfortunately the work is not of the same standard that the Contrabass 
              Shoppe demands from its restorers. Prime evidence of his sins comes 
              in the form of an incredibly strange shaped bassbar with a handwritten 
              inscription along the bottom that reads in capital letters 'REPAIRED 
              AND FITTED BY F.W.CALOW. 24 BURTON ST, NOTTm. JULY 1937 FOR MR THISTLWOOD'. 
              Besides being unconformist in shape it was also badly positioned 
              and badly fitted. The Calow bar has been removed intact and is now 
              offered with the instrument as part of its history.</p>
            <p class="body"> Four other internal hand written pencil inscriptions 
              from Mr Calow can be found.</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body"> On upper table on treble side - 'This Bass 
                Made By T Davies, Birmingham 1874 No3 - Should label be 
                Missing'.</li>
              <li class="body"> On lower table on treble side - 'REPAIRED 
                BY Fk W. Calow. 24 Burton St Nottm 1937'</li>
              <li class="body"> On upper back on angle break on bass side - 'Repaired 
                By and Re-necked July 1937 Fk W. Calow. Violin maker 24 Burton 
                St, Nottingham'</li>
              <li class="body"> On lower back on treble side - 'Repaired 
                By and Re-necked July 1937 Fk W. Calow. Violin maker 24 Burton 
                St, Nottingham'</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="body"> Finally another so called bass-specialist repairer, 
              a Mr J. Jones from a slightly earlier date to that of Calow has 
              left his repair label on the central back above the central brace. 
              It reads 'Mr J. Jones, 5 Leopold Street, Birmingham. For Mr 
              Kirkby, Reginold Terrace, Leeds. 23rd November 1917.'</p>
            <p class="body"> But I thought you said that there is very little 
              damage to the instrument? Yes that is correct and I must admit that 
              that statement does sound a bit funny particularly with all those 
              repairer inscriptions inside the instrument. The fact of the matter 
              is that our past restorers were rather overzealous in their approach 
              with the end result being somewhat messy. To sort out everything 
              properly has required an expenditure in excess of 4K. The nature 
              of the work done is too numerous to mention here but it should suffice 
              to say that it has been executed without compromise. By the 
              way, you have my assurances that a correctly fitted, correctly shaped 
              bass bar is now in position.</p>
            <p class="body"> Words cannot really describe the overall condition 
              of this magnificent instrument. Words will not do justice to the 
              power and tonal qualities of this instrument. This is a Goliath 
              of an instrument. As estate agents say here in the UK "An 
              early viewing is highly recommended".</p>
