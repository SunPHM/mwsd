            who love music never thought of attending an accordion concert, but 
            go regularly to chamber music series," observes Frank Hohner of M. 
            Hohner, Inc. Thus, an entirely new accordion concept is being fostered 
            on concert-goers as the instrument finds its place in ensembles. Educator

            music may be defined as instrumental ensemble music performed by one 
            player to a part, as opposed to orchestral music, in which there are 
            several players to a part. Emphasis lies on the ensemble rather than 
            the single player. Instrumental ensemble pieces already existed in 
            the late Middle Ages by composers such as Obrecht, Isaac, Hofhaimer, 
            and in the 16th century by composers such as Willaert, Buus, and Padovano. 
            Musicians to this day have continued to value chamber music, primarily 
            because it permits a refinement and intimacy of expression that cannot 
            be derived from a large musical organization.<br>
            <br>
            Since the accordion has so many attributes that are conducive to chamber 
            music, it is particularly suitable for this medium of expression. 
            In essence, the accordion has all of the prerequisites essential to 
            small ensemble involvement: sustaining power, dynamic sensitivity, 
            articulated response, timbre and texture variance, and compatibility 
            of sound with string and wind instruments.<br>
            <br>
            During the Baroque period (1600-1750), chamber music with some type 
            of keyboard instrument (small organ, harpsichord) became prevalent 
            with trio sonatas. This kind of chamber music is written in three 
            parts with similar range and design and a supporting figured-bass 
            part. The trio sonata is usually performed on four instruments: two 
            violins for the upper parts, a cello for the bass part, and a keyboard 
            instrument for the bass part with the realization of the thorough 
            bass (harmony) accompaniment.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="graphics/cham2.jpg" width="391" height="196" align="right" alt="cham2.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="7">The 
            accordion, in the role of the keyboard part, maintains the clarity 
            of sustained lines that are essential to the character of this kind 
            of music. Playing the keyboard part on the accordion requires little 
            or no modification - especially if performed on an instrument, which 
            has the extended potential of a free bass system. Since the trio sonata 
            was the most important type of Baroque chamber music, almost all composers 
            of this period wrote for this medium. My performing experience has 
            included the Trio Sonatas by Bach, Handel, Telemann, Corelli and Arne.<br>
            <br>
            In the past 25 years, composers have utilized the accordion in a chamber 
            setting with particular emphasis on its explosive dynamic power coupled 
            with transparent sustained qualities. Examples of this kind of writing 
            are found in Carmelo Pino's Concertino for strings and accordion, 
            Night Music for string quartet and accordion by David Diamond, Movements 
            for accordion and string quartet and Duell for accordion and percussion 
            by Torbjorn Lundquist, Mosaic for flute and accordion by Normand Lockwood, 
            Trio for guitar, violin and accordion by Jindrich Feld, Introduction 
            and Allegro by Mathyas Seiber for cello and accordion and Trio for 
            accordion, piano and cello by Ted Zarlengo. <br>
            <br>
            For the serious accordionist, it is difficult to conceive of a more 
            challenging and satisfying musical effort than the involvement in 
            chamber music. Working with other instruments gives one a completely 
            new perspective about the accordion's unlimited musical resources 
            and sound control, as well as musical understanding of how one's own 
            part contributes to the overall shape of the composition. The accordion's 
            function as the sound producer and controller within the ensemble 
            must be thoroughly understood to be used most efficiently as the medium 
            of expression, since music, by its very nature, is a living, breathing 
            art.<br>
            <br>
            Among the benefits to be derived by utilizing the accordion in a chamber 
            music setting is not only the musical content gained by the performer, 
            but the fact that it also stimulates further special interest for 
            other musicians. The use of the accordion in chamber music, for the 
            most part, has remained obscure; its importance as an ensemble instrument 
            has sometimes been misunderstood and many musicians, whose contact 
            with this instrument has been limited, are unaware of its scope. To 
            introduce the accordion to musicians and scholars, thereby removing 
            the misconceptions about its quality and appeal, two things are necessary: 
            musical understanding and sensitivity to and about playing a part, 
            which while independent, should be amalgamated within the sound balance 
            of the whole ensemble.<br>
            <br>
            Obviously, there is no one formula of requirements to become a fine 
            chamber player, simply because music is such a personal experience 
            - a quality to be much esteemed in our mass production age - that 
            each player and listener draws a different benefit from it. For the 
            accordionist, a completely new and untapped medium of expression is 
            to be uncovered through the performance of chamber ensemble playing. 
            The challenge is even more exciting because this medium as not yet 
            been fully explored. </font></p>
