<h1>scaffo</h1>
<p><img src="texture01a.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="100"></p>
<p>a metal scaffolding pole is a v cool thing to turn into an instrument. i like the weight, and the way it resonates. </p>
<p>a normal double-bass, for example, vibrates very differently, because the
  strings are coupled to the body in a certain way (it's the bridge what does
  it) and also because the wood responds in a certain way to the vibration.</p>
<p>but i wanted to try stringing a string along the whole length of a steel pipe
  (without a bridge) so that the string would be very strongly coupled to the
  pipe's <em><strong>longitudinal mode of vibration</strong></em> - i.e. so that
  the steel would transmit the sound through the action of the string &quot;squashing&quot; and &quot;unsquashing&quot; the
  pipe. </p>
<p>i asked some workmen if i could have one of their spare scaffolding poles, and they let me have a very nice one, about four feet long. it was dirty, of course, so i washed the thing in bleach before i did anything else. i strung it, devised a way of picking up the sound, and that was that - a lovely bassy-and-buzzy instrument.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the sound sample
  is three layers of scaffo (no effects). the buzziness of the instrument comes
  from the low &quot;action&quot; (i.e. the string lies very close to the pole)
  and also to some extent to the loose bridge.</p>
<p>you'll notice from the picture that there <em>is</em> actually a bridge. i
  needed to have one in order to lift the string a little way away from the pole;
  i did start off looking for steel pipes with a &quot;lip&quot; at the end so that the
  string wouldn't be flat against the pole, but that seems to be hard to find.</p>
<p>i found a really good piece of metal to serve as the bridge. it's flat and
  has a hole in the middle, and if you listen carefully in the sound sample you
  might be able to hear its effect - as i play it wobbles, adding a bit of a
&quot;phaser&quot; effect to the sound.</p>

<h2>pickup</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="pickupbox01.jpg" alt="my pickup box" width="400" height="200"></p>
<p>as i said earlier, the resonance comes largely from the pipe's longitudinal vibration - so the pickup needed to be at one end of the pole, rather than attached to the middle. i solved this problem by putting a contact mic in a small steel box, and then literally standing the pole on the box. this gives really great coupling (i.e. it picks up plenty of the sound) and it's really quite a handy portable little thing.</p>
</div>
<h2>string</h2>
<p>i didn't find any suitable string (guitar/cello string not long enough, double
  bass string too expensive), so i tied together the three thick strings from
a set of steel acoustic guitar strings. (the fisherman's knot is the best way to tie strings end-to-end.) i looped this new long string through the pipe and attached the two ends together using a machine head (the kind used in electric guitars - see picture).</p>
<p align="center"><img src="machineheads01.jpg" alt="tuning machines" width="440" height="118"></p>
<p>i like the sound that is created by the wound steel guitar strings - bassy
  and buzzy.</p>
<p>some people have pointed out that if you don't want to tie three
    guitar strings together, you could try alternatives such as piano wire or
  'weed whacker' line. i tried a second attempt using piano wire, and it's not suitable at all... too stiff for the purpose, i'm afraid.</p>
