Usually a third option is adopted – do nothing. Not keeping your site upto date gives a very poor impression and really defeats the primary purpose of the web site: to provide the latest company information to the outside world.</DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>There is another problem with conventional web authoring software. For the non-specialist it is near impossible for multiple people to change the web site usually leading to one person being sent changes from multiple sources. This is another barrier to keeping the web site upto date.</DIV> <IMG src="/gfx/cmweditor.jpg" align=right><DIV class=Paragraph>To solve the problems of technical skill and multi-person authoring Sea Bass Software have produced a tool to allowthe management of content within a web site.

The author focuses on content, the site looks after the style of the content. By using&nbsp; Custom Style Sheets the site automatically applies the site look and feel to all content producing a professional look and feel.</DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>If you would like a content manageable site then we can take your existing site or company marketing material and define the look and feel of the site leaving you to add the content. Alternatively we can build the entire site leaving you to keep it up to date. Either way we’ll train you on how to maintain the site.
