: I have just made an upright acoustic bass guitar (basically a bass guitar/double bass hybrid). It has the normal 34" scale of a bass guitar but a bigger body (cornerless, spruce carved front and maple carved back and soundpost) angled neck and and cello endpin to enable upright pizzicato/arco playing. The idea is to solve the problem of double bass portability and allow easier transition from bass guitar to upright playing, as well as being an acoustic bass guitar with greater resonance due to its larger soundboard and box volume.<p>: Does this interest anyone, or from the vague description above does it sound like an unoriginal or ineffective idea.<p>: Other features are a scrolled headstock, adjustable truss rod (essential due to its bass guitar inspired 12th fret body join) and adjustable bridge.<br>: Any form of communication will be greatly appreciated.<p>Sounds very interesting, Toby - if you have a photo I'm sure we'd all love to see your creation.<p>You might want to check out Steve Azola's Deco Bass at the link below. It sounds similar, and I have played his bass at a NAMM show, though I don't recall if the bridge height/body shape would allow arco work.
