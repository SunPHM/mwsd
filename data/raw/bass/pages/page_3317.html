<h5><STRONG><EM>Life History </EM></STRONG><i>of Black Sea Bass and Fishing for 
them off Maryland’s Coast</i></h5>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black sea bass (Centropristis striatus) is a salt water 
fish that ranges in the Atlantic coastal waters, from northern Florida to Cape 
Cod. In Maryland, they are found in the inland bays and in the ocean out to 70 
fathoms (420 feet), depending on the season of the year. They appear on the 
inshore wrecks and reefs during the first or second week in May and withdraw 
back to the continental shelf in early November. Some of the population combines 
the offshore movement with a slight southerly migration to offshore Virginia and 
North Carolina, as they prefer temperatures higher than 46-47 degrees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When black sea bass are inshore, they prefer structure and 
are most plentiful on live bottom, around wrecks and the pilings of bridges and 
wharves. They are bottom feeders, and subsist primarily on crabs, shrimp, 
mollusks, small fish and squid. They are very aggressive feeders and will 
readily take a baited hook. As their name indicates, they are usually black when 
removed from the water but in the water they give the appearance of being barred 
with longitudinal stripes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black sea bass spawn from the middle of May to the end of 
June and are protogenous hermaphrodites. This means that they have the ability 
to change their sex. Most sea bass are females until they are 10 inches long and 
then they change to males. During the mating season the males develop a hump on 
their forehead and develop strikingly beautiful cobalt blue and teal marking on 
the edges of their fins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black sea bass in our area generally grow to a maximum 
weight of 5 pounds, but mature fish average about 1 ½ pounds. In Maryland, in 
2003, the minimum size is 12 inches. A 12 inch fish weighs about one pound, and 
is 3 years old.</p>
<h5>Management in Maryland</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because they are mostly caught in the United States Exclusive 
Economic Zone, (EEZ) more than 3 miles offshore, and they migrate between 
states, management of the species is done cooperatively by coastal regulation. 
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission working in concert with the Mid 
Atlantic Fisheries Management Council provide management guidelines that the 
coastal states put in to fishery regulations. The black 
sea bass fishery management plan was initially put together in 1996 because the 
stock was overfished and at a low level of abundance.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the plan, in 1999, the minimum size for 
recreational harvest of black sea bass was increased from 9 to 10 inches. As 
most of the females are less than 10 inches, the effect was to protect all the 
females and reproduction responded immediately. Adult stocks grew and 
reproduction has been very good since then. The Maryland Coastal Bays Finfish 
Investigation Project catches juvenile black sea bass in its trawl and seine 
surveys. As evidence of improved reproduction, young of the year black sea bass 
are being captured in increasing numbers in the samples. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the 2001 fishing season, the minimum size was 
increased from 10 inches to 11 inches and for the 2002 fishing season the 
minimum size was increased to 11.5 inches. In 2003, the minimum size was again 
increased to 12 inches, with a 25 fish creel limit and closed seasons from 
September 2 to 15 and the month of December. The size increases have been great 
for recreational fishing. Black sea bass have a very low natural mortality; as 
the minimum sizes have been increased, the fish have grown into the size limits. 
The results are that we have some of the best black sea bass fishing off the 
coast of Maryland that we have had in many years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While fisheries managers are relatively confident that the 
stocks of black sea bass are improving, the magnitude of that improvement is not 
precisely known. Most finfish surveys done along the Atlantic coast are trawl 
surveys, where a net is dragged along the bottom and the fish that are caught 
are counted and measured. Black sea bass inhabit rocks and structure that cannot 
be sampled by trawl surveys. The National Marine Fisheries Service started a 
coastal tagging study of the black sea bass population along the coast in the 
fall of last year. Maryland biologists and members of the Maryland Saltwater 
Sportfishermen’s Association went out on the Ocean Princess from Ocean City and 
tagged 1130 fish in one day to help with this survey. The fish were tagged with 
tags that promise a reward of a hat or $100, depending on the tag, to whomever 
catches the tagged fish and sends the tag to the NMFS for their reward. The 
objective is to be able to better estimate the number of fish and the total 
fishing mortality rate along the coast and manage the stock more precisely.</p>
<h5>Commercial and Recreational Fisheries</h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishing for black sea bass can be a very pleasant 
experience. There are several head boats operating out of Ocean City that take 
fishermen to the offshore wrecks for a reasonable fee ($30-$70 per trip). They 
supply bait (usually squid) and rent rods for another small fee. Some fishermen 
bring along small crabs and plastic worms put on the hook with the squid to 
attract larger fish. Generally anglers use a regular boat rod or a stout 
spinning rod. Black sea bass are very aggressive feeders and if you are in the 
right place they are most surely ready to bite. </P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a successful fishing trip, you will find that black 
sea bass are very good on the table. The meat is very white and has a unique 
taste. Pan cooking them with butter and lemon pepper is a good start. Black sea 
bass fishing is expected to be very good this year so you may want to get out 
and give it a try.</p>
