<p align="LEFT">Being an music teacher who uses Orff-Schulwerk principles and 
  activities quite a bit, I have always longed for some bass bars to fill out 
  the low end of our classroom ensembles. But I couldn't quite bring myself to 
  buy a set at $290 <i>per note.</i> </p>
<p>So when I attended the 1997 National Orff Conference in Seattle, I heard two 
  things that blew me away: Jon Madin's workshops, in which he used his own homemade 
  marimbas; and Walt Hampton's school group, the Rugare Marimba Ensemble, an amazing 
  group of 5th and 6th graders playing Hampton's own compositions, which are great. 
  But in both groups, there was this wonderful low end to the sound, coming from 
  a beautiful, clean-sounding, comparatively compact bass marimba! I had to have 
  one; I knew it right then and there. So I bought Jon Madin's book, <i><a href="../resources/books.html#jmmyom"><b>Make 
  Your Own Marimbas</b></a></i>, and the rest is history! </p>
<p align="LEFT">(This website will present an <i>overview</i> of Jon Madin's design, 
  as well as some of our modifications. Since it is his design, with only slight 
  modifications by us, I did not feel right about including specific measurements 
  and other things that might make his book obsolete. So if you want to construct 
  a marimba using this design, it will still be necessary to purchase his book.)</p>

    <td>I could never have anticipated the full impact that this instrument has 
      had in my classroom. Its cost, size and the space that it takes up are made 
      up for a thousand times by: the lovely, dark, deep sound that it makes; 
      the way the kids jump for joy when they get to play it; the way that parents 
      come up after performances and ask about it; the fact that newspapers want 
      to interview me about it; the times that my principal brings visiting administrators 
      down to my room to see it; I could go on and on! And all this for the mere 
      sum of around $350, plus a <i>lot</i> of time and labor. If I had tried 
      to buy a set of contrabass bars, I would have spent a minimum of $2000, 
      which is many times my yearly budget. </td>

  <tr> 
    <td>(A side note: another thing that could have been done would be to get 
      a grant for the funds to purchase contrabass bars - but I decided I would 
      rather build one and own it myself.) I've also been told by percussion supply 
      dealers that there are so few bass marimbas around (mainly at music schools), 
      that if I had tried to purchase a professionally built one, it might cost 
      as much as $40,000; And now we have one in our classroom!</td>

    <td>Now, I realize that my marimba is not professionally made, and a real 
      percussionist might turn up his/her nose at its lack of refinement, or at 
      the slight buzz or rattle here and there; but the kids are thrilled about 
      it. Now they have had an aural experience that they would not have had, 
      if I had waited years for an opportunity to buy one. They now have a real, 
      tangible example in front of them of the massiveness of a truly low instrument.

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="5">
  <tr> 
    <td>The instrument is physics in action, neatly integrating the science of 
      acoustics with the art of music. The sound waves vibrating from the low 
      C are so slow (about 65-70 hz/second) that you can <i>feel them with your 
      bare hand.</i> The kids think this is COOL! Sound waves are suddenly something 
      real to them, not just a mysterious phenomenon the teacher tells them about.

      <p>Another recent use was for our new mallet ensemble to accompany the first 
        graders in their concert, giving the older kids opportunities to work 
        with the younger kids (and vice-versa) and to develop their musical leadership 
        by taking an active role on the supporting end of a performance. It was 
        fun to see the older kids getting a kick out of the &quot;younger&quot; 
        songs that they were accompanying. The bass marimba made our mallet ensemble 
        possible. Even if we could have created an ensemble without it, the sound 
        would have been nowhere near as exciting. </p>

      end; but if you do, you will never regret it. Good luck!</td>
