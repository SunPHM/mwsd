            <p class="innerheaders">Where does this instrument come from?</p>
            <p class="body"> Well to be honest with you we&#8217;re not entirely 
              sure where exactly this instrument comes from and what date it was 
              actually made. We were told by one of our suppliers in Hungary that 
              it was a mid 20th century German instrument that he sourced in Russia 
              and which he himself stripped of its worn and battered varnish and 
              subsequently revarnished with this nice quality deep red varnish. 
              After removal of the table (in order to effect sound improvements) 
              we suspect that the instrument may not be quite as old (probably 
              made within the last 5-10years) as we were informed. </p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> So what do you know about the instrument? 
            </p>
            <p class="body"> Whatever the date of this instrument we know that 
              it represents great value to the player. If this instrument does 
              have 50 or so years of age it has survived &#8211; structurally 
              &#8211; incredibly well. If this is a much more recently made instrument 
              then it is quite astounding to think that a hand made instrument 
              of this quality can be made and sold on at this sort of price level.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> You said that you&#8217;ve done some internal 
              improvements to the instrument. What have you done?</p>
            <p class="body"> Even more incredible in terms of value is that we&#8217;ve 
              undertaken a whole host of improvements to the instrument that had 
              a total costing to us of &pound;1175-00. Internally we&#8217;ve 
              rethicknessed the front and fitted a new bass bar. Externally we&#8217;ve 
              fitted a new fingerboard, quality brass endpin unit and bridge with 
              aluminium adjusters. Of course we will be pleased to give you a 
              copy of the repair invoice with the instrument.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Should I buy this instrument? </p>
            <p class="body"> Yes, it really is a great choice to make for anybody 
              looking for an instrument that is made well, looks good and sounds 
              excellent and has a budget of up to 5K.</p>
