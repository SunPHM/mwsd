<b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><font size="+2">Fully Carved Double Bass </font><br><br>
<img src="http://www.doublebass.biz/k1.jpg" width=116 height=300 border=0 align="right" alt="" vspace="10" hspace="10"></b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">My <a href="basslink.html">Double Bass Links site</a> gets a lot of traffic, and with that traffic comes a lot of questions. One has always been, "where can I get a really good bass -- for not a whole lot of money?" Well, now I have an answer.<br><br>
I made a contact while at the NAMM show in 1999 with a representative for a company in Bulgaria that has been making stringed instruments since 1924. We discussed having them create a high quality, fully carved instrument at a more affordable price point. I asked that they carve me a 3/4 size double bass that I could audition, with the agreement that I would order more for distribution in the US <i>if</i> it met with my approval. Frankly, I didn't have high hopes, considering the price point, but was absolutely delighted when the bass arrived and I had a chance to examine and play it - it is the one pictured on the right. I only had a week to play it before somebody gobbled it up! Since then, as a result of my comments and criticisms, the latest instruments are better yet. I am the only dealer for these quality instruments.<!-- <br><br><font color="#FF8040"><b>8-22-05 Notice: Due to the steady demand I have made arrangements with the company to warehouse some additional basses in the US! I'll list the available instruments below as I can. Of course, basses can still be ordered in the usual way. -->

</b></font><br><br>
<img src="http://www.doublebass.biz/urbmeasure.jpg" width=129 height=339 border=0 align="left" alt="measurements are approximate and may vary slightly" vspace="10" hspace="10">The double bass has the traditional solid spruce top and solid maple sides and back; the fingerboard is ebony, the tailpiece hardwood. The photo on the left is of the second bass I received, with measurements superimposed for your information. Measures are approximate and subject to slight changes, of course. <br><br>
<br><br>

Yes, you see how attractive the instrument is, but the answer to the important question: <i>it sounds great, with all the resonance and life that you would expect from a fully carved bass.</i><br><br> I have arranged for the instruments come from the shop with D'Addario Helicore Orchestra strings, so immediate replacement of the usual crummy placeholder strings is not necessary! In spite of their "orchestra" label, they have good sustain, clarity, and warmth, and IMHO are a great all-around string for any style.<br><br>
In my experience, the basses are reasonably playable right out of the crate, usually only requiring a little work on the nut slots, unless you want very low action. The sound post will also need to be put into place; it is fitted, of course, just removed before shipping to prevent potential stress damage in transit.<br><br> You can potentially do these things yourself and I will provide guidance if requested. While playable, these are considered "factory" basses and are not set up, and I urge you to consider having yours optimized by a reputable luthier/repairperson for the best performance. Your environment may differ from the one in which the bass was constructed, and this can also affect the bass' action, of course. The cost of a setup will vary with the amount of work you feel needs to be done (as well as the credentials of the luthier you visit.) I have created a <a href="luthiers.html" target="_blank">Luthiers Directory</a> that you may wish to check out for options, though I'd also ask some local players or teachers to provide input on a particular luthier's talent and cost. Going to some luthiers for a setup can be similar to taking your car to a mechanic -- <i>you</i> need to judge exactly what you want done vs. what may be recommended, and choose the right shop for your budget and needs. <br><br>
I cannot do the setup work for you as my hand problems no longer allow me to work on basses here. Plus, the opportunity of a direct shipment saves you the dollars it would cost to have the bass shipped here, first.

    <td><font size="-1"><font face="'Times New Roman',serif" color="black">"I bought one of Bob's Bulgarian basses about a month ago.  I live nearby so I 
was able to see it and try it before purchasing it.  This instrument is a 
great value.  The workmanship is excellent and the sound just wonderful.  In 
fact, the more it is played the richer the tone seems.  Bob installed strings 
according to my specifications, a K and K transducer and setup the 
instrument.  He also offers very nice bag if one is needed.  Whether played 
acoustically or amplified, I am very pleased with my new instrument.  Bob was 
great to work with, which made for a very smooth transaction."<br> <i>Jules DiRocco, 12/00</i><br><br>
Hello. My name is Jose Garcia. I'm the Principal Double-bassist of the <a href="http://home.coqui.net/eolivier/ospr/roster.htm">Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra.</a> Recently I bought a five-string bass made in Bulgaria from Mr. Bob Gollihur. It's a great bass with full sound.The size is easy to play,very comfortable and rich in sound. This basses are good quality and promise to improved sound certainly by the years of use. They sound very strong even being so new. I strongly recommend Mr. Gollihur's offer. This basses are great. 7/01<br><i>And his second email of 8/18:</i><br>
Thanks again for such a nice bass. Is wonderful. We go together like "horse & carriage". The sound is improving each time I play and in the thumb-position sounds nice too. You can even play solo stuff, fast things without lacking of clarity. The low-B is like a thunder. Take care and thanks again, <i>Jose</i>.<br><br>
Bob, I just want to let you know, I am completely satisfied with this bass.  I have to admit I was anxious to play it at first, because I really was skeptical of getting a good bass for such a small amount of money.  When I first played it, I was floored with the response, and overall tone.  It doesn't just sound good in select places on the fingerboard, it sounds good everywhere, it's very even and balanced.  My friends and private teacher were also amazed at the quality of the bass. Thank you very much for an exceptional bass,<i> Patrick Landers 8/24/01</i><br><br>
JUST A SHORT NOTE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M QUITE BUSY GIGGING WITH MY NEW BULGARIAN BASS.  THOSE NEW CORELLI'S WORK WELL, NOT AS HARD ON MY HANDS ALSO. GREAT PIZZICATO.  THE K & K PICKUP WORKS WELL TOO. HAD MY BASS ALMOST A YEAR NOW AND THE SOUND KEEPS GETTING BETTER THE MORE I USE IT.  SEEMS LIKE THE HUMID HAWAIIAN WEATHER IS GOOD FOR THE BASS.  I NOTICE WHEN IT'S COLD, IT DOESN'T SOUND AS GOOD COMPARED TO WHEN IT'S WARMED UP. I LOVE IT AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT!<br>
                                                                 <i>THANKS, MILES Y****** 6-5-04</i>

</table><br><br>I am receiving all of the shop's output at this time; there are only two guys building them so the supply is limited and there is a waiting list. I am taking $200 good faith deposits (fully refundable before shipping) to reserve a future instrument. If you are interested in reserving an instrument or want to discuss any facet of the instruments or the deal, <a href="mailto:bob@gollihur.com">email me at bob@gollihur.com or call 609.624.1470 10am-7pm Eastern time.</a><br><br>
<br><br>
BTW, if you are looking at "solid wood basses" make sure the instruments are actually carved from solid wood, like this bass. It has come to my attention that "solid wood" instruments are being sold that are not carved-- instead, the wood is softened and molded into shape, like some "solid wood" archtop guitars have been in the past. Be sure you're getting what you think you're getting.

</ul>All three are gone as of 8-29-05, six days after posting them. I hope to have some more in stock soon, but I'd suggest pre-ordering a bass to be certain you'll get one. The queue is about 8-10 weeks for a bass right now.</font> -->
<br><br>

<br><br>To demonstrate my confidence that you will be delighted with your bass, I'll gladly offer a seven day approval period for shipped basses, during which you can return the instrument for a full refund less shipping.
<br><br>

As received from the shop in Bulgaria, your price for a four string bass is $2075* plus shipping, usually $175-250 to most US (lower 48) destinations. Since the instruments have been very consistent since the beginning of 2001, I began arranging for direct shipping of basses to their new owners; this saves a lot of dollars by avoiding having the bass first sent to me.<br><br>

Yes, they will make <b>Five String Basses</b>. The one pictured was picked up by its new owner on 10/25/00, and he is a very happy player! See also Mr. Garcia's recent unsolicited testimonial. These can be special ordered for only $2325 plus shipping! Your choice, low B or high C. They are roughly the size of the 3/4 basses, with a slightly wider upper bout and a wider neck and fingerboard.

*special order instruments require a higher deposit, contact me for details.
</ul>I will mail you a receipt and confirmation once the deposit is received. You may request a refund of the $200 deposit for a standard bass right up to the shipping date; special orders are binding, once the bass construction for a special instrument has begun, it is yours and the deposit is not refundable. However, this usually only applies to left-handed or 1/2, 4/4 size instruments.

<img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0">I have to say that if you are a relative newcomer to the Double Bass world, you would be hard pressed to find a more helpful and ethical guy that Mr. Golihur.<br><img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0"> 
My experience with getting hold of my Bulgarian 5-string was nothing short of a nightmare called "Attack of the Zombie Trucking Companies." I was shipped a bass (you gotta see the shipping crates for these things. They are like a coffin for the fat man at the circus. There is an interesting plot line for a "Sopranos" episode in there somewhere)and right above the sticker on the box that said "DO NOT USE FORKLIFT!" There was a fist-sized hole that went halfway through the crate and, of course, the front of the bass. After I uncrated the bass, cried a bit, and called the trucking company, I called Bob. He was all over it in no time. He took care of having the damaged instrument picked up, and handled getting me another one pretty quick, which I know is not easy with custom ordered instruments. This is the short version of my story to make a point.<br><img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0">
Even though there was no fault at his end, he took it as a personal issue to help me get hooked up with my instrument ASAP. He kicked some butt across the country to get me satisfied. After many years dealing with business folk, I never had such a quick reaction and solution to a situation. You could have your child do business in complete confidence with such a man. 
I just thought he deserved some public kudos.<br><img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0">

I just wanted to let you know I finally have my bass back from setup. It plays beautifully... Overall I'm very happy with my bass. I'll keep you updated as it matures.<br><img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0">
I appreciate all of your help and your very committed approach to your business. I will be speaking of you often.<br><img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0">Thank-you for everything. Larry R*** 2-4-05

Hey Bob,<img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0">
   Got the bass last week and took it to a local luthier for setup. He was impressed with the workmanship and said it was a very nice instrument. I love the sound and have been plunking away at it every spare moment. My new bride and I want to thank you for all your help in making this a reality for us and look forward to doing more business with you in the future.

<a href="http://www.urbbob.com/engelhardt.html"><img src="http://www.doublebass.biz/engelhardts.gif" width="200" height="222" border="0" align="right" alt=""></a>I can have Engelhardt basses (and cellos) shipped directly to you at good prices. <a href="mailto:bob@gollihur.com">Contact me at bob@gollihur.com</a> or 609.624.1470 to determine price and availability. Check out my <a href="http://www.urbbob.com/engelhardt.html">Engelhardt bass page</a> to view the array of models they offer. All are laminated and based on the Kay line -- Engelhardt bought Kay's double bass and cello production facilities in the late 60's. Their quality has made significant gains in the last few years and they are making very solid good-sounding basses these days, far better than the many cheapie imported laminated instruments that seem to self-destruct rather readily and regularly.
