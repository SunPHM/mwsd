<img src="http://www.urbbob.com/dbt.jpg" width=132 height=179 border=0 align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Double Big Twin was my first K&amp;K "love," and remains my personal favorite for string-oriented jazz play*, especially for the price, although the new <a href="bmaster.html">Bass Master Pro</a> is a stiff competitor and is definitely also worth considering. As you can see, there is an individual transducer for each string, so you can really fine tune response. However, position changes do not make a huge difference, so don't expect to make up for a weak or more powerful string by positioning the transducers. Installation was easy (more about that later) using a thin adhesive film, and the discs are about 3/4", with a slight lift where the wire attaches. They are pretty thick -- I don't think you could bend them out of shape without a lot of effort. The individual wires are heavy, not thin or brittle, leading to a neatly shrink-wrapped cable. The output jack is on a clip that mounts on any pair of strings above the tailpiece.<br><font size="-2">*let me just define <i>which</i> jazz: in this case I am talking the more modern style of jazz that emphasizes string sounds and clarity, <i>not</i> New Orleans or old-timey jazz-- for that bigger and thicker style bass, but still with plenty of definition, I'd suggest the <a href="bassmax.html">Bass Max.</a> Better yet, choose the <a href="bmaster.html">Bass Master Pro</a> for the widest palette of sounds from which to choose!</font><br><br>

<font size="+1">So how does it sound??</font><br><br>
<!-- <A HREF="mailto:bob@gollihur.com"><IMG SRC="http://www.eclecticbass.com/contactanim.gif" width="155" height="84" border="0" align="right" alt="Questions?? Click to Email Me!"></A> -->The first thing that strikes my ears with the Double Big Twin is its <i>clarity</i> and <i>definition,</i> but yet with body to it, not that typical thin piezo sound, and it's much <i>warmer-sounding</i> than others I've heard. This unit captures the nuances of the bass, so you hear the sound of the instrument, not the pickup --- and the sustain was wonderful! Not the fat, kinda blurry sound I was used to, but the more accurate sound of the string, its interaction with the fingerboard, capturing sustain, vibrato, and... oops! better watch the intonation with this baby! Perhaps it's the proximity of the pickup to the string, and so the signal/noise ratio, but more likely the quality of the piezo element itself -- these K&amp;K folks have been at it for almost fifteen years, and I guess they know how to build special purpose transducers. Even after I was sold on this pickup, and moved it to my other bass, I was truly surprised at just how well the distinctly different personalities of the Juzek carved bass and Kay plywood came through using the same pickup. The K&amp;K Double Big Twin sounds like <i><u>your</u></i> bass, not just any bass.<br><br>

<font size="+1">What about arco?</font><br><br>

I almost didn't buy this pickup because their literature didn't recommend it for bowing, but instead suggested the <a href="bassmax.html">Bass Max</a>. Surprising, because I think the arco response is just wonderful and balances well with pizz, but results are probably dependent on the bass and bridge. A potential reason to consider the Bass Max, instead, is that if you get a pronounced scratchy style of arco tone due to your strings (like those Thomastik Spirocores, so wonderful for pizz but so lousy to bow), this pickup will accurately reproduce it. What you play is what you get.<br><br>

<font size="+1">Installation</font><br><br>

<a href="http://www.kksound.com/pdf/doublebigtwin_manual.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="prod_manual.gif" width="47" height="57" alt="" border="0" align="left" vspace="7" hspace="7"></a><img src="http://www.urbbob.com/dbtalone.gif" width=275 height=146 border=0 align="right">The unit comes with what could hardly be called double-faced tape -- it's more like a loosely organized layer of adhesive. The ultra-thin layer of adhesive holds the transducer head, and if you don't like where it is at this point, you can move it. If the adhesive gets funky, roll up the sticky debris with your finger and start anew. However, it has great holding power, eventually becoming semi-permanent. Want some more details about installation and positioning? I include a copy of my Personal Notes with every pickup and preamp purchase, that includes my experiences and advice. It can give you further insight on installation and more.<br><br>

</div><br><br>

<img src="http://www.doublebass.biz/instockanim.gif" width="158" height="91" border="0" align="right" alt="">If you prefer a slightly thicker and more balanced sound, with more mids, but still with all the definition you need, the <a href="bassmax.html">Bass Max</a> may be a better choice, although its character is similar in some ways -- see its page for further information and photos. And the <a href="bmaster.html">Bass Master Pro</a> offers sort of a combination approach, so you can have your cake and eat it, too. In the interest of full disclosure, I originally kept a <a href="bassmax.html">Bass Max</a> on my Kay (sees mostly country, folk, and bluegrass use) and the carved Juzek bass used to have a Double Big Twin on it. Since I found I preferred a wider range of sounds on the Juzek, I first installed a <a href="bmaster.html">Bass Master Pro</a> and love the extra flexibility it offered. As of 2004 (times and gigs change!) I'm gigging with the <a href="bassmic.html">Golden Trinity/Bass Max system</a> on my Juzek, as I am mostly playing at lower to moderate volume levels.<br><br>
<b>Do you want <s>fries</s>, I mean, a preamp with that??</b> I <i>STRONGLY</i> recommend you use an appropriate preamp with the Double Big Twin for the best results, or you may not be a happy camper. Read details on my <a href="http://www.urbbob.com/preamptalk.html">Do You Need a Preamp?</a> page - your amp may already be compatible or you may already have a box that can do the job. This is important, no marketing BS, some pickups, like the Double Big Twin, <u>must</u> have the proper input impedance (1 megohm or higher) to sound as intended. <br><br>K&amp;K recently came out with the Pure Preamp, which has a three band EQ as opposed to the 2 band EQ on the Power Pack (and Model 97) -- I'd suggest the 3 band unit for use with the Double Big Twin. Of course, if you don't need the EQ flexibility at your fingertips, it doesn't matter that much. I offer a Double Big Twin/preamp combo below.

The <b>mounting kit</b> includes a quality 12" cable with right angle connectors, a piece of vibration-isolating foam, a hook &amp; loop strap, and illustrated instructions for quickly (and NON-PERMANENTLY) mounting the Pure Preamp to the rear surface of your tailpiece, putting the controls right where you can reach them - and making for a very clean, inconspicuous installation.<br><br>

I've had custom cables built for speciality as well as routine use. Note the one foot cables on the right top section; they are designed for use by bassists who want to place their preamp on their tailpiece.<a href="cables.html">Click here to visit the page with cable details and pricing,</a> and <a href="preamp-mounting.html">click here to visit the page with photographs showing how you can mount your preamp on your bass' tailpiece.</a> </div>

Dear Bob,<img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0"><br>
I have been searching for the perfect double bass pick up that I think best conveys the subtle nuiances, and power as well as arco in my performances. Thanks to your knowledge and website I have found my  sonic answer with the Big Double Twin. The musicians in my band have complemented the clarity, crispness,and tone that now achieve! I can not begin to tell you how aurally happy I am now because the Big Double Twin! I now achieve the power, presence, and sonic clarity that eluded me for so long.<img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0"><br>
Kudos to you and the Big Double Twin!!<img src="spacer.gif" width="1" height="4" border="0"><br>
