I was </font><font color="#FF0000" size="3">born in 1983, in the rainy town of
Columbus, Ohio, I grew up singing. I was inspired by the powerful vocals of
Carol King, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, and of course my mother. In my sophmore year
of high school, my family and I moved to Plano, Tx. On my first day, in my first
period class, I met one of my best friends Lauren Scott. Lauren introduced me to
a small church that was just starting to grow. This church was great! I could
come as myself, and they were using electric guitars and durms to praise God. It
was there that I met my fiance, John Lewellen. I became greatly moved by the
power of God in Christian rock bands. My brother, Austin Scott (the previous
drummer whom we all Love and miss), and I decided to start a band of our own.
Later on John joined us, and Follow the Leader was born. My other great
enjoyment in life is drawing for comic books.</font></span></font></p>

the nineteen hundred and eighty third year of our Lord I was born. It was 100
years before that, that I enrolled in music theory. then I believed in jesus
when my brother showed me the light. after that I met the second most important
love of my life, Lyndsey, when she started attending my church. Lyndsey, eric,
and austin(the previous drummer whom we all Love and miss) all started a band,
and I, not knowing how to play anything other than a trumpet, bought a bass and
joined them. I now like playing the bass and everything is good.</font></span></font></p>

since I was a lil’ kid I wanted to play the guitar. When my parents Finally
bought me one I spent every day of ...the rest of my life… playing it. Right
now, I spend a lot of time working hard with the band and trying to get to know
God more closely. I enjoy playing computer games such as Counter-Strike and
Starcraft. Lately, all my close friends outside of the band have been moving
away. At first I was feeling lonely and depressed, but then God made me see new
things in my life that I had never seen before. I’ve had&nbsp; more time&nbsp;
to work with the band, and most importantly, I’ve had more time for my quiet
time with God. I’ve finally found&nbsp; where I think God wants me to be. I’m
finally doing what something inside me has always told me I should do. I love
the ministry that I believe God has called me to.</font></span></font></p>

was born in Garland, Texas on April 7th 1988, and raised in a Christian home. I
accepted Christ when I was 7 years old and have never looked back. I started
playing the drums when I was 11 . I've never taken lessons, I am completely self
taught. I first started playing with my dad and my brother. Since then, I have
played with several worship teams, and have been in one other band besides FTL.
I had just started going to Crossroads when&nbsp; I heard that FTL was looking
for a drummer so I thought I'd give them a try. They accepted my offer, so here
I am, and here we go. . .</font></span></p>
