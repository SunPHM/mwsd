Vince  

Plays bass and guitar has been a local musician for over three decades, 
writing and playing with ex-members of "Spang-A-Lang", "Santana", 
"Tower of Power" and "Journey".  Vince was greatly influenced by the 
sounds of Motown and then found himself expanding his talents by 
listening to the music of "Weather Report" and the bass styles of 
Jaco Pastorius.  Not only is Vince a great bass player, he has also 
mastered guitar licks to equal the talents of Stevie Ray Vaughn and 
Carlos Santana.  Vince also keeps busy playing with "Bueno" and 
"Grooveline."
