<P>I was born October 1965 in Bristol Connecticut but moved back to Allentown 
  with my parents before my first birthday and have lived there ever since. I 
  spent a couple of years in State Clowntown &#151; I mean State College during 
  my first run at a college degree but I don't really count that as living.</P>
<P>I like to do outdoor activities, hiking, biking, Frisbee golf, music shows, 
  that sort of thing. I like any kind of music which of course doesn't include 
  rap or country because they are music. I played bass in a band for a while and 
  I like to jam every now and again, here's an old photo from the days we were 
  just learning how to really play.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="bass.png" ALIGN="left" WIDTH="339" HEIGHT="493" ALT="View of bass player from drum kit">I 
  really miss that jam room we had, it had lots of character. </P>
<P>I'm a big ice hockey and Philadelphia Flyer fan, and I follow the Eagles and 
  Phillies when there's no hockey on. I played for a while too but it got expensive 
  and I was going to school too which cut into available time.</P>
<P>I've been working in the IT world since 1995 but when I got laid off for the 
  second time on 7 December 2001 (how poetic) I went back to school to finally 
  finish a B.S. degree from Penn State. Working in IT has some perks, I got to 
  go to NYC for computer shows and see many <A HREF="computer-show-nyc.png">wonderful 
  things</A>.</P>
<P>I have other stuff available on my web site at <A HREF="http://www.cygnusx-1.com/index.html">www.cygnusx-1.com</A>, 
  but most of it is unfinished and not very interesting. The Tix section has some 
  promise but I'm just getting started on that.</P><BR CLEAR="all">
