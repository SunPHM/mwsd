<h4>You have the bridge, Number One</h4>

<p>Captain Jack has been sent on an away mission to the industrial regions of north central Pennsylvania.  It is a routine mission to search for unlawful escape of hazardous organisms from their containment vessels.  Until then, I will be entering the semi-daily ship's logs.</p>

<p>The temperate rain forest has apparently moved north to this locale.  It has rained intermittently since Friday.  This afternoon, after I got the lake temperature, I bailed about 70 liters of water from my boat. (I count everything. Right, Jack?) </p>

<p>There are 4 cabins rented this week and two of the groups reported today that the bass fishing is superb.  The "smallies" are biting on everything.  The Jachymeks are trolling gold/black and silver/black rapalas and they tell me they are catching one after another.  They have caught a couple on surface lures and that got me excited to go fishing tonight, but just as I was getting ready to leave the house the rain started again. I hope that tomorrow night brings better weather so that I can attempt to catch my first jitterbug bass of the year.</p>

<p>The lake temperature today was 72 and the outside temp stayed around 70 all day.</p>

<h4>Compliance Manditory!</h4>

<p>Hot and steaming in Northern Ontario</p>

<p>I was getting my boat into shape during the rainstorm today. I thought that there would be very little to be done to get it lakeworthy &#8211; just some cleanup of sun damaged varnish on the gunwales. But noooo! &#8211; On closer inspection I noticed that the original bow shear rail was rotted under the fiberglass on the bottom of the boat! Jeeez oh man! That is the way it is when you have a 1930&#8217;s vintage Peterborough cedarstrip boat. It rides like a Rolls Royce and handles like a Ferrari but it also demands attention!</p>

<p>After I gently removed the old shear rail and fasteners from the boat (you have to treat an old lady with care and respect) I dipped into my hidden pile of red oak boards. They were originally hidden to prevent Gordo from using the beautiful clear straight grained oak on inappropriate projects &#8211; like cabin screendoor doorjambs! That&#8217;s what happened to my last piece of wormy chestnut that I got from my sister in &#8216;06. Gordo is gone and I would give all my lumber to have him back but that is another story. But I still keep my lumber hidden, mostly in memory of Gordo since Sled would never use lumber inappropriately. So I dug out a nice inch thick board and ripped off an inch wide piece. I took the rail piece to the boat and tested the flex &#8211; none and more none! It&#8217;s OAK for god&#8217;s sake! Wishful thinking on my part! So began my first foray into STEAM BENDING. I thought, &#8220;If the boat builder could do it than the Jack certainly could too&#8221;. (Apologies to Dr. Suess and The Grinch) So I got some pieces of my still, an old length of cast iron sewerline, an old gas hot plate, a cylinder of propane (out of date) and a pressure cooker and Rube Goldberged myself a steaming trunk. As with most things I build, I was going for results not style points.</p>

<p><img alt="We Got STEAM Heat!" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/steam trunk.jpg" width="400" height="267" border="1" /></p>

<p><br />
After a short assembly period and just a little swearing, the steam bending began. About an hour later and a lot of preliminary test bends the piece was &#8220;cooked&#8221; and put into place. It&#8217;s nice when things work on the first try!</p>

<p><img alt="shear excellence" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/100_0210_WEB.jpg" width="400" height="267" border="1" /></p>

<p><br />
Today started out hot &#8211; low 90&#8217;s and humid, with lake temperature of 76F. A beautiful day no matter what Janet says. I fly fished off the docks for about a half-hour and caught 4 bass &#8211; two of them around 12 inches.  The other two were small and made quick flights when I set the hook! Around 3:00 a front of thunder showers came through giving us some much needed rain and cooling the temp down to about 80, albeit a very humid 80. Still nice!</p>

<h4>With Friends like these</h4>

<p>Another beautiful day in Northern Ontario.  Well, that&#8217;s what Jack thinks.  It was over 90 degrees and humid today.  But, there are no guests in camp and the living is easy.   Plenty of friendly flies, though.</p>

<p><img alt="stupid flies aren't your friends" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/100_0204_WEB.jpg" width="400" height="267" border="1" /></p>

<p>The water temperature was 76 today.  We have no fishing report.  The weather network is predicting rain for the next four days, so I guess the monsoon season is moving north.  We need the rain.  I cut grass today and there were many places where the grass is burned and the usually muddy area in front of cabin 2 is very dry and cracked.  <br />

<p>The stupid flies have returned.  The black flies have almost completely disappeared.  Isn&#8217;t it ironic, don&#8217;t you think?  If you recall, last year I complained about these charming visitors.  In fact they are really known as <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/treecare/forest_health/ftc/friendlyfly.html">friendly flies </a>and are native to Minnesota.  They parasitize tent caterpillar and are therefore considered beneficial&#8230;.UNLESS, you are painting a cabin or hanging out laundry or sitting on the beach drinking a beer or &#8230;.  Enough bitching already!</p>

<p>We went fishing on Friday and caught many medium bass and one pike seen here.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="jannie caught a pike" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/0620pike_WEB.jpg" width="400" height="338" border="1" /></p>

<p>Jack has been fly fishing off the dock the past couple days.  Yesterday he caught three nice size bass, but today &#8211; nothing.  There is a hatch occurring now and the fish are hitting the All-You-Can-Eat buffet.</p>

<p>We both went swimming this afternoon.  The lake temperature around 6 PM was 78 F.  Wow.<br />

<h4>EEEEK!</h4>

<p>Northern Sector Weekly Report:<br />
From: Wing Commander Fleetermouse <br />
To: Praetor Pippistrelle</p>

<p>As you may recall our base of operations is the attic vent of Sportsmen&#8217;s Camp cavern. It is spacious, temperature regulated, free of possible predators, high for great take off, and perfect for landing.  One disconcerting thing about our base is that every spring we get a daytime &#8220;visitor&#8221;.  The lights go on in the attic, we hear approving low-pitched tones and our bellies are rubbed! This is a yearly indignity that the wing complains about bitterly. This has been happening like clockwork since my great great great grandfather&#8217;s tenure as wing commander! Yesterday I finally took action to determine the source of this yearly disturbance! Big Brown was sent to roost in the netted portal of the lower cavern. As dawn broke there was no sightings or activity. Nothing happened until about mid day. The entire screen portal was summarily opened and slammed &#8211; alarming Big Brown no end. Big Brown was then enveloped in a giant soft fabric and deposited into a dark cell! After some investigation, a small crack was located and Big Brown made his escape! He sat on the top of the cell until he was attacked by a furry behemoth &#8211; identifying herself as &#8220;Princess Dweezil&#8221;. After flying for his life and pinging the area he found no escape! Once again he was enveloped in the soft fabric and returned to the cell. This time there was no escape! Night fell and he miraculously escaped to later report his findings.</p>

<p>Sir our numbers are burgeoning. My wing now numbers above a dozen with more members on the way. The weather has been optimal &#8211; sunny warm days keeping our sleeping quarters comfortably hot and the nights cool for good fast hunting. Every night we take flight to a veritable smorgasbord of mosquitoes, evening blackflies, massive moths, and bland yet crunchy jejune bugs, it couldn&#8217;t be better! </p>

<p>It is my recommendation, based on Big Brown&#8217;s reconn and our optimal location, that we &#8220;let sleeping woolly bears lay&#8221; and investigate no further!<br />
</p>

<h4>I thought this was the express!</h4>

<p>When is the next freight train to Moose Factory?</p>

<p>I went to the far end of the lake today to take out the beaver dam(n). It was a beautiful day with everyone fishing and Janet had things she wanted to get done, so off I went to do the deed. It was like a scene from On Golden Pond &#8211; sunny with the wind in my face as I zoomed across the blue waves. I took the digital camera with me to record the carnage and provide evidence for the High Beaver Council&#8217;s class action lawsuit against Sportsmen&#8217;s Camp. Hey they promised to deliver a dozen stripped and debarked poplars to my beach as payment. What they don&#8217;t realize is that their court is not binding on Americans! But I digress &#8211; as I was easing the boat into the channel at the end of the lake &#8211; avoiding the sleeping boulder next to the sentinel rocks I noticed an eagle take flight a mere 50 yards from my position. What a sight &#8211; if only I could have gotten the camera out the case and ziploc bag! </p>

<p>I took pictures of the approach to the dam and the lilypads growing there. When I go to rip out the dam the lilypads are on the surface &#8211; when I leave the current flattens them out! I beached the boat on the West Side of the narrows and walked over to the dam. I took several shots of the dam for the before and after treatment, stashed the camera on the rock above the dam and waded into the task.</p>

<p>About halfway into ripping the dam asunder I was disturbed by a tremendous ruckus from down stream. It sounded like a water going freight train! I stood up from my task and saw two moose moving with all due speed toward my position! A very large cow and a full sized young bull hadn&#8217;t a clue to my presence &#8211; I was down wind from them. I didn&#8217;t particularly want to get run over by the Moosonee Express so I climbed out of the stream and grabbed the camera. I extricated the camera from its case and bag and looked up to see the &#8220;Express&#8221; still under full steam! How was I to get the shot?  I shouted, &#8220;When&#8217;s the next train?&#8221; The giant steel wheels bit the rails EEEEEEEEEE! I then got them before they took a siding into the bush.</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="WHO PULLED THE STOP CORD?" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/mooses.jpg" width="400" height="267" border="1" /></p>

<p><br />
The show&#8217;s over move along &#8211; I then went back to ripping out the beaver dam. During the next 10 minutes I was privileged to eaves drop on the nearby Moose conversation. They made noises I&#8217;ve never heard from a moose before! High pitched moaning grunts &#8211; snuffles &#8211; wheezes and more high moans. I believe the translation was &#8220;What the hell was that funny looking beaver shouting at us for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The weather as stated above was beautiful &#8211; mid 70&#8217;s slight breeze and clear. The lake temperature was 68F today! The hatch of the dragonflies is about halfway complete. The black flies are becoming far less intrusive! The Watson and Dahl crews told me that the fishing was good. </p>

<h4>Where th'hell did these laurel leaves come from?</h4>

<p>All Hail Caesar!</p>

<p>The Watson Crew is here. The crew is sans Jeff (my adopted nephew) and Chris Murphy (national Canadian weather celebrity) and they will be missed. The Watson crew means that there is entirely too much drinking and fun to be had when they are here! But I have work to get done! Is there no end to this torture? I was working on cabin number 11 when they arrived &#8211; with cold beer. Being the camp owner I am duty bound to greet in coming guests, so I went over to greet them and was presented with a cold beer. Janet even arrived on her new lawn tractor (it&#8217;s a sweet ride) to greet them. No more work done there! The beer later turned into a Caesar and in the fullness of time walking became a task.</p>

<p>For the unwashed masses of the American populace Caesar was the emperor of Imperial Rome &#8211; but No -here in Canada it is the much-improved version of a bloody mary! Indeed it is much improved and the Watson crew have it perfected! It&#8217;s spicy, yet not overpowering with delightful alcoholic overtone and the glass is even rimmed with secret blend of spices. Yum! And that is the problem &#8211; one leads to another and another leads to the floor &#8211; they are large drinks. </p>

<p>I have been requested by my sister to post some more pictures of the new (to us) cabins. So I will take some pictures of the cabins insitu and post them tomorrow (that is assuming I don&#8217;t HAIL CAESAR!).</p>

<p>The weather here is beautiful. Seventies, sunny, slight breeze (just enough to keep the black flies at bay), in short, the only way it could be better is if the lake temp was 78F and I were swimming. But the lake temperature was 65 yesterday. The fish were biting extremely well last night. But they haven&#8217;t started hitting the surface yet. That doesn&#8217;t usually happen till the lake temp gets closer to 70F. I will have to tear out the Beaver Dam(n) this week since they have rebuilt it to Hoover proportions and my docks get lower in the water with every rainstorm.  Chris of the Watson Crew has volunteered to join in the expedition, as he did last year. Gee I wonder if Caesar would like to come too ---- well gotta go rip out a dam &#8211; HAIL CAESAR! &#8211; seeya!<br />

<h4>Sorry, No picture today!</h4>

<p>That&#8217;s the way anhuh anhuh &#8230;.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Italian backwater of New Castle. Actually in an outlying township of that backwater. When I was a teen and some trend came to New Castle it was a good bet that the fad was groady in California, anathema in New York, passé in Pittsburgh. But hey it was OK for me. Being a stubborn, practical and insulated teen had its advantages. And besides mommy picked out my clothes. Hey Guys it took less work! Quit laughing! I mean it you bastards! &#8211; Hey cut it out! &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m warning you, I&#8217;ll stop this Blog!&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;. OK - The rule of thumb is - as something came into fashion in New Castle it was probably about a year out of fashion everywhere else. This drove my sister crazy in her teen years and amused me no end! But some things never change &#8211; platform shoes, wide lapels, gold chains and gold jewelry seem to have that eternal allure to the Italian populace! So it is quite normal for me to be the eternal bottom feeder of the pop culture wave! But Ho! </p>

<p>Enter the Blog &#8211; we&#8217;ve been blogging for a while now (courtesy of the sainted Ying! Did you hear of his beatification on Wednesday? Or was it something else to do with beating off.. Huum, I better have another beer) and I assumed that if I were doing it, it must be passé. But blogging was mentioned in the NY Times Sunday edition a couple weeks back and figured prominently in the Toronto Star yesterday. This seems to indicate that blogging is now nearly passé or at least in the approaches to that state. It also indicates that I was blogging during the tail end of the period of time when it was &#8220;cool&#8221;. Go On! Shuuut Up! I am still dubious of this conclusion! Nonsequitur! Norman coordinate!</p>

<p>The weather today is sunny and beautiful! Its about 70F now and promises to warm even more. The rain we&#8217;ve received in the last few days has raised the lake level about an inch. I may have to rip out the beaver dam(n)! The fishing was excellent at dusk yesterday and was really good in Lett Lake the previous day.<br />

<p>Urgent Communiqué to Blackfly High Command</p>

<p>Commander Bloodsucking Devil Reporting to High Commander Bloodbloated Gallinipper:<br />
Sir, our time of supreme ascendancy in this quadrant is at an end. Recent reconnaissance photos have detected the emerging hordes of our dreaded enemy &#8211; The Dragon Fly Collective. Although I have not witnessed it, genetic memory indicates that, a bloodbath of horrendous proportions is in the offing! I have transmitted the reconn photos for your perusal sir. These giant voracious monsters are emerging from Firth Lake in massive numbers. They are HUGE! Memory hasn&#8217;t prepared me for the fearsome sight of these eating machines! They are agile fliers, equipped with a superior sensor array and large masticating jaws. Oh the carnage!</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="the end is near" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/dflypic.jpg" width="400" height="267" border="1" /></p>

<p><br />
This may be my last communiqué as I may be killed in the next few days. Migration is out of the question so we are indeed doomed. It is only hoped that we will have enough eggs deposited in the local streams to perpetuate our numbers for the future.</p>

<p>You are indeed lucky oh Lord of the Tundra to have many more weeks of ascendancy.  But alas our time in the air is coming to its bloody end.</p>

<h4>Summer's Nigh</h4>

<p><img alt="lilacs.jpg" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/lilacs.jpg" width="400" height="267" border="1" /></p>

<p>Summertime and the livin&#8217; is eeeasy &#8230;</p>

<p>Summer is nearly upon us here at camp. The lilacs have just bloomed, my wild roses are setting a thousand buds, Janet has bent the lawn mower blade twice, the humming birds are emptying the feeders as fast as I can fill them, the &#8220;sneaky little bastard mosquitoes&#8221; are here in droves and the birches are almost in full leaf.  The docks are set so Rudy and Kirby enjoy the daily ritual of walking down to the dock and getting the lake temperature. For them it is more like &#8211; walk out on the dock watch Dad drip water on his feet &#8211; get a treat &#8211; chase squirrels and ground hogs &#8211; look for food on the ground &#8211; piss everywhere, its our camp ya&#8217;know &#8211; sneak away from Dad &#8211; go back to Dad for another treat &#8211; walk back to house &#8211; wait for another treat from Dad after entering the house. I have finally completed (I believe) all the tasks necessary to opening the camp. Now I can begin work on the new cabins.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of walking around the cabins when I am traipsing to and from the shop for tools etc. There are many problems of setup that need be solved prior to jacking up the cabins. Some things have to wait until the cabins are leveled and some things can be completed more easily before. The attachment of screened in porches is a small dilemma due to the rooflines of the cabin and attached bathroom. Adequate headroom on the porch is needed yet the roof structure must be simple, not interfere with the existing roof and have proper slope. I believe I have it solved in an elegant fashion but I will have to discuss it with Sled. There is also the problem of wood stove placement. Janet suggests that we put the refrigerators out on the porch (an old Sportsmen&#8217;s Camp tradition) and free up the room in the cabin. Good idea &#8211; it also facilitates stealing beers in the middle of the night without waking the guests.</p>

<p>The Jackson&#8217;s are in camp. That&#8217;s a good thing, since they are a great group of guys and its usually quiet in camp while they are out fishing the river and outlying lakes. It is reported that Mark Jackson will achieve his two score years on Tuesday. We will have a bonfire, in his honor, weather permitting. Mark also tells me that there is a great deal of solar activity predicted for this week so we may get some great auroras. All we need is some clear nights.</p>

<p>It is in the 70&#8217;sF with heavy overcast and a slight southerly. It will rain today. The lake temperature is 65F today.</p>

<h4>First Firth Fish Foto</h4>

<p><img alt="Jannie's first bass 2003" src="http://www.doublefeature.com/campblog/graphics/0606bass_WEB.jpg" width="400" height="266" border="1" /></p>

<p>We finally were able to go fishing for an hour tonight.  We caught about ten bass in less than an hour and we will be having our first fish fry of the year tomorrow night.  This fish, however, is still in Firth - too big to keep for eating. It was about 14 inches long.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, for those of you that don't remember what being in the sun feels like, we provide this picture.  Also, squinting is a common reaction to the sun in your eyes.  But, before you get too jealous, it did rain for an hour yesterday and the black flies are still bad, even though I did take off my hood for the picture.</p>

<p>The water temperature at noon was 67.  It was in the low 70's today and sunny.<br />

<h4>Show Time!</h4>

<p>Hell we elect a new Pope every morning!</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends, I&#8217;m so glad you could attend, step inside, step inside!&#8221; So goes the theme song of the longest running comedy/tragi-drama not on FOX network. You see, we&#8217;re old, and the twenty something crowd doesn't go fishing, generally, so FOX turned down the pilot show. They didn&#8217;t like our other suggestions for a show and turned them down, too - Dawson&#8217;s Lake (too sluggish and stagnant),  Dawson&#8217;s Brook (sounds like his boy friend), Dawson&#8217;s Estuary (&#8216;scuz me sir but what the Hell is an estuary?), Dawson&#8217;s Stream (don&#8217;t like the golden-shower connotations), Dawson&#8217;s Firth (sounds like he has a lisp and he&#8217;ll lose his virginity), Hell, they didn&#8217;t even like -  Dawson&#8217;s strangely attractive yet angst ridden indecisive and verbally erudite teen friends. They didn&#8217;t send the pilot tape back though. I wonder what ever happened to that?</p>

<p>Anyway the show opens with the theme song and an aerial pan shot of the lake with the end of the shot being the camp sign as people leave. Jack and Jan are waving goodbye and smiling mightily. The face of the departing guests can&#8217;t quite be seen. A small sign under the main sign states that &#8220;it&#8217;s the friendliest place on earth &#8211; May through June&#8221;. This is an obvious reference to the biting insects &#8211; but, gee, the Americans don&#8217;t realize that and it&#8217;s a moot point as most them aren&#8217;t literate anyway (just like their currently appointed president). But they soon begin to know it&#8217;s not a reference to Jack. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s a week of warm days and cool mornings and the Pope is elected each morning until Janet say&#8217;s &#8220;Jesus christ, you build a god damn fire, and get it hot, then you leave &#8211; why don&#8217;t you just leave!&#8221;  This week&#8217;s epiZooody is entitled &#8220;The Newest Nonhindu Nondeity Termed the Destroyer&#8221;. We cut to Jack in the shop attempting to &#8220;Frankenstein&#8221; old outboard motor lower unit parts into a newer motor. It&#8217;s strange because he is swearing profusely. The swearing isn&#8217;t the strange part, it's just that there isn&#8217;t anyone there to be sworn at! His usual modus operendi. A man walks into the shop, Jack looks up and laughs ruefully. The man says &#8220;"Jack, he&#8217;s worried sick about this &#8211; he was just cruising along oblivious when he struck the rock"&#8221; (ripping two, count&#8217;em two, blades off the prop bending the propshaft and chipping a gear). Jack replies, &#8220; "I think OBLIVIOUS IS THE FUCKING KEY WORD. I think it&#8217;s about time he procures a motor to use on his own. Do you know how many propellers I&#8217;ve bought in 19 years of owning the camp? &#8211; Three! Do you know how many are a result of your brother?&#8221; &#8220;Two&#8221; he replied. &#8220;COINCIDENCE??? I think NOT!&#8221;" Replies Jack.</p>

<p>We now cut to a commercial for the Prop repair shop in Hailybury Ontario &#8211; servicing the needs of clueless Americans in the North.</p>

<p>Well my tea is empty and I want to get some work done so this exercise is preempted by productive work.  It doesn&#8217;t happen very often but when it does its as inexorable as Sled getting to that last bottle of Labatt&#8217;s 50 so git outta da way!</p>

<p>The weather is beautiful &#8211; some northwesterly breeze, upper 60&#8217;s low 70&#8217;sF. Water temperature is 64 degrees &#8211; taken from the standard location, 2 feet down at the end of the east dock at noon right before Rudy and Kirby get Temperature treats. The black flies are bad, mosquitoes too! I&#8217;ve killed more than 10 whilst airing out this diatribe. The pines are in full pollen bloom and I can&#8217;t touch my eyes for the next 2.5 weeks. The lake is yellow with it. Peace!<br />
