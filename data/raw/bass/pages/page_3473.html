<p>Of the 20,000 known species of fish in the world, only 120 species live in
the Southern Ocean. Chilean Sea Bass, also known as the Patagonian toothfish, is
one of the unusual fish species that has adapted to the freezing conditions of
these Antarctic waters. Toothfish can live as long as 50 years, reaching
reproductive maturity at 10 years old or later. Unfortunately, they are often
caught too young to have had a chance to reproduce.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This rapidly disappearing species is often referred to as &quot;white
gold&quot; within the fishing industry, and has consequently been overfished to
the point of commercial extinction, particularly by &quot;pirate&quot;
fisheries. Many fishing companies that have collapsed fisheries in their own
national waters, operate under Flags of Convenience (FOCs) in the Southern
Ocean. Because vessels operating under FOCs are unregulated, it is impossible to
control the amount of their catch. Often, the vessels don't even bother coming
to shore when they've filled their quota. Instead, reefer ships with proper
refrigeration are hired to transport the fish to illegal harbors, while the
fishing vessels continue their relentless hunt for the remarkable toothfish. It
is estimated that in some areas, 90% of commercially sold toothfish are pirated
from the sea.
<p>The situation for some &quot;by-catch&quot; species is equally desperate. All
10 species of Southern Ocean albatross are also routinely hooked and drowned by
pirate fishers, an estimated 330,000 seabirds in just five years. The Amsterdam
albatross is the worst affected. Just five to eight breeding pairs are left on
the French territory of Amsterdam Island. The World Conservation Union (IUCN)
2000 Red List of Threatened Species included 16 albatross species threatened as
a result of longline fisheries.
<p>These pirates must be stopped.
