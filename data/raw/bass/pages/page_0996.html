Lead Guitar and Vocals we have Bob Heft. This is very easy to say, Bob Heft is one of the finest lead guitar players, not 
only in the L.A. area but anywhere. He has endorsements with many of the best known equipment manufacturers simply because 
he is so damn good. Bob does about 200 gigs a year with Team Honky Tonk, and all the guitar players want to talk to him. 
What a monster...</STRONG></P>

weapon. On drums Milo Tedesco. We found Milo in the Recycler. Unbelievable. He never played country music before in his life.
He had heard of Hank Williams, but had no idea who Garth, Clint or Waylon were. Milo’s background was in punk, alternative, 
and Latin music. After playing with THT for five years, he has become one of the most sought after country players in 
Los Angeles.</STRONG></P>
