<font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><font size="+1"><b>Mounting your Preamplifier on your Upright Bass</b></font> 
<br><br>
A number of players, especially the very active Rockabilly bassists, have elected to mount their preamplifier on their bass (K&amp;K Power Pack, Pure Preamp, Dual Channel Pro/Pro ST, Bass Master Pro/Rockabilly, Golden Trinity Bass systems). This can be appropriate for a number of players for a lot of different reasons. As a result, I've documented the setup I did for a friend, and I've also had special cables built for your convenience, since I have not been able to find a commercially available one foot stereo cable with angled TRS connectors.<br><br>

<img src="newflash.gif" width="26" height="20" alt="" border="0"> <b>Mounting Kit Now Available!</b><br>I've published this page for several years in order to assist players to acheive a low-profile pickup installation, but some customers have told me that they had a bit of trouble sourcing the appropriate materials. To make things even easier, I've recently assembled a new "kit" to aid you in this process. The kit includes:
<ul>
	<li>A high-quality 12" cable (mono or stereo available)</li>
	<li>A dark-colored, dual-surface hook-and-loop strap</li>
	<li>A piece of charcoal-colored, vibration-deadening foam</li>
	<li>Complete, illustrated instructions</li>
</ul>

This kit is available <a href="#kit">at the bottom of the page</a>, in both mono and stereo versions, if you're interested. It contains one of the same high-quality 12" cables I've carried for several years. The full mounting kit is only $1 more than the cost of the cables alone, which I still carry separately if you'd rather source the other materials yourself. Regardless of whether you purchase the kit, the cable, or nothing at all, the instructions will continue to remain published here for your convenience.

Some players prefer to mount their preamps <i>behind</i> their bass' tailpiece, so it can remain on the bass and still fit in the case (Power Pack, Pure Preamp, Dual Channel Pro/Pro ST, Bass Master Pro/Rockabilly, Golden Trinity Bass systems). I've written out the following instructions, with photographs, as a suggestion for an easy method for mounting a preamp. If this is something you'd like to do, this information may give you your own ideas for placing your preamp in a more convenient location. Please understand why I used the bright colors for these photos -- I would recommend the use of dark gray or black foam and a black or other color Velcro strip to make the installation less obvious. I used these colors to make the components more visible in the photographs.<br><br>
You will find the special cables I had built available for sale at the bottom of the page, as well as on individual product pages.<br><br>

    <td><font face="Arial" size="-1">The key to mounting the preamp is the belt clip. The first thing I did was to remove the black screw at the center of the bracket. I rotated it 90 degrees, as shown in the photo below. This way, the preamp knobs will face out from the side of the tailpiece, which I think makes them easier to use. If you don't rotate the clip, the knobs will face up and be mostly behind the tailpiece, and the cable connections and knobs won't be as obvious from the front of your bass. It's a personal choice.</font></td>

The other materials used are shown: a piece of foam about the same size as the preamp, and a seven inch Velcro strip. I favor these strips (commonly available) as they have the two different Velcro types on back and front, and can be threaded through the slot for extra security.</font></td>

Of course, you may wish to route the cable so it is less obvious, as well as make sure it doesn't cause a vibration against the tailpiece.
