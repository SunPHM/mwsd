With the sports show season finally out of the way and nearly a week of 
spring-like weather conditions, I was chomping at the bit to get out on the 
water for the first time in more than a month. It was Friday, February 21, 
the forecast was calling for temperatures near the 70 degree mark and I was 
on my way to the California Delta.
<P>
Compounding my excitement was the fact that I had a red hot fishing report 
from former Fish Sniffer staffer Albert Berends a day earlier. He spent the 
afternoon fishing with local Delta Rat Mike Saso from Elk Grove. They didn't 
get on the water until well after noon and still managed to catch a total of 
14 fish with several quality bass in the 3 to 3-1/2 pound class and a 
monstrous 12-1/4 pounder landed by Saso.
<P>
"These fish are on the verge of moving up to spawn, but the water 
temperature is still too cold," explained Berends. "The key to catching fish 
right now is working over deep water, maybe six to ten feet deep, just 
outside the protected flats that are ideal for spawning."

<TABLE WIDTH="590">
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="590" COLSPAN="2">
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica" SIZE="-1">
<P>
That was the pattern Berends and Saso worked to perfection on Thursday 
afternoon. "We were pitching 6 inch Yamamoto Senkos in a variety of colors 
including watermelon red, junebug and chartreuse," he added. "We also caught 
fish on Luhr Jensen Speed Traps in the crawdad pattern, chartreuse and white 
spinnerbaits and a 6 inch #39 Magic Worm fished on a drop-shot rig. The 12 
pounder fell for a #208 Senko."
<P>
According to Berends, the fishing has been hit and miss out on the Delta, 
but when you hit it right, you can load the boat with quality fish. "It's 
basically feast or famine out there," he explained. "There are little 
pockets of active fish throughout the Delta and when we run into one of 
those pockets, we're catching fish on nearly every cast. Of course it 
doesn't last long, but it's possible to put a big limit in the boat in a 
hurry. That's why we're seeing a few teams with huge limits in most of the 
tournaments and other teams are struggling for a few bites a day."
<P>
As far as choosing an area to fish, the middle Delta has been very 
consistent for Berends. "Water temperatures are still in the low to mid 
50's, so you want to look for protected areas that might be a degree or two 
warmer that other areas," he said. "On Thursday, we did most of our damage 
in Middle River, Lathom and Connection Sloughs."
<P>
So there we were loaded with the latest information; We knew right where we 
needed to go and exactly what baits to use. The weather couldn't have been 
better with little to no wind and warm sunshine beating on our faces. I was 
joined by Paul Cunningham of Sacramento and to say we were pumped would be 
an understatement. So how did we do? Well, after 10 hours on the water, we 
had a grand total of 5 bites and managed to land 3 small fish up to 2 
pounds.
<P>
How is this possible? It appeared that everything was in our favor. Good 
tides, great weather and all the latest information. The one thing we 
couldn't change was the fact that it was still February and no matter how 
great the weather is, you just never know if the fish are going to bite from 
one day to the next. Albert was also out on the water fishing the same 
general area and he and two other anglers found it equally tough with a 
total of 5 fish. Albert did manage one quality largemouth that weighed 4.7 
pounds, but the rest were small fish in the 1-1/2 to 2 pound class.
<P>
Areas that had produced numerous quality fish just a day earlier were 
suddenly dead. Even Berends was amazed at the drastic change in the bite 
with seemingly identical conditions found on both days. I know this is 
typical of bass fishing in winter, but it's still frustrating when these 
fish don't do what they're supposed to.
<P>
Fishing this time of year is a gamble regardless of the weather, but the 
chance of catching one of those monster Delta limits or possibly the fish of 
a lifetime will always keep us coming back for more.
