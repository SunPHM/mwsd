    the gamest fish that swims.&quot;<img src="Graphics/©DNR_smallmouthBass.gif" alt="©DNR_smallmouthBass.gif (22882 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="113"> Enthusiastic comments like this
    entered in the journals of the 19th and early 20th century paid tribute to this scrappy,
    well-proportioned fish. Because of these qualities and their relatively small numbers,
    Lake Michigan smallmouth bass are reserved exclusively for sport fishing. </tt></font><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><tt>During spring and summer, they
    concentrate in shallow bays and on reefs in upper Green Bay and off the Door County
    peninsula. Essentially a nonmigrating fish, they retreat to pools, undercut banks, or
    fairly deep water to avoid bright daylight. They are most active in early morning and
    evening. During winter, they gather near the bottom and feed little until spring and water
    temperatures rise to about 47 degrees F.&nbsp;</tt></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><tt>Smallmouths spawn 
      when water temperatures rise in the spring. Males build several nests before 
      choosing the final location, and</tt></font><img border="0" src="Graphics/OhioDNR_smallmouth.jpg" align="right" width="369" height="249" alt="Smallmouth Bass"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><tt> 
      construction of the nest can take anywhere from 4 to 48 hours. When a</tt></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><tt> 
      female appears, the male will drive her into the nest. The female will usually 
      stay a little bit longer in the nest each time, and the dark</tt></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><tt> 
      mottlings on her back become prominent and the background pales when she 
      is ready to spawn. Approximately 2,000 to 10,000 eggs are deposited into 
      the nest during spawning. Males stay to protect the eggs and fry, but many 
      nests fail. Floods destroy the nests, sudden temperature shifts cause fungal 
      infections, and other fish prey on the eggs or fry.&nbsp;</tt></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><tt>Young smallmouth
    bass feed throughout the day on small crustaceans and graduate to insects
    and small fish by the time they are 1.5 inches long. Adult smallmouths eat
    fish, crayfish, and insects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></font></p>

    smallmouth bass superior to all Great Lakes fish except the whitefish. The low fat content
    of its flesh makes it easy to <a href="preserve.html" target="_top">freeze</a> for later
    consumption. If the lake's waters remain clean, these plucky game fish will undoubtedly
    continue to be a favorite attraction in some areas of the upper Great Lakes. </tt></font></p>
