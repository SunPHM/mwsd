  </h3>
  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have probably spent more time fishing for bluefin
  than any other pelagic. Bluefin are very exciting to catch and also frustating at times.
  Trolling cedar plugs fast in the early part of the season is the most action filled
  fishing I know of. I know things are not as they should be with the bluefin population and
  hope we can save this noble fish. In years that we have done well, we have been signalled
  early on by the abundance of sand eels. A sure sign of a good bluefin year is when we
  catch bluefish, bonita, etc. in early June which contain lot's of sand eels. When this
  happens, I know that I can go to several hills inside the 20 fathom line and spot clouds
  or balls of sand eels with my fishfinder. These marks almost always precede a knockdown or
  even multiple hookups......but let me back up here before I get ahead of myself.</font></b>
  </p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In mid- June, I tend to leave the dock around 4:30am and
  run towards 20 fathoms as quick as I can. Often I have an experienced crew and we get the
  lines in pretty quick. I normally pull a bird, several vinyl squid and a green machine
  daisy chain on the center line way-way-way back. The other lines are all triple cedar
  plugs; sets of black, blue and white, red and white, and also natural. I like to drag a
  total of 5 lines in rough, crowded or hotbite conditions. If things are less hectic, we
  drag 7 lines. We have caught more fish on black or blue and white plugs on the long rigger
  lines than any other combination. At times the natural plugs work well right up close on
  the flatlines. Also a &quot;zuchinni&quot; tuna clone is hot at times real close to the
  prop. We seem to do better fast. I used to catch bluefin best at 8.6 to 9.5 knots on
  Humility. Daybreak does best around 8 knots but by my own admission does not raise bluefin
  like my old boat. I know of boats that can troll at 10 knots without planing and they
  outfish a lot of slower boats. My crew and myself have done our best when we have gotten
  the jump on the crowd of boats and found bait and tuna on a hill. Hookups can be one after
  another for a couple hours or more. By 9 am the bite is often over and usually lot's of
  boats are around. This is a good time to put on a #3 1/2 drone spoon and #2 planer in
  place of a flatline and exchange the plugs for ballyhoo/seawitch rigs. Ballyhoo was very
  effective in 1996 for bluefin and saved the season for us in 1999. Red and white was the
  hot color in 1996 and pink was prefered in early 1999.</font></b> </p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By early July, one of two things
  normally occurs. Either the fish begin to shift their preference from plugs to lures like
  the green machine run way back and ballyhoo or they quit biting altogether and must be
  chunked. I remember, by the way when chunking was something completely new to Chincoteague
  and only practiced by a few boats. The local boats and wachapreagers were pretty
  skeptical. Back then it was done at what we called &quot;the second set of pots'' which
  used to sit just inside the 20 fathom line. They have been moved some thru the years.
  Through the early and mid-nineties the chunking spots varied and the sport was a bit more
  exciting to me as the fish might be chunked at any number of pots, several rough bottom
  areas, wrecks like the ammo wreck and of course what was later to become known as the
  &quot;Parking Lot&quot;.&nbsp; In 1999, the Parking Lot finally fell to second in
  popularity with the Lumpy Bottom the new hotspot. This area, too has been renamed as years
  ago it was known as the&nbsp; seamount.</font></b> </p>

  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">About 1992 a bluefish cut me to the bone
  and it took weeks to heal. A few years later one bit a small section off the end of my
  thumb. My opinion is that the first order of business when bringing in a big ocean
  bluefish is to kill the damn thing with a club. Then it is perfectly safe to keep, release
  or whatever. They are just plain mean and dangerous. In June I usually troll at 4 to 5
  knots for them. I look for them to be 20 miles out or more although it can be less. I like
  a big spoon on a planer, stretch 25&#146;s, stretch 30&#146;s and cedar plugs. I target
  them in early June for the table as well as for mako bait. Later when we fish for tuna the
  damn things eat every lure that they can catch. I try to go real fast to discourage them
  then.</font></b> </p>

  <font face="Arial">Bonita </font></span> </h3>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A while back, an older man told me there
  are 2 kinds of bonita.&quot; The small ones come by, then the big ones&quot;. I don't know
  or care which one is which, but he is right; there are 2 kinds. They look similar except
  for size, the smaller being 3-4 lbs. and the larger kind 4-8 lbs. The smaller bonita are
  usually there on my first trip attempted, maybe June 10 and last a week or so. I have
  caught most of them at the 28' lump, trolling a planer/ spoon, drail/spoon or small
  bird/feather setups.Water is from 66 to 72. They will sometimes show up around september
  for a day or 2. The larger come by right with the first bluefin, maybe june 15, and are
  gone by July 4. I get most on cedar plugs or a zuker/bird rig. They definitely orient to
  bass pot flags or weeds. As a matter of fact, we have gotten a bluefin or two under a bass
  pot flag in this time frame. The bonita are mostly from the 28' lump out to about 20 miles
  off; few beyond 20 miles. I like them for mako bait. Both fish are tuna colored with black
  stripes parallel to the body and big, sharp teeth like a king mackeral. Kings, by the way,
  sometimes hang right in with the big bonita. This can be a problem as kings will bite off
  the second and third plug. This can be minimized by spacing the third plug twice as far
  apart as the first two. Bluefish sometimes are around at the same time as the</font></b> <b><font

  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I haven't fished for these in a few
  years but I hope to see a return of these fish in greater numbers. I am fortunate to say
  that I have been mackerel fishing and experienced the heavy bite that you hear so much
  about. I will mention a few tips here which I learned from the headboat elders. These fish
  are best fished for on a headboat due to the weather . I have done best from the last week
  in March to mid April. You can plan on very big seas and expect the majority of the people
  on the boat to be deathly ill or drunk at best. In spite of all the flying food, the
  fishing can be very exciting! I start with a special rig with very small tubes, shad darts
  or small hooks&nbsp; with tinsel or bucktail tied on.&nbsp; Four or more hooks are good
  and I like torpedo sinkers from 5 to 8 oz. These smaller jigs seem to work best on herring
  and small mackerel which will ignore the larger mackerel tubes. If the boat hits a good
  bite on large mackerel, I will have a larger tube rig all ready, maybe set up on a rod. I
  like to fish about 1/3 the way up the boat, near a door. A good spot on the boat is
  achieved by arriving early and planting your rod in your chosen area. I have had my best
  luck on the O.C. Princess with her fast engines and dedicated captains. I have been
  rewarded by fishing very hard for the captain during the first hours of fishing. An angler
  that consistantly catches fish and is courteous will be well attended by the mates. This
  is because the lead anglers will serve as motivators to the less experienced and seasick
  among the passengers. On a good day, the fishing enthusiasm will spread thru the boat and
  everyone will have a super day and a cooler laden with fish. I try and tip the mates
  properly for their work. Boston mackerel trips have been a great beginning to the fishing
  season for me many years.</font></b> </p>

  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We fish for dolphin a number of ways. The simplest and
  most common is to troll around sea bass pots or lobster pots. Weedlines and floating
  lumber or other objects are excellent places to look. I have seen dolphin orient to
  objects as small as a coffee cup. If I am targeting dolphin around objects, I like to
  troll ballyhoo at about 5 knots around the area. I use a number of different rigs. If I
  work a weedline, I prefer to use a small vinyl &quot;octopus&quot; skirt and a device
  called a hoonose on the leader. The hook gets hidden inside the fish with no point
  exposed. This rig allows me to troll slowly down the weedline without getting the lines
  fouled. The drag is left very loose so the fish can eat the ballyhoo.</font></b> </p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We may also pull up to structure and
  throw out bait to dolphin. We keep one fish hooked up at the boat until the next angler
  has one on. We rotate so that there is always one fish hooked and swimming near the boat.
  This keeps the school at the boat. I like just a few casting lures for dolphin. A 2 or 3
  oz. Single hook Hopkins lure is very effective. Also a surface popper works for me. Other
  than that , I prefer bait. The best bait, by the way, is a strip of skipjack tuna, false
  albacore or bonita belly.</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  you will ever encounter. They are a real challenge on #30 line and tend to come in packs.
  You can expect to hookup on multiple lines for hours at a time under the right
  circumstances. I prefer to fish for them with small feathers trolled at 7 or 8 knots. I
  have caught them from bouy N2 on out to the 30 fathom lumps. Expect a few in June and then
  more in August. They may stay till Halloween. If I want to catch them specifically I look
  from 10 to 20 miles out. They are one of the best for beginners to target. I normally ask
  my crew to take a &quot;fat albert&quot; day once each year and enjoy this superb fighter.</font></b>

  composure like the marlin do. I hope to do better in the future. The guys that catch blue
  marlin claim that a black Haiwaiin Eye and horse ballyhoo is the preferred bait.</font></b>

  </h3>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have spent lot's and lot's of time
  fishing for sea bass. With a few exceptions, I prefer to fish for them in May and early
  June and maybe again in the fall. In the spring I prefer wrecks in depths from 50 to 80
  feet. For the big fish, I don't fool around. I use a single hook rig with a whole squid
  for bait or a large bucktail jig with a strip of squid which is actually 1/2 of a large
  squid mantle. This method catches less total fish but with a much higher average weight. I
  don't hesitate to use a stiff rig and 6 to 8 oz. of lead, depending on the depth, current
  and drifting of the boat. I prefer to use spectra type braided line in water over 50 feet.
  This line is absolutely mandatory when we fish deeper wrecks. We sometimes fish wrecks
  over 200 feet deep! These areas can hold some monster sea bass. Also ling or red hake can
  be caught in deeper areas, even along the drops of the canyon edges.</font></b> </p>

  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Skipjack tuna can at times be very
  exciting. I have seen times when 15 pounders were around and would slam a spoon or feather
  trolled around a wreck, bass pot flag or pod of bait. These larger fish were inside the 20
  fathom line! More often, we have caught smaller fish in areas ranging from 15 miles off
  the beach out to 30 fathoms. I usually don't complain when they appear as they make
  excellent shark bait, strip baits and good table fare when they are large enough. Baits
  cut from the belly seem to often be the hot bait to have for bailing dolphin, triggerfish,
  jacks and seabass.</font></b> </p>

  </span> </h3>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This subject is hard to write about as
  there are so many variations to shark fishing around Chincoteague. I have caught smooth
  and horny dogfish, blue sharks, sandtigers, sharpnose, tigers, hammerheads, bulls, sandbar
  sharks, makos, blacktips and even some real odd looking ones! We fish for sharks primarily
  in June. Blue sharks arrive first and can be very plentiful when the water is cooler than
  about 62 degrees. The first makos are right behind with most in 62 degree or warmer
  weather although our largest one yet was in 59 degree water, out in 30 fathoms. The very
  tip of the little 20 fathom finger is a popular and productive spot this time of year but
  30 fathoms can also be good at times. Later in the season, shark fishing is sporadic at
  best. Daybreak's mid-season success has been only at night, usually after midnight. Our
  results have varied from blacktips to large makos at night. This fishing is pretty tricky
  and can be disasterous due to weather and other variables. In spite of the nature of
  nightime sharkfishing, it remains popular with myself and some of my crew. See

  </h3>
  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Spanish mackeral are lots of fun and sometimes show up
  off Chincoteague. In July or August, look for spanish to appear almost anywhere outside
  Chincoteague Inlet. You can expect to see fish jumping out of the water anywhere from the
  inlet to 15 or miles miles out, most often during the first hour of daylight. Jumping fish
  may be ready to bite or have lockjaw. Also the best fishing can be when no fish are
  jumping. The only way to know is to try! I usually like to head southeast towards bouy N2
  which is about 5 miles southeast of Chincoteague Inlet. Just inshore of this boy is the
  real Turner's Lump where the bottom rises abruptly to 14 feet or so. This break from 14 to
  30 feet is my favorite spot to look for spanish.</font></b> </p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have found that the spanish mackerel are a bit
  finicky in regards to the tackle and techniques used. I prefer to troll #00, #0 or #1
  clark spoons for spanish. I use light rigs, like bay rods with #15 to #30 line. The rod
  gets a small sampo ball bearing snap swivel. After the swivel I attach either a #1 drone
  planer or a small inline sinker from 2 to 8 oz. Attached to the sinker or planer is a 25
  to 30 foot leader of #30 line with a small ball bearing swivel at it's mid-point. The
  spoon is tied on the leader with an improved clinch knot. I may use a planer rig as one
  flat line and a heavy sinker rig on the other flat line. The outriggers get the lighter
  weight rigs. I let the rigger lines out 100 feet or more and the flat lines from 20 to 40
  feet from the sinker to the stern or about 50 feet from the planer to the stern.</font></b>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now comes the critical part&#133;the
  boat speed. I don't seem to do well at all unless I go fast, like 7 knots. At times 200
  rpm's difference in speed (.5 knots more or less) is critical when trolling for these
  fish. The other trick I have learned is to fish for spanish early in the day. I define
  early as the soonest possible time after dawn. A crew that is willing to get an early
  start can have an excellent catch in a short time. I have seen spanish mackeral in a
  frenzy off Chincoteague several times. This is most often very early and sometimes every
  line will be hit as soon as it hits the water. Later in the day the fish get very shy and
  hard to catch. Normally the first big Hurricane will send the spanish south in a hurry.</font></b>

  </span> </h3>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although we fished heavily for togs for
  several years we do very little any more. There are three main reasons for this. First, I
  don't have the correct boat for the job, second the fishery has become more difficult due
  to the decline of the fish and the sharp increase in the boat traffic in pursuit of tautog
  and the third reason I have gotten so that I don't have the motivation to fish in real
  cold weather in a small boat. I have had by best success fishing for tautogs in March
  through April. This is the only time I have caught truely nice togs of 10 pounds and more.
  This fishing was strickly over wrecks in water from 50 to 75 feet. This &quot;first&quot;
  part of the tog season actually begins when the sea bass move off, maybe in December and
  runs until they return which is early May or so. From May until September, I have found
  togs sporadically on (actually IN) wrecks which are mostly closer to the beach in dirty
  water of 20 to 45 feet. These areas seem to frequented less by the eager sea bass. I
  prefer fresh hard crabs for bait although clams are fine if the bass aren't too thick. I
  have had my best success by positioning the boat VERY precisely. Anglers new to tog
  fishing are often suprised to find that actually moving the boat 10 feet can be the
  difference between a great catch and an unproductive trip. This is very hard to instill in
  the crew unless they witness it first hand. My rule of thumb is to figure on one hour from
  the time of arrival upon a wreck site until lines go down to catch. Any time under an hour
  for boat positioning is considered excellent. Cold weather trips occaisionally yield a
  very special bonus...Codfish! Codfish is, in my opinion the best fish to eat on God's
  green earth. Summer togs are sometimes accompanied by triggerfish, amberjack and sharks.</font></b>

  </h3>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Triggerfish are a little
  unpredictable. Some years they are thick as fleas and others we don't catch any. We may
  see them first in early summer around floating debri or basspot flags. They are often
  finicky this time of year and accompanied by equally finicky dolphinfish. Locating a
  bucket floating will solve this problem as the fish will swim in and you just pick up the
  bucket and dump the fish in the cooler! By mid season they are likely to be around most
  wrecks, flags etc. and more voracious eaters. A small treble hook and a slice of skipjack
  or dolphinfish belly will be attacked by groups of greedy triggers. They are great
  fighters and delicious. By late summer they can be caught bottom fishing around wrecks
  from the beach out to 20 miles or so. Clean them by cutting their armor with a boxcutter.
  Start by the vent which is the only spot soft enough to cut from the outside. Once a cut
  is started, the blade will easily slice from inside out. The meat is white, firm and
  excellent table fare.</font></b> </p>

  around Blackfish Banks. My best luck has been in 35 to 50 feet. I prefer the best squid
  available and a long mono leader....a wire leader spooks them. If I don't get a bite after
  30 seconds, I wind my rig up and drop it again. If I still don't get a bite, I change the
  strip of bait....I think the fish smell a fresh piece. At last resort, I move the boat a
  bit. See also the Chesapeake Page for sections on fishing for trout.</font></b> </p>

  </span>
  </h3>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yellowfin fishing can start as early as
  late May depending on water temperature. Late June is more typical. They are most likely
  to show up first along the edge of Norfolk, Washington or Poor Man's canyon. I like to
  fish for them right on the drop from 300 to 600 feet. Most early season bites that I have
  experienced have been from 7 or 8 am till about 10 am. Arriving later is typically a waste
  this time of year. I like to leave the dock about 4:30 for this early season fishing. I
  prefer to fish ballyhoo/sea witch or ballyhoo/feather jig combinations at about 6 knots in
  early season and seldom make too many changes later on in the season. One very important
  note that I want to stress on yellowfin fishing is the use of a long center line rig. I
  prefer to run a large boone bird with several vinyl squid trailing, followed by a green
  machine, back as far as possible on the center line. This can be 300 or more feet back
  depending on the boat, reel, weather, traffic,&nbsp; and the wishes of the crew. This rig
  can be absolutely deadly at times and has accounted for more yellowfin on Humility and
  Daybreak than all other rigs combined. By July yellowfin can be chunked as well as trolled
  and may be anywhere from inside the 20 fathom line out to 1000 fathoms. Often they will
  appear in 30 fathoms in mid summer. I look for bait which I feel is the key to sucess in
  catching yellowfin. I also push to be on the fish early as I mentioned before. Finding mid
  season yellowfin working on bait can be very rewarding as the fish will sometimes setup a
  summer pattern and be consistant for several weeks. As the season progresses, the fish may
  also respond to repeated chunking and become regular feeders at a site such as the 30
  fathom line or the lumpy bottom. Other years, the fish constantly appear and vanish
  without any regularity. This can wear on the nerves of the captain and crew. The challenge
  of trolling for yellowfin, the thrill of the early morning blitz and the unique fight of
  these fish is very rewarding to me in spite of the times that I go home frustrated and
  empty handed.</font></b> </p>
