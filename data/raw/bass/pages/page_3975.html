<br /> <div align="center"><font size="+2"><b> Reminiscence from Olomouc  </b></font></div>  <br />  On the occasion of such a round birthday of Dick Sillitto it is good time to remember some               earlier events in the life. &nbsp;     <br /><br />   We have met for the first time at the Carberry Tower in July 1969 at               the first summer school on <i>Quantum Optics</i> (just Americans started to the Moon, now I am               writing after Colombia was destroyed) organized by Dick Sillitto and Prof P. Farago.  &nbsp;That               was the Tenth Scottish Universities Summer School in Physics.  &nbsp;My career in quantum optics               in that time was rather short and I was happy to receive an invitation from the Directors of the               School to give a seminar.  &nbsp;Moreover, in that time it was quite difficult for us to go abroad even               to participate in a scientific meeting.  &nbsp;I was successful in arranging all formalities and I could               go from the Warsaw Pact to a NATO Summer School. &nbsp;First to London from Prague by               airplane and from London to Edinburgh by fast train, together with my colleague R. Horak,               who was also able to participate in the School. That was an excellent experience for me.</td>

Bloembergen, R.J. Glauber, H. Haken, A. Kastler, W.H. Louisell, E.R. Pike, G.W. Series, G.               Toraldo di Francia, L. Mandel, A.L. Schawlow, D.F. Walls, R. Graham, F. Haake and many               others).  &nbsp;I am proud of my contribution being included in the book of the School under the title               <i>Quantum Optics</i>, edited by S.M. Kay and A. Maitland (Academic Press, London 1970).  &nbsp;This               was really great help of Dick at the beginning of my career in quantum optics.  &nbsp;        </div></td>

		<td>&nbsp;It was hardly two years after restoration of the plurality democracy in our country when my               wife Vlasta Perinova and Antonin Lukš were successful in participating in the <i>European               Quantum Electronics Conference</i> and <i>Tenth National Quantum Electronics Conference</i>,               which were held at the Heriot-Watt University at Riccarton near Edinburgh in 1991. &nbsp;Vivid               impressions of lectures, talks, and discussions influenced both her and him to devote most               effort to the study of the phase observable and the quantum phase distribution. &nbsp;This stimulated               them to start the writing of the book <i>Phase in Optics</i>, which was published by V. Perinova in               coauthorship with A. Lukš and J. Perina in <i>World Scientific Publishing House</i> in 1998. &nbsp;<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="peri/dvlastaluks.jpg"><img src="peri/dvlastaluks.jpg" border="1" width="290" height="190" lowsrc="peri/dvlastaluks2tn.jpg" alt="Dick, Vlasta and Antonin outside the Sillittos' flat in Dunbar, 1991" title="Dick, Vlasta and Antonin outside the Sillittos' flat in Dunbar, 1991"/></a></div><br />The               Sillittos answered the interest of V. Perinova and A. Lukš during the conference as an               invitation to tea. &nbsp;Since it was a long way to get to Dunbar where the hosts lived, the guests               were offered a trip through a pleasant countryside of Scotland in the sun of the late summer.               &nbsp;They were shown the flat in the former merchant port. &nbsp;The guests remember nice time spent               with Winifred and Dick Sillittos and their hospitality over beautiful photographs.
