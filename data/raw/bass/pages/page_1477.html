<h1>Music</h1>

I've been a huge music fan all my life, with a varied set of
interests, mainly focused around different varieties of folk, blues,
and pop/rock music.  I come from a very musical family.  My father is
a fabulous blues guitarist who taught me more than anybody, and my
brother is also a killer guitarist, playing mostly harder stuff (big
Eddie Van Halen fan).  I play a variety of instruments, primarily
guitar (on which I'm largely self-taught except for my father's
influence) and piano (having studied classical piano for about six
years).  I also have my fun on bass guitar, mandolin, ukulele, various
keyboards, all sorts of whistles and recorders, percussion of varying
stripes, and I can play the riff to "Satisfication" by the Stones on
the flute.  I also sing, probably more frequently than most people
would like, but I'm getting better.  My earliest influences on the
guitar were English blues rockers like Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page,
but since then I've taken inspiration from folkier types ranging from
Neil Young and Bob Dylan to Bert Jansch, John Renbourn, and Nick
Drake.<p>

For gear I have a variety of stuff, but my main pieces of equipment
are my <a href="malachi.jpg">'81 Epiphone Spirit</a> (a '59 double
cutaway Les Paul Special copy, approximately), my <a
href="rockstar2.jpg">'02 Epiphone SG</a>, my vintage Fender Super
Reverb amp (silverface, cira '70/'71), my totally awesome
best-$100-I-ever-spent Ibanez Tubescreamer overdrive pedal, my
Marshall VS35R studio amp, and my Peavey practice amp, in addition to
my nameless but trusty acoustic guitar, my little 3/4 classical (my
first guitar), my Yamaha YPP50 Electric Piano, my flute, my grungy
A-shape mandolin that I got from some guy at a flea market, and my
cute little ukulele that Dominic gave me.  My music collection is
pretty wide ranging, and my only criterion for music is that it sounds
good.  For a random, representative sample of my tastes and
influences, the CDs sitting by my computer in my office right now are:
The Stooge's first album,
<I>Love, God, Murder</I> by Johnny Cash, <I>Summerteeth</I> by Wilco,
<I>Chocolate and Cheese</I> by Ween, <I>Live at the BBC</I> by the
Pixies, <I>Traditional Love</I> by the Orange Mothers, <I>Chieftains
7</I> by the Chieftains,
<I>Against Nurture</I> by Suckle, Franz Ferdinand's first LP, <I>Light
and Magic</I> by Ladytron, and <I>Time (The Revelator)</I> by Gillian
Welch.<p>

I've been in a variety of informal (or formal) bands and jam outfits
over the years.

<h2>Acorn</h2>

Acorn was/is a loose jam band largely centered around the Acorn Co-Op
in Palo Alto, where we met on odd Wednesday nights from late 2001 to
early 2003 to run over whatever material came to our heads, ranging
from Irish folk to Barry Manilow to Australian drinking songs to
Beatles, Stones, and other 60s rock covers to 80s cheese to more
recent stuff like The Cure, Pulp, and The Pogues to impromptu funk
jams to hokey country songs to the occasional spontaneous original
(which we never wrote down).  Somewhere in early 2002 Edmund, in a
drunken bluster, negotiated our way into semi-regular gigs at this
dive called The Island in Palo Alto, where we played in the back room
and scared away the passers by and annoyed the regulars and
entertained only the most hideously drunk.  We quit playing there in
December 2002 after narrowly avoiding getting our faces bashed in by
this 7-foot wino named Stretch.  Normally Stretch was quite a lovely
guy who used to sit around in the back with us and good naturedly
request all these Jackson Browne songs we patently refused to play.
But one night when we weren't even playing he spontaneously developed
some kind of very serious problem with us and things got a little
ugly.  We beat a hasty retreat and never again darkened their doorstep
with our presence.<br><br>Acorn kinda dissolved when Oliver moved to
Edinburgh and Edmund moved to San Diego and Dominic and Maryl moved
first to Pacifica and now to Pittsburgh, and I stayed in Mountain
View.  Various configurations of us still jam when we get together.
Most recently, in June 2004 we (sans Oliver) had our triumphant return
to what was once The Island, now renovated and called Dan Brown's, for
Dominic's farewell party.  We played exactly one song (a Dominic
original) and left it at that on account of the fact that we'd brought
two guitars and one mic but only two amps.  That's three things to
plug in and only two things to plug them into.  For those of you
keeping score, I have a BA in math from the University of Texas and
Dominic has a DPhil in maths from Oxford.

<h2>Dead Tongues</h2>

The Dead Tongues are a Stanford Linguistics Department based band
founded by <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~sag">Ivan Sag</a>
and <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~nunberg">Geoff Nunberg</a>
and maintained by Ivan and <a
href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~sells">Peter Sells</a>.  The
permanent line-up is:

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~sag">Ivan A. Sag</a> -
Keyboards, vocals

We mainly play blues, 60s rock, and rhythm and blues covers.  For more
information about Dead Tongues in general see <a
href="http://eo.stanford.edu/sag/hobbies.html">Ivan's Hobbies
Page</a>.  I first joined the Dead Tongues (playing with the Abbott
Brothers Band) on lead guitar at a July gig at Michigan State
University for the 2003 Linguistic Society of America Institute dance
party.  The personnel for that concert were:

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/e/b/ebr2/">Elaine
Richardson</a> - Vocals

<li> Dead Tongues:
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~sag">Ivan A. Sag</a> -
Keyboards, vocals, electric guitar

<li> <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~sells">Peter Sells</a> -
Bass guitar

<li> <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~jbeavers">John Beavers</a>
- Electric guitar, vocals

</ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mielke">Jeff Mielke</a>
(of <a href="http://www.remaindersband.com">The Remainders</a>)
- Electric guitar, vocals

<li> The Abbott Brothers Band:

<ul>

<li> Bob McCarthy - Electric guitar, vocals, keyboards

<li> <a href="http://members.aol.com/lshauser/">Larry Hauser</a> - Blues harp, vocals

<li> <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/abbottb/">Barbara Abbott</a> - Fiddle

<li> <a href="http://www.msu.edu/user/tschmidt/">Tom Schmidt</a> - Drums

</ul>
</ul>

Here's a good <a href="dead-tongues-shot.html">snapshot</a> of that
gig, and here's another <a href="guitar-solo.html">one</a>.  We've
sinced played two other gigs with the current line-up, one at the
Linguistics Department end-of-year party in June 2005 and one at the
Theta Delta Chi house in Cambridge in July 2005 during the LSA Summer
Institute.  We played on a stage in the basement pub of the TDC house,
which I later discovered was the same stage that Boston played some of
their early gigs on (their original drummer being a TDC brother),
meaning I have played lead guitar on the same stage where Tom Scholtz
got his start.  Unlike Tom, I have not as of yet gone on to release
four bitchin' albums of late 70s hard prog/pop rock, but I'm assuming
it'll happen pretty soon.


<h2>Solo, Duets, Trios</h2>

In the meantime, there are lots of folks that I like to play with from
time to time, usually just as duets or trios, depending.  These
include especially <a
href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~dwiddows">Dominic Widdows</a>
(with whom I've been playing since 2000 and it's only getting better,
even though the bastard moved to Pittsburgh), <a
href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~sag">Ivan Sag</a> (who has a real
Hammond B3 organ in his garage and knows the words to all the Fugs
songs), <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/olemon/">Oliver
Lemon</a> (who I see when I'm in Edinburgh), <a
href="http://www.stanford.edu/~coppock/">Liz Coppock</a> (who sings
beautifully), and Lis Norcliffe (who's a great singer and plays guitar
to boot).  My most recent jam buddy is <a href="malachi.jpg">Malachi
Clark</a>, the next Joey Ramone (or Shane McGowan, we're not sure).
I've also been known to go solo for open mic nights, folk sessions
(debuting at a singer's night at The Royal Oak in Edinburgh), and
parties for my friends.
