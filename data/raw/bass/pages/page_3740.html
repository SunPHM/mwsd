    the market is open Saturdays from 8 a.m. to noon, selling products grown exclusively in
    Hawaii by island farmers and food producers. In addition to fresh food and easy-to-pack
    items such as jams and jellies made form mango, papaya, strawberry guava and other exotic

    chef Alan Wong, has introduced a new concept and a new restaurant at Ala Moana's Liberty
    House department store. Wong's PINEAPPLE ROOM restaurant and PATISSERIE BAR were first to
    open on the third floor, followed by the HAWAIIAN REGIONAL CUISINE MARKETPLACE on the
    fourth floor. The concept here is to showcase the freshest local products. Produce, such
    as <em>pha</em> berries, and white, purple, orange and yellow peppers come mostly from a
    cooperative of Big Island farmers who work with farmer Kurt Hirabara to supply only their
    best. There are concierges to guide you through the ordering process at the deli, to the
    fish and meat market, the bakery or the truffle department where you can watch your
    purchases being prepared.</b></strong></font></p>

    Pineapple Room is open for breakfast, lunch, snacks and light dinners. It is an airy&nbsp;
    restaurant, seats 150 and sports an open kitchen surrounded by a long marble bar from

    emerge from a wood-burning oven.</b></strong></font></p>

    pineapples. Chili, a local favorite, is served over mashed potatoes with seafood and
    topped with guacamole. <em>Char siu</em>-crusted onaga (snapper), <em>nori</em>-wrapped
    salmon and salt and pepper Kauai shrimp are three reasons to return again and again. Near
    the entrance to the Pineapple Room, weary shoppers can stop for a quick 'pick-me-up' of

    brighter flavors than the deeper, earthier Indian ones. The Thais love citrusy tastes like
    lemongrass and kaffir lime, along with <em>galangal</em> (a Thai ginger) and fresh basil
