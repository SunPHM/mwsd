Michael Lee Allen, George Manno and Michael Newton for the work they did in
putting together a six-part series on Kay Guitars in &quot;Vintage Guitar
Magazine.&quot; Also referenced was the work of J. Scott, &quot;50's Cool Kay
Guitars&quot; and a book written by Raymond Elgar entitled, &quot;Introduction
to the Double Bass.&quot; George Gruhn and Walter Carter were very helpful, as
was their book &quot;Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars.&quot; &quot;American
Guitars&quot; written by Tom Wheeler was helpful. Other people involved in this
project included Carl Kuhrmeyer, nephew of Henry Kuhrmeyer, along with Cal

style='font-size:10.0pt'>rom the time the first Kay bass was produced (1937),
the majority of the wooden parts were made at the factory. Necks were contoured
from hard maple, peg holes drilled, tops and backs formed-sanded, ribs bent and
bass bars installed on tooling either made for or developed under Kuhrmeyer's
direction. Presses for installing the bass bar, and the heating forms used to
laminate the tops and backs of the instruments were made in-house. The heating
irons used to form the shape of the ribs were purchased, as were the sanding
machines used to sand the tops, backs and necks of the new line of instruments.
Also purchased, was a hot stamping or embossing machine. This machine was
capable of embossing the tailpiece with the word </span><a
href="#nickletailpiece">Kay in cursive script</a><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>.
Bandsaws, drills and other hand tools needed were already in house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Models: </u></b></span><a href="#SHORTCUT">Go back to Shortcuts</a></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The first bass manufactured (1937) was
apparently the Concert or the (C-1). The concert bass had rounded shoulders or
bouts, which made the bass easier to play while sitting. The Maestro model
(M-1), having the violin shape, where the middle ribs form a point at their
junction with both the upper and lower ribs was manufactured after Kay was well
into production.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>At the beginning there was a (C-1), (M-1),
and a special ordered fancy bass, still called an (M-1), known and advertised
as the Alvin Hawes Model. It was a fancy bass and could be ordered with
engraved </span><a href="#tuners">tuners,</a><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>
inlet purfling and ebony fingerboard and tailpiece. Alvin Hawes was the man who
designed the bass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The earliest bass in the database is a (C-1),
Ser# 124, with tag saying (K-Meyer). It appears this bass was one of the very
earliest produced. It did not have a round disc placed under the sound post and
the pressure had split the laminated back. The earliest basses may also have
been named Kay, Kay Kraft, Old Kraftsman, Kraftsmen, KustomKraft, Custom Kraft,
K-Kraft, Kay-Meyer, or K-Meyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Blond finish was optional <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>and (M-1) Kay basses with a blond finish came
to be known as the (M-4) models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>M-4
models carried inletted purfling and an ebony fingerboard. These lasted through
1940 then (M-4) was renamed the (M-1B), of course the B being for blond
finish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The M-1B did not have inletted
purfling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>About the same time Kay produced a model C-4
bass which was a blond concert model.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>In 1940 the cataloging of<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the S models began and continued until 1969.
There were models were advertised as Supreme, Swingmaster, or Slapmaster basses
(S-1, S-3, S-4, S-5, S-6, S-7, S-8, S-9, S-10). With the S model designations
beginning in 1940, new models were added until 1952. Recent registrations
indicate S model basses were made prior to 1940 for popular people. One of the
basses registered was made in 1938, an S-6, and was apparently made for Bob
Wills. We have also recently located an S-5 bass which would have been
manufactured in 1937. The S-5 was a thin model. There is also an S-100 which is
a thin Orchestra model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The S-100, very
few manufactured, does not seem to carry inletted purfling or ebony trimmings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>There are now many Orchestra Models in the
database. Some of these say </span><a href="#innertag">Orchestra on the tag</a><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> which is glued to the inside back; some are
designated (0-1); some are designated (0-100 or 0-100B). The B is for Blonde
finish. The (0) in (0-100 or 100B) may mean (Orchestra-100 or 100B). The
Orchestra models were the (C-1) shape with a nicer finish and polished tuners,
probably made to be a little more appealing to the public eye. The basic
concert models (C-1`) were for students. Orchestra model could be ordered with
some purfling. They have been documented with inletted purfling extending
vertically up and down the middle of the back. Many of the Orchestra models
were sold with a wooden end pin and a rubber crutch tip. This not only
eliminated rattles in the endpin, but the basses were made to play in the
sitting position and an adjustable post was not necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>As years went on, Kay made numerous models
depending on the customer's requirements. The (M-1) and (C-1) models were
mainstays. There were many variations featured, from thin bodies, inlaid
purfling, and 1/3 smaller bodies to bound f-holes, </span><a href="#BASSPIC">5
strings (M-5),</a><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> and nickel plated metal
parts. (M-2), (M-2 Army), and (M-2 Navy) basses have been documented. These
basses were advertised as One-Half size, however the basses were available in
Three-Quarter size at no extra charge. The One-Half size basses are about
2&quot;shorter in the body from top to bottom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Model (M-1W) This &quot;W&quot; is an albatross.
At first it was thought the &quot;W&quot; stood for white because a couple of
basses were white.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was reported the
&quot;W&quot; stood for Wabash music. Supposed they had ordered 1000 basses to
be distributed to school systems. I have quite a few M-1W basses now listed
that are not white and they have not been refinished. There may be a
possibility the &quot;W&quot; stands for &quot;in the white&quot; or
unfinished. Kay did sell some basses unfinished; however, after studying the
finish on many of the M-1W basses, I believe it was factory applied. Kay also
sold a few bass bodies which resulted in people adding their own features. Kay
sold a few basses to Sears and Montgomery Ward which were unmarked. It is also
possible they sold basses or parts of basses to other manufacturers. The &quot;W&quot;
may also be related to the H.N. <b>W</b>hite Co. located in Cleveland, Ohio.
They manufactured King and Cleveland (American Standard) basses. I think as
time goes on we may see a relationship develop between these two companies,
particularly having to do with interchangeable parts. The Cleveland Musical
Instrument Company began in 1925 as an offshoot to King and the H.N White Co.
They made band instruments including upright basses. Their products were known
as &quot;American Standard.&quot; H.N. White Co. started making musical
instruments in 1893 and the brand was known as &quot;King.&quot; King was
White's associate and he invented the trombone with the trumpet valves for
marching bands. King started making upright basses in 1935.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Model S-8. A 1947 catalog says the S-8 is the
same as the S-1 and S-9 except it offers a different color. S-1 is brown toned;
S-9 is blonde and the S-8 was advertised as &quot;honey colored&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Top of the line basses were advertised over
the years as, Swingmaster, Supreme, or Slapmaster basses. The models were (S-1),
(S-8) and (S-9). Top of the line five string basses were (S-51), (S-58), and
(S-59). Identical except for color, these basses used Ebony on the
fingerboards, an </span><a href="#horseshoe">Ebony horseshoe shaped into the
rear of the neck base</a><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> . Some of the S model
basses had the scrolls hand carved integral with the pegbox. There was also a
company in Chicago, so far unidentified and out of business, who was
responsible for the carving of the roses integral with the pegbox. They may
have also made the roses used by Kay and glued onto the pegbox. These carved
scrolls were used on the most expensive basses. The S-9 basses were blond with
S-1 basses being brown toned. S-8 basses were &quot;honey colored&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Chubby Jackson, a jazz bassist, endorsed the
Kay bass for Kay Musical Instrument Company from about 1946 until 1969. The
S-51 model Kay was advertised as the &quot;Chubby Jackson Models. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Some of the S-9 basses have now been
documented containing an apparent original sound amplification system. As
described by the owner, &quot;it is a high impedance mic on the end of the
endpin. The endpin is constructed like a phone plug and is inserted into a
socket that sits on the floor. The socket is then connected to an amp. It is
made by Ampeg and/or Astatic.&quot; The mic is inside the bass, the end pin
about 24&quot; long which extends up into the bass and screws into the mic. The
outside of the endpin is insulated from the inside and then the jack plugs into
the bottom or exterior portion of the endpin. Henry Kuhrmeyer was a leader in
putting sound systems in musical instruments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Kay also produced a TV model and a 1/4 bass,
(M-3), along with at least three different sized cellos.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The H-10, S-10, M-3, and S-3 are all the
same size and have the same string length. The S-10 bass is the fully decorated
H-10. The S-10 is the top of the line quarter bass. The S-10 is fully purfled,
with ebony fingerboard and tailpiece and ebony horseshoe on the heel of the
neck. Schools bought the majority of the upright instruments intending to
provide the beginning student with an affordable, playable instrument. In early
years the quarter bass was called the H-10. About 1954 the H-10 was renamed the
M-3 and the S-10 came on the scene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Only a few B-5 basses were manufactured,
possibly 50 - 60. A full sized cello with bass tuners and strung up as a bass.
This bass instrument was sold as a jazz cello. People in the field have called
this a &quot;Baby Bass.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first
Jazz Cello was manufactured for Ray Brown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was used on his CD and named a model K-200.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The tuners were slightly different than the standard Klusons
having plastic knobs for the tuners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>According to one of the employees who has
worked for Kay, Kay tried producing some plastic or fiberglass model basses.
The one bass found like this had a standard maple neck, rosewood fingerboard,
and Kay inscribed on the back of the peghead and a rosewood tailpiece with the

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Former employees of the Kay Musical Instrument
Company believe the (C-1) bass to be the most common. They thought Kay made
about twice as many (C-1) basses as they did (M-1). Probably 10-15% of the
basses produced were either (S) or (M-3) models.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>During the production of the Kay bass every
effort was made to produce instruments to exacting tolerances set forth by
MENC, the Musical Educators National Conference. MENC, a non-profit
organization was formed in 1907, with the intent of helping every American
student obtain a musical education by encouraging schools, communities and
educators to offer music programs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Body size, string length, distance from the
nut to the top of the base, and depths of the base were dimensions monitored
continuously to ensure standards were met. Since the target market for Kay
basses was the beginning student musician, it was important each instrument
noted the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Catalogs advertising the bass suggest it was
designed for students 15 years and over. The standard 3/4 size Kay bass stood
72&quot; tall, having a scale or string length of 42&quot;. The body of the
bass measured 44&quot; from the bottom back to the base of the neck. Depth,
width of the ribs or thickness of the bass body varied from 6 3/4&quot; near
the neck to 7 3/4&quot; near the bottom. Another important measurement was the
length of the neck. A distance of 16 5/8&quot; was set for the dimension, from
a line drawn from below the top nut to a line drawn to the base of the neck, or
where the neck joined the top rib. This measurement was taken from the back of
the base, ensured the correct position of the player's hand for note stopping,
and proved the trueness of the neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Ebony, hard Maple and Rosewood were three
very necessary woods needed for the Kay bass. Ebony and Rosewood demands were
sometimes difficult to fulfill either because of a shortage of wood or world
trade politics. During the time Kay basses were produced 5/4&quot; stock was
the preferred stock for making fingerboards. However, because of the wood
supply some fingerboards were made out of 1&quot; stock. Use of 1&quot; stock
for making fingerboards resulted in the neck of the base seeming smaller in
circumference since the fingerboard was 1/8&quot; thinner. An original
fingerboard should be about 1 5/8&quot; wide at the nut and from the bottom of
the nut to the end of the fingerboard the measurement should be 33 1/4&quot;
Thickness of a board made from 5/4 stock should be about 5/8&quot; at the
bottom and 3/8&quot; at the top. A board made from 1&quot; stock will be about
1/8&quot; thinner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Most of the Concert and Maestro model basses
had Rosewood, hard Maple or ebonized fingerboards. Ebonizing was the process of
staining hard Maple or Rosewood, black, thus simulating Ebony. A true Ebony
fingerboard and tailpiece were found only on the top of the line bass, the
Supreme, Slapmaster or Swingmaster. In the early years of Kay the Maestro bass
was top of the line and sported an Ebony fingerboard. Kay fingerboards all had
a flat on the E side and were not rounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Hard Maple was used for the necks of the
bass. A Kay neck with a full dimensioned fingerboard was thick and requests
came in for a thinner more playable neck. Kay never slimmed the neck of their
basses even though wood supplies for a thinner neck may have been easier to
locate. Sometimes it may seem the neck is slimmer than normal, but it is
possible the fingerboard was made from thinner stock. The peghead and the neck
were made as one assembly with the exception of a few experimentals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The roses, scrolls or volutes were glued on
except for the higher quality basses when they were sometimes carved into the
peghead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One luthier reported to me
that he had three different styles of scrolls he had saved from Kay basses. The
different styles have not been proven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a quarter and frequently the word KAY is embossed into the wood.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>If the line dividing the peghead goes all
the way to the bottom of the peghead, then the neck is probably a replacement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Some basses have </span><a href="#kaypeghead">&quot;Kay&quot;
embossed at the rear of the peghead</a><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> in
script with fairly small letters. It appears as if installed with a wood
burning tool. One source suggested the basses with this mark were marked at the
factory whenever the bass was made for the US Government. Many basses were
purchased for use in military bands. This appears to be bogus information.
Basses have been found and documented to have the Kay Peghead but have never
been any part of the government or military. Former Kay employees believe the
Kay embossing tool was used on every bass manufactured while they worked at the
Walnut St. factory. They also said the embossing was done only by Kay and not
outside contractors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Possibly the Kay
was embossed on every peghead and then through the sanding and finishing

Fairly common is the three piece neck which has a piece of ebony, 3/16&quot;,

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The Kay Musical Instrument Company was
leading their field in lamination. From the beginning, the Kay bass (1937) had
a laminated top and back formed on presses in the factory. Presses were made of
a material that looked like plaster and wood and finally steel. Hide glue was
probably the glue used to laminate the plys. Upon taking a 1949 bass apart,
hide glue between the plys was apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It appears hide glue was used at least from 1937 until 1952.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Early in the 1960's, an aluminum mold was
manufactured to replace the steel mold used for laminating the tops and backs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Kay bass tops and backs held to 1/4&quot;
thickness (5-ply), however, as steel strings became popular, in the late
1950's, the possibility of table tension increased. (The table is the portion
of the top where the bridge sits.) Facing the possibility of increased table
tension it appears a decision was made to increase the strength of the laminate
to better support the bridge. New technology emerged which allowed layers of
laminate to be used in whatever thickness would produce maximum strength. The
fifth or surface ply ended up to be .050&quot; of Spruce for the front and
.050&quot; Maple or figured Maple for the back. There does not seem to have
been any specifications for the core wood used in the lamination procedure,
only the surface sheet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Forest
Products Lab of Madison, WI has analyzed the plys of a 1949 bass. The back
surface was hard maple, the front surface was Spruce. Both of the
understructures were the same. The second ply was basswood, third was birch,
fourth was basswood and the fifth most innermost ply was birch.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All were held together with hide glue.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The surface, third and inner ply were
laminated vertically while the second and fourth plys were horizontal, creating
a mesh effect certainly designed to create strength.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The reports on the number of pieces making up
the veneers on the front and back seems to be quite inconclusive.<span

back from the edge of the hole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
was on one of the earliest basses having inletted purfling and Kay may have
changed the purfling design, to the set back style, before the end of
1937.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It appears the inletted purfling
around the f-holes was at the very edge of the f-hole until just before bass with
Ser# 1240.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bass Ser# 1240 has the
purfling set back from the f-hole edge about 1/4&quot;, but the S model basses
prior to Ser# 1240 had the purfling right at the edge. The concert model
appears never to have been advertised as having purfling, instead, there were
two black painted pin-stripes on both the front and the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Since Kay had the laminated top and back the

numbers ran consecutive with cellos. Twice as many cellos were sold as basses.
With production under the Kay name lasting until October of 1969, Kay likely
produced 20,000-30,000 basses. I think the last bass made in 1969 will have a
serial number not in excess of 58,000.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
