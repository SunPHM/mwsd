  Breeding duck and Canada goose populations in Minnesota increased or remained 
  stable this year, according to results just released by the Minnesota Department 
  of Natural Resources (DNR). <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Breeding waterfowl numbers for most species were generally good,&#148; 
  said Steve Cordts, DNR waterfowl staff specialist. &#147;Although May was one 
  of the wettest on record for most counties in the state, most of the rain occurred 
  after we had completed the survey.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p>Each May a DNR waterfowl biologist and conservation officer pilot estimate 
  breeding duck populations by flying randomly selected survey routes at low elevations 
  using fixed-wing aircraft. The survey is designed to estimate breeding duck 
  populations across about 40 percent of Minnesota, which comprises most of the 
  better duck breeding habitat. All waterfowl and wetlands are counted along these 
  routes. In addition, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service ground crews count waterfowl 
  along a portion of the routes to correct for birds missed during the aerial 
  survey. <br>
</p>
<p>The estimated mallard breeding population in Minnesota this spring was 375,313, 
  which was 34 percent higher than last year and 9 percent above the 10-year average. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Although the increase this year was not statistically significant, the 
  mallard population remains high despite the dry conditions,&#148; Cordts said. 
  &#147;Pond numbers declined 19 percent this year, but mallards seemed to have 
  fared well.&#148; </p>
<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/news_waterfowl_04.jpg" width="358" height="190" border="0"><br>
</p>
<p>Since 1992, the population has been above 300,000 every year except in 2003. 
  Blue-winged teal numbers were 353,209, an increase of 83 percent from last year 
  and 54 percent above the long-term average. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;The increase this spring was partially due to the cooler-than-average 
  May temperatures, which resulted in delayed migration of blue-wings through 
  the state, so some migrant teal were counted early in the survey,&#148; Cordts 
  said. &#147;Last year, most migrant blue-wings had moved through Minnesota by 
  the time the survey was initiated.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p>Populations of other duck species such as wood ducks, ring-necked ducks and 
  gadwalls increased 13 percent this year to about 280,000, which is 10 percent 
  above the 10-year average. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Overall, we expected slightly lower populations this year because of 
  the dry conditions during the survey, but duck populations remain fairly high 
  across the state,&#148; Cordts said. &#147;Also, the abundant rainfall received 
  across most of the state later in May should improve brood-rearing conditions 
  and benefit late-nesting ducks.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p><b>CANADA GEESE</b><br>
  This is the fourth year the DNR conducted a statewide helicopter survey of breeding 
  giant Canada geese in April and early May. A DNR biologist and helicopter pilot 
  counted Canada geese on 150 quarter-section (160 acre) plots randomly across 
  Minnesota&#146;s three major ecoregions: prairie, transition and forest zones. 
  This year&#146;s estimate of 375,000 geese was higher than 2003 and remains 
  above statewide population objectives. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Conditions were very dry throughout most of the state when we flew the 
  survey,&#148; said Steve Maxson, DNR goose specialist. &#147;That seemed to 
  concentrate geese on the remaining wetland habitats, which may have influenced 
  the count,&#148; The number of breeding waterfowl in Minnesota is estimated 
  each year as part of an annual inventory of North American breeding waterfowl. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Data on breeding duck populations from Canada and other states is not 
  available until July, but preliminary reports indicate fair conditions and duck 
  numbers in the Dakotas and prairie Canada,&#148; Cordts said. &#147;Most regions 
  benefited by rain in late May, but it may have come a little late. Also, we 
  expect production from most arctic-nesting goose populations to be very poor 
  because ice melt was extremely late this year.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p>Mallard population estimates from Minnesota will be combined with estimates 
  from other North American breeding areas and used to determine the duck season 
  length and bag limit for the 2004-05 waterfowl hunting season.<br>

  MINNETONKA, Minn. &#150; Doug Mientkiewicz&#146; second annual Bass Fishing 
  Classic raised a record $60,000 for Minnesota based conservation organization 
  Wildlife Forever. The groups&#146; mission is to preserve America&#146;s wildlife 
  heritage through conservation education, preservation of habitat and management 
  of fish and wildlife.</p>

  The 2nd Annual Doug Mientkiewicz Bass Fishing Classic held on Monday raised 
  a record $60,000 for Minnesota&#146;s wildlife.</font> <br>
</p>
<p align="left">The Doug Mientkiewicz Bass Fishing Classic was held Monday, June 
  28 amid sunny skies and calm blue waters. The team format tournament matches 
  a celebrity athlete with a professional bass angler and an amateur in each boat. 
  The 33 boats all arrived on time for the 1:00 PM weigh-in and a large crowd 
  to watch each Minnesota Twin weigh-in with his team. Among past and present 
  Twins weighing fish were Lew Ford, Gene Larking, Jacques Jones, Jack Morris, 
  Bert Blyleven, Johan Santana, Matthew LeCroy and Corey Koskie. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">World Series champion and former Twin Kent Hrbek along with Doug 
  Mientkiewicz and Eric Gislasson acted as emcees as each team brought their catch 
  to the stage. According to Douglas Grann, President &amp; CEO of Wildlife Forever: 
  &#147;The crowd was trilled having the two best first basemen in Twins history 
  take the stage together. It was a rare opportunity to share the wonders of the 
  great outdoors with Minnesota Twins fans.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p align="left">The team of Brad Monnette, Matt Peters and Rodney McCormick with 
  16.24 pounds took first place. Second place went to Doug Mientkiewicz, Dean 
  Capra and Robert Blake with 15.34 pounds. Jamie Ogden, David Skallet and Jim 
  Gerchy won third place with 13.39 pounds. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">All of the fish were successfully released back into the lake, 
  a 100 percent release rate, thanks to the advanced oxygenating technology of 
  Aqua-Innovations and their special release boat. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Expenses were kept very low thanks to the donated support of Maynard&#146;s 
  Restaurant, the Minnesota Twins, Minnetonka Outdoors, Stearns and the pro bass 
  anglers, each of whom donated their time, boat and fishing equipment. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">&#147;Proceeds from this year&#146;s event will be used to fund 
  grassroots conservation grants for fish and wildlife work throughout the country,&#148; 
  said Grann. &#147;Local sportsmen groups and conservation clubs can apply for 
  challenge grants directly from Wildlife Forever. This is another example of 
  the Twins supporting the community and our natural resources.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p align="left">Sponsors of the tournament included: The Minnesota Twins, Ranger 
  Boats, Yamaha engines, Fox Sports Net, WCCO Radio, Twin City Co-ops Federal 
  Credit Union, Stearns and Minnetonka Outdoors. <br>
</p>
<p align="left">The tournament&#146;s fundraising efforts were supplemented with 
  an on-site silent auction that raised nearly $5,000. In addition, one amateur 
  fishing spot was raffled off during the month of May that raised $1,500. <br>

  <font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DNR Reports</font><br>
  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is seeking comments on a 
  proposed special turkey hunt for disabled veterans at Camp Ripley next spring. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The hunt, which would be the first turkey hunt authorized at Camp Ripley, would 
  be held May 3-4. It is designed after the successful disabled deer hunts held 
  annually at the military installation. The Minnesota Legislature has given the 
  DNR authority to conduct special hunts that provide hunting opportunities to 
  those with disabilities, according to Beau Liddell, DNR area wildlife manager 
  at Little Falls. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;The special hunt would be open to 20 disabled veteran hunters and their 
  partners,&#148; Liddell said. &#147;The special deer hunts have been a success, 
  so we expect a turkey hunt could generate similar interest. There is the option 
  of expanding the hunt in future years.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p>The DNR and the Department of Military Affairs would provide the necessary 
  technical assistance and logistical support. The National Wild Turkey Federation-Wheelin 
  Sportsmen and the St. Cloud Veterans Administration Hospital would administer 
  the hunt. <br>
</p>
<p>Hunters who have a permanent disability and are armed forces veterans would 
  be eligible to apply for the special hunt. All disabled hunters would be accompanied 
  by an able-bodied partner who would not be allowed to hunt. <br>
</p>
<p>Permits and licenses issued for this special hunt would allow disabled hunters 
  to take one bearded turkey, only during the special hunt and only at Camp Ripley. 
  Hunters would be allowed to use only legal shotguns, muzzleloading shotguns 
  and archery equipment for taking turkeys, as defined in the Minnesota Hunting 
  Regulations Handbook. Interested hunters would not apply through the regular 
  spring turkey hunt lottery. </p>
<p>Instead, they would apply directly to one of the sponsoring organizations that 
  would select participants. Permits and licenses issued for this hunt would be 
  separate from those issued during the regular spring lottery. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;The actual number of wild turkeys harvested during the proposed turkey 
  hunt is expected to be small,&#148; said Liddell. &#147;The disabled hunt would 
  not affect permit levels for the regular spring hunt that occurs outside Camp 
  Ripley. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Turkey populations on the military installation have increased dramatically 
  and are very healthy at this time,&#148; Liddell continued. &#147;We believe 
  this is an excellent opportunity to offer disabled vets a unique and exciting 
  hunt.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p>Comments on the proposed hunt should be submitted by July 30 to Beau Liddell, 
  DNR area wildlife manager, 16543 Haven Road, Little Falls, MN 56345; phone (320) 
  616-2468; or e-mail <a href="mailto:beau.liddell@dnr.state.mn.us">beau.liddell@dnr.state.mn.us</a>.</p>

  <br>
  <font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DNR Reports</font><br>
  A booming deer herd and a strong commitment to the future of hunting have led 
  to the expansion of special youth deer hunting opportunities this fall, according 
  to Minnesota Department of Natural Resource (DNR) officials. Seven special youth 
  deer hunts and one special youth deer season will be held in October at locations 
  throughout the state. <br>
</p>
<p>Applications for the three archery hunts and four firearms deer hunts are available 
  on the DNR Electronic Licensing System beginning July 1. Applications for the 
  hunts are due Aug. 20. Lotteries will be held to select participants. <br>
</p>
<p>Youth who are ages 12-17 as of Oct. 7, and who have their Firearms Safety Certificate, 
  are eligible to apply for one of the special youth archery deer hunts. Hunts 
  will be held at Camp Ripley Oct. 9-10, Arden Hills Army Training Site A Oct. 
  21-22, and Arden Hills Army Training Site B Oct. 23-24. Participants must obtain 
  a valid archery license at least two days prior to the hunt. <br>
</p>
<p>Youth who are ages 12-15 as of Oct. 20, and who have their Firearms Safety 
  Certificate, are eligible to apply for one of the special youth firearms deer 
  hunts. Hunts will be held at Whitewater Wildlife Management Area Refuge near 
  Winona Oct. 21-24, Lake Bemidji State Park Oct. 21-24, Rydell National Wildlife 
  Refuge near Crookston Oct. 30-31, and St. Croix State Park near Hinckley Oct. 
  30-31. Blaze orange requirements will be in effect for these areas during the 
  youth hunts. Participants must obtain a valid firearms license prior to the 
  hunt. Youth may hunt with bow and arrow or a shotgun in the Whitewater Wildlife 
  Management Area Refuge hunt. <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;Youth hunts are a tool for recruiting and retaining young hunters because 
  they give us an opportunity to provide high quality, safe, mentored hunting 
  experiences,&#148; said Ryan Bronson, coordinator of the DNR&#146;s recruitment 
  and retention program. &#147;With all the competition for kids&#146; time these 
  days, providing positive experiences early in a hunter&#146;s development is 
  critical to keeping them involved. Plus, by holding these hunts outside of the 
  regular hunting season frameworks, it is easier for adult mentors to participate.&#148; 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Participating youth must attend a pre-hunt orientation and safety session and 
  must be accompanied by a parent or guardian during the hunt. If the parent or 
  guardian is an inexperienced hunter who would like help, volunteer mentors from 
  sponsoring organizations are available to accompany the hunter/parent teams 
  in the field. Sponsoring organizations include the Minnesota Deer Hunters Association, 
  Minnesota State Archery Association, and the Bluffland Whitetails Association. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>&#147;The research on youth participation in hunting and fishing is conclusive,&#148; 
  Bronson said. &#147;Youth become hunters and anglers because they are taught 
  how by someone close to them. We require a parent, guardian or other adult mentor 
  to accompany kids on these hunts so they experience the hunt together. Usually, 
  participants report that the time they spend together is the most valuable part 
  of the hunt.&#148; <br>
</p>
<p><b>NORTHWEST MINNESOTA EARLY YOUTH ANTLERLESS DEER SEASON</b><br>
  A different type of hunting opportunity will occur in northwestern Minnesota 
  Oct. 23-24. A special youth antlerless deer season was established by the Minnesota 
  Legislature for Kittson, Roseau, Lake of the Woods, Marshall and Pennington 
  counties. Any youth ages 12-14 with a Minnesota firearms deer license, valid 
  for any zone or season, are eligible to hunt antlerless deer in these five counties. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>All participating youth must be accompanied by a non-hunting adult and must 
  get a free Northwest Minnesota Youth Antlerless Deer Season endorsement from 
  an Electronic Licensing System agent prior to the hunt. There are no limits 
  on the number of youth who may participate. Participants may take only one antlerless 
  deer during the hunt. Party hunting is not allowed. <br>
</p>
<p>While the special hunts have been on fairly limited parcels of land that are 
  largely closed to hunting, the northwest Minnesota youth season is open in an 
  area that encompasses more than 4 million acres. <br>
</p>
<p>Deer hunting organizations in the area, including the Minnesota Deer Hunters 
  Association and Minnesota Quality Deer Management, will seek to pair willing 
  landowners with young hunters. Later this summer, a Web site will be available 
  that both landowners and potential hunters can access to get together. <br>

<p> <font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DNR Reports</font><br>
  Hunters seeking one of 100 permits for the 2004 Minnesota prairie chicken season 
  or one of 4,380 permits for the fall turkey hunt must apply by July 30, according 
  to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). </p>
<p>Applications may be picked up at more than 1,800 Electronic Licensing System 
  locations beginning July 1.<br>
</p>
<p><b>PRAIRIE CHICKEN SEASON</b><br>
  The five-day prairie chicken season, which will begin on Oct. 23, is open to 
  Minnesota residents only. Hunters will be charged a $4 application fee. They 
  may apply individually or in groups up to four hunters. Prairie chicken licenses 
  cost $20. <br>
</p>
<p>The hunt will be held in seven prairie chicken quota areas in west-central 
  Minnesota between Crookston in the north and Breckenridge in the south. Up to 
  20 percent of the permits in each area will be issued to landowners or tenants 
  of 40 acres or more of prairie or grassland property within the permit area 
  for which they applied. <br>
</p>
<p>The season bag limit is two prairie chickens per hunter. This year, licensed 
  prairie chicken hunters will also be allowed to take sharp-tailed grouse while 
  legally hunting prairie chickens. Sharptails and prairie chickens are similar 
  looking species. The general closure on taking sharp-tailed grouse by small 
  game hunters in this area is to protect prairie chickens. Licensed prairie chicken 
  hunters who wish to take sharptails must meet all regulations and licensing 
  requirements for taking sharp-tailed grouse. <br>
</p>
<p>Last year was the first Minnesota prairie chicken season since 1942. There 
  were 853 applicants for the 100 available permits in 2003. The odds of being 
  drawn the first year were about 12 percent. A preference system is in place 
  that adds a preference point for each year a hunter correctly applies but is 
  not drawn. <br>
</p>
<p>Of the 100 successful applicants in 2003, 93 purchased licenses. Licensed prairie 
  chicken hunters harvested and registered 115 prairie chickens. Overall success 
  rate of prairie chicken hunters in 2003 was 68 percent. The average registered 
  take per license holder was 1.2 birds. <br>
</p>
<p>Minnesota&#146;s prairie chicken population now stands at more than 3,000 breeding 
  birds in the spring and more than double that number in the fall. Prairie restoration 
  and protection programs have helped stabilize the bird&#146;s population in 
  recent years. The restoration of a regulated prairie chicken hunting season 
  has helped build awareness and support for protecting and enhancing prairie 
  and grassland habitats.<br>
</p>
<p><b>FALL TURKEY SEASON </b><br>
  Applications for this year&#146;s fall turkey hunt are being accepted at Electronic 
  Licensing System vendors across Minnesota. Fall turkey hunters may apply for 
  one of 4,380 permits to hunt in one of 24 permit areas from Oct. 13-17 or Oct. 
  20-24. This is a 13 percent increase in available permits compared with 2003. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>The application fee is $3. The license costs $18 for residents and $73 for 
  nonresidents. A $5 stamp validation is also required for turkey hunters 18 years 
  of age or older. <br>
</p>
<p>The deadline for applications for both the prairie chicken and fall turkey 
  hunts is July 30. Application worksheets and maps of permit areas for both hunts 
  are available on the DNR Web site at www.dnr.state.mn.us. </p>
<p>Successful applicants will be notified by mail and must purchase their permit 
  at an electronic licensing system vendor.</p>
<p><b>DNR accepting applications for 2004 Camp Ripley archery hunts</b><br>
  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) will begin accepting applications 
  July 1 for the 2004 regular archery deer hunts at Camp Ripley near Little Falls. 
  Hunters may pick from one of two hunting seasons, Oct. 21-22 or Oct. 30-31. 
  A total of 4,500 permits will be available - 2,250 per two-day hunt.<br>
</p>
<p>Hunters may apply for the Camp Ripley deer hunts in person at any one of 1,800 
  Electronic Licensing System agents throughout Minnesota, by calling 1-888-665-4236, 
  or through the DNR&#146;s Web site at www.dnr.state.mn.us/rlp/ index.html. <br>
</p>
<p>The fee is $8 per applicant. The deadline to apply is Aug. 20. Those who apply 
  by phone or Internet will be charged an additional convenience fee of $3.50 
  per transaction. This year, participants may purchase intensive harvest permits 
  and take up to two deer during their hunt. <br>
</p>
<p>To apply, resident and nonresident hunters will need a valid state driver&#146;s 
  license or state issued identification card with current address, a firearms 
  safety certificate number, or a Minnesota DNR number found on a recent Minnesota 
  fishing and hunting license. <br>
</p>
<p>DNR officials said it is important that the identification card used reflects 
  the current mailing address, because this is where notification will be sent 
  if the applicant is successful in the computer preference drawing. </p>
<p>Applicants must be at least 12 years old prior to Oct. 21, 2004. In order to 
  obtain a license to hunt or trap in Minnesota, anyone born after Dec. 31, 1979, 
  must have a firearms safety certificate, a previous hunting license, or other 
  evidence of successfully completing a hunter safety course. <br>
</p>
<p>Hunters applying for a permit will be asked a series of questions. It is recommended 
  that they prepare for these questions by completing a worksheet prior to applying. 
  Hunt application worksheets are available on the DNR&#146;s Web site, from the 
  DNR License Bureau, or from an Electronic Licensing System agent. Hunters may 
  apply as individuals or as a group of up to four individuals. Group members 
  may only apply for the same two-day season. <br>
</p>
<p>The archery hunt at Camp Ripley is an annual event. The DNR coordinates the 
  hunt with the Department of Military Affairs, which manages the 53,000-acre 
  military reservation.<br>
