        <P><FONT COLOR="#ccddff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">On May 24 and
        25, the Eastern Madera County Chamber of Commerce (EMCCC) held
        their 25th annual Mountain Peddler's Fair in Oakhurst, California
        on Saturday and Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. About 15,000
        people were expected to attend, with about 450 vendors, selling
        anything from antique glassware to hotdogs, candy and popcorn.
        And SMCTek was there to sell (or at least try to sell) guitars
        and basses.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT COLOR="#ccddff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The SMCTek
        booth was manned by Steve, our guitar builder, and brother-in-law
        Kenny, who also helped set up &amp; tear down everything Saturday
        and Sunday. We handed out a couple hundred business cards and
        flyers, and at least 25 different musicians played our instruments.
        With prices ranging from $225 to $800, we didn't expect to sell
        much product, but viewed this as an opportunity to put SMCTek
        instruments in the hands of some California musicians so that
        they could experience first-hand the quality of the guitars and
        basses we build.</FONT></P>

    on Saturday, our neighbor to the left was Oakhurst's local AM
    radio station KAAT. When they took down their booth at noon we
    became the corner booth in our row, so we removed the side panel
    of our booth so that people approaching from the side could see
    us and the guitars as well.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ccddff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">When all was
    said and done, we sold only one instrument, a black P/J bass
    with a used body and new neck, very nicely set up. This gentleman
    played the bass for quite a while, then played the hand-made
    guitar on the left in the above picture. With our own master
    guitar builder Steve playing bass, he did a beautiful rendition
    of Eric Clapton's <B><I>Wonderful Tonight</I></B>, then went
    away to think about that bass. About 30 minutes later he came
    back and bought it for $225, and went away happy. And in our
    excitement, we forgot to get his name!</FONT></P>

    we set up again, with some of the instruments placed up on the
    tables to show them off better. The two instruments on the right
    below are the two hand-made instruments SMCTek has been working
    on over the last 6 weeks, in the process of developing a new
    product line in which the bodies and necks are made by hand right
    in the SMCTek shop. All of the instruments previously built by
    SMCTek used bodies and necks purchased from various vendors online
    and on Ebay.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#ccddff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Over the course
    of the two days of the Fair there were perhaps a dozen jam sessions,
    and perhaps 20 to 25 different people played our instruments.
    One of the high points was on Sunday afternoon when a fellow
    who had a hotdog cart in the Fair came by to buy a set of guitar
    strings and stayed to play and sing Johnny Cash's <B><I>Folsom
    Prison Blues</I></B> with Steve playing bass. We also had three
    members of a motorcycle club from Fresno play some of their songs
    for us, and one young fellow jammed with Steve on bass, playing
    with a style that reminded Steve of Mark Knopfler.</FONT></TD>
