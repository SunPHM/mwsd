      example the picture below shows a 4 voice or 4 sets of reeds
      accordion.&nbsp; However this does not mean that it has 4 different sounds; it means that it
      has 4 blocks of reeds inside, so when you play any note, depending on what
      coupler or register is depressed, 4 actual reeds will be activated.&nbsp; Accordions will have from 2 sets to 5 sets of reeds in general. There are
      many combinations available today but usually 48 bass instruments will be
      2 voice, 72 and 80 bass 3 voice, 96 &amp; 120 will be 3 or 4 voice. 5
      voice is not so popular as it is rather bulky. The trend has been to get
      as many sets of reeds into the smallest accordions - the best selling
      models for quite some time have been 72&nbsp; &amp; 96 bass with 4 sets of
      reeds. There is always a compromise as the amount of notes on the treble
      keyboard is less on a 72 bass (34 piano keys) than on a standard 96 bass

      <strong><img border="0" src="images/Siteimagery/muscoup.jpg" align="left" width="80" height="129">Musette refers
    to a type of tuning, usually associated with French or Scottish sounds. &nbsp; The true
    musette tuning is when you have 3 middle reeds, (also called&nbsp; 8 ' or clarinet
      reeds); one in
    tune, one tuned flat and one tuned sharp thus causing the notes to vibrate
      against each other.&nbsp; When
    these 3 reeds sound simultaneously, this is what we refer to as musette.&nbsp; Depending
    on how far sharp and flat the&nbsp; reeds are tuned will vary the speed of musette; in
    other words, the further sharp and flat, the stronger the musette.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

    this particular instrument and this is why it is better to look at the dots on the coupler
    instead of the words;&nbsp; 3 in a row in the middle segment means you have the necessary
    3 clarinet reeds. &nbsp;I have dealt with many customers that had bought accordions

    Cassotto is an Italian word meaning 'box';&nbsp; it is also&nbsp; referred to as
    &quot;tone chamber&quot;.&nbsp;The reeds that are placed in this chamber
      have a far more mellow and rich tone. As you can see from the photograph

    constructed differently to standard models, and in any make would be regarded as the top
    of the range. </strong><b>The instrument becomes slightly heavier (about
      2lbs on average).</b><strong>These models always cost more as the
      construction is more complicated with 2 sets of pallets being required to
      cover the sets of reeds. It is possible to have your cassotto accordion
      either with musette&nbsp; or&nbsp; double octave tuning; in most people's
      opinion a musette tuned instrument is better with no cassotto as the idea
      of the musette sound is that it should be&nbsp; bright and sparkling&nbsp;
      and the cassotto mellows one of the three&nbsp; 8' reeds. However it has a
      beautifully rich sound of its own and is a popular choice especially in
      the 96 bass specification. </strong><b>Occasionally on a five sets of
      reeds cassotto accordion you may find that the piccolo (4') reed is placed

    will be one bassoon reed (16'), two clarinet reeds, (8') and one piccolo reed (4'). &nbsp;

    reeds.&nbsp; Occasionally instruments come into stock with the more unusual 16', 8' and 4'

      the physical weight of an accordion rather than the ease and comfort of
      playing it; if you have a very good quality instrument the reeds will
      respond far quicker and easier thus requiring less effort to play than one
      of lesser quality.&nbsp; This can often be misunderstood to seem that the
      accordion is actually heavier but if you have opened and closed the
      bellows twice as much on a cheaper instrument because the reeds need more
      air to play you will naturally tire quicker.&nbsp; However, with the
      choice of specifications available today it is a good idea not to buy an
      instrument with more keyboard length than you really need; many folk
      players for example never need more than a 72 bass as the majority of the
      music is usually played in the keys of G,D &amp; A.&nbsp; (A lot of
      English folk players use a two row melodeon set in the keys of D and G but
      obviously this is a generalisation).&nbsp; I have compiled a few examples

      usually with buttons on both sides in either a one, two or three row
      format on the right hand and used mainly by folk and traditional
      players.&nbsp; There is an enormous variety of specifications made in
      different keys for different countries.&nbsp; Some melodeons have stops
      (couplers) on the top of the instrument which are simple devices for
      closing off any sets of reeds.&nbsp; The one row melodeon only allows you
      to play in that one key that the instrument is tuned to.&nbsp;The Cajun
      musicians generally use a 1 row with 4 sets of reeds. They
      sometimes come with two bass levers or also with four bass buttons.&nbsp;
      A different note plays depending on whether the bellows is pushed or
      pulled.&nbsp; The rows are set to major keys - for example D/G
      melodeons used by the English folk players usually have two rows of
      buttons on the right hand, the outer row is in the key of D major and the
      inner row in G major and generally they are played &quot;down&quot; the
      rows.&nbsp; Two row models normally have 8 bass buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Irish and Scottish melodeons are now usually tuned in B/C. These
      instruments are generally played &quot;across&quot; the rows, enabling the
      player to play in various keys depending on the bass buttons they have - the standard tuning on the bass for the B/C models is F/C,
      G/C, E/A and D/G (major chords).&nbsp; Other tunings sometimes seen are
      C/C#, C#/D and D/D# (any tunings are available upon request, however
      instruments can also be altered to anything desired by replacing or&nbsp;
      retuning the existing reeds). A system still made today that was very
      popular in the forties and fifties is the &quot;Club&quot; system. This
      usually has 2½ rows, commonly in C/F or B flat /E flat ; the half row
      would consist of accidental notes to make the instrument more
      versatile.&nbsp;<br>

      would cause the clicking mentioned above.&nbsp; Some faults may appear to be
      very serious, but don't panic; on numerous occasions customers have come
      to the shop expecting bad news about their repairs only to have it

      The accordion is generally a hard wearing instrument if treated
      correctly.&nbsp; Try to keep it dust free and in an environment with an
      even temperature.&nbsp; As with almost any other instruments, do not place
      it near a radiator or heating source or direct sunlight.&nbsp; In extreme
      cases, an accordion left in the back seat of a car on a very hot, sunny
      day can cause the wax around the reeds to melt neccessitating a complete
      renovation.&nbsp; The worst you can do to an accordion is&nbsp;store it in a damp
      place. The reeds will get rusty very quickly and the instrument will go
      badly out of tune.&nbsp; Even if the accordion looks to be in perfect condition
      on the outside it will require a full overhaul of the reeds which is expensive;&nbsp;
      this procedure involves the removal of the reeds from the wooden reed
      blocks, </strong><font color="#000000" size="3"><b><a href="images/Siteimagery/goodreed.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/Siteimagery/goodreed_small.jpg" alt="goodreed.jpg (4996 bytes)" align="left" width="37" height="80"></a></b></font><strong>
      (there are approx. 220 double-sided reeds &amp; 400 valves in a full size accordion ) laid out on trays, cleaned thoroughly, re-valved,
      re-waxed back onto the wooden blocks and finally tuned.&nbsp; The picture
      you see on the left shows just one side of one reed.&nbsp; This kind of work
      (including any general repairs to the mechanisms) would take approximately
      two weeks and cost between £400-£500.&nbsp; If you store your accordion
      in it's case it is best to wrap the straps behind the accordion rather
      than pulling them over the keyboard as over the years I have had to repair hundreds of
      keys that have been forced out of position by the strap buckles catching
      the edge of the key as the straps are pulled over, as well as having the
      possibility of scratching the cellulose covering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td>

      Some manufacturers use a different amount of resin in the wax mixture so
      the effect might not be so bad as the picture opposite - however I do not
      think it is worth finding out which is the best mix, do you?</b> <b>&nbsp;Another
      common problem that can also occur to your instrument if you leave it in
      direct sunlight, is that over a period of time, the cellulose will discolour if it is
      not black.<br>

      No, not at all.&nbsp;It helps enormously if you can already read music, play piano or
      keyboard to any degree. But even so, whether you are having personal tuition or if you follow a good tutor
      book, for example, the Anzaghi tutor,&nbsp;and practise
      consistently, your ability and technique will quickly improve. People
      believe that the co-ordination is very difficult but this is usually
      because they are trying to play both hands together before they have
      mastered each hand separately.&nbsp; In addition, I believe it's good to
      have your instrument within easy access as this encourages the desire to
      pick it up and practise regularly instead of the hassle of having to pull
      it in and out of it's case which can cause damage if you are careless as
      described in the last question.</strong></td>
