 <font color="#000099"><font size="+1">Here are a couple pics of my bass
after rough cutting the body profile and a lot of the neck shaping done.
On the left it's hanging in one of my home-made guitar hangers made from
some scrap pieces of plywood. I still need to thin the upper horn and do
some more shaping and smoothing of the body before moving to rounding over
the edges. On the right you can see the neck-to-body junction, it also needs
a bit more shaping and thinning out. You can also see there some of my bad
filler in the black lines inside the long horn. That's why I've decided to
finish the edges, neck and back of the headstock black, then fade that to
a translucent blue for the top of the body, headstock, and back of the body.
If I can figure out how to do it it should look really good...a big "IF"
at this point!</font></font>  <br>

 <font color="#000099"><font size="+1">Here's a couple closeups of the back 
of the headstock and another angle on the neck/body junction. On the back 
of the headstock I'm trying to carve a rounded volute under the nut but still 
have a little more work to do on it to make it symmetrical. Also, you can 
see where the router slipped into the nut slot and gouged the edge of the 
neck. I've worked that down a little bit but still have more smoothing to 
do. Just one of many "flubs" that, so far, I've been able to either hide or
fix. On the other picture again you can see how fat the upper horn is still.
I still have to take off as much as 3/8" from the inside of it. You can also
see the hump on the back of the neck that needs to be smoothed out.</font></font><br>

you can see in the one on the left, the laminates didn't come out perfectly 
centered...that's one reason I've decided to finish it in black. On the right 
you can see the volute where the neck meets the headstock. It still looks 
a bit too lumpy to me, a bit more carving to do as you can better see in the
picture below..</font></font> <br>

 <font color="#000099"><font size="+1">Here's the body after trimming the 
horns a bit thinner and rounding over the edges. I still have to do the roundover 
by hand on the inside of the horns close to the body, but that won't be too 
difficult. Next, on to routing the pickup and control cavities. I've just 
about finished shaping the back of the neck where it meets the body. There's 
just a little more to do rounding over the neck inside the horn to make it 
easier to reach across the wide fretboard. It's starting to look good now, 
I kind of hate to have to cut into the top and mess up that nice curly maple, 
but it does need pickups. Speaking of which, I've received my pickups from 
<a href="http://www.carvin.com">Carvin Guitars</a> and have made my routing 
template for them as well as the control cavities. I'll have pictures of them
on the next page.</font></font> <br>
