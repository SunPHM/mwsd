          I am an associate in research (soft-money faculty) at the 
	<A HREF="http://ibc.wsu.edu">Institute of Biological
Chemistry</A> at <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu">Washington State
University</A>  I work in the laboratory of <A 
HREF="http://www.wsu.edu/~ibc/faculty/rc.html"> Rodney Croteau</A> on the
biosynthesis of the terpenes.  If you didn't already know, TERPENES ARE
COOL! The oldest known biomolecules are terpenes, and today they
make up the largest class of natural products, encompassing over 30,000
known compounds.  All terpenes are initially made from a simple
combination of C5 isoprene units, which often undergo cyclization,
rearangement and secondary modification to make a mind-boggling diversity 
of compounds. While every living thing makes terpenes, it is the plants 
that make the most diverse and remarkable numbers of compounds.  The
Croteau group is primarily interested in the fascinating enzymes that
synthesize these molecules in plants.  Many of them employ interesting
reactions mechanism which we would like to study at the structure-function
level. This is where a molecular biologist like me fits into this group
that has been traditionally made up of enzymologists, synthetic chemists,
biochemists and analytical chemists. Since many of these compounds are
made in relativly low abundance in plants (the anti-cancer drug taxol is
found in the range of mg taxol/kg tissue) to study these enzymes requires
first identifying the gene that makes the enzyme, then cloning it so the
enzyme can be mass produced in bacteria.  Along the way we have also 
pursued and come across genes with commercial interest.  To date I have
eight patents issued or submitted and my success at identifying these
genes has helped attract more than $2M in industrial contracts for the
lab.  Toot..toot...(that was my own horn).  Ouch...I just  hurt my elbow
trying to
pat myself on my back.  Really though, I am only one part of a very large
research group that has enormous amounts of fun tracking down these really
neat enzymes, which are according to Robert "Bob" Long (AKA Oblong), "the
closest things to magic on the planet."  Living in and around Pullman, we
all get the fantastic luxury of having challenging, interesting work in a
rural academic setting.  I also have the pleasure of calling Rod Croteau,
a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a friend and collegue.  He
is the best damn guy anyone has ever been lucky enough to work with, and
he appreciates the wonderfull synergy that can occur when the right team
of people with diverse backgrounds is assembled and then allowed to
get creative.  I don't know how the science or the people could get any
better.  10234, 10235, 10236, 10237, ...counting my blessings!!!

My lovely wife Kristine, our beautiful daughter Claire, our adorable son
Ben, and I currently
live out in the sticks of rural Pullman. Kristine is lucky enough to be a 
stay at home mom, though she always has something going and never seems to
stay at home.  Claire is just tooo cute.  Ben has a great nature.  We are 
currently breathing life
back into an old farmhouse who's core structure dates to 1878, which makes
it an awfully early structure for this part of eastern Washington.  The
area around the house
is frequented by white-tailed deer, mule deer, the occational elk (all of
which have been taken by bow and arrow, and sometimes a rifle, and put in
the freezer), pheasants, partridge, quail, coyotes,
porcupines, the damned racoons, and over fifty species of common birds. We
have also been fortunate enough to spot bobcats often and cougars
almost too often for comfort, though it is always a joy to see them.  We
maintain a very large garden, but only get to eat what the deer
leave behind.  We live only a few miles "as the crow flies" from the Snake
river and usually take our fair share of crayfish, smallmouth bass and 
steelhead.  The home is defended by a black powder cannon that hurles 
concrete filled
pop cans (got some great video to get linked here) harder, faster, and 
farther than you might think is possible.  If you've never seen a pop can
full of concrete fly well over 500 meters, you've missed one of life's
great pleasures.  It is also kinda fun sometimes to but things in front of
the cannon.</P> <br>
