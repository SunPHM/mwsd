<P>There seems to be a conception amongst many people that the Bass,
<I>Dicentrarchus labrax</I>, is rarely encountered in Scottish seas, with
only a small number of this superb streamlined fish finding their way this
far north.

<P>&nbsp;Before the decline of the species during the the 1970s and 1980s,
bass occurred regularly in the warmer months of the year, in large numbers
along the Solway coast, and were caught by anglers, particularly in Luce
Bay.

<P><B>Summer Migrations</B>

<P>The popular opinion as to why bass occurred along the Solway coast was
that this long length of coast formed an obstacle to their northern summer
migration through the Irish Sea, and very few made the journey further
north through the North Channel.
<BR>&nbsp;When I first visited the coastal areas of the north-west of Scotland
and reflected on the facts of their geographical location, the relative
warmth of the sea due to the near proximity of the Gulf Stream, and the
relative ease for bass to migrate north up the west coast of Ireland in
summer and then head across to the north-west coast of Scotland, I felt
that bass must occur in considerable numbers along the many miles of coast
in this area. Why were they not caught then? Well, most of this coast is
very isolated and never fished, or most of the fishing is geared to catch
common species and not bass.

<P><B>Autumn and Winter Bass</B>

<P>When I moved to south-west Scotland in 1989 the reports I received and
my own experience indicated that the opportunities for catching bass were
not great. However, since then the situation has improved and bass are
now being caught in increasing numbers, although not yet as frequently
as before the decline.

<P>&nbsp;My own experience is of bass occurring from May onwards, but what
is more surprising is that the fish are staying very late in the year.
In 1994 I was catching bass on Luce Bay beaches until just before Christmas
and only bad weather prevented me from fishing after that. I was also informed
about a 6.3 kg (14<I> lb</I>) bass netted offshore just after Christmas
in the previous year. This late occurrence parallels the late occurrence
of Grey Mullet.

<P><B>Northerly Observations</B>

<P>Bass are now to be found in areas where they had never been seen before,
or at best had only occurred as rare oddities. Loch Ryan is the northern
facing twin of Luce Bay. Whereas Luce Bay opens out south into the Irish
Sea, Loch Ryan opens out into the area known as the Lower Clyde. Local
anglers have told me that for the first time in their memory bass are caught
from the west shore of this loch, as well as increased numbers being hooked
by anglers further north along the Ayrshire coast.

<P>&nbsp;However, what is of even more interest is that very small bass
of 170 grams (6 <I>oz</I>.) upwards that are being caught on the storm
beach near Dunnet Head right at the most northerly shores of the Scottish
mainland and near the Kyle of Tongue, a sea loch just to the west. Bass
are also caught off the beautiful shores of the Western Isles.

<P><B>Why?</B>

<P>Why are bass occurring in areas where, even in days past when the total
numbers were far greater, they were rarely to be seen? It has been suggested
that the gradual warming of the seas is the reason. However, the relatively
sudden change makes this an unlikely cause.
<BR>&nbsp;It would be beneficial to know the route taken by these northerly
occurring bass to arrive at areas such as the north of Scotland. Are they
fish that have travelled up the west coast of Ireland, fish that have travelled
through the Irish Sea near the coasts of Ireland or Wales, or even conceivably
fish that have passed through the Straits of Dover and up the North Sea
coast of England and Scotland?

<P>&nbsp;My own limited theory is that the main influence in their success
is the beneficial effects of the warm outlets from power stations that
have been built in recent years, including the nuclear power station at
Heysham in north Lancashire, that provide havens. Shrimp fishermen in Morecambe
Bay have told me of large numbers of tiny bass caught in their nets
<BR>.
<BR>&nbsp;It would be interesting to receive reports from other members
about the occurrence of Bass in Scottish seas. It would be also interested
if a tagging programme could be started on these northern fish so that
we can find out more about their travels and origins.
