    This album could be characterized as the most &#147;specialized&#148; of the three under
    review, for it is concerned with the music of one small island, Biak, that lies just off
    the northern coast of Irian Jaya, Indonesia&#146;s easternmost province. It is a
    co-production with anthropologist Danilyn Rutherford, who conducted fieldwork on Biak in
    the early 1990s and convinced Yampolsky to go there. The two share credit for recording
    the tracks and writing the commentary.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Helvetica">They situate Biak in a long
    history of encounters with outsiders from Europe and other parts of Indonesia&#151;a
    history that continues to unfold as Biak has become one of the main ports of entry by air
    to Indonesia for travelers from North America.</font></td>

    The authors chose to focus on three genres: two contemporary types of song are contrasted
    with the older <b>wor</b> (Audio 1), which the authors characterize as a genre that is
    &#147;in decline&#148; but is still remembered by many.</font> </td>

    The two newer genres, <b>yospan</b> and church songs, which have largely replaced wor at
    celebrations, display ample foreign influence. My comments will be limited to impressions
    of the contrasting sound of these three genres. Most of the album is devoted to wor.
    Seventeen of the twenty-two tracks exemplify this genre. Divided into dance, non-dance,
    and narrative categories, they supply a richer representation of this genre than most
    listeners will probably want or need. Characterized by choral singing (almost exclusively
    male on these tracks) and drumming, the differences between one track and the next are not
    consequential for the uninitiated ear. But the wealth of contextual information provided
    for these songs enables one to appreciate some of their significance. The men form into
    two opposing choruses that compete for attention, one group &#147;beginning their verse
    before the [other] singers are finished, and the [other] singers retaliating to
    &#145;steal back&#146; the song&#148; (liner notes, p. 6). Within each group singers also
    strive to stand out. Rutherford and Yampolsky note the emphasis on variation, the
    importance of travel, and the incorporation of foreign experience.</font> </td>

    The four examples of church songs (Audio 2) offer a stunning contrast to the wor: sung in
    five part harmony by female choirs, these performances are evidence of the deep influence
    of Christianity and the long reach of European missionary and colonial power. Sonically
    beautiful, these tracks closely resemble Christian choral singing from various areas of
    Africa and other parts of the world.</font> </td>

    Yospan</b> (Audio 3), represented by a medley of four songs in the final track on this
    album, is a recent dance genre, created from two other types of dance, one fast and one
    slow. The fascinating history of this hybrid involves government policy, imitations of
    Dutch warplanes, and various other seemingly incongruent elements.</font> </td>

    The dance has apparently become the centerpiece of celebrations. It is accompanied by an
    ensemble of guitars, homemade ukuleles and drums, and a giant </font><img border="0"

    beaten with a stick. This is an amateur form of expression that is open to all members of
    Biak society. The authors offer a highly engaging account of the fluidity of the dance and
    the way that virtually any element can be absorbed into it. They end with the intriguing
    claim that &#147;wor and yospan are based on the same resilient principles. In a
    conventional framework of words (wor) or motions (yospan) both present the foreign as a
    startling source of inspiration to be mobilized and circulated locally. Both genres embody
    the aesthetic of surprise&#148; (liner notes, p. 14).</font> </td>
