<p><b>Nontidal Potomac River:</b> River conditions at the Williamsport Water Treatment 
  Plant are 1.5 feet and holding, cloudy, and 78 degrees Fahrenheit as of July 
  15, 2002. Fishing has been fair with catches of smallmouth bass, walleye, and 
  catfish being reported. In addition to live bait, small tubes and grubs bounced 
  on the bottom have been effective for smallmouth bass. There are a few trophy 
  bass being caught, but most are less than 12 inches. Richard Elliot caught a 
  3 pound, 7.25 ounce smallmouth bass using a hellgrammite in the Conococheague 
  last week. Mike Fiorita, Sr. had a nice one weighing 4 pounds, 7.25 ounces. 
  It was caught below the P.E. Dam on a stonecat. Mark Burgan reeled in a 5 pound, 
  10.5 ounce largemouth bass at Big Pool. Don Cosden of Shady Side, Maryland is 
  pictured on the right with a beautiful smallmouth bass he caught on a recent 
  float trip using a flyrod. A Jim Anderson weighed in a 16 pound 3.75 ounce catfish 
  he caught at Dam 4 on chicken liver. A few other nice whisker fish were also 
  weighed in at a nearby Maryland Sport Fishing Tournament Citation Center.</p>

    Creek Lake (Garrett County): </b>The evening bluegill bite has been great 
    with many 10 to 10.5 inchers being checked in at a nearby Maryland Sport Fishing 
    Tournament Citation Center. Young angler, Jessica Klotz, caught the largest 
    one reported last week to the citation center. It measured 11 inches and was 
    caught on a worm. Worms fished in 3 to 12 feet under the docks has been the 
    ticket. Smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and chain pickerel continued to 
    bite minnows and dark colored tube jigs fished in 10 to 14 feet of water. 
    Ryan Pavol (left) recently caught a 3 pound bass using a Gitzit. The best 
    time to catch them has been in the evening. Fishing for northern pike has 
    been fair with minnows. Places to try include Paradise Point, Green Glade, 
    and North Glade in the grass. Bill Ream of Swanton, Maryland caught a 14 pound, 
    8 ounce northern pike that measured 40 inches. Walleye fishing has been slightly 
    better than for northern pike.</p>
