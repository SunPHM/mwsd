	<td>Mexico bass fishing can be done on the greatest black bass lakes in the 
    world. There are four such lakes on the West coast of Mexico. <b>There is Lake 
    El Salto (size), Lake Agua Milpa, or as some call it just Lake Milpa 
    (numbers), Lake Huites (mainly numbers with a little size) and Lake Baccarac 
    (size).</b> The bass fishing at each Lake is a little different because of the 
    age of each Lake. Generally speaking the older lakes produce larger bass but 
    not quite as many numbers as the newer lakes. A Mexico bass fishing trip to 
    one of these four lakes can make any bass angler’s dream come true. If you 
    are interested in bass fishing Mexico, you can see specific information 
    about each lake by clicking on the appropriate icon.</td>

<p>The East coast of Mexico has two great Lakes for Mexico bass fishing. The 
mother of them all, <b>Lake Guerrero (mainly numbers with a little size)</b>, is still 
producing numbers with an occasional ten-pound plus trophy. Some of the best 
dove, duck and quail hunting in Mexico can be combined with your fishing trip to 
Lake Guerrero. </p>


<p>The newest Mexico bass fishing lake of them all is<b> Lake El Cuchillo 
(numbers)</b>. Lake El Cuchillo is located less than one hundred miles south of the 
Texas/Mexico border. It has been producing some very impressive catches.</p>

	<td><img src="images/mitsy4.jpg" border="0" alt="bass fishing Mexico"></td>
	<td><p>Mexico bass fishing is the best bass fishing in the world for several 
    reasons. The first being the growing season. Because of the warm 
    temperatures enjoyed by most parts of Mexico, the growing season for bass is 
    several months longer than for most areas in the United States. Therefore 
    the bass grow larger faster than they do in the Lakes throughout the United 
    States. The other primary reason is fishing pressure. As a general rule the 
    local population does not take advantage of the great Mexico bass fishing. 
    As a result of that, instead of hundreds of bass boats fishing the Lakes 
    every day as is the case with popular bass lakes in the United States, there 
    will never be over fifty and most of the time under twenty five boats bass 
    fishing a Mexican Lake on any given day. Therefore, the bass have a lot less 
    pressure put on them, which makes bass fishing Mexico the best there is.</p></td>
