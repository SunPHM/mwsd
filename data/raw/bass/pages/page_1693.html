<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>I am Jeff Mitchell and this is my web
page. My involvement in drum and bugle corps dates back to 1965 when I
first joined the Goodwill Ambassadors in my hometown of Newburgh, NY. At
present, I judge music and brass
for DCI.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>The G bugle has a long history and
tradition in American military music and the drum and bugle corps activity.
The bugle was originally designed as a military signaling device and relayed
vital information to the troops in the field. Later the G bugle became
the backbone of the drum and bugle corps activity. My interest in this
was piqued by Drum Corps International's recent adoption of multi-key instruments. Interestingly, my research has shown that multikey bugles were not illegal until the 1950's.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1> The bugle has gone through many changes
in this century and this page will highlight both the instruments and their
importance to the advancement of music and brass playing in drum corps.
There were two basic trends in bugle evolution. The first was to move from
no valves to a fully chromatic bugle. The second was to add larger instruments
with an increased conical bore, which added more voices and colors to the
arranger's arsenal.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>The bugle of choice for American drum and bugle corps was pitched in the key of G. This was the key set in US military regulations like for ease of performance. Bugle calls employ five notes, transposd low C, G, middle C, E and G. On a G instrument, these tones are produced freely without a much strain and can be easily mastered by a novice. Bugles in G, Bb, C, and Eb are all fairly common in the history of the instrument.
The Preston Scout House Bugle Band employed Bb bugles along with an Eb
bass horn on their way to several Canadian national championships and undying
devotion of anyone who saw them perform. Their web site provides a more complete
bugle history.</font></font>

BUGLE</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In the early 20<sup>th</sup>
century the US military bugle was redesigned. It became more cylindrical
and it's bell shape and length closely resemble the trumpet. This allowed
the bugle to achieve greater power and to be employed for increasing use
as a musical instrument. Note the tuning slide which gives indications
that the redesign was for use of multiple bugles or as an addition to military
bands. The use of new radio technology in the battlefield and the changing
the nature of warfare reduced the bugle to a more ceremonial role</font>.</font>

<p><font face="Algerian"><font size=+3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THE DRUM CORPS
MOVEMENT IN AMERICA</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The first drum and bugle
corps appeared at the turn of the century. Chandler's Drum and Bugle Corps
of Beacon, New York was formed in 1903 and was in the vanguard of the movement
that used military instruments to create music. They are still active today
and are one of the oldest drum corps in the country.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The valveless bugle is extremely
limited in terms of musical application. It produces the following notes,
non transposed;</font></font>
<p><font face="Broadview"><font size=+1>C-G-Mid C-E-G-Bb-Hi C-D-E-G</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Algerian"><font size=+3>THE ONE VALVE G-D BUGLE</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The need to provide more
substantial music led to the addition of bugles with a valve pitched in
D. During the first World War, the Bersag Horn became popular with military
bands. It was a Bb brass instrument with a valve that lowered the pitch
a fourth to F. This valve was adopted by drum corps to increase the musical
range of the bugles. During the pre-WWII era bugles were manufactured with
a screw that would actually lock the valve in place. Judges would inspect
the horns prior to performance to insure they were either locked up (G)
or down (D). This photo shows the mechanism on a baritone bugle.</font></font>
<p><a href="http://home.hvc.rr.com/jmitchell1/bug3.jpg">&nbsp;<font face="Bazooka">valve
locking mechanism</font></a>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Initially corps played fanfares
and other bugle type music and alternated between the G horns with the
valve up and the D horns with their valves locked down. The music of drum
corps was largely fanfares. A section would be played on the open horns
and then repeated by the horns with the valves locked down. Songs could
only be played by the alternation of pitches between the two instruments,
somewhat like a bass drum section does today in modern drum corps. The
impracticality of this scenario, two bugles to play one melody was remedied
by the freeing of a D valve to the G. This added enough notes to allow
simple arrangements.</font></font>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font face="Algerian"><font size=+3>THE FREEING OF THE VALVE</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>A major step forward in the
history of drum corps was the decision to allow movement of the valve during
competition. This occurred during the 1940's. Once the American Legion
and VFW allowed free use of the valve, almost immediately corps began to
look for the "missing" notes. Arrangers struggled to write music, given
the non-chromatic nature of the instruments. The tricks used to work around
the inadequacies of the instrument were a source of pride.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The tuning slide was seen
as a device to gain additional notes from the bugles. The VFW allowed the
slide to be employed in 1949 and the American Legion followed a few years
later. This was remedied by the use of the tuning slide to lower the instrument
a semi-tone or half-step. This was done by using an emory cloth or other
abrasive material, and turning the tuning slide into a "slip-slide" as
it was referred to by the corps. The slip-slide was used in a trombone-like
fashion with the left hand. It was a complex movement to throw the slide
back with the fingers of the left hand and catch it with the thumb and
shoot it back to the closed position. This had to be done while supporting
the horn with your right hand and using your thumb on the valve.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>In order to make it a bit
easier, bugle makers changed the configuration with the male-female setup
on the tuning slide. The lower portion of the slide had a ring and it portion
of the tubing coming from the mouthpiece went inside the slide, rather
than over it.</font></font>

C-C#-D-Eb-E-F-F#-G-Ab-A-Bb-B-hi C</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>This allowed corps to play
far more complex music, although it was limited to a few keys. You can
see why drum corps sound became unique. One needed to play much higher
than the conventional brass voices of a band or orchestra, as the missing
notes forced the melodies into the upper register.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The rotary valve was legalized
in the mid 1950's. In fact, it was legal in the mid 1950's to have 2 valves.
The only problem was only one could be vertical. In the mid-60's, the first
DCA Champion Reading Buccaneers, played 2 valve sopranos. Both valves were
horizontally mounted and played with two thumbs. It was fairly difficult
to play and march and the valve-rotor combination became the standard configuration
of the day.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The Getzen Company manufactured
3 different rotors. For soprano, tenors, french horns, and contras, you
could get a rotor in either F# or F. The bass baritone,&nbsp; with it's
10 inch bell, had replaced the smaller baritone and was available with
a rotor in F#, F, or E. To give the possible note combinations would be
rather confusing. The slides in F and E were not widely employed. There
was some experimentation with a few F and E rotors in the 3rd sections
to get missing notes. However, it was more confusing than helpful.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The drum corps activity quickly
grew in popularity and corps sprung up primarily in the eastern seaboard
and great lakes area of the mid-west. Churches, scout troops, veteran's
organization all began to sponsor corps. The limitations of having only
one brass voice to choose from, soprano, was overcome by the addition of
the french horn bugle and tenor bugle. This added lower voices to the bugle
choir and corps began to really begin to make music.</font></font>

closer together. This allowed melodies spanning the register from G to
