  The Opheclide served as a tenor/bass pitched transition instrument between
 the keyless and keyed Serpents of the 1700s and the valved lower brass instruments 
of the mid 1800s. The idea came from the keyed bugles first invented in 1817 
in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first Opheclide was patented in 1821 in France
and a version was still listed in the French Cousenon catalog of 1910.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Essentially it is a tapered tube about 8 feet in length and pitched in C (or
sometimes in Bb) with a bell about the size and shape of a alto or baritone 
horn.&nbsp; They usually have 9 keys placed so the player can open and close 
a&nbsp; single or combination of large holes in the tubing - using two hands- 
much like the saxophones of today- but with the air column vibrations coming 
from the players lips using a euphonium size mouthpiece.&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher 
(alto) and lower (contrabasse) versions were also made.&nbsp;       
      <p>This particular opheclide came from Tony Bingham's shop in the UK- 
who doubted whether he could restore it - it was in really tough shape.&nbsp;
It has no markings, but is probably French - circa. 1850. I&nbsp; bought
it and brought it back to my brass repairman&nbsp; in Bangkok. He had never
seen one before, but since it worked essentially like a strange looking saxaphone, 
he called on his woodwind talents and fully restored it to playing condition!&nbsp; 
When I play it, it sounds like a sick cow- but Chuck Dallenbach of the Canadian 
Brass had a go at it and played some easily recognizable tunes!!!&nbsp; The 
sound is not particularly mellow, but there are&nbsp; still some serpent /
opheclide ensembles who play period pieces.&nbsp;</p>
