Great, of course - maybe for the new album, I thought. But they needed it really quickly, so I did it from home, by ftp, (which is the way I play on a lot of projects nowadays.)<br> Then, only a week ago Friday, I was asked if I could come to Italy to play a show with Peter. Not realizing what that show was, I sadly declined, because I had a record session (a great one, with Paula Cole, booked on Friday the 10th.) Imagine my surprise, coming home from New York on Friday night, to hear from friends (who saw the opening ceremony on Canada tv earlier than it was aired here in the U.S) that the &quot;show&quot; of Peter's was performing <i>Imagine</i> for about the biggest tv audience conceivable! <br>E-mails started coming in about 3 minutes after it aired, asking whether it was me, and if not, why!<br>Alas, it's typical of me that I hadn't asked what the show would be, and typical of Peter that he hadn't mentioned it. But, oh, the photos I'd have up on the site for you if I'd been there! Not to mention the fun of being back in Italy. <br>It did seem to me (as people pointed out on the Guestbook page) that it was David Rhodes playing an NS Upright bass (which I'd done the track on.) And it sounded like that part of the track was indeed my playing - hard to be sure from a tv set. I'll surely ask David when I see him - I'm sure there'll be great stories from the event, not the least of it his feelings about being setup as a moustache-less Tony!<br>And, in the big picture, I'm very happy to be a part of Paula's new recording - so I've got no complaints.<br><br>There, I've explained it!<br>Coming up this week: I may sit in with the California Guitar Trio at BB King's in NYC on Wednesday. And I'll be with Jim Weider's band at Ram's Head in Anapolis, on Saturday. In between I'll be trying to arrange a second barbershop quartet for my upcoming tour. (And fielding e-mails asking <i>Was that you in Torino?)</i>!!<br><br><br><b>Feb 10, New York</b><br><br>In the city again to do some sessions. The Lewis Taylor show was terrific - I imagine some of you caught him on the Conan O'Brian Show. Funny how massive television is - one appearance is bigger than all the live shows you'll ever do. So there's no considering Lewis a cult artist or unknown gem once he's been on national television. He certainly deserves the exposure and success, but... there's still a part of me that wishes only I and my friends knew how great he is.<br><br>The Uncle Funk show at New World Home Cooking had, predictably, a great meal for us beforehand - the photo at right shows the Levin brothers flanking my friend and neighbor Bruce, who sat in on bass for a couple of songs. Also pictured, a photo (only slightly doctored) from the Cynthia Dillenbeck session did, and photos from Aaron Comess (drummer with Spin Doctors) solo album, which also had guitarist Bill Dillon. I'd like to see a concert with Bill Dillon, Dylan, Cynthia Dillenbeck and Beck. Why did I write that?<br><br>*Letters to my Guestbook page have revealed a better way I could have written it: a concert with Dylan, Beck, Dillenbeck, Dillon and Beck(Jeff).<br><br>Jim Weider band has a show coming up at the Ram's Head in Anapolis, on Feb 18th. After that it'll be band rehearsals for the Tony Levin Band, cause we're hitting the road from the CD release on April 4th. I'll post the shows, of course, as they're booked. Italy shows, in early May, are just about booked now. We're looking at more of Europe for May, with U.S. touring in April and then June onward. <br><br><br><b>Jan 25, Kingston</b><br><br>Jeesh, I just read the diary entry I wrote two days ago - terrible grammar. I thought I was beyond writing with so many silly mistakes. Wrong.<br>So I've cleaned up the four uses of &quot;well...&quot; and corrected at least some of the misspellings. That reminds me, yesterday while reading a science magazine I realized I'd misspelt <i>chromosome</i> in the the package notes of my upcoming cd. Plenty of time to correct that, though - and, hey, you've got to love a song that has <i>chromosome</i> in the lyrics!<br><br><br><b>Jan 23, New York</b><br><br> I am sure you know this feeling - you've got a favorite singer and album, and very few people know how great the guy is - you tell your friends, and they become  fans too, but still it's like a secret you share because for some reason the public doesn't know how great the artist is.<br><br>  Well, that's the way it is for me, with Lewis Taylor. Musicians shared his early cd with me years ago, and he's got a following among players, but hasn't caught on  in a big way with the public (at least I think so - he is based in England, and I certainly don't hear much about him here in America, except from my friends.)<br> Lewis is playing in NYC this week - his first ever U.S. show, and it's a big event for us who love his work. Actually I've no idea how the live show will  be like, his albums are homemade with his playing all the instrument and doing multi-vocals. He's an awesome singer, with a great soul feel, but not afraid to  throw in really weird chord progressions. And his bass parts are unique - an inspiration to me. <br><br>  I'll report on how that show is - it's rare that I go out to shows  - I wonder if it'll be all muso's in the audience!<br><br>  I did a nice album a few weeks back with singer/guitarist Paul Mutimear. Then travelled to Kentucky where my friend Ronan Chris Murphy was doing a progressive album  in a new studio, Saint Claire - great great layout, with a big room, lots of nice gear, and 4 bedrooms for the band to stay in. We had the usual lineup Ronan  uses when he's producing: Pat Mastelotto on drums and Mike Keneally on.. keyboards (he often plays guitar.) I'll throw some photos up on the right, of the studio  and it's candelabra. (don't believe I ever had need to write that word before!)<br><br>  Came back to NYC for a cool recording session with singer Cynthia Dillenbeck, and my old friend Joe Bonadio on drums. Nice music. I got too engrossed  in the music  to take  photos. I have to shake myself back into the old habits of taking lots of photos - these diaries don't express things as well as photos.<br><br> Then I met up with Sasha - our Russian promotor, who is in NY for a week, with the band he manages, Huun-huur-tu (Tuvan throat singers.) I didn't get to see the band, but did get to drink quite a bit of pepper vodka (even introduced Sasha to my homemade concoction: PepLevska !) <br><br>And on Friday night there was a Jim Weider gig in NYC - we've played a few times now at the Cutting Room, down in the West 20's. Nice place.<br><br>Now, headed back home to do some home-made bass parts on albums - seems there's a lot more of that nowadays, and actually it's getting to be a rare pleasure to be in a big studio with other musicians! Coming up soon, updates on the Lewis Taylor gig, and Uncle Funk in Woodstock's New World Home Cooking.<br><br><br>  <b><i>Recent releases Tony played on:</i></b> <br><br>Steve Howe
