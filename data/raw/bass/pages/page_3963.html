The primary design goal for FOSUT was to keep the ongoing administration of an online shop as simple as possible while presenting the shop in an attractive, professional and practical manner to your customers. </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>There are four characteristics that combined together give your shop its appearance: </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph><STRONG><EM>Shop Style </EM></STRONG></DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph><STRONG><EM>Presentation Style </EM></STRONG></DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph><STRONG><EM>General Pages </EM></STRONG></DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph><STRONG><EM>Default Page </EM></STRONG></DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>The <STRONG>Shop Style </STRONG>are the colours and the imagery used within the shop.As part of the initial design and build of your shop our artists will take any existing logos or imagery you use and apply it to the online shop. This acts as a template that all your shop details have applied to them. You will never have to design a button in an art package or design backgrounds and set colours and fonts just to add a new category of products to your shop - just type in the name of the category and the Shop Style will automatically be applied. </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>While FOSUT is primarily focused on displaying product information you still need to show more general information - who you are, where you are, your terms and conditions, why its safe to shop with you. In fact, these <STRONG>General Pages </STRONG>are needed for every site and we build them for you. You can of course alter these and add new ones. If you want to add a Mug Shots page with pictures of your staff then you can, if you are members of organisations or provide services then these could be added as well. </DIV> <IMG align=left src="/gfx/pubcosmall.jpg"><DIV class=Paragraph>A choice of two <STRONG>Presentation Styles </STRONG>allows you to list products in detail, with pictures and descriptions or you can provide a simple tabular list (as shown in <A href="http://www.pubco.co.uk/" target=content>Pubco</A>, left). These styles can be combined so that thousands of commodities can be listed where no picture or description is needed (but can still be provided for special cases) and specialised products can be provided with large pictures and detailed descriptions, all within the same shop. There are extra levels of control within the products themselves. Products can optionally have stock levels and availability dates. Products may have variations - for instance a product may have variations by Size and by Colour (and the unique Colour / Size combination can even have a unique price, stock level and availability date). You can even have products that you don’t sell online - you can specify an Information button to be shown instead of an Add to basket button allowing you to advertise items you wouldn’t normally sell mail order (like a yacht or a house!). </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>When a customer first sees your online shop they will see the <STRONG>Default Page </STRONG>first. The default page can be any page in you shop - it could be a general page telling the customer about you, or it could be a products pages, maybe your special offers. </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>With the custom artwork, flexible presentation of products, any number of general pages and the choice of default page you can achieve the look you want for your shop. Changing this look is simple so you can keep your site fresh and interesting to regular customers and you can control the look without being a Web guru. </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>If any of this sounds complicated, its not, and don’t forget we set everything up so you’ll only need to make small changes. Anyway we’ll show how it all works in person and we have full online help complete with videos showing examples of all the tasks. </DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>[<A href="contactus.htm" target=content>Contact us...</A>]</DIV> <DIV class=Paragraph>[<A href="products.htm" target=content>Back to Products...</A>]</DIV> <DIV class=copyright>Sea Bass Software,<BR>Fitting the pieces together.</DIV> </BODY></HTML>
