	Dave Maize acoustic bass guitar</h3>
    <p>
    Dave Maize is an Oregon luthier who specializes in acoustic bass
    guitars.  His instrument was reviewed in the December 1993 issue of Bass
    Player magazine, so I'll avoid duplicating the information presented in
    that review.  Maize's instruments are top-quality in craftsmanship,
    appearance and sound.  Woods used for the instruments are either
    recycled or from controlled-yield sources.
    </p>

    <h3>Dimensions</h3>
    <p>
    The 34-inch-scale instrument has a 24-fret neck, roughly
    1-9/16" (39.6mm) wide at the nut and 2-3/8" (60.3mm) at the 24th fret.
    The neck joins the body at the 16th fret, which for me made the
    cut-away body option unnecessary.  (The cut-away extends to the 21st
    fret).  The large body has a rounded back, and its waist is narrower
    than the traditional dreadnought shape.  Body dimensions are approximately
    21-1/4" (53.9cm) long, 18" (45.7mm) wide and 5-34" (146mm) depth; overall
    length from headstock to "tail" is 48-3/4" (123.8cm).
    Weight is slightly over 6 pounds (2.7kg).
    <p>

    <h3>Pricing</h3>
    <p>
    See Dave Maize's <a href="http://www.maizeguitars.com">home page</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    (*) The standard inlay is a 1" (25mm) circular figured burlwood insert with
    a decorative inlaid border.
    </p>

    <p>
    Your choice of woods does not generally add
    to the price, though there may be exceptions.
    </p>

    <p>
    My bass has a Bigleaf Maple back and
    sides, mahogany neck, western red cedar top, Highlander pickup/preamp,
    thumbrest, locking gold Sperzel tuners, and custom hard case.
    </p>

    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>
    The overall workmanship is superb.  The body binding inlay
    work is wonderful (a three-part binding using walnut, a black stripe
    and a light-colored wood).  The cross-grain figuring of the Bigleaf
    Maple gives the body a velvety textured appearance below the perfectly
    smooth clear finish.
    </p>

    <p>
    Dave chose Katalox (pronounced "KAT-a-losch"), a Yucatan wood, for the
    fingerboard and bridge.  Katalox is a hard, dark wood similar to ebony
    but it isn't endangered.  The rounded jumbo frets are perfectly set
    with no gaps or sharp edges at the edge of the fingerboard.  The
    instrument arrived well setup with nearly perfect intonation; though
    I'm a stickler for exact intonation, it isn't easy to achieve with the
    fixed saddle.  All I had to do was tune up.  The neck is finished with
    a slight gloss; this will burnish nicely to a smoother satin finish
    with playing.  The nut is made of "Tusq," a synthetic ivory product.
    The locking Sperzel tuners and the
    slip-in bridge allow for easy changing of strings, especially to
    achieve a different sound.  Position markers are inlaid along the side
    of the fingerboard; there are none on the face of the board.
    </p>

    <h3>Tone and Playability</h3>
    <p>
    Tone is very mellow, with the expected acoustic snappiness, but it
    isn't overly strident.  Plugged in, the Highlander pickup transmits
    this acoustic tone without adding color &#151; the instrument's sound gets
    louder with amplification, without sounding like an electric.  Dave
    advises that as the finish and the wood age, the low tone will improve
    further.
    </p>

    <p>
    My first live use of the instrument was for an electric rock/country gig
    (two electric guitars and drums).  Sound was fine; the phosphor-bronze
    strings had more than enough treble to cut thru the mix.  Feedback only
    occurred when I faced my amp within a couple of feet, and then only if
    I wasn't muting the strings with my hand.  Because the instrument's
    deep body positions the neck farther from my body, I'm getting used to
    playing without seeing any strings except the low E.  And, though I
    have long arms, my right hand is more "hooked" to reach around the big
    body to the strings.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also played unplugged at an acoustic rehearsal session, with two
    acoustic guitars, flute/sax and fiddle/mandolin (all unplugged, of
    course).  Though I would have preferred to hear myself better, I was
    told that the instrument easily projected about 8 feet to the far side
    of the circle of musicians, and I got compliments on the
    tone.  I was playing harder than I normally would on an electric, but
    fatigue didn't become noticeable until after about three hours.
    </p>

    <h3>The Electronics</h3>
    <p>
    The Highlander IP-1 pickup consists of a coaxial pressure transducer
    "probe" installed in the bridge saddle, and a handmade solid-state
    preamp contained in a metal tube which serves as the output jack and
    strap pin combination.  This pickup, I'm told, comes from US submarine
    sensor technology, adapted to musical use.  Boasting a 100dB dynamic
    range, the Highlander's frequency response is flat from 10Hz to over
    800KHz!  (Yes, eight-hundred.)  It's powered by a single 9-volt battery
    installed in a flip-out compartment (earlier instruments located the
    battery inside, definitely less convenient).  The preamp, which has no
    controls, has circuitry to automatically adjust the transistor bias to
    compensate for ambient temperature and battery voltage.
    </p>

    <h3>You Got Some Case</h3>
    <p>
    The custom hard case is also impressive.  This Fort-Knox of a case is
    made from plywood and covered with black canvas material (I think Dave
    said they call it "Bull Hide.)  It's lined with a burgundy "fur" (from
    what kind of animal?) and it weighs an astonishing 18 pounds (8.1kg)
    empty.  The case snugly and securely holds the instrument, latching
    with five gold-tone steel latches (one has a keyed lock).  Although
    it's heavy to carry, I doubt there will be any worry about damage (but
    it isn't ATA-rated so it can't be trusted with baggage handlers).
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <p>
    I'm sure I've forgotten something, but I'll wrap up by
    again saying that this is one sweet bass.  Since there's always got to
    be a complaint, my only one is that Dave Maize's delivery schedule was
    difficult to endure.  His original delivery estimate on my May 28th order
    was November 1994
    (about five months) due to a small backlog, but events stretched things
    out until February
    1995. (Dave attributed part of the delay to the time he spent building
    a new spray booth along the way.)  Even under ideal working conditions,
    it takes about three months to complete an instrument.  Add in the
    realities of other orders, a sensible work schedule and some time spent
    managing business issues, and it's easy to understand a six-month
    delivery estimate.  On the positive side, it's a way to
    budget the purchase price over the longer time.
    </p>

    <p>
    I currently play this bass almost exclusively for folk gigs, because it
    looks as well as sounds perfect for acoustic music.  I tend to play it
    in the style of a string bass (which I've never played), capitalizing on
    the initial "boom" of the instrument.  Naturally, its sustain when amplified
    extends far longer than that of an upright bass.  For practice sessions,
    it's nice to be able to travel light and play without aid of electrons.
    </p>

    <p>
    Dave Maize sells direct, so you can't try one of his instruments before
    buying, unless you're lucky enough to catch him at a music show or know
    an owner; as a result, he allows a two-week full-refund trial period.
    The instrument carries a lifetime original-owner warranty.
