		1</b>
</p>
		<p>How is it that two responsible women with master's degrees in public 
		health can let it all go to hell so fast? </p>
		<p>Maria and I set out from Rochester today about 9 AM and arrived at 
		our cabin at Christie Lake about one-ish. We hadn't done much 
		planning... bedding... cameras... lawn chairs... fishing gear... coffee 
		maker... CD player... and an agreement that we would not bring candy but 
		would bring chips, salsa, and fresh guacamole. A stop at the duty-free 
		at the Canadian border got us stocked up with liquor and, okay, we did 
		wind up buying a couple of bars of Cadbury chocolate, but only because 
		we were hungry and what better to go with mugs of coffee?</p>
		<p>We toasted our arrival with rum and Diet Coke (uh-oh, no ice in the 
		freezer) then went to pick up our motor boat. The lake was calm and 
		deserted. Perfect.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>About 4 we set off on our first fishing excursion, only half 
		organized (and half in the bag). Maria caught a fish, but it swallowed 
		her hook and had to be cut off the line. Oops, forgot to bring any extra 
		tackle with us, so that was that. Then my straw hat flew off into the 
		water, allowing us to demonstrate our dexterous boating skills in 
		rescuing it before it sank. A little more challenging was the fact that 
		the gas line kept falling out of the motor: a survival crisis on that 
		deserted lake. We had enough moxy to figure out how it attached, but not 
		enough to keep it attached. Back at the dock, Maria hailed a 
		bare-chested young buck to problem-solve for us. Unfortunately his 
		little woman arrived swiftly behind him to assure he didn't get carried 
		away by the distressed damsels.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Over supper we switched to Maria&#8217;s pinot grigio. Supper 
		consisted of tortilla chips out of the bag, with scoops of guacamole, 
		while we stood around the kitchen gossiping and listening to music. </p>
		<p>But the day's adventures weren't over. We got out the video recorder 
		and began our trip documentary, interviewing each other out on the dock 
		and then figuring out how to use the night shot mode to do taping after 
		dark.* Our blue plastic wine cups were never empty. Hey, let's get some 
		footage of Maria in the boat... okay, great... oh SHIT! Maria falls 
		overboard. Do I panic? Hell, no. I just keep filming.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>Hours later: I wake Maria from a sound snooze on the couch to take 
		our blue wine cups over to the bonfire next store. Happy Canadians... 
		happy Babes in Boyland. </p>

		Day 2</b> </p>
		<p>Our plan to start the morning's fishing with a Thermos of coffee + 
		Bailey's vanished with the pounding in our heads and the queasiness in 
		our stomachs.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>At Maria&#8217;s party in the fall, we'd set the standard that a good 
		drinker could sustain a fine buzz without crossing the line to stupidity 
		or nausea. Today we can swear to each other that we did nothing stupid 
		(falling out of the boat was just a little clumsiness &#8211; the landlubber 
		finding her sea legs sort of thing) and neither of us threw up, but we 
		had muffed our opportunity to sustain a 48-hour buzz. We hit the high 
		seas this morning toting only bitter coffee. </p>
		<p>Whatever, we proved ourselves to be worthy fisherwomen, filling the 
		day with three sorties out in the boat, this time with all the right 
		equipment -- including the video camera. I'd been worried about my 
		extravagance in buying a $70 waterproof case for the camera, but saw 
		immediately how wise it was as we piled into the boat. Later, when my 
		own sea legs betrayed me and I went sprawling along the dock, video case 
		flying ahead of me, I was also happy for all the foam padding inside.
		</p>
		<p>Our first two trips out we were hauling in the bass &#8211; better at 
		catching than releasing. There are a lot of bass out there today with 
		brain damage from too much air and concussions from flopping around on 
		the bottom of the boat. </p>
		<p>So we were pretty good with the worms. Now for bigger challenges. 
		Malone, for a laugh, had found a book for us at a flea market: <i>
		Advanced Bass Fishing Techniques</i>. We studied. We prepared our 
		artificial baits and our shimmery plugs. And there it was that we came 
		splat up against the boundary of our skill. The same fish who went crazy 
		for our worms looked askance at our poor excuses for injured minnows and 
		whatever it is pumpkin-seed-flavored plastic is supposed to be mistaken 
		for. </p>
		<p>Satisfied that we had finally entered our incompetence zone, we 
		headed back to the cabin and opened a can of Chickarina soup for the 
		first non-tortilla-chip meal of the trip and poured our first glass of 
		wine of the day. </p>

		Day 3</b> </p>
		<p>Yesterday we faced the shallowness of our fishing competence: &quot;good 
		with worms.&quot; This morning our last outing made us face the shallowness 
		of another skill: boating. </p>
		<p>The lake level is down -- the propeller on the motor digs into the 
		sandy bottom at the docks, so you need to paddle the boat out before you 
		get her started. Easy if the air is still. But today a stiff breeze was 
		blowing into shore. We jumped into the boat and took our usual seats, me 
		at the stern preparing to start the motor, and Maria up front, untying 
		us, and seated facing me. We shoved off, using our paddles in our 
		typical half-assed way, a little poling, a little rowing. I'm bad at 
		rowing but Maria doesn't have a clue. We'd get ourselves past the end of 
		the dock, I'd start the motor (which always took several tries for me), 
		it would stall out and sure enough we'd be grounded again. The more we 
		tried, the worse we got. We looked around for someone to help &#8211; yes, we 
		were willing to play the damsels-in-distress card again &#8211; but there 
		wasn't a soul in sight (probably because our Canadian friends had 
		partied till 5 AM outside our windows). </p>
		<p>About this time I got the little voice in my head: <i>Give up, go 
		home, you've had a great weekend, this is too hard, you have so many 
		other things you could do today, give up, give up, give up</i>. This is 
		the voice of Lazy Susan, not Susan The Great Dame. We shouldn't give up, 
		but clearly we weren't going anywhere. </p>
		<p>&quot;All right, this isn't working,&quot; I said to Maria. &quot;What d'ya say we 
		tie up, go in and pack, and maybe the breeze will die down?&quot; </p>
		<p>It was a plan. We packed up, put everything in the car, swept the 
		sand out of the cottage, and brought our trash to the recycling shed.<br>
		The air had warmed, but the breeze was still strong and Maria was still 
		game. I was pessimistic. What to do... what to do... Ah! Of course! We 
		needed... a strategy! </p>
		<p>&quot;Ok, here's what...&quot; I said and we proceeded to work out a 
		coordinated and disciplined approach to paddling the damn boat out as 
		far as our girlish shoulders and bad technique would take us to buy 
		enough time to drift during the inevitable motor stall-outs. </p>
		<p>We did it. </p>
		<p>Off we roared for another couple hours of good-with-worms bass 
		fishing. Maria landed her Big One of the weekend. Of course, we nearly 
		killed the poor thing, trying to get the hook out of his mouth. It 
		became a project. Both of us grappled with the unlucky beast -- and 
		managed to keep taping video all the while. By the time we got the hook 
		out, he was moribund and I remembered reading in a book about rocking a 
		fish back and forth in the water to get some oxygen through his gills. 
		After long minutes of swishing him around in my net, he swam away. </p>
		<p>Success. The Babes in Boyland left Christie Lake and Canada feeling 
		like Great Dames.</p>
