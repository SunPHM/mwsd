From time to time </BIG></B>Bass Inside Magazine will present bassists that might not fit easily into mainstream music. We will feature artists and players that might not otherwise find their way onto other music magazines as the cover story. One of the best things about being an online music magazine is that our cover stories are not tied into keeping advertiser support. The artists are there simply because they deserve to be. </P>

<P>The irony of this is that more often than not these bassists are the ones that can teach you the most, causing you to question not only how you view your instrument but also how you see yourself and your world. 
</P>

<P>Now for those who feel that the way to measure eligibility for Cover Story position, for those who need facts and a chronology, just visit Jonas Hellborg's website. For the rest of you, come with us and meet an absolute original!

<P><B>Bass Inside:</B> In doing research for this talk, I got the sense that you are of a mind that the more one describes something, the more one tries to place it into a box to show others, the less likely they are to capture the essence at all. The box of description, of identification, inevitably alters the thing described. 
</P>


<P><B>Jonas Hellborg: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">I am just a mirage, a reflection of who and what has passed through my life. If you look or listen hard enough you'll discover where I've been, and if you do not recognize the places you can read about them in my music. 
</FONT></P>

<P><P><B>Bass Inside:</B> You've mentioned in earlier interviews that at the beginning of your career, finding yourself on a magazine was 'fun', it satiated the ego, something any musician surely has, regardless of how they might deny it. It has been said that "if you poke any saint deeply enough, you touch self-interest". 
</P>


<P><B>Jonas Hellborg: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">Survival instinct I suppose. We do have an automatic instinct to protect and defend our perceived identities.
</FONT></P>

<P>In these early years, as mentioned, it must have been a kick to have played the Rock Star for a while.
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Attention feels good, it always does. Whether it is from your mother or admiring fans. It gives you a sense of security.
</FONT></P>

<P>Now, with the release of <i>ICON</i>, we find you on the cover of a magazine again. If the youthful 'kick' is no longer needed, what would the motivation be at this point in your life? 
</P>


<P><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="hellborgcd.gif" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="140"><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="140"><FONT COLOR="blue">Same as it ever was, turn the rock over and see what you find.
</FONT></P>

<P>Would you say that the paths you chose never gave you stupendous wealth from the position of money without end, but the rewards from your choices gave you much much more, manna for the soul, so to speak. 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">That is a matter of perception. Life flows, you can pick out almost any event and prescribe importance to it and it can be defendable as such. And I suppose that every moment of our existence influences every other moment of our existence, both past and present.</br clear="right"></p>

<p>Our psyches are so multi-dimensional on top of that. If I make a decision today the actual decision could derive from an event that happened when I was 5 years old, but only manifests itself at this age. </p>

<p>Regarding compensation for a chosen path I would say this...the real issue is, who are you? If you have the courage to be who you are, as much as you are able to perceive who you are, then you do not really have many choices. </p>

<p>And on top of that, material rewards are sort of overrated. A tomato does not taste any better because it is served on a golden plate in a palace. The amount of money you need to fulfill your material needs and the desires that are truly yours (and not some sort of social show-off manifestation) is really not great. </p>

<p>What you really need is a discipline for your journey into your true identity and, as Joseph Campbell put it, to "follow your bliss". 
</FONT></P>

<P>What kind of impact have experiences and influences drawn from different projects had on you as a person, a musician, a bassplayer and a composer etc? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">There is no difference between all of these. It is all the same thing. I am my experiences. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Do influences from special social traditions, belief systems, religions you have witnessed inspire you to compose and play in particular ways? (What invokes this question are those pieces of yours that use Indian Raga as the tonal parameter) 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">The World/Universe/Capacity of existence is chaos. In order to deal with it we give its different aspects names. In different cultures you have different languages, but it is all the same set of experiences. Once you're in the experience nothing is different and there are no more languages.
</FONT></P>

<P>Many musicians are moved to travel outside their safe and established area of expertise, falling on their faces, oft times sounding contrived and clearly out of place. Examples of this are the army of musicians who embraced World Music simply to ride a popularity wave, or rock musicians who, upon reaching the age of 50, suddenly imagine themselves driven to portray themselves as traditional jazz and smooth jazz experts. You have somehow managed to dance across various styles, different genres convincingly, without artiface, somehow sounding like you belong precisely where you are at that time. 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I am a tourist. I do not wear a funny hat when I go to an Indian restaurant for a meal. I know who my parents are. I know where I grew up. I know what my first language is. That gives me a point of reference. </p>

<p>I do not pretend to play Indian music, but I can play with Indian musicians and understand them enough to have a worthwhile exchange. The same with classical music, Jazz, African Music Chinese music. </p>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="hellborgnband.jpg" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="123" alt="Jonas with Indian Band live"></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT COLOR="red"><I>Jonas and the band behind ICON</I></FONT COLOR></P>


<p>Basically I do not pretend to be something that I am not. At the same time I know what I like. I am not going to avoid playing Bach just because Glenn Gould played Bach a 100 million times greater than I could ever possibly dream of playing it. The truth is it still gives me pleasure, so I will do it. </p>

<p>The fundamental idea I guess is pretty anti-elitist. The truth is, I would rather hear somebody who can't sing but who really enjoys singing than somebody who is really developed but has lost the passion. Everybody can play or sing, it is just a matter of how much and if you dare to be who you are (again). 
</FONT></P>

<P>How do you research and define your role as a musician playing an instrument in styles of music where there is, by convention, no role for a bassist at all? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I do not see myself primarily as a bassist or even a musician. I am a human being interacting with other beings (human and other). There is no role for a Swedish speaker in an Arab society. I can still go there and interact. 
</FONT></P>

<P>It would seem to take a level of deep respect for these styles of music, a reverence for their antiquity and authenticity and a fair bit of understanding or empathy towards it, to find a method to include but not intrude in this artform. 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Well, let's make a comparison with ancient artifacts. We take a geographical point where there are people living who do not really care about broken pieces of clay in the ground. You send in the boys from the British Museum who collect and basically steal these 2000 year old treasures. This means nothing to the culture it has been stolen from but it is incredibly valuable in our own culture. </P>

<P>A moral dilemma, but how do you solve it? In music we deal with human beings and their perception of reality. We really only deal with history if it is important to living people that are affected by our actions. </P>

<P>We live now, we play now: If I play with a musician who believes that the note C means "Your mother is a donkey", then I will not use that note. Again it is "I am what and who I am". You are who and what you are. Let's find a common ground and avoid stepping on each others toes. What you do is as worthwhile as what I do. That includes scientists, garbage men, kings and prostitutes. 
</FONT></P>



<P>Would you say that involving yourself with ethnic music is something you have to govern yourself carefully with, embracing the music and not treading like an elephant in a rose garden? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">We all have a definite position in the world. So we all see the world from a specific angle. My angle is no more accurate than yours. Knowing that you can not maintain, however convinced you are about the correctness of your observations, that Ahmeds observations are any less true or correct. From that comes respect for others. 
</FONT></P>

<P>We imagine you must feel a big difference between your role as a player in the early projects in your career and with your more recent ones (i.e the McLaughlin Band in comparison to your duo with Glen Velez). If so, can you describe this difference? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">We are born in a fog. As we grow older the fog clears. There is a naive enthusiasm when you are young that you can't  achieve as much as an old fart, so there are different qualities in all the stages of your life.
</FONT></P>

<P>Did you ever feel that you were led by the music?
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I was led by life. 
</FONT></P>

<P>I imagine that the days of playing fast merely to impress are long since over for you, so really 'pouring it on', fast for fast's sake, would seem like child-like behavior to you. However, some songs cry for an adrenaline rush given only by mile-a-minute flurries of notes. Therefore, how do you determine when to pour it on or when to just let the song breathe? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">It is like f***ing. When you want to come you increase the speed of your gyrations. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Can you describe how you approach composition? For example, on an earlier recording, <i>Roman</i>, do you recall which came first, the melody, the harmony, the rhymical pulse, or did it flow into your awareness intact, as one complete ribbon of thought? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Music creation, whether you want to label it composition or improvisation, is really to get out of your own way. It is really there all the time, if you will only let it happen to you.</p> 

<p>I cannot honestly say that I ever wrote anything, it is just stuff that already exists, reflected through me, so it looks a little bit different than if it was reflected through you.</P>

<p>There is nothing new, it is only a matter of what you like. You can make an incredible pasta sauce out of garlic, olive oil, tomatoes and basil. You can mix the whole thing together in a pot, but you had no part in the coming to existence of the ingredients or their individual qualities or their effect on us, so what did you create? </p>

<p>Nothing! You have simply discovered that if you make this combination, it tastes good. Music is the same thing. If you mix this with that it sounds good. It is discovery. 
</FONT></P>

<P>What qualifies as a well-rounded song for you? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Whatever makes me feel something. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Is a song ever truly completed for you and are you in a perpetual state of chasing that completion? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">What we call songs are just snapshots of our vanity at a certain point in time. "I existed and here is the proof." The idea of songs or compositions is not holy to me.
</FONT></P>

<P>Your acoustic bass guitar sound is extraordinarily crisp, (is it still the Wechter acoustic bass guitar?) and it speaks in a voice that emotes beautifully. It truly sings. Could you describe how you came about this sound and how you approach recording so that you can put that distinct voice onto a record? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">It is the pasta sauce syndrome again. I just know what I like to hear, and it's not about instruments. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Is it really an issue of certain strings, certain pickups, brand names, woods, wiring, or is it something else entirely?
</P>


<P><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="hellborgbass.jpg" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="240"><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="240"><FONT COLOR="blue">Yes and no. It is not about brands. It is the match between your specific physiognomy and the properties of your chosen instrument and its variables. They are however almost all overcome with the passing of time. If you play an instrument long enough you will adapt to it and your sound will come out.
</FONT></P>

<P>Many artists approached slap technique like it was an obligation to include on their recordings, as if to say, "See, I can do it too!". Your approach comes across differently. Again there is that sense of ownership with the style itself as opposed to merely, as some do, emotionally sampling it and just spewing it out. Is there any particular thing you are aware of doing to achieve that authenticity? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I never practiced playing that way, it was always there. I guess that is a little bit of the key to finding your musical identity. It will develop over time, but it is there from the beginning. If you have to struggle with something it is not you.</br clear="left"></P> 

<P>Find something that falls into your hand and that gives you pleasure, follow your bliss. 
</FONT></P>

<P>I get the impression that you are not so much concerned with any particular technique, like the much vaunted 'how-to's' and the why's and wherefore's' involved in the 'correct' way to play bass. 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">No, let us just be human and interact on that level first of all, and the rest, including music, will come out of that.
</FONT></P>

<P>Do you feel it might not be issues such as the correct way to pluck a string or whether to use a pick or your fingerpads at all? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">However you make the sound that turns you on is the correct way. If it sounds good, it's good.
</FONT></P>

<P>Are you more concerned with just getting out of the way of the music, certainly having enough technique to let the music flow in a straight line from the initial point of its creation to the ear, acting more as a window than a filter? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Everybody in the world has enough technique. I am more concerned about having true interactions with human beings. Period. Sometimes the result is music. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Are warm-up exercises and practice patterns still important to you at this point in your playing life? If not, how do you keep your hands listening clearly to your mind?
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">These can be great disciplinary tools, and at the same time great time wasters. The question never really is 'what' but 'why'. The second part of the question sort of implies that my hands really listen to my mind. To be human is to fail. But also it is to try and try and try. That is where the beauty is. Beautiful failures that we never intended. Those are the true pictures of who we are. </P>

<P>If we can stand to face and even admire those, it is a first step in admitting to ourselves who we are. Successful people are really boring, failures are much more interesting. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Most of us have a lazy streak. How do you discipline yourself to venture into new, less safe areas, and how you push yourself beyond that comfort zone? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I don't  really. If I am lazy I'll be lazy, and when I feel the urge to work I will do that. I am not going to eat if I'm not hungry. 
</FONT></P>

<P>With that in mind, is what is considered at this time to be musical growth even an issue for you at all? Meaning, is it a feeling that you have to push to grow as a player, as a person, or are you pulled along with the music? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Personal growth yes, music is my tool, my instrument and my bliss. Life is an interesting book. You really do not know what the next chapter is going to be about. And if you try to write it yourself you are going to miss out. 
</FONT></P>

<P>It is also human nature to search for a theme, a structure in the seeming chaos. Our very physical nature, with the brain being comprised of synapses, electrical pulses arching from one synapse to another, seeks to find order in seeming disorder. We are literally predisposed to find the man on the moon. 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Yes, so none of that is true unless you decide it to be true. A philosophical system (religion, science, anything really) only explains itself. It only works if you stick to it. But they all work. ("Cannibalism is moral in a cannibal society", S. Butler)
</FONT></P>

<P>Most of us, in the drive to create a world we can find some semblance of safety in, seek out long-term objectives in our lives, our loves and our dreams. Therefore, as a human also, what hunger drives you to continue and to develop as a person, and as a musician / bassplayer? And what would you say is your Siren's Call? 
</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">It's all a mystery to me.
</FONT></P>

<P>This concludes one of the most enigmatic interviews I have ever been involved with. What I enjoyed the most was the sensation that things were being answered and yet room was being left for miles of interpretation. I could take whatever meaning I wanted from what was said. The same goes for the reader.</p>

<p>There was also the sensation that I was calling questions into a long tunnel, that wherever Jonas Hellborg resides is a place I have not yet visited. </P>

<p>Truly someone with the courage to be an absolute original. Ah, but the albums, including and in particular the new one, <i>ICON</i>. There are musicians out there that hear a different music than most. Jonas is one of those. </P>

<P>His gift to us, the effect of his need to create, is a window into that music. To try to describe that music achieves nothing. It proves merely to be a case of "the more you describe, the less you explain".  It remains up to you to taste and decide for yourself.
