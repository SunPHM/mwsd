The Captain had an opportunity to ship out to Catalina with a friend this weekend on his 48-foot pure fishing machine, the Madhatter, out of Long Beach. With the catching still on a pick, pick, pick the Captain wanted to check out the up and coming white sea bass bite. There were two low pressures systems back to back, so a trip to Catalina was a bet. We were either going to get our butts kicked in the middle of the channel or luck out with good weather. Well, that's what we got...good weather. There wasn't a soul on the island due to the forecasts so me and Junior, the ship's Captain, had the whole place to ourselves. What a day of fishing and catching. We dumped two big whites and landed one, all in a few hours. Caught a few calico bass and headed back to Avalon. Our bellies would soon be filled with the catch of the day and a brew or two.<P>
After dinner I was sitting on the back deck relaxing and thinking how big those two sea bass may have been if'n I could just got a look at 'em. Well let me tell you people, there are some folks who call themselves the "Fathomiers." They're about 60 of them who get to see those big whites all the time. When ever they get a chance, Palos Verdes Cove or Catalina, they are underwater with their fishing gear, or should I say fishing spears, swimming with them fishes in their own elements. Now look, the Captain doesn't usually speak about folk who use spears, I mean, let's call it what it is; it ain't fishing, it's hunting, man! When you are underwater looking a 70 pound sea bass in the eye, thinking if I shot this fella he's gonna drag my arse 50 feet down through the kelp forest, hold my breath underwater for two minutes or more; you will, and I mean will, think twice about it. I mean a fella could drown! Well, that's hunting...argg...sez the Captain.<P>
Here at Port Royal we happen to have one of those fellas, his name, Jim Matsukas, a diving Greek, who is captain of his 25-foot fishing boat the Spearfish, wouldn't ya know it! Well Captain Jim is a regular on the Palos Verdes Point. He's not just a hunter; he is also a surfer, scuba diver and a fisherman. Just when things get slow, like it's been, he rolls over the side and goes under water for a look-see. And why not? If them slippery little creatures ain't bitin', sometimes it don't hurt to pay them a visit. Well, in less than a week Big Jim shot two big white sea bass! One bass was 45 pounds, the other 50 and a half. I take my hat off to Jim and his bass. He is hunter of the week in my Captain's Log. Here's the picture to prove the point.<P>
The local fishing report is MORE OF THE SAME...A few halibut, lots of sand bass, sculpin, those spiny little @#*$#, sheepshead and whitefish. There's always mackerel too. Down south in Diego a few yellowtail are showing and up north Santa Barbara got some barracuda; go figure...In Oceanside the halibut bite is back to normal. Look take it easy, Here's what's going to happen in a hew weeks. More halibut, more white sea bass, more calico bass, more yellowtail, well, more of everything. Not too bad Jack!<P>
