John Davis/Owen Kupfer & friends on a successful White Sea Bass overnighter
on the Rail Time out of Peter's Landing Huntington Harbor.  We fished the
back side of Catalina.  Captain Rob "Tino" Valantine and Owner Gary Adams
were able to get us into the bass.  The fish ranged in size from 18-28#.
The bonus were three Halibut to 16#.

The first signs of life appeared in the local salmon fishing when the 
commercial season opened on May 1.
<P>
"Two sport boats brought in big salmon on May 1," said Tammy Schuyler at 
Portside Marine. "Bill Hardesty landed a 20 pound, 3 ounce chinook while 
trolling purple haze hoochies at 60 feet deep off Diablo Canyon. Bob Hatcher 
also nailed a 24.7 lb. king while trolling in 300 feet of water off Diablo 
Canyon."
<P>
Commercial salmon boats reported good catches the same day. "One guy brought 
in 18 fish weighing an average of 18 pounds each," reported Schuyler.

<P> 
"Another fisherman came back with 16 quality salmon."
<P>
Unfortunately, the storm moved in and made the seas rough from May 2 through 
May 4.
<P>
No boats went fishing for salmon or sanddabs out of Virg's Landing in Morro 
Bay on May 3 or 4, due to rough weather and tough fishing. However, the 
boats are expected to go for salmon soon, now that more chinooks are showing 
in the area.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Monterey/Moss Landing</FONT></B><BR>
Monterey Bay is producing big king salmon weighing 15 to 35 pounds  for 
anglers fishing at a mixture of depths. However, scores are down, with an 
average one fish per rod or less for private and party boat anglers.
<P> 
"Our fish counts are a little low, but this year we have seen a lot of big 
fish caught, mainly at the Soquel Hole," reported Roger Diaz at The Tackle 
Box. "Since the numbers of salmon are not as plentiful, I recommend trolling 
to cover more water. Also, mark areas where you catch fish and circle around 
to fish the same hole when you hook one."
<P>
Anglers fishing at the mouth of the Salinas River and Zmudowski Beach are 
catching quality surfperch and the occasional striped bass. "The perch are 
hitting motor oil plastic grubs with orange tails. For the bigger perch, try 
using a 2 inch grub rather than a 1 inch one," explained Diez.
<P>
Captain Norm Chapin of Hook'Em Up Sportfishing is taking one fish per rod 
while fishing at The Slide in 180-200 feet of water. "On May 4, the water 
had a wicked lump to it and my passengers came down with 'ocean allergies', 
but that wasn't until we had two fish in the box," Chapin. "We lost three 
other fish before getting back to the harbor at 8:30 am. Our fish weighed 14 
lbs. and 17 lbs."
<P>
On a previous run on May 1, the two anglers trolling chartreuse double glow 
hoochies in Monterey Bay landed three fish weighing 14, 16 and 18 pounds, 
according to Chapin.
<P>
The Star of Monterey out of Chris' Fishing Trips reported decent fishing on 
the last salmon trip. "The eight people mooched anchovies between 60 and 80 
feet deep off Moss Landing to nail 7 fish to 26 pounds," stated Todd 
Arcoleo. "Although we are not getting the numbers, the fish we are catching 
are big ones.


<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Santa Cruz</FONT></B><BR>
The fishing out of Santa Cruz remains tough. Some private boats had a fish 
per rod average or better. Some continue to come home with no fish. We are 
looking forward to some North/West wind the water is clearing up on us. We 
have had a lot of South winds we need the North/West for upwelling and 
desolve oxygen into the water. It is still early and we have a good chance 
at some great Salmon fishing. Fish can show up at any time and come out of 
the canyon. We have seen salmon come out of the canyon when we did not 
expect it before. In the mean time keep an eye out for Halibut we are 
working on getting live bait at Shamrock Charters soon.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Half Moon Bay</FONT></B><BR>
Salmon fishing enthusiasts experienced mixed results over the May 3-4 
weekend, with one day yielding limits and the next one fish per rod or less.
<P> 
"This weekend we fished about 8 to 10 miles below the Islands and caught 
fish trolling anchovies between 20-40 feet," reported Captain William 
"Smitty" Smith of Riptide Sportfishing. "On Saturday, weather conditions 
were perfect. The sea wasn't rough and we started hooking salmon first thing 
in the morning. By the end of the day, we had caught 11 limits up to 21 
pounds."
<P> 
"The bite was still good on the following day, but we were unable to put our 
limits in the box," said Smith. "We trolled all day hoping to get more fish 
in the boat, but we came up short with 13 fish for 8 people. The big fish of 
the day weighed 18 pounds."
<P>
Anglers fishing out of Huck Finn Sportfishing experienced consistent chinook 
action on Saturday, but struggled the following day fishing 6-8 miles below 
the main Farallon Island, according to Bill Beckett.
<P> 
"The bite was best on Saturday," said Beckett. "The <A HREF="http://www.fishingboat.com" TARGET="_blank">Queen of Hearts</A> checked in with 19 limits, while New Captain Pete returned with 25 fish for 16 
passengers. Ankeney Street came back with 19 salmon to 25 pounds for 16 
anglers."
<P> 
"On Sunday, May 4, fishing took a nose dive, but we still had fish in the 
box," he explained. The Queen of Hearts took 10 fish for 19 people, while 
the New Captain Pete brought in 13 fish for 22 anglers. Ankeney Street was 
the top boat with 26 salmon for 15 people.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">San Francisco</FONT></B><BR>
Live bait drifters landed limits and near-limits of stripers, along with 
good numbers of halibut, in San Francisco Bay on the weekend of May 3-4.
<P>
The Bass Tub returned to the wharf with 16 stripers and 6 halibut for 12 
anglers on Sunday, May 4, according to Captain Erik Anfinson. The bass and 
halibut are  showing at a variety of spots, including Paradise Cay, the 
Berkeley Flats, the Alameda Rockwall, Bakers Beach and Crissy Field.
<P>
The salmon fishing is also going strong, with "terrific" action reported by 
Jacky Douglas, captain of the Wacky Jacky. Most of the boats have been 
running southeast of the Farallon Islands, about 14 to 17 miles outside the 
Golden Gate. Limits and near-limits of quality chinooks have been the rule 
when the weather allows the boats to get out.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">San Rafael</FONT></B><BR>
The variable weather has slowed down fishing pressure in San Francisco Bay, 
but anglers are nailing good numbers of halibut and stripers on the 
favorable tides.
<P> 
"Anglers drifting live bait are nailing halibut averaging 8 to 10 pounds in 
the Berkeley Flats and in Paradise Cay," said Art Donati at Loch Lomond Live 
Bait and Tackle. "Some bank fishermen are also catching a few halibut and 
stripers outside of the harbor jetty."
<P>
The water is clearing from recent storms and trolling for stripers is a good 
prospect. "Troll at the top of the tide with white and chartreuse wormtail 
jigs," said Donati. "The best area is off the Brickyards and San Quentin."
<P>
Live bait drifters are also bagging striped bass at the Brothers and Whaling 
Station. The bass caught on live bait are generally larger than those caught 
trolling. The live bait bass range from 5 to 20 pounds, while the 
troll-caught fish go from 15 to 25 inches, including both shakers and 
keepers.




<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Berkeley</FONT></B><BR>
Halibut and striped bass fishing has been very consistent in San Francisco 
Bay. For example,  a Fish Sniffer trip on the <A HREF="http://www.feeva.com/goldeneye2000/" TARGET="_blank">Goldeneye 2000</A> with Captain 
Quang Vo on Wednesday, May 7 produced 38 fish, including 27 halibut and 11 
stripers, for 27 anglers. Dan Bacher of the Fish Sniffer landed the largest 
halibut, a 30 pounder. Pat Athey of Ripon won the Lamiglas rod for the 
biggest halibut caught by the participants, while Roosevelt Washington of 
Richmond won the Ambasseduer Abu Garcia Reel for the heftiest striper. The 
halibut ranged from 6 to 30 pounds, while the stripers ranged from 3 to 12 
pounds.
<P>
Tony Ngyuen of Granite Bay took his limit of halibut, as did Craig Patterson 
of Rio Linda. However, the hottest rod on the boat was Mike Prettyman, who 
works at Fisherman's Warehouse in Sacramento. Prettyman landed both his 
limits of striped bass and halibut.
<P>
The anglers drifted live bait off Angel Island and in Paradise Cay. Anglers 
also released many shaker stripers. The weather was nice, with a mixture of 
overcast and sunny skies. Other party boats and private boats fishing the 
same area also did well.
<P>
The salmon bite was wide open this week for anglers fishing on charter boats 
out of Berkeley Marina; the boats fishing on Thursday landed early limits of 
chinooks. Limits of bright kings averaging 10 to 15 pounds have been the 
rule as long as the weather cooperates.
<P> 
"Salmon fishing has been fantastic this week," reported Chris Nelson of the 
<A HREF="http://www.sfbayfishing.com" TARGET="_blank">Berkeley Marina Sports Center.</A> "Most of the boats have been running south 
east of the Farallons about 14 to 17 miles outside the Golden Gate. They're 
trolling anchovies from 20 to 60 pulls deep."
<P>
Saturday's catch was very impressive with the New Easy Rider reporting full 
limits to 20 pounds for 13 anglers. The El Dorado also scored salmon limits 
with 46 fish to 25 pounds for 23 anglers. The New El Dorado fished a live 
bait charter inside the bay and checked in with 17 halibut and 1 striped 
bass for 30 anglers. The New Golden Eye also fished live bait inside the bay 
for a total of 6 halibut and 1 striped bass for 5 anglers.


<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Emeryville</FONT></B><BR>
King salmon action has been red hot for anglers fishing out of Emeryville 
Sportfishing this week. It's been limits or close to it on every trip and 
the fish are quality kings running 8 to 20 pounds.
<P> 
"The salmon bite really broke loose this week," reported Craig Stone of 
Emeryville Sportfishing. "The boats have been running about 18 miles 
southwest of the Golden Gate and taking near limits to limits of fish. 
<P>
Inside the bay, the halibut and striper action has been good for 1 to 2 fish 
a rod on the Berkeley Flats."
<P>
On Saturday, May 3, the <A HREF="http://www.rapidtransitsportfishing.com" TARGET="_blank">Rapid Transit</A> bagged full limits of salmon to 23 
pounds for 15 anglers. The New Salmon Queen also brought in limits to 23 
pounds for 16 anglers. The Dandy found limits as well with 16 fish to 18 
pounds for 8 anglers. The New Seeker was the only boat to mooch during the 
day and they managed 35 fish to 19 pounds for 22 anglers.
<P>
On Friday, May 2, the Captain Hook ran a live bait trip inside San Francisco 
Bay and they checked in with 12 halibut to 12 pounds and 8 striped bass to 
10 pounds for 12 passengers. They most of the day drifting live anchovies on 
the Berkeley Flats.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Richmond</FONT></B><BR>
Anglers fishing out of Richmond are still catching over one fish per rod 
while targeting halibut at the Berkeley Flats. The flatfish average 10-12 
pounds each.
<P> 
"We trolled for halibut in the Berkeley Flats and the south bay to land 7 
halibut for five people on our last trip," said Captain John Paxson of 
<A HREF="http://www.dreamcatchersportfishing.com" TARGET="_blank">Dreamcatcher Sportfishing.</A> "We first picked up 4 fish in the south bay. 
After the bite slowed down there, we headed back to the Berkeley Flats and 
landed our 3 other fish. The big fish of the day weighed 12 pounds."
<P>
Paxson also ran a commercial trip in the flats the following day that 
yielded five halibut. "I heard there were a few boats nailing lots of 
striped bass at Paradise Cay," said Paxson. "The best action was on the 
outgoing tide."
<P> 
"I managed to get a break from fishing in order to deal with other work over 
the May 3-4 weekend, but I did get out mid week for a commercial trip with a 
longtime friend, Mike Farmer," reported Captain John Badger of Barbarian 
Sportfishing. "We were out on the water for about five hours in the 
afternoon and put 15 halibut in the box. The biggest fish for the day 
weighed 22.5 pounds."

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Point San Pablo</FONT></B><BR>
Live bait trips running out of Point San Pablo found decent action on a mix 
of halibut and striped bass last week. Over the weekend, striper action 
heated up with one boat reporting limits of fish at Paradise Cay.
<P> 
"We tried running a 7 gill trip on Saturday, but couldn't find any willing 
fish," reported Frank Miller of <A HREF="http://www.furysportfishng.com" TARGET="_blank">Fury Sportfishing.</A> "We decided to make a 
quick run over to Paradise Cay at the end of the trip and caught a handful 
of stripers. On Sunday, we ran straight to Paradise and caught full limits 
of stripers and 3 halibut to 12 pounds for 5 anglers."
<P>
According to Miller, the fish were all taken on live anchovies drifted 20 to 
30 feet deep on the outgoing tide. "Most of the stripers are schoolie-sized 
fish from small keepers up to 7 pounds," he added.
<P> 
"We've been taken close to a fish per rod on our live bait trips this week," 
reported Captain Chad Aho of New Keesa Sportfishing. "On Sunday, May 4 we 
landed 6 striped bass and 4 halibut to 8 pounds for 11 people. We had lots 
of action throughout the day and also caught and released a bunch of 
undersized stripers."
<P>
Aho said they concentrated on halibut at the Berkeley Flats the previous 
weekend. "We caught 6 halibut for 6 anglers on Saturday and 8 halibut and a 
striper for 13 people on Sunday," he said. Nine-year-old Ronald Fujita from 
El Sobrante landed the big fish of the week, a 30 pound halibut. Michael 
Fujita nailed a 13 pound halibut and 14 year old Nicki Katz caught an 11 
pound halibut."


<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Bodega Bay</FONT></B><BR>
Bodega Bay salmon season started off with a bang last month and the action 
has held steady up to press time.
<P> 
"We're going to be blown out for the next couple days, but we made it out 
over the weekend and the salmon bite was excellent," reported Sophie Powers 
out of Bodega Bay Sportfishing. "We had to deal with a fair amount of wind, 
but the fish are close to home so we didn't have to run very far."
<P>
According to Powers, the salmon have been running 8 to 12 pounds on average 
and the top method has been trolling anchovies at 25 to 60 pulls deep. "The 
New Sea Angler ran just south of Point Reyes on Saturday, May 3 and they 
landed 22 salmon to 16 pounds for 18 anglers," said Powers. "It was pretty 
rough on Sunday, but they found a big school of fish off Carmet Point and 
they limited out the boat with a total of 52 fish to 18 pounds for 26 
anglers."

<P><B><FONT COLOR="red">Fort Bragg</FONT></B><BR>
Salmon action has been on a steady pace off the Fort Bragg Coast this week. 
Party boats are checking in with 1 to 2 fish a rod on quality king salmon 
averaging 15 to 18 pounds.
<P> 
"Ocean conditions have been fantastic this weekend and we've got a great 
salmon bite happening straight out of the harbor," reported Rick Thornton of 
<A HREF="http://www.anchorcharterboats.com" TARGET="_new">Anchor Charters.</A> "The Lady Irma ran morning and afternoon trips yesterday 
and brought in full limits to 30 pounds for 6 anglers in the afternoon and 
12 fish for 8 people in the morning."
<P>
According to Thornton, the salmon are hitting trolled anchovies in 25 to 70 
fathoms of water. "These are really nice fish, most in the upper teens and 
good numbers of fish in the 20 to 30 pound class," he added. "We also landed 
a 96 pound blue shark while trolling for salmon this week."
<P> 
"Salmon fishing has been steady around a fish a rod or better this week," 
confirmed Ashley Diaz at the Noyo Fishing Center in Fort Bragg. "We weren't 
able to make it up to Punta Gorda for rockfish this week, but it looks like 
conditions should be good for our next trip scheduled on May 9."
<P>
According to Diaz, the Rumblefish brought in 18 salmon for 10 anglers on 
Thursday, May 1. Friday's trip produced 15 fish for 19 anglers. Saturday 
morning, they nailed 7 salmon for 7 anglers and the afternoon trip produced 
9 salmon for 13 anglers.
