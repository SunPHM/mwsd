 	<font size=3 color="#000000" face="times new roman, arial"> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in 1961, in Vancouver, to Judith Dorise Janzen and Mijo Ivan Samija. My mother's origins were in the prairies - Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan. Her parents were of Russian and German origin, being Mennonites who fled persecution in their own lands. Her mother was a mandolinist, ukelele player, pianist, and singer. She grew up with the piano, eventually played organ in church, and became a composer later in life. My father came from Split, Croatia, and had lived in several European cities on the way here, where my mother met him on Kits beach while out walking. Stories of his adventures filled my summers as a child. Not all happy stories, but certainly rich. I have three brothers - Mijo, Adam, and David - and one sister - Siobhan.
  	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began carving whatever came to hand when I got my first pocket knife, at age 7. A trusting grownup - my stepfather Roderick Wood - gave it to me and taught me to use it. From bows and arrows to boxes, construction work to dragons, I learned to make things of wood. Making gifts was a great enjoyment. Soon I was dependent upon tools for a lot of what interested me, without really meaning to be. Making something when it was needed came often more readily than buying it, as money was scarce. 
 	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time high school came along I was aware that woodwork was my forte, though I knew not in what direction to pursue this craft. Furniture was possible, but I enjoyed curved, flowing forms more, objects with symmetry, but of an 'organic' feel. 
 	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various pursuits caught my interest, passingly, and I had perhaps 30 different jobs before I was 25 years old. A labourer, carpenter, odd-jobber, bicycle mechanic, I even tried a year at art school, thinking of a career in photography. I raced off-road bicycles, ran, made carved things for family and friends. Then one rainy winter afternoon in late 1985 it occurred to me to make cellos. I was working in a bicycle shop and as I made tight the left-rear axle nut of a Raleigh 3-speed it came to me, and I spoke it aloud: "I'm going to make cellos." A few bemused seconds later I said "I want to play the cello too." (That inspired a stupified glance from a co-worker!) A moment I'd awaited for a very long time had come, and I knew it to be good. Leaving that job within the month, I began the research I knew would be hard but also very satisfying.
 	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a year I had made a workbench, a few dulcimers - for practice - most of a jazz guitar-bass, and my first violin was well near done. The library had proved a most rewarding resource. A sort of box-cello came next, and a bow to play it. I'll not detail here how those looked, nor how they sounded, but at least I was able to use them. I began to study Bach's 'Six Sonatas for Violoncello Solo' and it mattered not what sound I made. In my mind, there was Bach, and I was playing at last. 
	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1987 I joined the Violin Maker's Association of BC and learned some things from a few of the members there. But I soon found it confining, a hobbyists' sort of place, and gave up membership.
  	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chance meeting - I was trying to sell my first violin, and only this one person answered the advertisement - brought me the friendship of P.J.Tan, a luthier now based in Edmonton, Alberta. He offered me his overflow work; some bows to rehair, the odd restoration or repair. This kindness, a few pointers, and links to others in the violin world was the real beginning for my professional life. Since then his friendship has been my most valued inspiration in making. A tireless maker. 
	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have played cello in a few community orchestras, longest being the Vancouver Folk Orchestra for 4 years under conducter and composer Karl Kobylanski, now deceased. It was most rewarding experience, and I wish there were time for it still. I've also played in a number of chamber music settings. Duets with my mother at her piano were most cherished, despite the fire that seemed to ignite the air most times we played together.  
 	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave up my last 'job' in 1994, having become certain that an employee I am not. Word of my work with instruments had spread and the lineup of bassists grew steadily longer. Fewer of the others, but I have loyal clients in all sizes of the violin family. It seems I've become a bass luthier without meaning to be and I enjoy this accident very much. 
	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I share my life with an old-time fiddler named Shiho and her daughter Cello. Shiho plays old time music for the most part, with <a href="http://www.copperspine.com/artist_bios/dyad.html">Dyad</a> (represented by <a href="http://www.copperspine.com/">Copperspine</a>) and various other musical collaberations. 
	<br /><br /> 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the present Vancouver remains my dwelling place, and the damaged, mal-adjusted, needy and new basses and other fiddles keep calling for my attention. We'll see what really happens as it unfolds, and doubtless I'll be surprised.

	<font size="2"> p.s.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last name begins with an '&#138;' if anyone was wondering. The caron above the S is a slavic thing. Some browsers are not able to handle that, and it has been 'deprecated' in HTML 4.01, so I've left it out.
  	<br /> The name is pronounced <b>'Shah</b>-me-ah' and according to my father derives from a capturedTurkish scarf, a captain's military insignia. As he told it, some Dalmatian ancestor in the 15th century took the head of a Turkish captain, then rode home with the man's scarf-of-rank and adopted the Ottoman term for our family name. Perhaps that's what happened...  The older name, sometimes still spoken, was Dumankusic.
