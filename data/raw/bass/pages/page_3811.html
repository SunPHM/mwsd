Honeymoon Trip<br>
Aboard the Riverboat Delta Queen</h1>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/dqline.jpg" width="400" height="205"></p>

<p align="left">Although we were <a href="../wedding/index.html"> married</a> February 9, 2002 at the old Mission San Juan
Bautista built in 1797, we didn't get a chance to take a honeymoon until March
of 2003. It was certainly worth the wait. This is a small record of a most
fabulous two and a half weeks of travel that included one week aboard the Steam
Powered Riverboat Delta Queen. She was built in 1927 for the Sacramento River,
used in World War II as the smallest troop ship of record, and moved to the
Mississippi River system in 1947 by the Greene Steamboat Line. The Delta Queen
is a National Landmark and the oldest moving post office on America's inland
waterway system (she has her own postmark)! But I digress, you
can find more history about this magnificent lady of the river at the <a href="http://www.deltaqueen.com/fleet/dq/dq_main.htm" target="_blank">Delta
Queen Steamboat Company</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"> This page is about our honeymoon week aboard the Delta Queen!
But first a quick picture of our wedding at <a href="http://www.oldmission-sjb.org/" target="_blank"> Mission San Juan Bautista</a> in San
Juan Bautista, California.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Click any picture for a larger version.)</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/p0002197c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0002197t.jpg" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">Our trip started by automobile from Loveland, Colorado to New
Orleans, Louisiana. We took three days to get to New Orleans casually traveling
back roads and staying off the freeways. (Such a great way to travel!) We spent
two days in New Orleans checking out the French Quarter, Churches, shopping, and
other tourist sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Our first night we had a wonderful early supper of soup (Ramona
had Potage alligator a sherry and Bob tried the Gombo Créole), fresh baked
bread and wine at <a href="http://www.antoines.com/" target="_blank">Antoine's
Restaurant</a> in the French Quarter. This place is great. Established in 1840
with lots of wonderful little rooms for service by tuxedoed waiters. Oh, the
food was wonderful along with the service and personal tour by our waiter</p>

<p align="center">.<a href="http://www.antoines.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="images/antoines.jpg" hspace="4" alt="Restaurant Antoine" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="http://www.antoines.com/12night.html" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="images/antoines2.jpg" hspace="4" alt="Antoines - Twelfth Night Revelers Room " width="201" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">The third day was our boarding day for the Delta Queen, so we
packed up, traveled the few blocks, parked our car and they off loaded our stuff
to the dock for us. We walked on board and were graciously greeted by one and
all. We were early, so while we waited, we took advantage of the 'little' buffet
of goodies and morsels. When our cabin was ready we found everything to rights
including all our luggage already delivered. We were in cabin 121 the New Jersey
Room. (On the Cabin Deck - Port (left) and Aft section. Our windows looked, aft
right at the big red stern paddles.) So we unpacked our goodies and readied
ourselves for the week. Oh boy!</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004237c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004237t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen at Dock in New Orleans" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004249c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004249t.jpg" alt="Stern Wheel while in New Orleans" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004378c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004378t.jpg" alt="Cabin 121" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">If you look closely at the picture of our cabin, you will see
that not only are the beds turned down and a mint included, but they also
provided a daily 'newspaper' <i>The Steamboatin Times</i> that tells all about the boat, our
day's schedules, and lots
of other interesting information.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(Note: If this were an ocean going vessel, it would be called a
ship, but on the river these vessels are called riverboats or boats. So I will stick with the river
tradition and call the Delta Queen a boat or riverboat and an elegant lady.)</p>

<p align="left">We still have some time to kill, so we walk around and find, you
guessed it, the bar with the music about the start. Elaine sets us up with a
little libation and Walter Kross and the Riverboat Five start playing (the
popcorn machine is always full). (Yea, the picture only has four musicians - one
of the musicians would join us the next day because he missed his flight. They
made good music with just the four!)</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004251c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004251t.jpg" alt="Elaine" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004253c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004253t.jpg" alt="Walter Kross and the Riverboat Five" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">At five o'clock we all had to clear out for fire and boat drill.
That is where you put on a life vest and they make sure you do it right. We did
our part and they did their part. Then off with the life jackets and back to
roaming the boat. (No pictures of us with our life vests on - Orange clashes
with Ramona's beautiful blue eyes, and she wouldn't allow me to take any
pictures.)</p>

<p align="left">As we get ready to leave New Orleans all kinds of actions start.
The boarding ladders are removed along with lines, hoses and the like. The
fireman in the boiler room turns up the heat. The Captain prepares to cast off.
The Captain Pilot blows the steam whistle. As we cast off, there is also someone
playing music on the steam calliope, located at the stern! And they do this
wonderful routine every time we enter or leave port unless it's too late at
night, but it never was for us! They even will blow the whistle to honor a
passing location or ship and the calliope could be played almost anytime. What
fun! A group of us even got a chance to play the steam powered noise maker!</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004469c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004469t.jpg" alt="Adding More Steam" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004498c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004498t.jpg" alt="Waiting for the whistle" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004583c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004583t.jpg" alt="Pilot Blows the Whistle" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004390c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004390t.jpg" alt="Steam Calliope" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">Our first evening aboard included the most wonderful dinner.
There was a selection of two appetizers, two soups, two salads, four entrées,
(actually five entrées if you count a special vegetarian selection), and three
different desserts! Oh Oh, I think I'm going to gain weight on this trip! Each
evening meal was the same sort of different selections. Never the same meal
twice. Continental breakfast on the cabin deck, breakfast in the dining room,
lunch in the dinning room, midday hotdogs available in the bar, afternoon
cocktails with hors d'oeuvres available in the bar, dinner in the dining room,
then a moonlight buffet on the cabin deck. We will never go hungry! Did I forget
to mention live piano music for every dinner from Tony Schwartz the pianist from
the River Boat Five? Our remaining days were no different. Every meal was great
and wonderful. Dinner included five entrée choices and we always wanted to try
them all. The best we could do was order two different and then share. (Our
waitress told us that we could order some of each, but there's no way we could
pack that much food into our tummies! So we just had to be satisfied with
sharing two choices of each available evening's fare.)</p>

<p align="left">Our Maitre d'Hotel Shelby assigned us our own private table for our
dinners. Same table every evening, it was great.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004545c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004545t.jpg" alt="Shelby" width="74" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">That night we literally steamed up river towards our first
landing at Houmas House Plantation. We get some night time calliope, wonderful
night river sights and watched the paddlewheel do its job.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004259c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004259t.jpg" alt="Calliope at night" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004257c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004257t.jpg" alt="Paddle Wheel at Night" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">The first morning we're up before the cock crows and find Aaron
fixing early morning coffee in the forward cabin deck area. We thought he was
just our porter, but come to find out he also sets up coffee by six (often
earlier) and continental breakfast from 6 to 10 for those early risers that want
something before real breakfast at 7:30 to 9. In our case instead of real
breakfast, we plan to leave the breakfast light so we can chow down on dinner.
Here's a picture of Aaron at the coffee maker and Ramona's first breakfast of
coffee and muffin.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004544c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004544t.jpg" alt="Aaron" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004269c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004269t.jpg" alt="Breakfast with Ramona" hspace="4" width="101" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">Our first stop is not a city, but simply aground on the river
bank just off the <a href="http://www.houmashouse.com/" target="_blank">Houmas
House Plantation</a>. So we are off the Delta Queen for a tour of the home (we
op not to take the swamp bus and boat tour, but just the house tour).</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004279c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004279t.jpg" alt="Houmas House Plantation" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004289c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004289t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen at Houmas House Plantation" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">That evening before dinner is the Captain's Welcome Aboard
Champagne Reception with Captain Gabe Chengery.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004294c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004294t.jpg" alt="Ramona toasting with champagne" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004297c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004297t.jpg" alt="Bob &amp; Ramona Snyder in their finary" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004300c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004300t.jpg" alt="Ramona Capt Gabe and Bob" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">The next day we are in Baton Rouge where we took advantage of a
tour called the Cajun Fiddler Walking Tour. May not sound like much, but it was
the most enjoyable time. A woman fiddler and folklorist by the name of Ann
Vidrine gave us a wonderful tour of Baton Rouge telling us about history of the
city, Cajun history, folklore and more while occasionally stopping to play her
fiddle and sing us a few Cajun songs. What a treat! We ended our tour with Cajun
Cafe Latte and Southern Pralines - Yum!</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004304c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004304t.jpg" alt="Ann Vidrine - Cajun Fiddler" width="87" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">Our next stop was Natchez. Our trip coincided with the <a href="http://www.natchezpilgrimage.com/" target="_blank">Natchez
Spring Pilgrimage</a> which opens many of the historic antebellum homes. We
opted for a tour of the city that included a few of these beautiful antebellum
mansions.&nbsp; Here's a&nbsp; few pictures of the homes we visited. I could
fill this page with pictures of these beautiful old homes, but I'll just limit
it to a few. I've also added an evening shot from the Delta Queen towards a
gambling casino that looks like a riverboat, floats like a river boat, but never
moves from the concrete enclosure it's floating within.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004333c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004333t.jpg" alt="Auburn House" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004337c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004337t.jpg" alt="Ramona at Auburn House" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004357c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004357t.jpg" alt="Longwood" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004375c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004375t.jpg" alt="Natchez anchorage at night" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>

<p align="left">Our next day's stop is Vicksburg and a tour of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/vick/" target="_blank">Vicksburg
National Military Park</a>. Not many antebellum mansions here but a lot of
history. Here's a picture of the Delta Queen at the Natchez river dock and some
of the National Military Park.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004451c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004451t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen at Vicksburg" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004313c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004313t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen at Vicsburg" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004452c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004452t.jpg" alt="Vicksburg Waterfront" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="194" height="130"><br>

<p align="left">After Vicksburg we had a full day of steamboatin' up the river.
There were lots of things to do aboard like watching the scenery and
paddlewheel, playing the calliope (that's Tony Schwartz at the console), touring
engine room. There are also planned events like making hats,
flying kites, watching movies, listening to the 'riverlorian' give history of
the river, boats, navigation and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">By the way, the steam calliope was built in 1897. It was
originally installed on the Showboat Water Queen which sank in the Kanawha River
in 1937. The whistles were salvaged, later discovered, then installed aboard the
Delta Queen in 1960.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<a href="images/p0004387c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004387t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen Paddle Wheel" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004388c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004388t.jpg" alt="Tony Schwartz at the Calliope" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004392c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004392t.jpg" alt="Tony Schwartz at the Calliope" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a></p>
<p align="left">While steamboatin' there's also lots to eat and drink! That's
Paulina with a Rob Roy for Ramona, and Jason tending bar. Ramona's in a hot game
of Canasta, then Ramona and Bob on the foredeck.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004476c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004476t.jpg" alt="Paulina with a Rob Roy for Ramona" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004549c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004549t.jpg" alt="Jason tending bar" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004501c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004501t.jpg" alt="Ramona in a hot game of Canasta" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004528c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004528t.jpg" alt="Ramona &amp; Bob on the foredeck" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a></p>
<p align="left">There's Jerry the riverlorian and Capt. Gabe busy at work!</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004547c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004547t.jpg" alt="Jerry the riverlorian" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004465c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004465t.jpg" alt="Capt Gabe on watch" hspace="4" width="87" height="130"></a></p>
<p align="left">You can even casually tour the boat.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004493c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004493t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen Starboard Side Cabin Deck" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004577c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004577t.jpg" alt="Lamp in the Betty Blake Lounge" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="87" height="130"><br>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Captain's Champagne Dinner is the second night of
steamboatin' and we are lucky enough to be honored with an invitation to the
captain's table! After the dinner Captain Gabe treats us to a colored steam
calliope concert, where he serenades Ramona and others with wonderful tunes!</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/captdinnerc.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/captdinnert.jpg" alt="Captain's Dinner Invitation" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="192" height="130"><br>

<p align="left">The Captain's Dinner was fantastic. For those of us at the
Captain's table, the evening started with a wonderful cocktail party of drinks
and lovely hors d'oeuvres (cream stuffed strawberries, tiny new potato wedges
stuffed with red and black caviar, stuffed mushrooms and more)! Then there was
the dinner for everyone. I thought I would include the menu for you here.
(Although it was the Captain's Dinner, all the menus were just as nice as this
for selection and finery.) That night Ramona chose the Roast marinated
Tenderloin of Beef and Bob chose the Pesto Crusted Sea Bass. Yum!</p>

<p align="left">Our next stop is Helena, Arkansas. We decide to stay aboard
relax and tour the engine room and pilot house. By the way, we toured the engine
room while we were underway. It is meticulously clean and wonderfully
quite.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><a href="images/p0004555c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004555t.jpg" alt="Ramona in the Engine Room" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a><a href="images/p0004492c.jpg"><img border="0" src="images/p0004492t.jpg" alt="Delta Queen bridge" hspace="4" width="194" height="130"></a></p>
<p align="left">Our final stop is Memphis where we leave this lovely lady of the
river the Delta Queen. We get a chance to visit with Bill and Dee (our
relatives) for a day. Then it's on
the Amtrak train back to New Orleans to fetch our car and return home.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.deltaqueen.com/" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="images/logo_DQ_header.gif" width="150" height="145"></a></p>
<p align="left">Our travels home took us to the Natchez trace, another antebellum
home, an old inn along the Trace,&nbsp; the Pawnee Bill Museum (a contemporary
of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show), and more of those wonderful back roads and out of the way places away
from the freeway as much as possible to return home to Loveland, Colorado.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/captains_wheel_lg_clr.gif" width="75" height="75"></p>
<p align="left">We would like to thank the Delta Queen and her crew for a
wonderful time. Everyone mentioned above was fantastic and we thank you all. We
also want to thank some of those not pictured above that had direct contact with
us:</p>
<p align="center">Bob the Steamboatin' Director<br>
Keith the Hotel Manager<br>
Kathy the Shore Tour Manager<br>
Chris our Room Steward</p>
<p align="left">Plus thanks to all those we didn't get to meet directly, but
certainly made everything perfect. Our two pilots, the Engineers, Mates,
Pursers, Stewards, Porters, Crew, all their Managers and the Entertainers.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/idcardt.jpg" width="211" height="130"></p>
<p align="left">Let's not forget the Chefs, thank you Donavan and your crew. The
food was wonderful, the weight gain was unfortunate but unavoidable.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Cooks Motto</b><br>
Much Work - Much Food<br>
Little Work - Little Food<br>
No Work - Burial at Sea</p>
<p align="left">Certainly not a problem here!</p>
