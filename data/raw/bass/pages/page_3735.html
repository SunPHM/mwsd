<p></a> <b>Reiko</b>: Could you please tell me your name please.<br>
<b>Wilmer Drake</b>: My name is Wilmer Drake. And I have lived
here in Manhattan Beach almost 75 years.<br>
<b>Reiko:</b> Wilmer, did you fish there?<br>
<b>Wilmer Drake:</b> Oh, yeah I fished there. We made our own
poles and we'd buy the bamboo poles, Calcutta pole, it was a
little different that regular ordinary bamboo, first they got the
bamboo but the bamboo had kind of a knob on it. It made it
difficult to mount guides on it, but with the Calcutta pole it
was much smother and much easier. And we made our own poles, I
remember my dad made his and I made one and wrapped our poles.
Pat has always kidded me, I remember I was anxious to go fishing
and I didn't have a decent pole and so I sent away to one of
these catalogue outfits were you got a rod and line and a reel
and ever thing. And he laughed, he remembers to this day how he
laughed, how I set that thing up, ever time I'd catch a small
fish that thing would just bend double. But it was a steel pole.
He always liked to tease me about it. We had fun. But later on we
where able to get our own poles. My dad when business was slack
would sit down in the plumbing shop and wrap his fishing rod.
Cause he liked to go ocean fishing or he'd go out on the barge,
he'd go out there. Made his own guides and everything out of
brass pipe, took brass pipe, sized brass pipe and made his guides
out of that.</p>

<p></a> <b>Wilmer Drake:</b> Now, I don't know who this gentleman
is, cause I never met him, but this happens to be a pretty good
sized sea bass, I know there was one caught that was bigger than
that, weighed over 500 lbs. But the story on the 500 lb. fish has
the gentlemen fishing at the end of the wooden extension of the
pier. This photograph was taken in 1922, in May '22 long before
they had built the extension onto the pier. So they must have
caught it at the end, off the old pier. I don't know this man,
cause I was pretty much a little boy about that time.</p>

        Wooden extensions were added to the concrete pier in 1927
        and completed in 1928. It was 200 feet long and included
        a stairway leading down to a landing and gas pumps for
        boats. The extension was destroyed by storms in 1940. ©

<p></a> <b>Wilmer Drake:</b> Now this is that wooden extension
that was wiped away after about ten years usage, and this was the
little building in the back, and this you see this pole right
here, they would take the larger boats out and anchor them
offshore about, oh , a distance out there, oh about a quarter of
a mile off shore and then the operators of the boat would row in
and then they would drop the line to them and they would hook on
to it and then they would bring the boat and put it on the deck
here. Well this dock and tackle was used to raise the fish, that
was caught, off of the end, that was about five hundred pounds
and as I say the man that was fishing it said it would, I watched
him and the fish kept running down to the south and he'd reel it
and it would come back and it would go over to the north a little
bit, its a wonder it didn't come in tangled, but it the fish was
so tired out that it just came up to the top and then after he
played it, so it never got around the pilings at all, but he
would have lost it if it has gotten in the pilings.<br>
<b>Bonnie Beckerson:</b> Just a little aside from the fishing:
People used to come from Pasadena and Los Angeles, they would
come all dressed up with gloves and an umbrella. Along the beach
there would be bath houses were they could rent a bathing suit
and go swimming, and then they would put all these fancy clothes
back on and go back up to Pasadena or Los Angeles or wherever
they came from. They used to go on the red car, it ran right
along the beach. It was an electric car. It was referred to as
the red car because, well we have pictures of it, and it was a
red car!</p>

<p></a> <b>Wilmer Drake:</b> This is Manhattan beach pier in
1920. And this is a fisherman, fishing alone, there are few more
fisherman further down the pier. This is shortly after the pier
was completed they propably hadn't put the round house up yet,
but it looks to me like the lumber that is in the foreground
could have been part of the materials for the Roundhouse. This
photo is very close to what would have been the end where the
Roundhouse would have been built, it was taken from this area
looking towards shore.</p>

<p></a> <b>Wilmer Drake:</b> This is a large group of fishermen
that would gather on Memorial Day, it was even more crowded on
the Fourth of July! And these are all fishermen and their
families. If you didn't get out at 4 o'clock in the morning to
fish there was no place for you to get your rod to the railing!
It would be crowded and people would stay there all day long, but
this is of course taken around 1930. Fishing was serious buisness
back then!</p>

<p></a> <b>Wilmer Drake:</b> .....and this is Uncle Ferdie, no
one seems to know who Uncle Ferdie is. My feeling was that people
came down on the red car line to see what was happening. They
would see the fish that the fishermen had caught and they decided
that they wanted to fish too, so they would go rent a pole. I'm
guessing that this was probably some of the first fish that Uncle
Ferdie caught. But as I say I don't exactly know who Uncle Ferdie
is and nobody else seems to know who Uncle Ferdie is either. He
must have been a stranger who didn't live in Manhattan Beach, but
was visiting Manhattan Beach at the time.</p>

Tournament of Roses 1937! I am not sure who the fellow is that
portrays the fisherman here at the time, but he walked in front
of the float and it looked as if he was pulling the giant fish as
he was walking. That was one of the entries that Manhattan Beach
had entered into the Tournament of Roses parade.</p>
