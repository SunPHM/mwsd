          Aquaculture is one of the oldest forms of agriculture known to man. 
          In China, people have been &quot;farm raising&quot; fish for many centuries 
          but only recently has the United States begun to culture fish on a large 
          scale. The culture of marine fish, or mariculture, has been particularly 
          slow to gain popularity in this country. For decades, harvesting fish 
          from the wild has been seen as the economically advantageous method 
          for fishermen, so there has been little demand for mariculture in the 
          United States. With the decline of world fisheries, this country, along 
          with the rest of the world, will have to turn to aquaculture in order 
          to support the current levels of fish consumption. In certain cases, 
          it has been proven that a cultured product, often younger, smaller or 
          faster growing than in the wild, can greatly improve market price of 
          that species. For example, cultured growth rates of the hard clam or 
          quahog (<i>Mercenaria mercenaria</i>) are significantly higher than 
          natural growth rates. The cultured product is a small, tender, desirable 
          clam as opposed to the wild clams, which may be large, tough and undesirable. 
          The availability of food in the wild is usually quite low for carnivorous 
          finfish, like the bottom-feeding, black sea bass. Cultured fish, however, 
          can be fed to satiation on a daily basis thereby greatly increasing 
          growth rates. Also, since the farmer determines the diet of the fish, 
          he can control the nutritional intake which influences health, flavor, 
          appearance and ultimately, marketability of the fish.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="../ASSETS/AQUA%20IMAGES/fish/BWseabass.jpg" width="357" height="189" align="right">Black 
          sea bass (<i>Centropristis striata</i>) is a protogynous hermaphroditic 
          serranid. In layman's terms this means that they can change sex (hermaphrodite) 
          and that they begin their lives as females and later change into males 
          (protogynous). Also, they belong to the Serranidae, or grouper, family. 
          Black sea bass are commonly found along the North Atlantic coast from 
          Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, primarily associated with live-bottom reefs, 
          sponges, wrecks and other similar structures. One of the most popular 
          bottom fish in North America, it is commonly sought after by both commercial 
          and recreational anglers. In Georgia, sea bass are possibly the most 
          conspicuous residents of the live-bottom reefs, such as Gray's Reef 
          National Marine Sanctuary. Other species often confused with <i>C. striata</i> 
          include <i>C. ocyurus</i>, the bank sea bass and<i> C. philadelphicus</i>, 
          the rock sea bass. Neither of these species reaches a marketable size 
          and therefore is not considered to be commercially valuable<br>
          <br>
          Until recently, regulations were unnecessary for black sea bass due 
          to their large population size. The commercial demand for sea bass has 
          historically been low mainly due to the higher market price obtained 
          by their relatives, the groupers. Grouper populations have been heavily 
          depleted in recent decades, and as a result they have gone the way of 
          most other fisheries. As populations of top predators decrease, fishermen 
          begin to harvest lower predators and omnivores. This has resulted in 
          the harvest of more black sea bass. Also, in the past, sea bass have 
          not been highly prized by recreational anglers. But recently, due to 
          the increased numbers of anglers (both recreational and commercial) 
          in coastal and nearshore waters, the need for regulation has arisen. 
          The Fishery Management Plan for Black Sea Bass was approved by the Atlantic 
          States Marine Fisheries Commission in October 1996. This was the first 
          regulation designed specifically for black sea bass and it implemented 
          an 8-inch size limit on both commercial and recreational anglers as 
          well as some other gear restrictions. In February of 1999 that size 
          limit was increased to 10 inches along the Atlantic coast. What was 
          once a plentiful, relatively unimportant fish commercially is now heavily 
          regulated. Charter boat captains complain that the sea bass used to 
          be their &quot;bread and butter.&quot; When a chartered fishing trip 
          ended unsuccessfully, captains could always count on being able to stop 
          at the nearshore reefs and load up on sea bass so their customers wouldn't 
          go home empty-handed. Now with the decreased numbers of sea bass and 
          the 10-inch limit, these captains find that catching large numbers of 
          legal size sea bass is difficult.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Previous 
          aquacultural research dating back to 1970 has focused primarily on spawning 
          and hatchery techniques for sea bass. This research includes work done 
          in Florida on a subspecies, <i>C. striata melana</i>, the southern sea 
          bass. The methodology of spawning and hatchery care is well documented, 
          but research is lacking in the growth of hatchery-reared fingerlings 
          to market size, about 2 pounds. Most conclusions of previous research 
          indicate that black sea bass is an excellent candidate for aquaculture. 
          <br>
          <br>
          A substantial portion of the sea bass demand is in the live fish market 
          of the northeast United States. Fishermen trap sea bass and transport 
          them live to the market for sale to a largely Asian clientele. A resourceful 
          fisherman in McIntosh County came up with the idea that live sea bass 
          could be farm raised for a sizable profit. He came to the University 
          of Georgia Marine Extension Service for consultation and research was 
          begun to develop methods for culturing black sea bass in recirculating 
          tank systems. The method of trapping wild sea bass for culturing is 
          not a sustainable solution to the problem, so the Marine Extension Service 
          contracted a hatchery to spawn sea bass. The hatchery was to produce 
          fingerling size fish (1-3 inches long) for experimentation and ultimately 
          for the industry. The goal was to provide an economically viable and 
          sustainable method for culturing hatchery reared fingerling sea bass 
          to market size of about 900 grams.<br>
          <br>
          Research is ongoing at the Shellfish Research Lab (<b><a href="http://www.uga.edu/mariculture">SRL</a></b>) 
          on Skidaway Island and initial results have been positive. The sea bass 
          have exhibited much higher growth rates in captivity compared to natural 
          growth rates. For example, a very liberal estimate of growth from a 
          5-gram fingerling to a 900-gram (2 pounds), marketable adult is one 
          and a half years, compared to the six or seven years it would naturally 
          take the fish to reach that size. Also, initial experiments were conducted 
          in flow-through tanks, which subjected the sea bass to often deleterious 
          water quality. They exhibited high resilience to poor water quality, 
          such as high ammonia, very high water temperatures (93 F), low dissolved 
          oxygen and high turbidity (cloudiness). This high growth rate, tolerance 
          of poor water quality, and the promise of high market prices for live 
          fish make the black sea bass an excellent candidate for a fish farmer.<br>
          <br>
          Both research and marketing projections indicate that black sea bass 
          will prove to be an excellent species for mariculture. They are easily 
          grown, exhibit rapid growth in captivity and are quite hardy fish. Also 
          the live market demand for sea bass insures a substantial profit for 
          the product. Being a member of the grouper family, black sea bass has 
          a very desirable appearance and taste. For these reasons, the future 
          of black sea bass aquaculture in Georgia looks quite promising.<br>

          A local TV station has an award they give to &quot;Home town heroes&quot;. 
          The recipients are folks who make positive contributions to their communities. 
          We have some neighbors in surrounding communities who are unsung heroes. 
          I am speaking of a diverse group, in fact, they do not even all belong 
          to the same Phyla. But, they do make a positive contribution to their 
          respective biological communities. They are called <b>keystone species</b>. 
          You are, no doubt, familiar with some of these important species. But, 
          you may not realize just how valuable they are and just how many other 
          species depend on them.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="../assets/NATURE%20IMAGES/beaver.jpg" alt="picture of beaver" width="242" height="222" align="right">One 
          of the best known of these keystone species is the Beaver (<i>Castor 
          canadensis</i>). This industrious mammal helps control water levels 
          in and sometimes even helps creates wetlands themselves. The beaver's 
          damming of seasonal streams can mean life or death for numerous species 
          including insects, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and 
          mammals. Although trees are &quot;eaten&quot; or cut down by the beavers 
          during dam construction, wetland plants benefit greatly. Beaver ponds 
          are valuable reservoirs during droughts. In the southeast, with our 
          rich water resources this beaver accomplishment is not appreciated and 
          the species is even considered a pest. This is mainly because beaver 
          activity can flood commercial pine plantations. our financial well being 
          seems to take precedence over the needs of all other species.<br>
          <br>
          A walk on any of Georgia's ocean beaches at low tide takes you over 
          the hidden realm of the Ghost Shrimp (<i>Callianassa biformis</i>), 
          another keystone species. It takes some imagination to &quot;see&quot; 
          this habitat and understand the shrimp's value. The visible evidence 
          of this important species is just small holes in the wet sand with &quot;chocolate 
          sprinkles&quot; scattered around the openings. The shrimp (more closely 
          related to hermit crabs) can be as much as six feet down with in its 
          extensive burrow system. It is not alone. Other species use this habitat 
          for their living space. Worms, copepods, crabs and even fish spend some 
          or all their lives here in these protected retreats. The pumping action 
          of the shrimp's abdominal appendages bring oxygenated water and food 
          for itself and their roommates. The large amount of fecal material pumped 
          outside the borrows enriches the beach community and provides food for 
          other species including crabs, sand dollars and even fish. Millions 
          of these secretive crustaceans inhabit our beaches and their contribution 
          to beach productivity is enormous.<br>
          <br>
          The State of Georgia has honored one of our keystone species. The gopher 
          tortoise (<i>Gopherus polyphemus</i>) is Georgia's official state reptile. 
          It is listed in our state as a &quot;threatened species&quot; which 
          means it is close to becoming endangered. State reptile or not, this 
          species is in trouble and a number of other species along with it. The 
          &quot;gopher&quot;, as it is known over it's range, has the unique habit 
          of digging burrows as life long retreats. These borrows can be very 
          long and deep. Some &quot;gopher burrows&quot;measure over thirty feet 
          long and up to 12 feet deep. The temperature and humidity in the depths 
          of these holes stay constant year-round. The Gopher's habitat is sandy 
          soil areas on the coastal plain known as sandhills. Unfortunately, much 
          of this habitat is turning into residential communities and tree farms. 
          Neither of which the tortoise can survive. And when it goes so do its 
          &quot;dependents&quot;.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="../assets/NATURE%20IMAGES/tortoise.jpg" width="227" height="143" align="left"> 
          Gopher burrows are home and refuge for many species. At least 32 species 
          of arthropods call these &quot;cave like&quot; holes home. Gopher Frogs, 
          Red-tailed skinks, diamondback rattlesnakes and another threatened species, 
          the Eastern Indigo Snake, utilize these climate controlled habitats. 
          Burrowing Owls, foxes, opossums, raccoons and rodents also have lived 
          in them. In short, the gopher tortoise makes life possible for numerous 
          other species of animals. There is evidence that the tortoise's feeding 
          activity may improve growing conditions for native grasses. Humans also 
          have utilized the gopher. Unfortunately, they have done soby making 
          a quick meal of an animal that grows slowly. <br>
          <br>
          The last keystone species I would like to discuss is one of the most 
          important and misunderstood, the American Alligator (<i>Alligator mississipiensis</i>). 
          We often hear that the alligator has made a quite a comeback as well 
          as exaggerated tales of its threat to humans. Its numbers were decimated 
          by hide hunters, but protection under the Endangered Species Act gave 
          it a chance for recovery. They are once again numerous in southern wetlands, 
          rivers and swamps but, so are humans ... much more numerous. And, we 
          are far more dangerous to the gators than they are to us.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="../assets/NATURE%20IMAGES/alligator.jpg" width="168" height="267" align="right">The 
          alligator's value to the ecosystem does not result from the fine leather 
          products that can be made from its hide. Nor is it the novelty dishes 
          restaurants serve out of its meat. The stuffed gator heads sold at fairs 
          and flea markets are small change compared to its real value. Even the 
          cash tourist spend to see gators at wildlife parks can't compare. Their 
          real value is something much more basic: they dig holes. We call them 
          &quot;gator holes&quot;. The gator hole's value to the ecosystem is 
          most apparent during the dry times of year. During drought years, this 
          becomes even more evident. Alligators dig large depressions in the bottoms 
          of ponds and marshes. They maintain these pools even when the rest of 
          the pond or swamp has dried up by digging down into the groundwater 
          level. Fish, frogs, salamanders, birds and mammals all utilize these 
          &quot;wells&quot;. In fact, the Okeefenokee Swamp alone has over 40 
          species of fish that depend on gator holes for survival. On our barrier 
          islands, where fresh water is limited to rain-filled sloughs, gator 
          holes are the only place for deer and other animals to drink or wait 
          out the drought.<br>
          <br>
          We can easily understand the value of drinking water for wildlife or 
          even the fact that fish need water in which to live. But, the value 
          to the ecological balance goes even further. When the rains come again, 
          those fish will breed and spread out over the whole refilled pond. They 
          will feed on insects (more fish... fewer mosquitos). Birds will feed 
          on the fish and we can enjoy their beauty. It is a lot more complicated 
          than this, but you get the idea. The alligators also create &quot;trails&quot; 
          which allow fish, etc to move around the wetlands. This is especially 
          important in vegetation-filled fresh-water marshes like the Okeefenokee 
          Swamp or Everglades National Park. Alligators &quot;patrol&quot; under 
          wading bird colonies which are usually in trees surrounded by water. 
          This prevents predators, like the raccoon, from having easy pickings 
          on the eggs and young birds. Of course, alligators are happy to eat 
          young birds that fall from the nest. Good security comes at a price. 
          There is definitely a positive relationship between alligator protection 
          and successful nesting of our wading birds including the endangered 
          wood stork.<br>
          <br>
          The removal of a large alligator from a natural pond system can destroy 
          the entire ecological balance making it much less hospitable, not only 
          us, but countless other species as well. Even though alligator populations 
          have increased, the size structure is tilted towards small and medium 
          specimens. Large gators (over 12 feet) excavate largerr and deeper &quot;gator 
          holes&quot; which can withstand severe droughts. The math is convincing: 
          larger &quot;holes&quot; mean greater numbers of animals benefit and 
          survive droughts, and the ecological balance is improved.<br>
          <br>
          There are many other keystone species and our understanding of their 
          place in the scheme of things is only just beginning. We can learn how 
          to live in closer harmony with our environment by studying our &quot;habitat 
          hero&quot; neighbors. </font></p>

          Polychaetes- A Lively Spawning Event</font></u> </h3>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>By 
          Maryellen Timmons, Ph.D.<br>
          </i><br>
          You may have noticed swarms of worms in the rivers, by your docks, or 
          heard about them from a friend. They seem innumerable, but make no mistake, 
          you are seeing worms, billions of them! So what are they, and what are 
          they doing? These worms are most likely one of our common species of 
          worm, <i>Nereis succine</i>a, also called the clam or blood worm. It 
          is a marine relative of the common earthworm called a polychaete. Polychaetes 
          are segmented just like the earthworms, however, they have parapodia 
          (analogous to legs) that extend outwards from each segment. These parapodia 
          have bristles (called setae) that, along with muscular contractions, 
          help the worm move forward. Unlike the common earthworm, whose muscular 
          contractions move from front to back, the marine polychaetes have muscular 
          contractions that move from the rear forward. These contractions actually 
          produce forward movement!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          worm is a benthic (bottom-dwelling) organism commonly found among oyster 
          beds and along docks, crawling around other organisms such as sea squirts, 
          barnacles, and algae. It can be found in all benthic habitats except 
          the outer beaches. The clam worm, <i>Nereis</i>, provides an important 
          nutritional resource for our fish populations. If you look at the head 
          of the worm you can see that it has two formidable jaws, as well as 
          two rings of hard small teeth in its pharynx (just behind the mouth). 
          These come into play when feeding; the worm protrudes its pharynx and 
          its jaws come forward. <br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly the clam worm feeds on surface detritus and is a very generalized 
          feeder. The jaws are used for protection as well as for feeding. Reproduction 
          in marine polychaete worms often can be quite spectacular by human standards. 
          In Samoa a polychaete worm called &quot;Palolo&quot; (genus <i>Eunice</i> 
          ) spawns according to the lunar cycle. One week after the October and 
          November full moons the worms swarm to the surface at dawn and create 
          an image of wriggling brilliant colors covering the surface of the water. 
          This massive spawning is an image not soon forgotten. The Samoans collect 
          the brilliantly colored worms, eat some on the spot, and then have a 
          large feast afterwards. They don't actually collect the worms, they 
          collect the reproductive portions of the worms called epitokes. The 
          adult worms will produce a gamete-filled (containing eggs or sperm) 
          tail portion which will be released to the surface. The adult worms 
          in Samoa actually dwell in mucus-lined burrows in the crevices of the 
          reefs. Though just a reproductive portion of the worm, the epitokes 
          do have small eyes, and can be up to one foot in length! Once on the 
          surface, the tails (epitokes) will explode, and the gametes will be 
          released en masse when the sun rises. The epitokes are brightly colored; 
          the females are blue (and better tasting!), while the males are greenish 
          blue.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here 
          in Georgia our spawning version of the Palolo worm is just as spectacular. 
          During March, April, and May, our local clam worms also follow a lunar 
          cycle and rise to the surface for a spawning event. Our clam worms, 
          however, have formidable jaws even on the reproductive individuals. 
          These reproductive males and females, called heteronereids (hetero from 
          the Greek meaning different, as in two different sexes) are brilliant 
          red, white, and black during spawning and look like small fish wriggling 
          at the surface of the water. After the spawning event the fertilized 
          eggs become part of the plankton, and are in turn food for other species 
          such as crab, shrimp, and oysters. Our clam worm is not a burrower like 
          the Samoan version and can be found if you look closely at the organisms 
          attached to a dock. If you happen to come across a spawning event, take 
          a good long look, or quickly collect some to view, since the event doesn't 
          last long! </font></p>

          Right Whale in the Wrong Place</font> </h3>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>by John Crawford</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I first learned 
          about the state marine mammal of Georgia when a newborn male right whale 
          washed ashore on Little Saint Simons Island early in January of 1982. 
          I was part of the team that did the necropsy on this endangered species. 
          The infant was approximately 15 feet 4 inches long and about 200 lbs. 
          It was probably stillborn since no milk was found in its stomach and 
          the intestines contained meconium (a fetal bowel accumulation) that 
          is usually expelled soon after birth. Little did I know that years later 
          I would be helping with the necropsy of a large adult male who was possibly 
          this infant's father. <br>
          <br>
          Sometime around the 26th of 1996, one of the rarest animals on the planet 
          was swimming slowly along the coast of Georgia on a course it had undoubtedly 
          followed many times before. It was in the right place heading north 
          for a summer of feeding in the plankton-rich waters off New England. 
          Unfortunately, by coincidence, it picked the wrong time. &quot;Lindsey,&quot; 
          as he was known to researchers, a healthy Northern Right Whale, <i>Eubalena 
          glacialis</i>, was killed by a collision with a large vessel. Lindsey 
          first became known to whale researchers when he was photographed in 
          1985. In 1986 He was entered into the identification catalog and given 
          the number 1623.<br>
          <br>
          He was named Lindsey after a Daniel's Head, Nova Scotia fisherman who 
          &quot;adopted&quot; the research teams during the summer of 1988. Lindsey 
          proved on numerous sightings to be an &quot;Alpha&quot; male, who was 
          often spotted in the middle of courtship groups, having pushed other 
          males out of the way to get next to the female. <br>
          <br>
          <img src="../assets/NATURE%20IMAGES/rtwhale.jpg" width="314" height="97" align="right">On 
          January 30th, 1996, a private vessel reported sighting Lindsey's floating 
          carcass about 10 miles off of Blackbeard Island. After a small vessel 
          made several vain attempts to tow the whale, the Marine Extension Service 
          vessel, Georgia Bulldog, managed to begin moving Lindsey towards Harris 
          Neck National Wildlife Refuge. Moving slowly, Captain Lindsey Parker 
          of the Georgia Bulldog managed to maneuver the whale up a narrow creek 
          to the refuge. Waiting at Harris Neck was a large group of U.S. Fish 
          and Wildlife Service and Georgia Department of Natural Resources personnel. 
          Also in attendance were members of the press and curious onlookers. 
          It took several hours, two bulldozers, a huge CAT backhoe and quite 
          a bit of skill to pull Lindsey's 40-ton body out of the water. Once 
          the hawsers were removed, the public was allowed to approach the whale. 
          Awe was apparent on every face. This was the largest animal most of 
          us had ever seen. <br>
          <br>
          Once the whale was on land, the necropsy team began its work. Barb Zoodsma 
          and Mike Harris (GA DNR) coordinated the stranding response team. Because 
          it was nearly 6 PM, not much was accomplished the first day. However, 
          biologists did measure the blubber thickness during that evening and 
          night. They also tested the satellite transmitter and tagging technique. 
          The main necropsy effort, scheduled for 9 AM the next morning, was headed 
          up by Bob Bonde of the US Fish and Wildlife Service.<br>
          <br>
          Most available staff from MAREX headed south to Harris Neck to assist 
          in the necropsy efforts. Once suited up (in complete foul weather gear 
          and boots) we took measurements, removed blubber, collected isopods, 
          exposed the tiny ear opening, fleshed out bones, and hauled tons of 
          flesh away from the huge animal. Photographs and video footage were 
          taken and should prove very useful in our educational program. <br>
          <br>
          Late in the day, we discovered the cause of death. As we removed the 
          scapula, we saw that it was chipped and the ribs under it were fractured. 
          Then we began trying to measure the impact area by uncovering the bruised 
          flesh and blubber. As we exposed the back of the gigantic skull we could 
          see into the brain case. The skull had been crushed. Lindsey died instantly, 
          and the ship probably did not even know it hit something.<br>
          <br>
          This has been a bad year for right whales. The week after Lindsey died, 
          a dead female was reported floating about 40 miles off Fernandina Beach, 
          Florida, but was too far offshore and no attempt was made to reclaim 
          it. On February 19, an 18-foot infant right whale was spotted floating 
          about 20 miles off Cumberland Island by Georgia DNR during an aerial 
          survey of the coastal waters. This baby was taken to the veterinarian 
          hospital at the University of Florida, Gainsville, for necropsy. It 
          is feared that collision with a ship was again the cause of death. <br>
          <br>
          The northern right whale has been an important part of this country's 
          history. Its oil and baleen were vital to our cultural and industrial 
          development before the advent of fossil fuels and plastics. We have 
          never given credit where it was due. Declaring this species the state 
          marine mammal of Georgia is a step in the right direction, but most 
          Georgians do not realize that our coastal waters and those of northern 
          Florida are the right whale's only known calving grounds. With less 
          than 350 of these magnificent animals in existence, we must find ways 
          to pull them back.</font></p>

          Sunlight is the ultimate source of energy for life on earth. Sunlight 
          provides the fuel for photosynthesis. Plants use photosynthesis to capture 
          the energy from the sun and convert the energy to matter. Herbivores 
          feed off of the plants and the carnivores prey upon the herbivores. 
          Animals such as sharks that feed on other animals are called predators, 
          while animals eaten are referred to as prey. The flow of energy through 
          plants to predators is referred to as a food chain. Food chains may 
          become quite complex depending upon the number of organisms present 
          in a habitat. For instance, a simple food chain would be a whelk, a 
          marine snail, that preys on oysters. Oysters, marine bivalves, filter 
          the water and consume single celled marine algae called phytoplankton. 
          Marine algae utilize sunlight to grow. Thus, energy moves from the sun 
          to the algae, to oysters, and to the whelk. A more complex food chain 
          would be the algae supporting the oyster, which is eaten by the whelk, 
          which in turn may be eaten by the horse conch, which could be eaten 
          by a stingray, which may be eaten by man. The horse conch could feed 
          directly off of the oyster. Man of course also can eat the oyster, whelk, 
          or horse conch.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="../assets/NATURE%20IMAGES/whelk.jpg" width="113" height="196" align="right">In 
          the coastal waters of Georgia, four different species of predatory whelks 
          occur. Whelks belong to the family Melongenidae. The whelk species are 
          : the knobbed whelk, <i>Busycon carica</i>; the lightning whelk, <i>Busycon 
          sinistrum</i>; the pearwhelk, <i>Busycotypus spiratus</i>; and the channeled 
          whelk, <i>Busycotypus canalicatum</i>. The knobbed whelk is the most 
          abundant species and supports an offshore fishery in Georgia. <br>
          <br>
          Whelks are predators, but they are also scavengers. Whelks will prey 
          on a wide range of species, but concentrate on marine bivalves such 
          as oysters, clams, mussels, scallops and arks. They will also eat dead 
          animals such as dead fish or crabs. Whelks are slow moving snails, so 
          they can not hunt down a fast moving fish or crab. But if something 
          else killed the crab or fish and left parts of it behind, whelks will 
          feed off the recent or decayed remains.<br>
          <br>
          In Georgia, whelks generally occur in the subtidal areas or in underwater 
          areas below the lowest tidal level. However, in spring and fall, whelks 
          can be seen migrating onto the intertidal flats, areas exposed at low 
          tide, in search of oysters and clams. A whelk moves by crawling along 
          on its large massive muscular foot. During summer and winter when the 
          whelks cannot survive the high and low air temperatures, they remain 
          in subtidal areas. In the subtidal areas, whelks search for the various 
          species of arks to feed upon.<br>
          <br>
          Arks, the subject of my initial quest, are a primitive form of marine 
          bivalve which feed on phytoplankton as an oyster does. Arks belong to 
          the family Arcidae and numerous species occur in the coastal waters 
          of Georgia. The three larger sized and more abundant species are: the 
          blood ark,<i> Anadara ovalis</i>; the incongruous ark, <i>Anadara brasiliana</i>; 
          and the ponderous ark, <i>Noetia ponderosa</i>. The blood ark occurs 
          inshore to just offshore, the incongruous ark lives in sand along the 
          coastal beaches to approximately 2 miles offshore, and the ponderous 
          ark inhabits muddy-sand bottoms primarily in offshore areas. The blood 
          and ponderous arks occur in muddy-sandy to muddy bottoms. All species 
          reach a shell length of approximately 2.5 to 3 inches. Generally, the 
          incongruous ark has a clean white to yellowish colored shell. This ark 
          is the species commonly found washed up along our coastal beaches. The 
          blood and ponderous arks are covered with a brown to black hairy-like 
          outer covering called a periostracum. The periostracum helps to keep 
          the animal from sinking in mud bottoms and is believed to act as a predator 
          prevention device. The periostracum, which is slippery when wet, helps 
          to keep the whelk from holding the ark in its muscular foot.<br>
          <br>
          Whelks will prey on marine bivalves in two ways. If the bivalve is small 
          enough or has a thin shell, the whelk will crush the shell in its large 
          muscular foot. If unable to crack the shell, the whelk will hold the 
          prey in its foot. The whelk will then continuously rub the bivalve&#146;s 
          shell at its margin against its own shell along its shell&#146;s outer 
          whorl. By continuously scraping the bivalve shell, a small thin hole 
          will form along the margin of the shell. When the hole is wide enough, 
          the whelk will insert its proboscis through the hole into the bivalve 
          shell. Within the proboscis is series of teeth called a radula. The 
          radula is used to shred the animal which is then passed to the whelk&#146;s 
          mouth and ingested.<br>
          <br>
          Arks use byssal threads during their early life history in order to 
          keep from being washed away with the currents. As very small juveniles, 
          the size of a sand grain, many marine bivalves have the ability to attach 
          to solid objects by cementing numerous tiny threads produced from a 
          gland located in their foot to various objects located on the sea bottom. 
          Many bivalves only use byssal threads for the first few weeks of life. 
          Some species of arks and scallops use byssal threads only during three 
          to six months of their juvenile stage of life. A few bivalves species 
          such as mussels may use byssal threads throughout their life. Arks generally 
          attach to any item found on the bottom, including worm tubes, rocks, 
          oysters, dead shells, adult arks, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Last summer, while trying to collect live blood arks to perform some 
          growth studies, I was informed that I could collect some small, live 
          arks from the beach on St. Simons Island. I did indeed find the arks. 
          The easiest means of collecting them was to find a knobbed whelk which 
          could easily be located in the surf by hand or foot. By pulling up the 
          foot long whelk, we found anywhere from 1 to 14 arks attached to the 
          shell of the whelk. The arks were attached to the whelk&#146;s shell 
          by byssal threads and were approximately the size of a quarter. Attaching 
          to the shell of a whelk ensured that the baby arks were not washed away 
          by the constant wave action in the beach surf; however, attaching to 
          the back of a whelk, one of its main predators, is like trying to ride 
          on the back of a tiger. If you fall off, you can be eaten.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the winter 
          months when the shrimping season closes in Georgia, some local fishermen 
          put away their shrimp nets and install heavier duty nets to begin trawling 
          for whelks. Whelks, which are large-sized marine snails, support a major 
          fishery in Georgia. There is a large market for whelks in northeastern 
          U.S. cities where they are sold as seafood in ethnic markets and restaurants. 
          Italian restaurants use whelks in a dish called scungilli, but whelks 
          (sometimes sold as the more familiar &#145;conch&#146;) can also be 
          used in snail salads and for fritters. Georgia fishermen trawl for whelks 
          during the winter months after the close of the shrimping season and 
          into early spring. <br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Harvesting</b></u><br>
          <br>
          There are four species of whelks in Georgia: the knobbed whelk, Busycon 
          carica; the lightning whelk, Busycon sinistrum; the channeled whelk, 
          <i>Busycotypus canaliculatus</i>; and the pear whelk,<i> Busycotypus 
          spiratus</i>. These whelks are harvested using various methods. Offshore 
          trawling for the knobbed whelk accounts for the majority of the whelks 
          caught and sold in Georgia. Whelks are generally found crawling on or 
          partially buried in the soft sea floor. Trawling for whelk is similar 
          to shrimping, but the nets are designed a little differently. Whelk 
          nets have larger holes or meshes than those found in shrimp nets. Whelk 
          nets also have a heavier chain installed in the front of the net so 
          that the whelks can be harvested below the sediment. In addition, blue 
          crab fishermen harvest the channeled whelk as a by-product of their 
          fishery. The channeled whelk will enter a crab trap in search of the 
          bait; other local species of whelk usually will not. Finally, oystermen 
          and clammers will pick up knobbed whelks, lightning whelks, and channeled 
          whelks from the intertidal zone while gathering oyster and clams. Whelks 
          will migrate seasonally into the intertidal zone to prey on oysters 
          and clams in the spring and fall. Whelks tend to migrate off the intertidal 
          flat during summer and winter months, possibly to avoid extreme high 
          and low temperatures. <br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Life History</b></u><br>
          <br>
          We know very little about the life history of the various whelk species 
          inhabiting our coastal waters. Large numbers of knobbed whelks typically 
          occur in Georgia, with pear whelks occurring rarely. The largest sized 
          whelk is the lightning whelk, which may reach sixteen inches in length 
          versus the knobbed whelk which reaches only nine inches in length. The 
          channeled whelk reaches seven inches, while the pear whelk grows to 
          only four inches. The <i>Busycon</i> species have a thicker and heavier 
          shell than the <i>Busycotypus</i> species. <br>
          <br>
          Whelk eggs resemble a telephone cord but actually consist of a number 
          of separate capsules attached to a &#147;string&#148;. Each capsule 
          may contain from 0-20 eggs depending on the species of whelk and the 
          location of the capsule on the string. Frequently the first 5-15 capsules 
          are empty, with the number of eggs per subsequent capsule increasing 
          toward the end of the string. Since the beginning of the string is buried 
          in the substrate as an anchor and the eggs may not be able to survive 
          under the substrate, the female may be conserving energy by not placing 
          eggs into these capsules. Energy conservation is very important at this 
          stage in the female&#146;s life; laying a string of over 100 capsules 
          may take days to produce! This process can be very strenuous to the 
          female! <br>
          <br>
          Most marine mollusks have external fertilization of eggs in the water 
          column, followed by a planktonic larval development phase. However, 
          when the female whelk deposits egg capsules, the embryos inside are 
          already fertilized. This is because fertilization is internal in these 
          species of whelks. This makes them unique compared to most mollusks 
          in that the young hatch out of these capsules as fully formed juveniles. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Management</b></u><br>
          <br>
          Gathering life history information on whelks is very important if we 
          wish to wisely manage this natural resource. Information on growth rates 
          of the various species, sex ratios, and reproductive patterns is required 
          to manage this fishery. For instance, offshore trawling for whelks occurs 
          in the early spring when whelks deposit their eggs. The large mesh size 
          of the nets that are used during this process gather the larger-sized 
          females, while allowing the smaller-sized males to pass through the 
          net. The danger in this harvesting schedule is that the fishery is removing 
          the females from the population at a greater rate than the males. In 
          addition, shrimping in offshore areas during the fall occurs when whelks 
          are once again depositing their eggs. Therefore, both the whelk and 
          shrimp nets are dislodging the egg case strings that contain the juvenile 
          whelks. Once the egg case strings are dislodged, they wash up on the 
          beach and desiccate. In terms of reproductive biology, females are the 
          important sex. Thus, when a fishery removes reproductive females from 
          the population, while at the same time removing the egg cases, the fishery 
          may be headed for trouble.<br>
          <br>
          <u><b>Tagging Studies</b></u><br>
          <br>
          That is where our tagging studies come in. We want to learn as much 
          as possible about the life history of whelks in order to protect the 
          fishery and the whelk populations of Georgia. This may prevent the decline 
          in both whelk populations and fishermen&#146;s paychecks! We will be 
          gathering valuable data for three of the species: knobbed, lightning, 
          and channeled whelks. This data will be used to develop scientific information 
          needed to wisely regulate the whelk fishery in coastal Georgia. To date 
          we have tagged nearly 10,000 whelks and released them in the Wassaw 
          Sound area. Whelks have been released at Cabbage Island, Pa Cooper Creek, 
          Dead Man Hammock of Wassaw Island, Mud Island, and at the mouth of House 
          Creek, Little Tybee Island. Prior to their release, each whelk was measured 
          for its shell length and width, and then tagged with an individual marker 
          specific to that individual whelk.<br>
          <br>
          Our objective is to find as many of these tagged whelks as possible. 
          By doing this many times over the next couple of years, we hope to be 
          able to generate the data required to determine the natural growth rate 
          of the various whelk species. Furthermore, by determining where the 
          whelks are at each sample period, we hope to document migrational patterns 
          for the whelks.<br>
          <br>
          Most of the released whelks were collected by the crew of the R/V GEORGIA 
          BULLDOG. The crew is presently attempting to design and test a Turtle 
          Excluder Device (TED) for use by the conch (whelk) industry in Georgia 
          to prevent the drowning of sea turtles. Whelks gathered by the GEORGIA 
          BULLDOG were collected from the south shipping channel of St. Simons 
          Sound.<br>
