      <p align="Justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOFI is primarily a MIDI operated instrument, however. That means, she is 
 played by a computer interfacing with her relays, just like the rolls do, 
 except the computer operates the relays directly and not through the roll 
 interface switch banks. The computer and MIDI converter are not actually 
a part of SOFI. They are her media, providing a musical input signal, just 
like a roll would do.</span></p>
      <p align="Justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; "><img src="http://www.player-care.com/cb/sofi-cds/remotecb.jpg" alt="The Remote Control Box." width="160" height="138" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="Left">
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a box connected to SOFI called the Remote 
Box.  This is a control box that allows her lights turned on manually, as 
well as any rank of pipes switched on or off at any time, as well as all the
percussion  and even sound effects operated from the coffee table. The real
advantage  is when a standard "O" rolls is being played. With this box, you
are able  to orchestrate to your heart's content. But the remote box is also
able to  test every function of this instrument as well. Its 7 connectors 
allow a servicing of the instrument that is almost automatic, as well as a
full tuning, since its tuning switches for every pipe in the machine are normally
upside down, hidden on the bottom of the box.</span></p>
      <p align="Justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; "><img src="http://www.player-care.com/cb/sofi-cds/facade.jpg" alt="SOFI with her facade removed. Makes tuning her a breeze." width="260" height="205" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="Right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliability and ease of access was paramount in this 
 design. Since only machinery that is easy to service is going to get serviced, 
SOFI was designed to service. She has a full set of schematics and documentation. 
 All her circuits are divided into 4 steel boxes which detach from the back 
 and sides of the piano for ease of inspection. There are no circuit cards 
 and no solid state in these boxes, except for the power supplies. The 3 solo
 pipe chests can be stripped to tune in less than 10 minutes, including the
 removal <img src="http://www.player-care.com/cb/sofi-cds/rightcab.jpg" alt="Right cabinet, showing the bass drum, and other sound effects." width="176" height="250" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="Left">
of the xylophone. The accompaniment chest is already open from the back
 and easily tuned. It is possible for one man to tune the entire instrument.
 Repairs on the solo pipe valves are easily made without removing any pipes.
 They can be fixed from the bottoms, which drop away for full access.

</span></p>
      <p align="Justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case of SOFI is a "pre-fab," and most of the panels are flat. The widest 
 would be the solo chests, which are 6" deep. She sits on a "shadow foundation 
 board," which forms her outline on the floor and connects together with couplings.
 This type of foundation relies on shims to be made level. At present, SOFI
 sits mostly on carpet, and partly on a hard floor, and yet has remained
perfectly  fitted. Her front is still exactly vertical. <img src="http://www.player-care.com/cb/sofi-cds/fulwelen.jpg" alt="SOFI/w Craig and Ellen." width="300" height="257" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="Right">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her panels are drawn together with 1/4-20 bolts and threaded inserts,
mostly,  and the core wood used is Medex, a stable, fine-grained wood product
that  machines as well as plastic composites. It is neither flake board or
the  common counter top material, but a very high quality, stable composition 
board that allows a highly precision construction. The other members are fabricated
vertical beams and a long rear horizontal truss beam for light  weight and
strength, and are mortised together as a single structural member, yet as
strong as solid wood of the same cross section. Oak "T" beam rafters are
then set into slots in the top horizontal joists to complete the construction. 
 Simple and efficient.</span></p>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I arrange a tune for SOFI, I first 
 look through the available arrangements that I already have. How can I beat 
 an Ampico or Duo-Art arrangement? So that's what I go for, because they have
 so much potential!                       
      <p align="Justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, 
 I will arrange a song from scratch. The difference between doing it that 
way and picking a great arrangement already available is usually 2-3 weeks 
of time. Granted, I might not keep much of the original scoring, because so
many changes have to be made, but beginning this way is often faster because 
 of the placement of the notes in the melody line. Also, their arrangements 
 gives me the opportunity to improve on them, often as not. After all, SOFI 
 can provide more complex melody interplay than can a piano alone.<img src="http://www.player-care.com/cb/sofi-cds/shutter.jpg" alt="Automatic Shutter Mechanism. 6 levels of expression." width="260" height="173" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="1" align="Right"></p>
      <p align="Justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing your 
 own arrangements from scratch are sometimes more satisfying and often necessary,
  and there are many songs that were never recorded on rolls that need more 
 exposure and a fresh approach, so in that case, I would choose a totally 
new arrangement.</p>
      <p align="Justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a musician 
 but not by trade. Therefore, my time is limited to what I can afford to give
 these personal arrangements. There are other musician/arrangers who do this
 as part of their livelihood and these people will truly appreciate SOFI's
 "friendliness" and capacity to make their arrangements sound spectacular. 
 One reason is because SOFI has few limitations compared to most orchestrions. 
 It's so nice to hear in your mind's ear what you intend to let everyone else
 hear for the first time. As an arranger, you don't have to make as many
concessions  regarding the limitation of the mechanics, like the number of
pipes playing  at any given time, or the rapidity you can expect from your
percussion, or  the overall drain on the vacuum and pressure resources to
the overall arrangement  and its requirements. This makes arranging music 
for SOFI less time-consuming  and therefore, cheaper. It also allows for much
more complex arrangements  and in particular, the percussion track.</p>
      <p align="Justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason 
 arrangements for SOFI are so reasonable is that she was designed to be easily
  programmed. Her "O" roll scale is "intuitive." Her presets and multiplexing 
 are done on the same computer program the notes are placed on, just like 
a player roll. That program is called Cakewalk, available for sale in computer 
 stores. The setup program which conforms Cakewalk for SOFI's own use has 
already been written by George Bogatko and available from him so the format 
requirements are quite simple. Connected to SOFI and sitting at the computer 
terminal is also a handy indicator box that shows which presets and instruments 
are on and off. As you activate certain switches on the computer screen, the
box changes accordingly, and LEDs turn on and off to indicate. There's no
question what it was you did. That little box also contains switches to do
the same thing manually. This is not the Remote Box mentioned earlier.</p>
      <p align="Justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another nice 
 feature for any arranger is that her ranks and presets can be switched instantly, 
 as you will notice, even splitting a musical phrase (when you get the knack 
 of it), and this is a capacity that is not heard in any other orchestrion. 
 It is a capacity however that is allowed by the "O" roll original format 
when multiplexed. Yet the level of SOFI technology is identical to turn-of-the-century 
 technology except for the medium the music is on, and the advantage of that 
 old technology is the ultimate reward: Reliability and Repair-ability. Her 
 other strong advantage is her amenability to play new arrangements with a
 minimum of adjustments and special consideration for instrument limitations, 
 so common in other similar instruments. The end result of these musical advantages
 is that SOFI won't bleed its owner dry trying to afford it new songs or
tunings  and repairs. As a matter of fact, most people with a musical background
would  have fun arranging their own tunes, given the chance.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not want to offer recordings until we felt 
that  they would do SOFI some semblance of justice. The following 5 CDs are 
an example of a new, budding technology for home recording buffs called Direct 
Digital Recording. It is done straight into an audio-digital USB terminal 
called an audio-USB converter,  and into a computer. These recordings have 
not been doctored, and are as true to life as I could get them. I am pleased 
with the way they turned out.<span style="font-size: 10pt; "></span></p>
