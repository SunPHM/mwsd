<TD>Generally, accommodations can be found in three areas - the town of
Jackson, Teton Village at the base of the lifts, and on the Teton Village
Road (Highway 390) in between.&nbsp; Teton Village is about 12 miles from
Jackson and an excellent area bus service links the two if you don't plan
to rent a car.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="mapjh3.jpg" ALT="Map of Jackson Hole valley" HEIGHT=304 WIDTH=436></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>Teton Village has a few hotels, a couple inns, and LOTS of condos and
rental homes.&nbsp; It also is home of the famous Mangy Moose Saloon for
nightlife and has a few shops and restaurants.&nbsp; People and families
stay here who plan to mostly ski, but in the winter, rates can be quite
high for the privilege of being near the slopes.&nbsp;

<P>About 4 miles south of Teton Village (along Highway 390 on the way to
Jackson) is an area containing the Jackson Hole Racquet Club Condos &amp;
Rental Homes,&nbsp; the Teton Pines Townhouses, and the Sassy Moose Inn.&nbsp;
A small "mall" at the Racquet club has an excellent restaurant, a small
market, and liquor store.&nbsp; The rates are VERY reasonable at these
condos and homes during the winter, but be prepared to drive 8 miles to
town and 4 miles to the ski area, or use the area bus.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The town of Jackson is full of motels, hotels, inns, and B&amp;Bs of
every sort and kind from budget variety to luxury lodges.&nbsp; It only
has a few condominium resorts, one is at Snow King and another is the Jackson
Hole Lodge.&nbsp; Those wanting to be near nightlife, lots of restaurants,
and shopping might best stay in town rather than Teton Village.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>I made a map which shows many of the accommodations in the three Jackson
areas.&nbsp; Most of the shops and restaurants are within a 4 block area
of the Town Square shown below with a red star&nbsp;<IMG SRC="redstar.gif" HEIGHT=15 WIDTH=16>.&nbsp;</TD>

<P>Accommodations in the town of Jackson consists of motels, hotels, inns,
lodges, and B&amp;Bs... there's very few condominiums - most of those are
out at Teton Mountain.&nbsp; Visitors will find a wide range of choices
from basic motel rooms to luxury suites.&nbsp;

<P>Kenny and I spent a few days visiting some of the most upscale inns
while looking for a place for our family of 10 to vacation (4 couples plus
twin grandchildren) and also for a couple looking for a romantic hideaway.&nbsp;

<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ALPINE HOUSE</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Alpine House started with 6 rooms ten years ago and since added 15 deluxe
rooms and suites in a lovely new wing, giving a wide choice of accommodations
from cozy bedrooms (some with a loft) to a 1 bedroom suite with a separate
living room.&nbsp;

<P>The Inn is one of the most cheerful places we've stayed both in decor
and hospitality of the owners and staff.&nbsp; An abundance of big french
glass doors and windows bring in lots of sunshine and light.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="alpdine1.jpg" ALT="Great room with dining tables and cozy sitting area" HEIGHT=308 WIDTH=404></CENTER>


<P>The main room of the House holds a sitting area near the entry plus
tables and chairs for guest breakfasts, a "expresso bar" room, and long
tile counter next to the kitchen where guests will find breakfast goodies
each morning and snacks every afternoon.&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="alploft1.jpg" ALT="One of the loft rooms with ladder to the double bed above." HSPACE=8 VSPACE=8 HEIGHT=334 WIDTH=249 ALIGN=RIGHT>The
6 original rooms are on a second floor mezzanine - three on each side.&nbsp;
Two (101 and 106) are large rooms with queen beds and a private balcony;
two (102 &amp; 105) are standard rooms with queen beds; and two (103 &amp;
104) are unique loft rooms - one with a king bed and the other with a queen
bed both with ladders to a loft holding a double bed - see the side photo.&nbsp;
These rooms would be perfect for a family of three or four.&nbsp;

<P>The 103 King loft connects to 102 standard queen for those who might
want accommodations for up to 6 people.&nbsp; The rooms on this side of
the mezzanine all have large french doors opening to a outdoor balcony
running past all three rooms to a stairs conveniently leading to the parking
area below.&nbsp;&nbsp; All are decorated bright colors and scandinavian
furnishings.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The main downstairs area connects to a long hallway leading to a pretty
library room in the new section - a place to relax and enjoy a cracking
fire and view the front yard through large french doors (I saw three deer
wandering down the street one night!).&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="alpliv1.jpg" ALT="Library living room in the new section" HEIGHT=264 WIDTH=344></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The new bedrooms and suites are on the 2nd and 3rd levels.&nbsp; The
2nd floor holds 5 bedrooms - on one side of the hall is 109 and 110 - both
Standard Queen rooms and 111 which is a large King Deluxe room.&nbsp; The
other side of the hall has 113, a King Deluxe (can accommodate handicapped
people - a small elevator is right next to the room) that features a twin
size sofa chair (for a 3rd person) and large bathroom with a Jacuzzi...
plus 112 a one bedroom suite - King bed in the bedroom with a sofa and
fireplace in the living room and Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom.&nbsp; All
rooms have large french doors that open onto a 12" wide balcony only large
enough to stand on.&nbsp; In summer, the doors can be opened to the breezes
and cool mountain air.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The third level holds a variety of rooms and suites - one in the front
corner is a large Grand King with small sitting area, fireplace, large
balcony, and wonderful view of Snow King mountain.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="alp-121+.jpg" ALT="Deluxe King room with fireplace" HEIGHT=263 WIDTH=344></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The staff is friendly and makes guests feel right at home in a relaxed,
bright and cheery atmosphere.&nbsp; MJ (Mary Jane) is one of the receptionists
and often the one who answers when you call to make reservations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The chef is busy all day long - making wonderful breakfasts in the morning
and delightful cookies or snacks each afternoon.&nbsp;

<P>A full gourmet breakfast is included in the rates and starts with a
smorgasbord of cereals, fruit, juices, and breads presented on a long serving
bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders are then taken for a hot breakfast which varies
each day.&nbsp; We enjoyed a southwest breakfast burrito one morning and
feasted on eggs benedict another day.&nbsp; The chalkboard below shows
a menu of "Blackberry pancakes with pure Vermont maple syrup" and "Rustic
Frittata with country sausage, portabella mushrooms, roma tomatoes, and
chevre cheese".&nbsp; YES, it was good!&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="alpchef1.jpg" ALT="Chef Eric Bartle" HEIGHT=261 WIDTH=404></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>Chef Eric also prepares an "afternoon delight" at 4 pm which can be
anything from fresh baked cookies to freshly made salsa &amp; chips or
a selection of cheeses and crackers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wine and beer is available
during happy hour.&nbsp;

<P>The Inn has a sauna downstairs and outdoor hot tub for guests' enjoyment,
and also a massage room.&nbsp; The only amenity missing was a washer &amp;
dryer for guests which would make a long stay much easier than walking
2 blocks in either direction to a public laundromat.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="alpbed1.jpg" ALT="A queen room" HEIGHT=259 WIDTH=344></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>During our visit, lots of honeymoon couples were staying at Alpine
House and several families too.&nbsp; Children of all ages are welcome
and cribs are available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guests will enjoy the spaciousness
of the inn, the friendly staff, and the perfect location on a quiet street
in Jackson only 3 blocks from the square.&nbsp;

<P>The Alpine has one of the largest common areas of the inns in Jackson,
giving guests lots of lounging room.&nbsp; Overall, I give the Alpine House
a high rating for "best value" in the upscale inn and B&amp;B department.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(and kudos to Chef Eric for some delightful breakfasts and afternoon creations!)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Winter rates range from $130 to $295 and include breakfast.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#990000">RUSTY PARROT LODGE&nbsp;</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>The Rusty Parrot is Jackson's only 4 star accommodation and is pure
luxury.&nbsp; Built in 1990, the owners created one of the most desirable
"hideaways" in Jackson.&nbsp;&nbsp; A western decor is evident throughout
with log beams, western art and accents.&nbsp; The main area has a big
sofa and chairs in front of a massive fireplace with dining tables and
chairs scattered nearby.&nbsp; The open kitchen has a long serving bar
for breakfast, afternoon snacks, and refreshments.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rplob1.jpg" ALT="Rusty Parrot living area with dining tables and refreshment bar" HEIGHT=242 WIDTH=574></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>Three levels of 31 bedrooms provide lots of accommodation choices from
spacious Garden level rooms at $260 a night to some with a double whirlpool
bath and fireplace at $295.&nbsp; It has one luxury suite at $550 a night.&nbsp;
Each room has handcrafted furniture, down comforters, oversized bathrooms,
and television.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rpbed2.jpg" ALT="Rusty Parrot King suite with in-room Jaccuzi large enough for two" HEIGHT=242 WIDTH=534></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The location is only four blocks from Jackson Square and next to a
large park, giving an atmosphere of being in the country, rather than in
the middle of Jackson.&nbsp; Many times during our visits, we've seen deer
wandering through the park.&nbsp; The second floor has a large hot tub
for guests and overlooks the park and Snow King Mountain.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="snoking1.jpg" ALT="hot tub and deck view of Snow King ski area" HEIGHT=290 WIDTH=444></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The Body Sage is located in the Rusty Parrot and provides spa treatments
of every type plus massage therapists ready to relax those tired muscles
after a long day of skiing.&nbsp; Same day laundry service is available
for those with an extensive stay.&nbsp;

<P>Guests will enjoy gastronomic breakfasts created by talented chef Jason
such as "Boursin scramble with roasted potatoes, seared beef tenderloin,
a poached egg with hollandaise" or "Citrus spiced French toast with pure
Vermont maple syrup", OR "Rustic rolled oats with golden raisins and brown
sugar".&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="rpchef1.jpg" ALT="Waitress Kim and Chef Jason Sharp" HEIGHT=301 WIDTH=364></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The Rusty Parrot is now serving dinner, a good addition for an inn
this size.&nbsp; We started with Seafood Saffron Chowder, followed by Fresh
Sea Bass and Smoked Salmon Fish Cake appetizer, and then feasted on a Seared
Beef Tenderloin with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Fresh Asparagus, and
drizzled with a Bernaise sauce - all excellent.&nbsp; Right after dinner,
a curious deer showed up at the glass doors much to the delight of guests!&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The Rusty Parrot is a wonderful destination for those who love romantic
getaways, luxurious surroundings, superb breakfasts, elegant dinners, and
a full service lodge.&nbsp;

<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#09668E">INN ON THE CREEK</FONT></B></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="creek1.jpg" ALT="small creek next to Inn on the Creek" HEIGHT=284 WIDTH=377></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>As its name implies, this inn sits at the edge of Jackson next to a
delightful little creek, often full of ducks floating by.&nbsp; It is located
5 blocks from Jackson Square in a very secluded part of town.&nbsp; It
has nine rooms, six in the main inn and three located in an adjacent building
with a different entry and access.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>A living area with adjoining breakfast and refreshment bar greets guests
upon entering the inn.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Continental breakfast of hot drinks,
juice, and breakfast breads is served to guests every morning and is included
in rates.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="incrkli.v1.jpg" ALT="Living room and breakfast bar at Inn on the Creek" NOSAVE HEIGHT=302 WIDTH=424></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The rooms provide deluxe choices for guests, ranging from cozy standard
rooms at $159 a night in winter to some with an in-room Jacuzzi and fireplace
for $239.&nbsp; Interestingly, the fireplace is located JUST above the
Jacuzzi in this room!&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="incrkbd1.jpg" ALT="King bedroom with fireplace above Jaccuzi tub" HEIGHT=274 WIDTH=364></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>Inn on the Creek also has a big beautiful Grand Suite with a large
living-dining area complete with full kitchen, plus bedroom and oversized
Jacuzzi.&nbsp; This first floor unit overlooks the creek and provides one
of the most spacious one bedroom accommodations found in Jackson - a good
rate too at $449 a night.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="incrk1.jpg" ALT="One bedroom suite living room with full kitchen and dining table" HEIGHT=275 WIDTH=444></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The dining area is next to a fireplace with two wing chairs.&nbsp;
The door leads to a spacious bedroom and the full sized kitchen is just
to the right of the table and includes a breakfast bar with four chairs.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="incrkdi1.jpg" ALT="dining room and kitchen" HEIGHT=212 WIDTH=554></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>The Inn has a hot tub for guests and also laundry facilities.&nbsp;
Reception will be happy to suggest places for dinner or arrange day trips.&nbsp;

<P>If you are looking for deluxe accommodations in a lovely and quiet location,
then Inn on the Creek would be a good choice.&nbsp; It might also be perfect
for small groups or large families with older children.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#400080">HUFF HOUSE INN&nbsp;</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>If you enoy Victorian Bed &amp; Breakfasts, the Huff House Inn should
be your destination!&nbsp; Built in 1917 by a Jackson Doctor, the home
has been lovingly restored by present owners Jackie and Weldon Richardson
as a historical and comfortable place to stay.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="hufliv1.jpg" ALT="Part of the Huff House large living area" HEIGHT=293 WIDTH=404></CENTER>


<P>The house has a large living room, dining room, sun porch and five bedrooms
- all filled with heirloom furniture.&nbsp; Two bedrooms are on the first
floor; three are upstairs and each has their own bathroom.&nbsp; The largest
is the Huff Room on the main floor and features a whirlpool tub in addition
to a large bedroom suite with a sitting area.&nbsp; The upstairs bedrooms
are spacious and decorated with pretty pastels as shown below.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="hufbed1.jpg" ALT="One of the upstairs bedrooms" HEIGHT=265 WIDTH=384></CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>Four modern cottages, only a few steps from the main house, offer spacious
surroundings, each with a covered porch, king bed, a sleeper sofa, fireplace,
and huge bathroom with a whirlpool tub. These would be a good choice for
a couple needing extra space or a small family.&nbsp; All rooms and cottages
have a T.V., telephone, and hairdryer.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="hufcot1.jpg" ALT="Huff House cottage - very spacious" HEIGHT=264 WIDTH=444></CENTER>


<P>Children are welcome at the Huff House Inn and probably would be most
comfortable in one of the cottages.&nbsp;

<P>The location is on a quiet street only two blocks from Jackson Square.&nbsp;
Rates include a full breakfast and during winter, house rooms are $159
to $199 a night while cottages are $249.&nbsp;
