Hi!  My name is David, but you probably already knew that.  That's
me in the picture with the bass.  I've taken up the alto bass guitar.
Never heard of that instrument?  Let me tell you about it. 

<P>

The Alto Bass Guitar is set to exactly 1/2 scale of a normal bass guitar.  
They are tuned one octave above a normal bass too.  Pretty cool
instrument.  They don't give you quite the nice rumble as a normal bass,
but they have been known to hold their own in many bands throughout
Europe.  I was fortunate enough to have obtained one of the first shipped
to the United States.  Once they hit domestic markets, they should be
really affordable for most bass players.  

<P>

Ok, there is no such thing as an alto-bass guitar as far as I know.  Not
even in Europe...  So what is it that I'm holding?  That's just my normal
full-sized 5 string bass.  I just had a little fun with some image editing
software.  Yes, everything in the photo is real, but not everything is to
scale.

<P>

Hopefully I've held your attention long enough to allow for the other
images to download.  I hope you enjoy my page!

<P>

Hey, I bet you didn't even notice the banner ad up top... I designed that 
motherboard myself.  Yep, 5 years and two Electrical Engineering degrees 
later this is what I have to say for myself. :)  Check it out!  Ok, if you 
haven't figured it out, that motherboard is a COMPLETE JOKE.  That was the 
point...  Judging from the response I have gotten, people aren't realizing 
that.

I graduated from Indiana State University with two Bachelor of Science 
degrees on May 5th, 2001.  My two degrees are Electronics Engineering 
Technology and Computer Hardware Technology.
<P>
I'm really looking forward to getting out into the real world and making 
my own path in life.  As the famous poet Robert Frost once said, choosing 
the path less taken has made all the difference.  I want my life to make a 
difference in the world.  In other words, if you come to a fork in the 
road, by all means take it!

My <a href="resume.htm">Resume</a> is available for download if you are
interested in seeing what I have been doing during the past few years.

WEB PAGE AUTHORING
</center>
<hr>
<img src="web.jpg" align="right">
My most recent web page work is the <a href="http://www.zionlake.com">Zion
Lake</a> page.<P>

I also designed and maintain a web page for the students at my church -
<a href="http://students.eaglechurch.com">Impact</a><P> 
<P>
There are a few more I have designed, but most of them were for short term 
projects, and are no longer available online.
<P>
Ah, do you want to see my first ever web page just for grins and giggles?  
I thought so... <a href="http://members.iquest.net/~dbonner/">Click

<EMBED SRC="sos.swf" swLiveConnect=FALSE WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150

In college, a few buddies and I formed a band that we called <a
href="http://www.soldoutsoldiers.org">SOS</a>. 
<P>
We were a Christian contemporary folk/rock band in terms of style.  
<P>
<a href="sos.htm">Click Here</a> to hear our demo CD in Real Audio
format.<P>
We were together since December of 1999.  In that time we toured
around the state using our music to share our message.  
<P>
We recorded our first full length CD in the spring of 2000.<P>

<img src="eagle.gif" align="right">
I go to church at <a
href="http://www.eaglechurch.com">Eagle Church</a> in Zionsville, 
Indiana.  I love playing bass in the worship band and hanging out with 
the <a href="http://students.eaglechurch.com">student ministry</a> 
there.<P>

When I was at school, I went to <a
href="http://www.indstate.edu/scamps">Christian Campus Ministry</a>
where I was involved with music ministry, leadership, and missions.<P>

The ministry of <a href="http://www.zionlake.org">Zion Lake</a> has
provided a great setting for retreats and other Christian events.

Printer Repair
</center>
<P>
When a guy's printer type began to grow faint, he called a 
local repair shop where a friendly man informed him that the 
printer probably needed only to be cleaned. Because the store 
charged $50 for such cleanings, he told him he might be 
better off reading the printer's manual and trying the 
job himself.
<P>
Pleasantly surprised by his candor, he asked, "Does your boss 
know that you discourage business?"
<P>
"Actually, it's my boss's idea," the employee replied 
sheepishly. "We usually make more money on repairs if we let 
people try to fix things themselves first."

Accountants vs. Engineers
</center>
<P>
Three engineers and three accountants are traveling
by train to a conference.  At the station, the three
accountants each buy a ticket and watch as the three
engineers only buy one ticket.
<P>
"How are three people going to travel on only one
ticket?" asks an accountant.
<P>
"Watch and you'll see," answered an engineer.
<P>    
They all board the train.  The accountants take their
respective seats but all three engineers cram into a
rest room and close the door behind them.
<P>
Shortly after the train has departed, the conductor
comes around collecting tickets.  He knocks on the
restroom door and says, "Tickets, please!"  The door
opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a
ticket in hand. The conductor takes it and moves on.
<P>
The accountants see this and agree it is a clever idea.
So after the conference, the accountants decide to copy
the engineers on the return trip and save some money.
<P>
When they get to the station, they buy one ticket for the
return trip.  To their astonishment, the engineers don't
buy a ticket at all.
<P>
"How are you going to travel without a ticket?" says one
perplexed accountant.
<P> 
"Watch and you'll see," answered an engineer.
<P>
When they board the train all three accountants cram into
a restroom and the three engineers cram into another one
nearby.  The train departs.
<P>
Shortly afterward, one of the engineers leaves his restroom
and walks over to the restroom where the accountants are
hiding.  He knocks on the door and says, "Tickets, please!"

THE HAPPY-FUN "EXTRA" SECTION
</center>
<hr>
<img src="donut.gif" align="right">
<P>
Ok, so you made it this far.  Need some more things to waste time with?
How about eating a virtual donut?  Hehe, don't blame me if you think it
was a waste of time.  How about sticking explosives inside a beached
whale?  It makes an impressive shower of blubber if you don't do it right.
This section is intended for you if you want to have some happy-fun time
(assuming you have nothing better to do.)  I gave the disclaimer, so what
can I say if you click on the links?
<P>
For the first act, we have the <a href="http://netdonut.synack.org/"
target=_blank> virtual donut.</a>  What better way to waste your time...
If you are hungry, you will still be hungry.  But hey, it won't make you
gain any weight.  If you are <i>really</i> bored, try hitting the back
button after you eat the donut.
<P>
So that was a complete waste of time...  What did I tell you?  Why do
people tourture themselves by doing what you tell them not to?  I have
more fun stuff up ahead.  I promise the rest of the stuff will be more
interesting.  And fun...  At least I thought it was. 
<P>
Next up we have the exploding whale.  Yep, there ain't nothin like several
tons of whale blubber to make your day, especially when it is raining from
the sky.  Don't believe me?  Click on the <a 
href="http://www.perp.com/whale/" target=_blank>exploding whale.</a>
<P>
You're still here?  Tell you what, when you get done with this page, why
don't you go to <a href="http://www.yellowpages.com"
target=_blank>Yellowpages.com</a> and start with the A's.  Vermont is a
good place to start.  Once you get done with Vermont, try Alaska.    
<P>
I hope you didn't really go to yellowpages.com and read through
everything.  In any case, since you are still here, I'm beginning to like
you.  You've shown yourself to be very patient.  Let me reward that with a
cool video that I found amusing.  Click <a
href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilm/skeletons/film_detail/0,1263,204155,00.html"
target=_blank> here </a> to view the short film called 405.
<P>
Still here?  Sorry, that's all I have for now.  Try coming back later.  
<P>
I'm working on a brand new web page, but these things take time to do 
well.  I'll let you know when that happens.
