<p>Unlike striped bass in the <acronym title="United State of America">USA</acronym> for which a wealth of information already exists, striped bass research in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence is just beginning to reveal the basics of their biology.</p>

<div class="center">
	<img src="images/ph_striped_bass.jpg" width="444" height="299" alt="Striped bass (Morone saxatilis)">
</div>

<p class="center"><strong>Striped bass (<em>Morone saxatilis</em>)</strong></p>

<p>Striped bass are anadromous: they spend most of their time feeding and maturing in the ocean, but return to freshwater to spawn.</p>

<p>The southern Gulf striped bass program takes advantage of this predictable characteristic by sampling bass during their annual spawning migration to the Northwest Miramichi River (the only confirmed spawning location for the species in the southern Gulf).</p>

<p>"We only have a few weeks when the bass are accessible in the river, so the sampling has to be intense. The information we gather during this time allows us to monitor and report on the status of the stock," says Scott Douglas, a biologist with the Diadromous Fish Section in Moncton, N.B.</p>

<p>The southern Gulf of St. Lawrence striped bass program has been active for the past 10 years. By tagging adult bass, <acronym title="Department of Fisheries and Oceans">DFO</acronym> has been able to monitor fluctuations in population size and offer advice for management decisions.</p>

<p>Tagging of striped bass has also provided insights on migration patterns, growth rates and other biological parameters peculiar to our population found at the northern limit of the species' distribution.</p>

<p>The gaspereau fishermen in the Miramichi watershed play an integral part in the program. From the end of May to the end of June, they allow <acronym title="Department of Fisheries and Oceans">DFO</acronym> science personnel on board their vessels to tag, count, and measure their by-catch of striped bass.</p>

<p>More recently, <acronym title="Department of Fisheries and Oceans">DFO</acronym> has started a tagging study with adult striped bass along the Gulf shore of Nova Scotia. Unfortunately there have been no recaptures yet, so the jury is still out on this one!</p>

<p>A beach seine survey for young-of-the-year (<acronym title="young-of-the-year">YOY</acronym>) striped bass throughout the Miramichi River system and southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was added as a new component to the program in 2000.</p>

<div class="center">
	<img src="images/ph_beach_seining.jpg" width="438" height="294" alt="Beach seining at East Point on the Miramichi River">
</div>

<p class="center"><strong>Beach seining at East Point on the Miramichi River</strong></p>

<p>"The beach seine has been our sampling gear of choice for studying <acronym title="young-of-the-year">YOY</acronym>; it is easy to use, very mobile, doesn't harm fish, and we can cover a lot of area in a short amount of time," says Douglas.</p>

<p>Although the data set doesn't cover a long time series, the survey has already shown some interesting results.</p>

<p>For example, a substantial number of <acronym title="young-of-the-year">YOY</acronym> striped bass move out of the Miramichi system each year and move north and south along the coast. By the middle of August in 2002, <acronym title="young-of-the-year">YOY</acronym> striped bass had already travelled over 175 kilometres both north and south and were distributed throughout much of southern Gulf.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is believed that <acronym title="young-of-the-year">YOY</acronym> caught along the Gulf shore of Nova Scotia late in the fall had originated from the Miramichi River.</p>

<p>"This means we need to start looking at the entire southern Gulf as an important rearing habitat for this species," says Douglas. "It is undeniable that the Miramichi is critical to striped bass production, but we can't forget about all of the estuaries and coastal zones throughout the southern Gulf that juvenile bass are using. Activities and uses for these estuaries need to consider the positive and negative effects on striped bass."</p>

<p>The 2002 field season brought with it the second phase of an action plan developed by both the Province of Quebec and <acronym title="Department of Fisheries and Oceans">DFO</acronym> to re-introduce striped bass to the St. Lawrence River (Quebec).</p>

<p>It is believed that striped bass from the St. Lawrence River disappeared during the 1960s because of over fishing and habitat degradation.</p>

<p>To maximise the chances of a successful re-introduction, the action plan implicitly requires the use of Miramichi progeny as the St. Lawrence River seed stock. So on July 22, approximately 2,000 young-of-the-year striped bass were collected from the Miramichi system, placed in a tanker truck, and transported to Quebec.</p>

<p>These individuals are now in a hatchery where they will be grown either to maturity or to a size suitable for release into the St. Lawrence River.</p>

<p>This part of the program was considered a major success and plans are in place for another collection during the summer of 2003.</p>
