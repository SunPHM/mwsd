By combining the world’s most powerful multi-modeling bass guitar processor with a digital 8-track recorder, the BNX3 gives you everything you need to perform, practice, write and produce songs in a single unit. The BNX3 bass workstation is the first multi-track recorder that works like a bass player thinks.
<br><br>
Experience the first hand's-free multi-track recorder that lets you focus on creating and recording music instead of messing with mixers, cables and patch bays. Record, playback, auto-arm the next track, or delete tracks, all without touching a knob. 
<br><br>
Save tunes on SmartMedia™ and easily import your tracks to a PC or Mac. Polish them with Cakewalk® Guitar Tracks™ and burn a CD with Pyro™ (both included). Convert CD, .MP3, .WMA files, virtually anything that’s out there, to .WAV files and move them into the BNX3 to jam along with.

<b>GENETX has opened up a world of new sonic potential. The imitations and limits of modeling have been replaced with imagination and innovation worthy of every musician's creativity.</b>
<br><br>
There are many different amplifiers that have been used throughout the history of electronic music. These amp tones have paved the way for the music that we listen to today. An experienced ear can quickly decipher the type of amp being heard because every amplifier has a very distinct tone. It is this diversity in amp tonality that led to the demand for Amp Modeling. Amp Modeling gave the musician an accurate emulation of a variety of the most popular vintage and modern amps in a single compact package.
<br><br>
While Amp Modeling is a great technology, it is limited simply because it is an imitation of sounds that already exist. Imagine the freedom of being able to pick the sweetest tones, create tones that never existed, and then breed your own unique amplifier tone by combining their characteristics. Sound impossible? Thanks to GENETX technology, these seemingly impossible sounds are now a reality. You can even combine your own HyperModel creations with those of other musicians via the internet to offer a truly limitless sonic potential.
<br><br>
With GENETX technology and the DigiTech AudioDNA™ DSP engine, there are no limits. You can create sounds as unique as your own DNA.

<b>The GENEDIT software was designed to make the process of sound creation easy and intuitive via your personal computer. Your creations can be saved off either to your computer or downloaded to any GENETX product.</b>
<br><br>
Although sound creation can easily be accomplished from the front panel of all GeNetX™ products, the GenEdit™ software provides more comprehensive control, as well as preset editor/librarian functions. GenEdit™ is shipped with all GeNetX™ products and includes versions for both Mac and PC formats.
<br><br>
GenEdit™ was designed to make the process of sound creation easy and intuitive. There are three tabs at the bottom of the GenEdit™ window. The Amp tab provides access to the editing and warping functions of Amp and Cabinet models. The Effects tab provides easy editing of the extensive Effects library, and the Expression tab provides access to real-time and automated parameter control functions.

The BNX3 also features "Patch Mode". Patch Mode allows two entirely different preset sounds to be used simultaneously. These two presets can be assigned discretely to the individual left and right outputs for an incredibly thick stereo sound, or to the Expression Pedal for smooth crossfading between the two preset sounds.

The BNX3 provides 65 user and 65 factory presets and includes seven footswitches, which provides instant access to all effects and presets.
