height="160" align="right" border="0"></a>While some piers along the coast have 
        characteristics which help define and give identity to the pier, here 
        it is the area itself that makes the pier special. Supposedly the oldest 
        seaside resort along the Pacific coast, Capitola, since 1869, has been 
        a destination for inlanders headed to the coast. The area today is one 
        of restaurants, stylish tourist shops and art galleries. The main area 
        near the beach is really only a few square blocks, but it is made up of 
        commercial buildings, old Victorian houses, an old railroad depot and, 
        at the front of the pier, a 1920s condominium-type area known as the Venetian 
        Court, complete with pastel colors and ornate architecture. People in 
        Capitola seem to regard their &quot;village&quot; as an upclass, perhaps 
        more dignified, version of a beach town, in contrast to Santa Cruz and 
        its weekend hordes.</font></P>
      <FONT FACE="Times"> 
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>Environment<br>
        </B></font><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The pier itself 
        is fairly new, having been rebuilt in the mid-1980s following storm damage 
        which nearly destroyed the old pier. Luckily, the new pier is wood (which 
        I always prefer) and although the pier is only 855-foot-long, it is rarely 
        crowded with pier anglers unless there is a &quot;big run&quot; of fish 
        present. The majority of fishermen here are boat anglers heading out to 
        fish the nearby reefs. Some come to launch their own boats, some come 
        to rent the boats which are available on the pier. Excellent fishing is 
        found fairly close to the pier for several species.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><a href="images2/06-98/capitola3.jpg"><img src="images2/06-98/capitola3.gif" width="90"
			height="120" align="right" border="0"></a>The shore end of the pier 
        sees a typical sandy beach area. Further out on the pier sees a bottom 
        that is a mixture of sand and mud. Pilings have a fair buildup of mussels 
        and there is often a fairly thick buildup of kelp around the pier from 
        the midsummer months to the fall.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">What all of this means 
        is that an angler can choose to fish the surf area for the larger barred 
        and calico surfperch, or fish deeper water for white croaker, several 
        smaller species of perch, jacksmelt, flounder, sole, sand dabs and halibut. 
        The far end will also yield a few striped bass and sharks, and several 
        varieties have been landed here including smoothhounds, leopard sharks, 
        blue sharks and thresher sharks.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">In addition, Soquel Creek 
        runs into the ocean just down the beach from the pier. During the winter, 
        the mouth of the creek stays open; during the summer, it usually closes 
        and a small lagoon, mostly used for swimming, forms just inside the city 
        beach. Because of the creek, most years will see a few steelhead caught 
        during the fall and winter months (and sometimes even into the spring).</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Rarely seen fish that 
        have been caught in these waters include barracuda, triggerfish, black 
        sea bass and sturgeon; but your chances of landing one of these are about 
        the same as hitting a Lotto Jackpot.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>Fishing Tips<br>
        </B></font><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><a href="images2/06-98/capitola1.jpg"><img src="images2/06-98/capitola1.gif" width="120"
			height="90" align="right" border="0"></a>The best fishing seems to 
        be in the surf area, on an incoming tide, for the larger barred and calico 
        surfperch. For these, use sand crabs, pile worms, or mussels. If you like 
        artificials, try a plastic grub; and root beer or petroleum colored lures 
        seem to produce the most fish. By far, the winter months and spring months 
        are the best for these perch but some will be caught throughout the year.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The next best bet would 
        be to use cut anchovy, or small strips of squid, for kingfish (white croaker). 
        Use size 4 hooks, fish on the bottom, and cast out from almost any area 
        of the pier. This has always been one of the top piers in the state for 
        white croaker; I've only experienced one trip to the pier when I failed 
        to catch a kingfish. Given that fact, it should be noted that the size 
        of the kingfish has seemed to decrease over the past decade. Small kingfish 
        that never would have been kept in the past are now routinely kept by 
        some anglers. Come on, let them grow up!</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><a href="images2/06-98/capitola5.jpg"><img src="images2/06-98/capitola5.gif" width="90"
			height="120" align="right" border="0"></a>Another good bet is to try 
        small pieces of anchovy, with a size 6 hook, fished mid-depth to the bottom, 
        for walleye and silver surfperch. A place worth trying is around the pilings 
        under the pier; use fresh mussels or pile worms for bait, a size 6-8 hook, 
        and fish as close to the pilings as possible. Although winter and spring 
        are best times, you may catch a large pileperch, rubberlip seaperch, or 
        blackperch at almost any time of the year. Grass, gopher and kelp rockfish 
        also like to hang around the pilings.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">For something larger, 
        you might want to try for halibut, May through July. Each year will see 
        a few of these large flatfish landed. Most will be caught on live bait 
        such as anchovies, shinerperch, small kingfish, or small mackerel (some 
        years), and all should be fished on the bottom with a live bait rigging. 
        A similar rigging may also attract a striped bass but they are less particular 
        and will often hit a piece of mackerel or sardine, shrimp, or a pile worm 
        that is graciously offering up its life so that our noble anglers can 
        experience the thrill of a striper. Stripers over 30 pounds in weight 
        have been landed here. ( November of 1997 proved interesting when a school 
        of about 70 stripers came into the shallow water by the pier and teased 
        the anglers on the pier; only a couple were caught, one an eight pounder.)</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><a href="images2/06-98/capitola2.jpg"><img src="images2/06-98/capitola2.gif" width="120"
			height="90" align="right" border="0"></a>Try for sharks or rays off 
        the far end of the pier; use squid and a fairly heavy saltwater outfit. 
        Summer and fall seem the best times for brown smoothhound shark (sand 
        sharks), leopard sharks, bat rays, and skates, and a skate weighing 130 
        pounds was caught a few years ago. Wintertime sometimes seems to be good 
        for dog sharks (dogfish), hornback sharks (horn sharks), and the smaller 
        baby bat rays. Be sure, if you are fishing for the larger game, to come 
        prepared with either a net (preferred) or a treble-hook gaff to bring 
        the fish up onto the pier. Also, more and more anglers are practicing 
        catch and release. One day I witnessed a young angler land a Pacific angel 
        shark. After a quick picture, the handsome creature was gently lowered 
        back down to the water to the applause of interested onlookers.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Late spring through the 
        fall are also times when Pacific mackerel, jack mackerel, sardines and 
        a few white seabass may be in local waters. Most mackerel and sardines 
        will be caught on multi-hook riggings fished at mid-depth or fished near 
        the top with the assistance of a large bobber or Styrofoam float. Jacksmelt 
        can also be caught on these multi-hook riggings but often a few size 8 
        hooks on a line, baited with small pieces of pile worms, or small strips 
        of squid, will be just as productive. Although I've seen many species 
        landed here, I have yet to see a white seabass (although a few are landed 
        out on the boats). If you want to give the large fish a try, use live 
        bait and fish the early morning or twilight hours. Do remember to return 
        any small, illegal white seabass (called seatrout) to the water.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><a href="images2/06-98/capitola4.jpg"><img src="images2/06-98/capitola4.gif" width="120"
			height="90" align="right" border="0"></a>Salmon and steelhead are 
        also occasionally caught. Most salmon will be landed April through July 
        on anchovies or lures; most steelhead are landed during the winter and 
        spring on live bait (anchovies, if available), pile worms, frozen anchovies 
        or lures (and roostertails seem to be the preference of the local experts). 
        Salmon are most common in the deepest waters of the pier while the steelhead 
        often like to school in the fairly shallow, mid-pier waters on the north 
        side of the pier.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">A few additional fish 
        will also be landed. These include small rockfish (such as bocaccio, blue 
        rockfish, and kelp rockfish), and flatfish such as sanddabs, flounder 
        and sand sole (up to about 4 pounds in size). At times a few large cabezon 
        and lingcod will also show up but neither is particularly common.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Unfortunately, staghorn 
        sculpin (bullheads) are common, in fact too common. I had one trip here 
        where I stopped fishing simply because I couldn't keep them off my line. 
        Although these sculpin are notorious for hitting hooks on the bottom baited 
        with pile worms, that day they seemed to hit any bait and hit it not only 
        on the bottom but at mid-depth. I tried artificials for a while but when 
        a sculpin finally hit one of those, I decided it was time to move on. 
        If in doubt, consult the folks at the bait and tackle shop on the pier, 
        they seem both knowledgeable and ready to help an angler.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>Special Tip<br>
        </B></font><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Like many beach 
        areas in California, parking can be a nightmare at times, especially on 
        summer weekends. In fact, the city runs shuttle buses to the beach most 
        weekends. The best way to alleviate this problem is to arrive early in 
        the day when the pier is first opening up. Free parking and metered parking 
        is available at several spots (see the list below) but wherever the spot, 
        the question is often availability, not cost. In other words, if parking 
        spaces aren't available, it really doesn't matter if they are free. Fish 
        early or fish late! Nevertheless, anglers do find their way to the pier 
        and they do catch fish.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>Authors Note<br>
        </B></font><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Capitola Boat 
        &amp; Bait is located out toward the end of the pier; it is one of the 
        best run pier tackle shops that I have seen and deserves a congratulations 
        for a job well done. A full line of fresh and frozen baits are available 
        as is tackle, rod and reel rentals, crab nets, snacks and drinks, and 
        a wide variety of odds and ends catering to both anglers and non-anglers. 
        Boats, of course, can be rented and pictures of the catches are pretty 
        impressive. Of note is that live anchovies are available most summers. 
        This is one of the few remaining piers in California that offers live 
        anchovies (and the only pier in northern California). The shop even offers 
        free pier fishing seminars (&quot;Learn to Fish Off the Wharf&quot;). 
        Perhaps most impressive to me is the professionalism of every employee 
        that I have met.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>History Note</B><br>
        </font><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">The name Capitola 
        is Spanish for capital and was apparently first used by F.H. Hihn of Santa 
        Cruz when he laid out a new resort in the area in 1869. The good residents 
        of Soquel had offered to let the State of California establish its capital 
        in the upstairs rooms of Ned Porter's local store but California politicians 
        (wisely) declined the offer. Hihn used that information when he named 
        the site; it had been called La Playa de Soquel, the beach of Soquel, 
        during Mexican rule, and Soquel Landing under American rule.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">Apparently Soquel Landing 
        had a small pier prior to 1857 but a new wharf was started that year by 
        Hihn and the Pacific Coast Steamship Company. In 1860, it was lengthened 
        to 1,100 feet (some reports say it was lengthened to 1,200 feet in 1863) 
        but a storm in November of 1865 destroyed the outer 500 feet of the wharf 
        and made the inshore part of the pier unsafe. The pier was soon rebuilt 
        by the steamship company. The beach itself became a favorite of vacationers 
        from San Francisco, brought initially by horse-drawn vehicles, and then, 
        after 1876, by the Santa Cruz-Watsonville narrow gauge railroad whose 
        depot sat on Soquel Landing road, a short distance up the road from the 
        wharf. However, the railroads began to take business away from the shipping 
        line and the wharf was abandoned in 1879. As mentioned, the pier has been 
        damaged many times. In fact, I have a picture, dated 1913, which shows 
        the wharf split in half (as a result of a 1912 storm); the picture is 
        remarkably similar to one I took in the mid-'80s following the storm of 
        1983. Although the wharf looks to be in good condition, it really isn't; 
        Capitola recently committed nearly $1 million to restore the wharf during 
        1998.</font></P>
