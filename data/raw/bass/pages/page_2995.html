<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Hi Cap'n Ron, just wanted
to drop you a line and let you know how much Chris and I enjoyed
the bass fishing. We didn't really know what to expect, as we've
never gone on this kind of trip before. But I checked out some
of your previous customers and they could only say great things
about you and your service!! I can honestly say the same!! We
really had a great time. You really came through with the airboat
ride, taking us through the thick stuff and we had a couple of
close 'gators on the video camera as well!! Catching that 7 lb'er
was an experience of a lifetime!! Chris hooked a pretty awesome
5 lb'er too!! Wish we could've set the hooks on the several we
missed during the morning, but I seemed to have lost my touch!!
Chris FINALLY brought in a decent one right at the end with his
artificial lure! What a trooper! We definately want to come back
sometime and I will be telling my friends about you too!! Who
could forget Red Dog!?! We miss him already! Once again, thanks
for such a great trip--- We'll be back!!<BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">We had a good morning session
while the afternoon was a little slow, but overall we were very
pleased. We caught 6 bass and 3 catfish, including a 24lb one.
The largest bass were a 8lb and a 5.5lb. Our guide was Ray and
he was very knowledgeable about both the lake and central Florida
in general.<BR>

  we had with you and Red Dog. The trip was a graduation gift and
  was better than i imagined it would be. Beginning with the airboat
  ride and ending with all those big ole' fish, we could not have
  asked for a more perfect time. Despite the wind, you put us right
  on top of the fish. This was absolutley the best fishing trip
  I have ever been on. I only have one regret...running out of
  shiners before we caught all of the fish. Thanks for showing
  us such a great time and for being the ultimate guide. I will
  be back next spring. Give Red Dog a hug and a cookie for me.</FONT></CENTER></P>
