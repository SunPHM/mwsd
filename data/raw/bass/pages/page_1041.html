The K-Bass represents some of the most innovative design and technological
advances in recent years, and offers an unmatched "total bass concept"
of sound and playability.

<p>
In the early 1980's Ned Steinberger reinvented the bass guitar. He pushed
the concept of headless design into popular acceptance, waking up the musical
instrument industry to the possibility of creative and functional designs,
and led the field in composites technology.
<p>
The K-Bass extends the innovation of the headless neck with the introduction
of Steve Klein's unique form-fitting re-design of the bass' body. As a result,
this instrument seriously addresses the ergonomic concerns of players, whether
they play standing up or sitting down. Although the term "ergonomic"
(to work with the body) is freely tossed around in the industry, the K-Bass
is truly sculptured to maintain the most healthful relationship possible
between player and instrument.

The K-Bass has an alder or swamp ash body with a zolatone finish in either
black and copper, or metallic blue. The K-Bass comes standard with a bolt-on
Moses Graphite neck and a Steinberger bridge. The electronics include two
EMG pickups: a 35P4 and a 35J installed in the neck and bridge positions,
respectively. The 35P4 is an active humbucking soapbar pickup with ceramic
magnets, and the 35J is a single coil version of the 35P4. The output of
the pickups is routed through two stacked BTC controls-each controlling
volume and a bass/treble boost.
<p>
The K-Bass is available as a four-string, a four-string with
DB tuner, a four-string with Trans-trem, and as a five-string.
All models include a deluxe gig bag.
