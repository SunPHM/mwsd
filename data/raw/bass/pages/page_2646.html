  turned on Okeechobee's trophy bass. The lake is still very low,
  however the showers have added several inches of water to it.
  Best fishing is still in the canals. Expect a major bass spawn
  this month on the full and new moons. Trophy bass forecast is
  expected to be excellent this month due to the low water conditions
  which has the trophy bass trapped in the deep water canals. Harney
  Pond Canal where the last BASSMASTER Eastern Invitational tournament
  was held (Jan. 11 - 13, 2001) and won from with a 44-pound, 4-ounce
