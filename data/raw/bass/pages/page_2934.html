there's one thing that may be difficult at Hard Labor Creek Plantation - the decision of
what to do first&#133;hunt, fish or just 'kick back'. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#004040"><strong>With a spring-fed lake surrounded
by beautiful pine and hardwood right out your back door, that decision could be tough. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#004040"><strong>This private, pristine 85-acre lake
is called 'Owens Pond'. Its shoreline of cypress trees and downed logs, plus open-water
structure, offers some of the most enjoyable fishing you'll ever experience. The
tranquility offered by Owens Pond will make you want to come back again and again.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#004040"><strong>The lake, two roomy bass boats and
fishing tackle, and <a href="accomodations.htm">our lodge</a> are available to accommodate
you and your guests.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#004040">The lake is being managed with the
help of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for lunker bass but there
are lots of smaller bass and panfish to keep the spin casting and fly rod action fast and
furious.<br>

&quot;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">I took a group of friends
to Hard Labor again this year.&nbsp; Included was the &quot;other&quot; Mark
Davis 2001 B.A.S.S. Angler of the Year, B.A.S.S. Pro Chris Elders, well-known
outdoor writer Jeff Samsel, and childhood friend Kevin Newman.&nbsp; We were
there to get bass fishing, quail hunting, and deer hunting story material for
Jeff as well as have a good time.&nbsp; With not one but two $30,000 bass rigs
in tow and three professional fisherman, we quickly got the fishing out of the
way and made up a great fish fry with some smaller...like Ted
says...&quot;management fish&quot;.&nbsp; Really we didn't need the
&quot;pros&quot; because it was no great task to catch 30+ bass a piece each of
the two afternoons averaging 1 1/2 to 2 pounds.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><br>
