<p />“Sam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home.
<p />And at the age of seventeen, young Sam began to roam.”
<p />So begins “The Ballad of Sam Bass,” a song of the Old West most recently recorded by Country-Western singer Michael Martin Murphy.
<p />Sam Bass actually was born in Indiana – Lawrence County, Indiana, to be exact.
<p />Sam was the next to the youngest of the 10 children of Daniel and Elizabeth (Sheeks) Bass. He was born on the Bass family farm near the town of Woodville, just north of present-day Mitchell. The Bass cabin was near the the tracks of the New Albany and Salem Railroad, which began train service all the way to Juliet, near White River, a couple of months before Sam was born on July 21, 1851.
<p />He was about 10 years old when his mother died, probably of milk sickness or complications associated with the birth of Sam’s younger brother, Denton.
<p />His father remarried after his mother’s death and his new wife brought two children with her into the marriage. She and Daniel had a son, Charles, who was a half-brother to Sam.
<p />Daniel died in February of 1864, leaving Sam an orphan at 12. His father’s land and personal possessions were sold to cover his debts and give a little bit to his family. Sam was entitled to one-twelfth of the estate of $1,500 before expenses.
<p />Sam and the other minor Bass children went to live with their mother’s brother, David L. “Uncle Dave” Sheeks. He was one of the wealthiest land owners in Lawrence County and had a sprawling farm and business interests about two and half miles from the Bass farm. 
<p />Sam stayed at his uncle’s farm until he reached the age of 17. Then, following an argument with his uncle, he took off, possibly hopping a freight train and headed west to what he thought would be greener pastures.

<p />Following short stints in Missouri and Mississippi, Sam made his way to Texas.
<p />“He went out to old Texas, 
<p />A cowboy for to be …”
<p />He found a job with Sherriff Eagan in Denton as a hired hand on the Eagan farm. It was through this job that he was able to save some money and buy a horse. This horse, named the Denton Mare, became famous on the fair circuit and that helped Bass make more money on the side.
<p />He and Joe Collins took a herd of cattle from Texas to Nebraska to sell. They sold out at Custer City and had a good time with the money the made on the sale of the cattle. Then they tried something else – something Sam was family with from his days in Indiana – they robbed a Union Pacific train. Sam had grown up reading of the exploits of the Reno gang in southern Indiana.
<p />Sam’s career as a bank and train robber in Texas was fairly short-lived, but he did leave his mark on the legends and folklore of the Old West.
<p />Bass and gang were slated to rob the bank at Round Rock, just north of Austin, in July 1878. But there was a traitor in the gang.
<p />Jim Murphy had made a deal to give up Bass and the rest of the gang in a deal to save his own skin. Murphy alerted the Texas Rangers that the Bass gang was going to rob the bank in Round Rock, and they were going to be their on July 19 to check things out.
<p />The deputy sherriff heard that a group of men had come into town carrying guns and were in Henry Koppel’s store. He went to investigate and arrest them for carrying guns in town. He didn’t know who the men were, but when he attempted to confiscate their weapons, he was fired upon and killed.
<p />Another deputy who had accompanied Grimes opened fire on the men. Bass was hit, losing the middle and ring fingers on his right hand. The other deputy was hit and was unable to follow the gang as they fled.
<p />The Rangers, who already had arrived in town, heard the shots fired in the store and were soon on the trail. The three left the store and raced to their horses. Frank Jackson helped Bass to his horse after Bass was hit in the abdomen by a bullet fired by Ranger George Harrell. Seaborn Barnes was killed by a bullet through the head fired by Ranger Dick Ware. 
<p />Jackson picked up Barnes’ saddle bags and he and Bass made their way through Old Round Rock, to their camp near the graveyard. The eluded their persuers through a cedar thicket.
<p />After picking up supplies at the camp, they headed north on the Georgetown Road, knowing that more Rangers would probably be on their way from Austin.
<p />Bass’s wounds were serious and he could go no further. He told Jackson to get away while he could. Jackson did his best to treat the wounds and left Bass a horse, so if he felt better after resting, he could get away.
<p />He wasn’t able to ride away and he was found the following day by the Rangers and taken into town. They took him to a vacant building and secured a cot from a nearby hotel.
<p />Two local doctors, Morris and Cochran, agreed that Bass’ wounds were fatal and he would not live long. The Rangers tried in vain to find out about his robberies and the names of the people who had assisted him, but they learned very little.
<p />Sam lived through the night and was feeling better the next morning. Dr. Cochran told him he ought to confess, because he wasn’t long for this world. Bass replied, “Don’t count on it.”
<p />But about noon, the doctor was proved right. Bass lived almost four hours after that, dying at 3:58 p.m. July 21, 1878, his 27th birthday. He was buried the next day in Round Rock Cemetery, next to Barnes and adjacent to the Slave Cemetery. A Methodist minister provided the last rites.

<p />Mary Matson, an African American cook who sometimes cooked meals for the Bass gang, watched as the inpromtu funeral was conducted. She later related a story about that day. As the grave was being covered, a man rode up from the Gavelston Road, dismounted, picked up a clod and threw it on the grave and as quickly as he arrived, he was gone again. She claimed the man was Frank Jackson, come to pay his final respects.
<p />“Jim had used Sam’s money and didn’t want to pay;
<p />He thought his only chance wat to give poor Sam away.
<p />He sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to morn – 
<p />Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn!
<p />
<p />And so he sold out Sam and Barnes and left their friends to morn.
<p />Oh, what a scorching Jim will get when Gabriel blows his horn.
<p />Perhaps he’s gone to heaven, there’s none of us can say;
<p />But if I’m right in my srumise, he’s gone the other way.” 
<p />
<p />So ends “The Ballad of Sam Bass,” but not the legend. In Round Rock visitors will find Sam Bass Road, on which the cemetery is located; the Sam Bass Community Theatre and Sam Bass Middle School. The shootout with the Texas Rangers is recreated each year in July.
