  My main gigging band at the moment is Blue Trash (<a href="http://www.bluetrash.net">www.bluetrash.net</a>). 
  12string is featured occasionally (but prominently!) on couple of songs. Our 
  style is blues-based but you'll never know where it goes from there...<br>

  <br>
  First let me thank you for an excellent site! I've been insomniac since<br>
  discovering it back in 2001! The Aria conversion has only<br>
  9-strings but the basic principle is same as on a 12-string bass.<br>
  I purchased the bass from my friend a couple of years ago. It's an early<br>
  80's Aria Pro II which was converted into a 9-stringed beast! It has E,<br>
  A &amp; D as fundamentals and double octaves for each fundamental string.<br>
  EMG active electronics and EMG bass expander (which cuts mids and<br>
  increases high and lows). The bridge is self-made. <br>
  I too had dreamed of a 12ver ever since knowing it existed (I remember<br>
  staring at the cover of &quot;At Budokan&quot; and thinking &quot;what the hell 
  is<br>
  that?&quot;) So, getting this bass has helped me a lot! I use dropped-D tuning<br>
  all the time and string gauges are: 095, 075 &amp; 060 for fundamentals and<br>
  026, 032 &amp; 040 for octaves. My rig is 1973 Hiwatt Custom 100 tube amp<br>
  and Hartke 4x10? cab. It works well though the Hartke is a bit too hi-fi<br>
  for my liking (and it doesn't look half as cool as the Hiwatt!). Haven't<br>
  had a chance to experiment with two amplifiers but playing with a clean<br>
  sound has worked fine enough. </p>

  Current Gig: Bass player/Tom Petersson impersonator in all-female Cheap Trick 
  tribute band, Cheap Chick.<br>
  <br>
  12 String Bass: 1994 Trans Amber veneer flametop Hamer B12S made-to-order at 
  the Arlington Heights, IL Hamer plant. Standard maple neck with dual truss rods.<br>
  <br>
  Playing History: After 10 years of goofing off playing three-chord '60s garage 
  rock and surf instrumental with her all-girl trio, The Neptunas, Pam Cheatersson 
  (Pam Utterback), came up with the Cheap Chick concept in the summer of 2002.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I was sick and tired of paying $5 a pop for drinks at nightclubs in L.A. 
  I thought, 'Hmm.. all I have to do is find 3 other women in L.A. who have amazing 
  musical chops and love Cheap Trick. We'll get together the costumes and the 
  instruments, learn the songs, practice our asses off and then 'BINGO!' I'll 
  get 2 free drink tickets a night when we play. Whatta scam!'&quot; Having honed 
  her huckstress skills with The Neptunas, Pam dyed her hair Tom Petersson chocolate 
  brown, armed herself with a Hamer 12-string bass and hasn't looked back since.<br>
  <br>
  It seems that the band has formed a mutual admiration society with their idols, 
  Cheap Trick, too. Pam has met and spent time backstage with both Robin Zander 
  and Bun E. Carlos. Rick Nielsen has also become enamored with the femme foursome, 
  proudly displaying a Cheap Chick shirt from onstage and saying, &quot;Cheap 
  Chick are our new favorite band!&quot; and has also mentioned the girls in recent 
  interviews.<br>
  <br>
  Cheap Chick are spending 2003 working on a full-length CD, playing shows both 
  in Los Angeles and farther afield and, of course, going to see Cheap Trick every 
  chance they get.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Favorite 12-string bass songs: All Cheap Trick, all the time - &quot;Auf Wiedersehen,&quot; 
  Cheap Trick's version of The Move's &quot;Brontosaurus,&quot; &quot;Lookout,&quot; 
  &quot;Big Eyes&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Tribute band anal retentive obsession: trying to create a replica of the 1000 
  origami cranes hanging from Tom Petersson's headstock at the Budokan show to 
  hang from my own headstock.<br>
  <br>
  Wish list: The Pepto Pink Hamer 10 string prototype (for the color, more than 
  anything), A 4-String Hamer Firebird, a Hiwatt, Orange and Sound City heads, 
  a stack of cabinets that covers the back wall of the stage and a passel of roadies 
  to haul and set it all up.</p>

        Always at the ready to play all day and party all night is the<br>
        hard-rockin' Pam Cheatersson. In fact, if sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll<br>
        were sports, Pam would be a multi-gold medal triathlete. However, she<br>
        hasn't reached the top of her game easily, in fact she's made many, many<br>
        sacrifices to reach peak performance. She works hard at her avocation<br>
        and takes the rock 'n' roll lifestyle seriously, and a strict regimen 
        of<br>
        late nights and a &quot;no celibacy before a show&quot; policy is just 
        the start.<br>
        &quot;I keep pushing myself to outdo my personal best,&quot; says Pam, 
        &quot;If one<br>
        night I down a fifth of Jack Daniels, then the next night, I've got to<br>
        down a fifth and an extra shot. If I get to fondle five groupies after 
        a<br>
        show, then the next stop it's got to be five and the phone number of a<br>
        sixth. Sure, I've failed sometimes. We all have off nights, but I have<br>
        never given up. It's my training schedule that gets me top-flight male<br>
        models and Hollywood actors begging to be my groupies. You compare that<br>
        to what the other girls get and you'll see the difference some focused<br>
        goal-setting makes.&quot; It's that kind of dedication that has led her 
        to<br>
        become the best of the best in her field.<br>
        Look for Pam, and you're likely to find her with her cross-dressing<br>
        boyfriend, Dragmar at her side or surrounded by a pack of bon vivants<br>
        she calls her &quot;personal trainers&quot;. Aboard the Cheap Chick 737, 
        you'll<br>
        often see her, cocktail in hand, dressed in a jogging suit and preparing<br>
        to break yet another &quot;Mile High Club&quot; record. </div></td>

  We play a mix of originals and covers, and every time we play out and I pull<br>
  out the 12 string, people gasp and say &quot;WHAT IS THAT?&quot; and &quot;How 
  do you play<br>
  that thing?&quot; By the end of the night, they want to know where to get one!!!</p>
<p>Been playing for 20 years and no plans to stop now!!!!<br>

<p align="left"><img src="Edison_6_Hands_Bass-3.jpg" alt="Edison_6_Hands_Bass-3.jpg" width="438" height="350" border="0" align="right">This is Les Fradkin, the 12-string bassist of Edison Lighthouse,
the group which enjoyed the worldwide hit &quot;<b>Love Grows Where My Rosemary
Goes</b>&quot; in 1970. I play the Dean Rhapsody 12 Bass exclusively on stage and in
the studio on our new recordings. The following is my bio:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Once upon a time, the 45RPM hit single was king. In that
long ago day, Edison Lighthouse was one of the most phenomenally successful
groups of the1970's selling over 15 million records worldwide. The band
originated in England as an outgrowth of the successful group The Flying
Machine, which had a US top #5 hit in November 1969 with &quot;Smile A Little
Smile For Me.&quot; featuring Les Fradkin on bass, mellotron and vocals.The
producer of that smash hit assembled a new group to record a new song called
&quot;Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)&quot; and called it Edison Lighthouse.&nbsp;
Les Fradkin returned from New York City to join this new British group as an
original recording member of Edison Lighthouse.<br>
<br>
The recording of &quot;Love Grows&quot; proved to be a worldwide success
reaching the #5 chart position on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in&nbsp;
February 1970 and ultimately becoming a #1 hit selling over a total of 8 million
copies worldwide. In fact, for the entire year of 1970, it was the #2 selling
pop record in the U.K.&nbsp; The formula &quot;feel-good music&quot; hit sound
created with that smash proved to be so successful that the Edison crew recorded
other material under different group names which duplicated the sensation of
their first hit together. As White Plains, their single of &quot;My Baby Loves
Lovin'&quot; reached #13 in the U.S and #9 in the U.K. Under the moniker of
&quot;The Brotherhood Of Man&quot;, their &quot;United We Stand&quot; reached
#15 in the U.S. and #1 in the U.K.in 1970.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In addition to these lasting accomplishments, the group also recorded two
other hits, &quot;She Works In A Woman's Way&quot; and &quot;It's Up To You
Petula&quot; which both charted top 5 in Japan and top 60 U.S in 1971 under the
Edison Lighthouse name. In the late 1970's Les starred on lead guitar as
&quot;George Harrison&quot; in the Original Cast of Beatlemania on Broadway in
New York City and on tour all over the world.</p>
<p align="left">In 2001, original member Les Fradkin assembled a new version of 
  Edison Lighthouse. The group is enjoying renewed success on stage with the dramatic 
  inclusion of &quot;Love Grows&quot; in the sound track of the smash hit motion 
  picture &quot;Shallow Hal&quot;.&nbsp; Les' exciting Edison Lighthouse show 
  features 20 &quot;one hit wonder&quot; hits that Les has performed on plus new 
  material from the brand new Edison Lighthouse Greatest Hits CD &quot;The Soundtrack 
  Of Your Youth&quot; In 2002, Les discovered the wonders of the 12-string bass 
  after trying a Dean Rhapsody at a local Denver-area music store. He fell in 
  love with the power of the instrument and has adopted it for all his Edison 
  Lighthouse concerts and recording.</p>

up listening to Kiss, Cheap Trick, Sabbath, Purple, Etc... Was captured by
Simmon's presence, and Petersson's sound. Tom &amp; Jon Brant's live sound was
unbelievable... I knew that I would get my hands on one of those 12-string
basses one day.&nbsp; My wife gave me the green light in Nov, 1995. Life on
stage has not been the same. I use them on all my original projects, but as far
as covers go, the 12 doesn't fit on everything.&nbsp; It's really hard to put it
down and grab the 4, even though I know I should. I purchased the 8-string so I
could compromise by having the extra octave sound without having to use a pick.
I hate using a pick, but it's the only way to get the best of the 12'ver Beast.
I've been in some great bands over the past 15 years, and I have learned
something from every musician. The key is to always be open for ideas... As a
Bassist, my job is to support and play for the song... Eventually I get my
moment to shine, but holding the groove is the key - No matter how many strings
you're playing...</font></b></p>

I've always said that if it ain‚t fun, don‚t do it, and at age 36 I'm having 
more fun than ever playing music. After a number of years playing 12-string 
exclusively and eschewing cover music, I'm back in the trenches playing 
&quot;classic&quot; rock with my friends and just having a blast. Although I play 
&quot;regular&quot; bass most of the time now I still take my 12ver to every gig to boost 
the energy level over the top when necessary. Besides, I still love it when 
people come up and ask me, <b><i>&quot;What the hell is that thing?&quot;</i></b>!</font></span></p>

been playing bass for over 20 years, since he was in 9th grade.&nbsp; His first
bass influence was none other than Tom Petersson of Cheap Trick, although it
took him almost 20 years to finally acquire a 12-string bass, which he loves.&nbsp;
Ron is currently working on a solo project called &quot;No Concept&quot; that
features the 12-string bass on several songs, including a solo arrangement of
the hymn &quot;A Mighty Fortress,&quot; a song called &quot;Old Friend&quot;
that features 12-string bass and 12-string guitar, and a really heavy song
called &quot;Done&quot; inspired by the stories of HP Lovecraft.&nbsp; One of 
the things Ron loves about the 12-string bass is its capacity to sound like a 
harpsichord or like a cave troll.&nbsp; When not writing or recording, Ron is a 
partner in a performance management consulting firm, the Charter Oak Group, LLC.&nbsp; 
Ron holds a doctorate in political science from the University of Connecticut.</font></p>
