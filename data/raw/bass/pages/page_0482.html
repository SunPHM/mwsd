I started off playing drums many years ago, however they are still over in 
Ireland while I dont live somewhere that would appreciate them. A friend of 
mine suggested taking up the bass in the meantime and was even kind enough 
to lend me his old one for a bit.
<P>
I started off with an old Squire, but ended up with the Fender in the end. I
like the Precision's sound though I can see why people put a jazz pickup in
them as well. It's been sat about in its case for a while but lately I've been
digging it out more and playing the thing. It makes a good sound.
<P>
For those interested it is a Standard Precision Bass with a 
<A href="http://www.seymourduncan.com/">Seymour Duncan</A> Quarter 
Pound pick up, a <A href="http://www.leoquan.com/">Leo Quan</A> Badass II 
bridge, and a brass nut and black scratchplate made by 
<A href="http://www.kgb-music.co.uk/">KGB Music</A>. 

The strings are <A href="http://www.rotosound.com/">Rotosound</A> and the 
amp it gets run through most of the time is a   
<A href="http://www.marshallamps.com/">Marshall</A> practice combo. In an 
ideal world though it would have to be an <A href="http://www.ampeg.com/">
Ampeg</A> SVT.
