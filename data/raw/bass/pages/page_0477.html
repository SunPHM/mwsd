  footage of our plane ride and the Catskill Mtns., the great brown trout action with fish
  to 11 pounds&nbsp; and the &quot;weird&quot; was we trolled for them with ultralight rods,

  rigging for BIG trout on the troll, how to use planner boards which I know now has
  applications in our area and how to handle fish there &amp; techniques. We also gave you a

  was Capt. Henry Feeney of Brooklyn and we found non stop topwater action on schoolie
  stripers and a few keepers in Rockaway Inlet and off the beaches at Rockaway by boat. The
  purpose of this show was to introduce many of you to the fine action you can have on light
  tackle, basically freshwater tackle and topwater lures and Rat-L-Traps. Rat-L-Traps have
  been a great freshwater bait for a very long time, but we use them in saltwater too and
  many of you have overlook this fish catching' bait thinking it was just for freshwater. We
  give you tips on rigging leaders, tackle tips and some exciting top water footage of bass
  crashing plugs. As always we give you the Tackle Segment, Boating &amp; Fishing Tip of the
  Week, and a detailed look into the world of light tackle bass action. <em><strong>Click

  in Wantagh. On this episode we go striped bass fishing with clam bellies...the old
  fashioned way without a chum pot and away from the bridges! We squeezed each and every
  belly by hand. It was a tough trip, but we managed to get a dozen fish or so in very tough
  conditions as we were hammered by the first day of a high pressure system. In this show we
  gave the secrets to catching quality bass along the marshes with clam bellies,
  understanding tides, the tackle we used and most importantly the <a href="http://www.thefishingline.com/fishing10.htm"><strong>old-fashioned rigging</strong></a>
  we used to catch these bass. You can click the photo to see a blow up of the rig! There
  were tackle tips and the boating tip on how to properly anchor the boat with two (2)
  anchors along the marsh so you can fish perpendicular to the marsh, broadside with the
  current. Clam bellies are like candy to stripers and you can 30 fish per tide and fish to

The focus is not on the species, size
  or number of fish we caught nor the technique and tackle used for fishing. This show is
  special in that is celebrates the spirit and passion of all fisherpeople for the sport we
  love so much. It also focuses on how we may take for granted the wonderful angling
  opportunities we have and the daily mobility with and without boats in getting around. My
  guests this week were Mike Cirovolo and his brother Capt. Anthony Cirovolo of <strong>Hydro
  Therapy Charters</strong>, a wheelchair accessible fishing boat. </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Mike is in a wheelchair after a diving accident left him paralyzed with
  limited mobility in his arms as well. Joining us on this trip were retired high school
  principal Robin Calitri and Peter Hawkins who by the way is also wheelchair bound, but is
  an active fisherman, skier and skydiver and who has won 10 of the last 11 Long Island

  as I fished with Gary in one of his rental skiffs from the fishing station in the gin
  clear waters of Moriches Bay, where you can see the bottom in the gin clear water of 10
  foot. We went shallow water bucktailing on the many sandbars of the area in 2-foot to
  9-foot of water and I could see the fluke take my bait. In this show we gave you fantastic
  Ariel shots of the Moriches Bay area so you can see the tide lines, sand bars, cuts
  between bars and all the hot spots to fish with this bird's eye view. You have to se this
  show! We had quite a few keepers and some to 20 inches with tips on bucktails, rigs, fluke

  show to a new level as we continue using two cameras on the show and have captured
  something very few anglers in their lives have seen...a leaping thresher shark. Rich
  Johnson fished with guests Capt. Al Mott and mate Pat Augustine of the Lil' Ocean Annie
  charter boat in Montauk. We were in search of sharks south of Block Island and we found a
  couple them including a thresher over 220 pounds of which we caught on tape jumping out of
  the water! We show chumming techniques, hooking and rigging with instructions on how to do
  battle with a big fish and from my point of view a tougher fighter than any tuna! We give
  you tips on rigging leaders, tackle tips and some exciting top water footage of this
  thresher from two cameras on <strong>&quot;The Fishing Line.&quot;</strong> One camera
  from deck and the other from the top of the flying bridge for awesome footage of the big

  from Cold Spring Harbor, NY overlooking the middle Island area of Long Island Sound. We
  took a 25 minute ride to the Eaton's Neck Coast Guard Station area and fished an area
  known as the Brush Pile which is known for producing BIG porgies. Anchoring up in 20-foot
  of water, we proceeded to chum with clam chum and the fish came immediately with porgies
  to 2-1/2 pounds! In this show we gave you anchoring and chumming tips with animated
  diagrams and a chart with other fish holding spots in this Eaton's Neck area. This show
  also gave&nbsp; secrets to catching quality fish along drop-off's with tackle and baiting
  tips and we continued our computer generated drawings and diagrams of bottom structure

  the Media Manager for <a href="http://www.lipower.org" target="_blank">LIPA</a>. We filmed
  this show in the middle of the season;s worst heat wave in heat index temperatures of 102.
  The key to this show, was in the title, &quot;Cool Summer Bay Blues.&quot; We beat the
  heat with nature's own air conditioning as we hit the water at 5:30 a.m. and fished the
  back bay in the coolest temps of the day...before and at sunrise. We drilled several blues
  to 8 pounds on surface poppers for some exciting back bay action you may not know even
  exists. The key to success in the back bay in the heat of summer is to establish
  &quot;snapper&quot; patterns since the bay is loaded with them. In this show we gave you
  my favorite lure selections for creating the all important snapper pattern and it paid
  off. We also heard some great tips from Mike Lowndes on how to conserve energy and save
  money during summer. This show also gave&nbsp; secrets to catching quality fish along the
  marsh banks and tide rips around points in the back bay, with tackle and tips. There was
  also the weekly tackle tips and the boating tip. Video Clip for <strong><a href="http://www.thefishingline.com/videos/LIPABlues.asx" target="_blank">High Speed Modem

  worms, trolling, 3-Waying Bucktails and using live or chunked bunker. We have a variety of

  region. Capt. Joe Shastay details worming bass in the Rivers, Capt. Dave Lawrence of the
  Orient Point based Celtic Horizon covers 3-Waying Bucktails, Capt. Nick Montello of the
  Bottom Line Charters covers live and chunked bunker for bass and we even get into Trolling
  for bass too! Don't worry though as just because we did one particular technique in one
  area doesn't mean it won't work in others. That is the aspect we try to put forth each
  week is that every fish we go after and no matter how we do it, that week's technique will
  work for you no matter where you live in the Long Island, NY, New jersey or CT area! An

  the NY metro area. In this show we gathered our snappers on artificial lures, then showed
  you how we tied our special <a href="http://www.daiichihooks.com" target="_blank">Daiichi</a>
  DeathTrap treble hook rig and using live snappers we caught five fluke between 4 &amp;
  what was estimated at 7 pounds, but was weighed in at 8 pounds! We also showed boat
  control in back trolling, stemming the tide, using your LORAN to help control the speed of
  the drift and we covered the biology of BIG fluke, their habitats, what they eat and much,
