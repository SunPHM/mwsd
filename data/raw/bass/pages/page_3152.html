    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming of fall, a hint of cooler water temperatures excites the
    feeding appetites of many area game fish. At the same time, a fall mullet run also takes
    place along the pristine beaches of Amelia Island and at both of its deep inlets, the St.
    Mary's &nbsp;River and the Nassau Sound. However it's the fall mullet run that really
    excites the angling skills of many local salts, as they fish the mullet run for some of
    the year's best fishing action. </p>

    Redfish are a popular target of Amelia Island anglers.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the best waters in which to hook up with this excellent fishing
    action, are the tip of the St. Mary's south jetties, Fort Clinch's little jetties, the
    Nassau Sound fishing bridge and the southern tip of Amelia Island. Obviously, these large
    schools of fall mullet are very tidal oriented, as they begin to gather and make up large
    schools during the falling tide. When the tide nears its low point, a wide variety of game
    fish can be seen feeding on the migrating mullet schools, often vaulting several mullet
    right out of the water. And, many times game fish will come rocketing right out of the
    water as they chase down their easy meal. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these popular game fish include redfish, flounder, tarpon, sharks,
    jack crevalle, king mackerel and sea trout. Look for good numbers of tarpon, sharks and
    king mackerel to school at the mouth of the St. Mary's inlet and also at the Nassau Sound,
    while redfish, sea trout and flounder can be found holding close to bridges, oyster bars
    and jetties. Obviously, you won't have to look too far to find the best fishing holes, as
    the large schools of mullet will often shower the surface as they pass over a favorite
    school of game fish and their hiding spot. </p>

    Fishing Amelia's waters is a beautiful way to spend a cool, autumn day.<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A six to eight foot cast net, with a 5/8-inch mesh, works well when
    cast-netting for mullet. Many skilled fall fishermen will start by cast-netting the mouths
    of small feeder creeks during the high, outgoing tide. After a couple dozen mullet are
    secured in their boat's live well, they will then proceed to their favorite fishing hole. <br>
    The smaller finger mullet work best for flounder, redfish and sea trout, while the larger
    roe mullet are ideal for tarpon and large sharks. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The fall tides also provide excellent red bass fishing in the flooded marsh
    flats. Tailers can be cast towards with flies, topwater plugs or a wide variety of lures.
    Some of the better fly patterns are the epoxy spoons and crab patterns. For lures, try the
    1/2 ounce, gold Johnson spoon or a black, plastic jerk worm. Obviously, finger mullet or
    live shrimp will tempt reds in the grass, as well. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Offshore fishing is excellent during the fall for a wide variety of bottom
    feeders including grouper, red snapper and black-sea bass. Try fishing right on the bottom
    with cut bait, squid or live cigar minnows. Some of the more popular fish havens for
    bottom fishing are located between 10 and 15 miles from the coast of Amelia Island, and
    are all marked on the local offshore fishing charts. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Trolling for kingfish, barracuda, bonito, cobia and tuna is also good during
    the fall at many of these same offshore fish havens. Many local deep-sea fishermen prefer
    to troll with livies, including cigar minnows, spanish sardines or my favorite, mullet. </p>

    Bass fishing is excellent in many local tidal rivers <br>
    during the fall fishing season.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; Wahoo headline the fishing action for northeast Florida's Gulf Stream. The
    continental shelf is located some 65 nautical miles offshore where wahoo running from 50
    to 100 pounds are common. Other favorite species include dolphin, tuna, sailfish and blue
    marlin. One of the best fishing tactics includes trolling plastic lures, rigged with large
    ballyhoo. Some of the more popular trolling plastics include the &quot;Wahoo Whacker&quot;
    and the &quot;Tuna Tango,&quot; by C&amp;H Lures. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Surf fishing is outstanding during the fall for whiting, pompano, redfish,
    seatrout and flounder. Some of the better baits include fresh shrimp, sand fleas or live
    finger mullet. Look for the best surf action to come from the southern tip of Amelia
    Island. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Freshwater bass fishing is also excellent during the fall months in many of
    the local tidal rivers. Look for some of the better action to come from Loftin Creek and
    the Little St. Mary's river. A tried and true bass tactic includes fishing the low tide
    with a floating rapala, or plastic worm. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Crabbing is a favorite with families, and can be enjoyed on many of the inland
    waterways. First, tie a piece of chicken to a long string, and attach a weight to the end
    of the string and chicken. When a slight tug is detected, bring in the line and net the
    crab with a long-handled crab net. For excellent eating, boil the crabs alive in a pot of
    water with crab seasoning added! <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Out of state residents will need to purchase a saltwater fishing license when
    fishing from land, bridges or a boat.<br>
