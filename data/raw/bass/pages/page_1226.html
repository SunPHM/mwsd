<img border="0" src="Gene_Alive_2.jpg" width="262" height="360" align="left">It
started for me back in 1976.&nbsp; I was 15 years old I bought my very first
album. It was&nbsp; &quot;<b>KISS Destroyer</b>&quot; and I bought it with my
own money.&nbsp; It cost me $6.99 plus tax.&nbsp; My parents could not believe I
spent that much for a record. I listened to it over and over.&nbsp; The
infection had begun to spread and I wanted more.&nbsp; Soon after I bought
&quot;<b>KISS </b>ALIVE!&quot;
for $11.99.&nbsp; I put the LP on the turn table and donned my headphones like a
fighter pilot dons his helmet as he prepares for a combat mission.&nbsp; I knew
I was going to experience something powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I played that
album I began to realize that there was something happening to me.&nbsp; I
started to hear something within the music.&nbsp; It was there, something
&quot;deeper&quot; than the guitars , drums and vocals.&nbsp; It was dark,
precise, powerful and alive!&nbsp; I could feel it more than I could hear
it.&nbsp; Then like a revelation I realized I was listening to the bass
guitar.&nbsp; I focused and studied Gene Simmons' method.&nbsp; The more I
listened the more I could sense it.&nbsp; It was if Gene Simmons' bass playing
spoke to me.&nbsp; I knew then I was destined to be a bass player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">Three years later I bought my first
Bass Guitar.&nbsp; A friend of mine knew I was looking for one and told me about
this guy who was selling his.&nbsp; He wanted <b>$175.00</b> for it.&nbsp; This
was a lot of money for me at the time but I managed to&nbsp; scrape up the money
(I used my savings and borrowed $100.00 from my Dad.)&nbsp; I went to see the
bass guitar this guy had for sale.&nbsp; When he opened the case my jaw dropped.
It was a <b>Gibson Grabber with an Eggplant Sparkle</b> finish just like the one
<b>Gene Simmons</b> had on the cover of &quot;ALIVE!&quot;.&nbsp;
Needless to say I snatched it up so fast, the guy was still picking up the money
off the floor as I got on the bus to go home with my prize!&nbsp; From that
moment on I have never looked back.&nbsp; Playing a bass guitar is a pleasure
that I cannot describe.&nbsp; It is my source of relaxation, enjoyment and
expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img border="0" src="Genegbbr.jpg" align="right" width="205" height="302"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial">I recently purchased <b>KISS</b>
 ALIVE!
(The Kiss Remasters) and as I listen
to it again 20+ years later I still can appreciate the talents of these four
gentleman during the performance of this particular album.&nbsp; Gene Simmons'
bass playing is as I remember it, and it stirs the feelings and memories of my
youth.&nbsp; It is something that I will always remember.&nbsp; In my opinion,
Mr. Simmons' best work!&nbsp; Many may argue
the members of <b>KISS</b> are lacking with respect to their musical
talents.&nbsp; I for one feel a loyalty to them, especially to Gene for I have
no doubt without his influence, talent and bass playing style I would not be
playing my 12-string or any other bass today.&nbsp; That is why I chose to recognize
Gene Simmons on my website as the biggest influence of my bass playing life!</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3" face="Arial">Thank you Mr. Simmons!</font></b></p>
