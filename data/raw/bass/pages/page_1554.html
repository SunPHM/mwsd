<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b><i><font color="#80FFFF"><font size=+2>20
questions for Lenie:</font></font></i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#80FFFF">1) How did you hear about BEATLEMANIA auditions?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">I was aware of the show through the TV advertising
before I ever auditioned. My personal manager at the time gave me the number
to call in NYC.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">I was living in PA at the time. He said they
were looking for more fakes as the show was expanding.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">2) Had you been impersonating Paul McCartney before
you heard about Beatlemania?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">No, not per se. I was in a band in PA that did
mostly original music. I had always been a very large Beatle nut and had
a talent for impersonation.&nbsp; </font><font color="#80FFFF">(we can
sure tell by your demo!*)</font><font color="#FFFF00"> But even as a child
I had fantasized about being Paul McCartney.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">3) What was your audition experience like? (eg:
was the room full of Beatle impersonators, or was it just you and a music
director?)</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">I scheduled my audition in enough time to go back
to PA and have a laugh.&nbsp; I never thought I'd have a chance. But the
room was full of Beatle hopefuls and my hopes rose as I saw that most people
auditioning were not very talented.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The&nbsp; "Pauls" were required to play a song
on piano, guitar (Yesterday) and bass. Most guys did not get past 8 bars
or so.&nbsp; I had studied up on "Yesterday" noting that the recording
employed a guitar tuned&nbsp; one step down. Being left-handed helped a
bit in that my "look" would be enhanced over my right-handed competitors.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">I remember singing "Got To Get You Into My Life"
first.&nbsp; I figured if I was going to get the axe it might as well be
loud. To my surprise I got through the whole song to a round of applause.
I was encouraged.&nbsp; "Yesterday" was next and I got through that whole
song, again to applause. I then played "The Long And Winding Road" on the
piano all the way through.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Sandy Yaguda, the musical director, then asked
if I knew any other Beatle songs so I sang "Penny Lane" and then "Get Back".&nbsp;
I got the feeling that I was doing well.&nbsp; After the last song Sandy
asked me to step outside with him.&nbsp; To my surprise, he offered me
the job on the spot!&nbsp; I think there was a shortage of Pauls at the
time.&nbsp; I was invited to that night's show and to be wined and dined
by management.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Well, my head was spinning. I spent the rest of
the day at my parent's home in Long Island and then went into the city
to see the show.&nbsp; "Bunk 1" was playing that night.&nbsp; I was very
impressed by the show and got to meet Joe, Mitch and the rest of the crew.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">I was brought on stage after the crowd filed out
and re-auditioned for the shows producer, Steve Leber.&nbsp; He asked me,
after a brief reprise of TLAWR,&nbsp; if I could leave for LA in the morning.&nbsp;
I was not ready for that!! I had just been married and I was in a pretty
successful band at the time. I told him I'd have to have a little time
to think it over. At any rate, I was now an employee of BEATLEMANIA<font size=-2>&reg;</font>.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">4)&nbsp; How old were you when you were accepted
into the show?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">All of 25 years old.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">5)&nbsp;&nbsp; What was your first experience
on stage as Paul in front of an audience like?&nbsp; Was it the first for
your other band members as well?&nbsp; Tell us that moment right before
you hit that first note on IWHYH!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">It was pretty frightening! Although I had practiced
long and hard (5 months) with my band, Bunk 5, my first show was with Bunk
2.&nbsp; It was odd in that my first show was with three other guys I had
never played with before. It was also weird when we first started IWHYH.
The curtain was down in front of us and we played&nbsp; the song with the
scrim in front of us as well. No audience contact.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">6)&nbsp; How many years were you with the show?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;Officially I was hired in November of 1977
and my last show was in the spring of 1984.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">7)&nbsp; You were the production's first "lefty"
bass&nbsp; player, correct?&nbsp; Where there any other "Pauls" in the
line-up that played left handed after you came along?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">It's not true that I was the first left-handed
Paul! Mitch did a number of shows playing lefty.&nbsp; Although, I'm sure
about 99% of his shows were righty,&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">he bravely strapped on the lefty bass for a few
shows that I saw.&nbsp; No small feat.&nbsp; I was the first full-time
lefty Paul, however. The only other one was Glen Burtnick.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">8)&nbsp; Did you play guitar or piano left-handed
too?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">The Piano can only be played in one direction!
</font><font color="#80FFFF">(we
knew that! just testing you!) </font><font color="#FFFF00">I did, however,
play the guitar right-handed. The story goes that I first learned bass
lefty, then abandoned it for the righty six-string and then picked up the
lefty bass again when I got in the show.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">9)&nbsp; Were there ever any accidents on stage
say during costume changes? eg: trips and falls, etc.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Too many to mention, but the most memorable accident
happened to Tony Kishman opening night in Washington, DC. 1979. During
"Day Tripper" balloons kept floating out of the light rigging. The fake
Beatles were to pop the balloons as they descended. At the end a giant
(four foot diameter) balloon controlled by a tether, was to menace "Ringo".&nbsp;
This night the tether was off its track and the balloon was nowhere near
"Ringo" when it was time to pop it. Jimmy Pou had to swipe at it with the
headstock of his guitar. The balloon popped but the tether wire got tangled
in the headstock of the Ovation guitar Tony was to play for the next song,
"Yesterday".&nbsp; When Tony turned around to get the guitar it was gone!&nbsp;
It was now in pieces backstage!&nbsp; Our stage manager practically pushed
Tony out to the platform to sing.&nbsp; I was watching this disaster unfold
from the percussion room. Poor Tony was forced to ad-lib for a few moments
and the decided to sing "Yesterday" without his guitar. He urged the orchestra
to start with him so there would be some music behind his singing. It sounded
like a good idea at the time with one small problem; the music called for
the string players to go to the bridge after their first verse. Tony however
sang the second verse while the strings were playing the bridge. It was
a train wreck of monumental proportions!</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">10) If you had any, what was the most embarrassing
moment on stage?&nbsp; Power outage?&nbsp; Flubbed lyrics? Sneezes? etc.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">I once sang the French lyrics to "Michelle" in
the first verse. The rest of the song was the same verse over and over
again as I just could not find my place. I once started laughing uncontrollably
in "Eleanor Rigby" due to a few sour notes played by the string section.
We just started over from the top!</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">11) What was your favorite part of the show?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Flower Power" section. It was
cool playing with the extra musicians and fleshing out those previously
unplayable tunes.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">12) What was your least favorite?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beginning.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">13) Who did you enjoy working with the most?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">I enjoyed working with all of the guys! But my
favorite BEATLEMANIA band was Bob Miller, Joe Pecorino, Ralph Castelli,
and me.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF00">We worked together for about two years in the
early eighties.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">14) Where did you enjoy performing the most? (What
city, country, theatre, etc.)&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Montreal. Quebec City. And the beautiful people
of Brazil.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font color="#80FFFF">15) Did you play vintage instruments and use vintage
equipment for the show?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Alas, no. All reissue guitars and the Vox amps
were mid seventies vintage.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">16) Okay, if you were trapped on a desert island
with only one "musical" instrument, which would it be?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">My favorite all-time instrument is my 1972 Gibson
ES-345. A sweeter guitar I've never known. Honorable mention, my 1963 L/H
Hofner artist bass.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">17) We know that supposedly none of the original
Beatles ever saw the show live, but some people from the Beatles camp (other
than attorneys) did see it.&nbsp; Do you recall who?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Most prominent was George Martin who saw the London
production in the late 70's.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">18) Did you ever meet any of the Beatles?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">19) Do you still perform with other alumni?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Yes. I still work with Joe Pecorino, Louis Colucci,
Tom Teeley and David Leon from time to time.</font>
<p><font color="#80FFFF">20) All in all, looking back, how was the Beatlemania
experience for you?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF00">Pretty terrific! It changed the direction of my
life and has a great influence even today. I had the opportunity to see
the world, meet thousands of people, play the greatest pop music ever written
and make many life-long friends. A pretty good deal.</font>
