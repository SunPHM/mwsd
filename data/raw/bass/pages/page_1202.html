<a href="racyrec2.jpg"><strong>Later label style.</strong></a>   <br>                                                                   
A short-lived 1936 Hollywood label, laminated pressing with the 
same selection on both sides for jukebox
consumption.  Classic period style label with dark blue
design on a gray label.  Though credited to Hollywood            
Specialty Recordings, these were actually a product of           
the <a name="Radio Transcription Co.">Radio Transcription Co. Of America, Ltd.</a>, 1509 
N. Vine St., Hollywood, now <a href="http://www.transco.co.uk:80/products/laquer.html">TRANSCO</a>.  
Those who are convinced this is the devil's music will be reassured to know the
Chicago office was located at 666 Lake Shore Drive.  
Numerical rangeis HS 412-HS 422.  The later label design uses the same artwork as <a href="p_blue.html#PARADISE">PARADISE PLATTERS</a>. Numbers in the
runoff are written in the same hand as <a href="h_blue.html#HOT SHOTS ">HOT SHOTS FROM 
HOLLYWOOD</a>, also recorded at the Associated Cinema Studios, Hollywood. 
Some items were reissued on <a href="h_blue.html#HOLLYWOOD HOT SHOTS">HOLLYWOOD HOT SHOTS</a>. <a href="racylist.html">See label listing.</a>

A Radio Record Company was originally incorporated in Westchester
County, NY.  April 28, 1931. If this is the same outfit that later operated at 1658 Broadway, New York, NY,  it would be the earliest known party label.  Known releases are much later,  when it shared quarters with <a href="b_blue.html#BELL">BELL NOVELTY RECORDS</a>.  988 is reportedly
single-sided, others range between 129 and 606.  Label is green with 
black print.  Take numbers are occasionally shown in the runout after the catalog number. Later issues drop the 'Novelty' apellation.

sides migrated to party labels in the late 1940's and 50's. <BR>

*Note: Several U. S. recordings (not just risque items) were manufactured with white test pressing labels and sold to jukebox operators. While less common that other issues, these should not be regarded as great rarities.  When the John Ryan Records were produced, matrix numbers on each stamper had to be obliterated individually and some are still legible.
