African music is one of the strongest cultural exports that the region has, and 1997 was a
year packed with releases to be reckoned with.<br>
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><img src="_borders/Kotto_Bass_Soukous_Fusion.JPG" width="126" height="122" alt="Kotto Bass Soukous Fusion.JPG (7391 bytes)"><font color="#FFFFFF">Not that 1997 was
without loss: at the year&#146;s commencement, Cameroon<br>
lost its prince of Makossa music, Kotto Bass, after he was reportedly<br>
poisoned over a fish &amp; piment dinner. He had just completed a wonderful<br>
album, &quot;Soukouss Fusion,&quot; which had positioned him for further musical<br>
stardom. And most recently, in neighboring Nigeria, the king of<br>
Afro-Beat, Fela Anikulapo Kuti,
died reportedly of heart failure just<br>
after being released of another imprisonment charge by the Nigerian<br>
government. Fela, who is outlived by his musician son Femi Kuti, will be<br>
sorely missed by fans the world over who cherished his drawn-out,<br>
rambling funky brass jams, set to his no-nonsense preaching. <br>
On a far brighter note, Soukous music made a remarkable comeback<br>
after a relatively disappointing 1996. </font> </font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><img src="_borders/Defao_Amour_Interdit.JPG" width="124" height="120" alt="Defao Amour Interdit.JPG (8844 bytes)"><font color="#00FFFF"> 
</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
In Yaoundé, one couldn’t help but notice the around-the-clock frequency that 
recent hits by Defao &amp; The Big Stars and Koffi Olomide were being spun. The
season&#146;s hit album, already destined to be a classic among Congolese music
aficionados, was Defao&#146;s<br>
&quot;Amour Interdit&quot; release, which contains 10 excellent and varied tracks<br>
including the sensational single, &quot;2eme mi-Temps Famille
Kikuta.&quot; <br>
Everyone is dancing to this perfectly constructed, quintessential Soukous<br>
hit of the Nineties. It has velvety vocals, abrasive punch, and a<br>
crescendo that reaches near ecstasy levels with tasteful and delirious<br>
guitar licks that will tease you until you&#146;re begging for more. </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Another nice change from the sometimes overly slick
Paris-based sessions was<br>
Koffi&#146;s Quartier Latin band, which was responsible for the most
gutsy and<br>
creative hit of the year. &quot;Ultimatum&quot; has perhaps one of the funkiest<br>
beats and roller-coaster baselines of any recent song in memory.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Not to be outdone is the renowned Papa Wemba and his<br>
band, Viva La Musica, who present a professional and smoking release,<br>
&quot;Nouvelle Ecriture.&quot; Fans will enjoy the linear notes which read like a<br>
fan-club scrapbook and delight to the Afro-Latin jam with Salsa legend<br>
Tito Puente. A big letdown for me was the recent Pépé Kallé album<br>
entitled &quot;Merci Maman.&quot; Perhaps after his superb 1995 release,<br>
&quot;Gardez-Votre Souffle,&quot; I was all the more critical on the current album.<br>
My main complaint is the inferior sound quality of the recording, which<br>
is surprising since his band, Empire Bakuba, recently released &quot;Savoir<br>
Vivre&quot; which has perhaps the best sonic fidelity of any Soukous release. <br>
Finally, the update wouldn&#146;t be complete without touching on Zaiko Langa<br>
Langa whose glorious vocals and extended jams on &quot;Sans Issue,&quot; prove once<br>
again why they are still reigning after 27 years in the business. <br>
Soukous doesn’t get any more authentic then this. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">As for the realm of Bikut-si music, a whole heap of
new material<br>
surfaced from the growing staple of singers, but there seemed to be a<br>
lack of creativity and uniqueness. While pedalé still rules, it seemed<br>
like many artists were searching for something new in the music that they<br>
just couldn&#146;t get at. The genre&#146;s best known group, Les Têtes Brûlées,<br>
recently toured France to present material from their 1995 album, &quot;Be<br>
Happy,&quot; and are presently rehearsing new material in Yaoundé. The band<br>
hopes to tour the U.S. during the Summer of 1998 and is currently<br>
searching for new label representation in the States. This, of course,<br>
leads us to one of the largest frustrations for Bikut-si fans. While the<br>
style is intensely popular and readily available in Cameroon, outside of<br>
the country it is near impossible to locate a majority of the releases. <br>
</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">However, with the recent release of two CD&#146;s
aimed specifically at the<br>
export market, it looks like our prayers are finally being answered. A<br>
must-buy is the new album, &quot;Cameroon Bikut-si Tempo,&quot; which is a<br>
&quot;Best-Of&quot; featuring the artists Chantal Ayissi, Dieu Ngolfe, Ndjang le<br>
Zappeur and Sala Bekono. This is the first CD to effectively capture the<br>
recent Pedalé craze, and its excellent sound quality and Sonodisc<br>
distribution means that you should be able to get a hold of it. Another<br>
CD that has washed up on the Manhattan shoreline is the &quot;Best of Zélé le<br>
Bombardier.&quot; Zélé is one of the leading pedalé artists in the Bikut-si<br>
Hit Parade, and although I prefer Bisso (Tao Tao) Solo&#146;s singing, Zélé<br>
made it here first. Thus keep your eyes open for other Bikut-si<br>
releases, as it appears that someone has finally decided that there is a<br>
market for the music&#146;s export. Finally, if you happen to get to Yaoundé,<br>
be sure to visit Paquitta Plus, L&#146;Escalier or the Club Carrosel to see<br>
these artists perform their latest hits live! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><br>
There has been an exciting array of interesting female Afro-Pop<br>
releases being produced in Europe that are worth your attention. The<br>
African Zouk diva, Monique Séka, has just released an excellent, albeit<br>
very electronic album, entitled &quot;Adeba.&quot; If you like your Zouk sultry,<br>
slick with horns and rounded out with lush female vocals, then any of<br>
Monique&#146;s albums are for you. Another winner is from Sally Nyolo, whose<br>
first solo release, &quot;Tribu,&quot; on Tinder Records, is impressive and far<br>
more acoustic an album. Sally showcases her vocal ability to remarkable<br>
extent on several of the tracks, where only bass and melodic drum rhythms<br>
accompany her. Do not be mislead, this is a deep and somewhat<br>
trance-inducing music, and the Eton language is beautiful to listen to. <br>
This former Zap Mama singer will hopefully get encouraging response from<br>
her first solo CD. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><br>
Makossa lovers are in luck as well, because there is always a<br>
wealth of releases and reissues from the likes of TJR and Sonodisc<br>
Records. The big news is the simultaneous mega-release from Petit<br>
Pays (who is now so popular that he has a street named after him).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Not one but three albums came out at the same time on the same
label. A case study in clever<br>
marketing, Petit Pays combines great Zouk and Makossa beats with an<br>
exacting amount of groaning and wailing that will predictably gain him 5<br>
stars from his countless female fans at home and abroad. <br>
The wealth of music styles and exciting, uplifting beats from<br>
Central Africa certainly overwhelms all the otherwise sour news emanating<br>
from the media these days. This region has an outstanding cultural and<br>
musical heritage that shows no signs of diminishing with the tough times.<br>
<br>
Grab these CD&#146;s, play them at full volume, and teach your friends and<br>
neighbors about the positive things coming out of Africa these days. <br>
Until next time, peace and keep on grooving!
