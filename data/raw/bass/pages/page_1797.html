<P>New Alvarez Yairi FY-94 HALF OFF   899.50  SOLD
This guitar is an Alvarez Yairi FY-94. The FY-94 features an OM style folk orchestra body. The top is solid spruce with an abalone rosette and scalloped bracers for a more pleasing tone. The back and sides are solid mahogany, which is unusual for an Alvarez Yairi (most of their guitars do not have a solid back). Vintage natural finish shows off the beauty of the spruce and mahogany used in the construction of this guitar. The body of the guitar is bound with ivory multi-layer body binding. The fingerboard is rosewood with a 12th fret diagonal inlay. The bridge is made of rosewood and is direct coupled. Tuning machines are gold die cast. This guitar is a factory second, which means that it has a small flaw somewhere on the body of the guitar and as a result we are allowed to sell it for far cheaper. The only flaw on this guitar is a small chip in the wood near the outermost peg on the bridge (see pic). As a result of this tiny flaw, the price on this guitar is cut in half from $1799 to $899.50. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable guitar for an inexpensive price.

<P>New Alvarez Yairi FY-200 HALF OFF   1699.00
This guitar is a brand new Alvarez Yairi FY-200.  The FY-200 features an Orchestra style body with solid Indian rosewood back and sides.  The top is solid spruce decorated with an abalone shell rosette.  Vintage natural finish shows off the beauty of the wood used in the construction of this fine guitar.  Maple body binding.  The guitar is braced with Yairis signiture X-shaped scalloped braces for a more pleasing tone.  The fingerboard is ebony with a twelfth fret diagonal inlay.  The direct-coupled bridge is also ebony.  Tuners are gold die cast.  <P>
This guitar is a factory second, meaning that it has a small flaw somewhere on the guitar and as a result Yairi sells it to us for far cheaper than they normally would, and we in turn can pass those savings on to you.  The flaw on this guitar is a small chip, about 4 millimiters squared, in the abalone shell of the rosette.  The flaw has been glossed over, and blends in almost perfectly with the abalone.  If I hadn't known that a flaw existed I probably never would have been able to find it.

<p>Alvarez Yairi DY-500 HALF OFF   2500.00<br>
This guitar is a brand new absolutely gorgeous Alvarez Yairi DY500.  The DY500 features the dreadnought body style with a tinted solid spruce top fitted with scalloped bracers for a more pleasing tone.  The back and sides are a beautiful solid Indian rosewood, bound with maple and abalone.  The guitar is covered in a beautiful vintage natural finish, which brings out the beauty of the spruce and rosewood used when this guitar was hand crafted in Japan.  The rosette is set with abalone, as are the large diamonds inlaid into the ebony fingerboard.  The bridge is direct coupled and crafted out of ebony.  Tuning Machines are gold die cast.  This is the best guitar that Alvarez Yairi makes. 

The guitar is a factory second, meaning that it has a small flaw somewhere on the guitar and as a result Yairi sells it to us for far cheaper and we in turn can sell it for much less than a regular Yairi.  The flaw on this guitar is what looks like a tiny hairline scratch above the rosette on either side of the fingerboard (see pictures).  The scratches are tiny, almost invisible, and will not cause problems in the future.  As a result, the price on this guitar is cut by over half from it's retail of $4999.00 to $2449.00.

Model F-385 great sounding Takamine 12-string. Solid spruce top, mahogany back and sides. Rosewood fingerboard. Easy to play. All original except for 2 replaced bridge pins. Some capo marks on the back of the neck (see pic). Sounds better than the Taylor 12-string I have in stock. You would be hard pressed to find a better sounding 12-string in this price range. <P>

<p>Fender Strat Plus  695.00
Nice blue Fender Strat plus in great condition. All original except for one replaced saddle on the high e string. It is missing a back plate and one volume knob. Plays and sounds great. The lace sensor pickups are very quiet and they especially sound great through effects. Rosewood board. Shipping in the US will be 25.00. <p>

<p>White Fender Squire   350.00
This is a used Japanese Fender Squire, which is one of the best squires ever made. These guitars can be real sleeper deals, because a lot of people confuse them with Chinese, Korean, or Mexican squires. The Japanese versions were a superior instrument. They sound very close in tone to an authentic American 1960s strat. This one is in good playing condition, and has practically no fretwear at all. It is missing the back plate (see pic). There are two finish cracks which you can see in the pics underneath the bridge. There are another two finish cracks where the neck of the guitar meets the body. These are finish cracks only; the wood is not harmed. <p>

<p>Near-Mint Silvertone Guitar 595.00
This is a near-mint condition silvertone guitar, with the original amp-in-case. This tube amp is a better quality amp with more power and tremlo than some of their other models. This guitar is a double cutaway model with two lipstick tube pickups. Neck is in great shape. 3-way switch and a volume and tone control for each pickup. This is practically mint except for a few little scuffs on the top of the headstock. You would be hard pressed to find a cleaner model of this guitar. This is the same model guitar as the one in the movie "That thing you do" with Tom Hanks.

This is a very nice used five-string banjo. No labels or brands anywhere except "John Boulding Jan 2003" written in pen under the bridge. Could this be a custom banjo made for/by John Boulding?
