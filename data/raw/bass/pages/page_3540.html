							<p>A favorite way to spend warm summer evenings on Nantucket is to walk along the waterfront. This time of year the boat basin is full of impressive yachts and well-tended sportfishing boats, and a number of the galleries and shops on the wharves stay open late.</p>
							<p>One of our favorite stops on these evening meanders is Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute;. Near the end of the white shell walkway that leads down picturesque Old South Wharf, this charming dockside eatery is a perfect spot to enjoy the evening ambiance of Nantucket.</p>
							<p>Owner and seasoned restaurateur Tim Madden named his new caf&eacute; for an historic landmark on his property. &#147;It&#146;s a romantic name, and I&#146;m intrigued by the folklore that is attached to it,&#148; he explained. It is said that Eat Fire Spring, a still-active fresh water spring, was discovered and named centuries ago by the Native Americans here who believed that its pure, cold water had &#147;powers to preserve and restore health.&#148; During the drought of 1847, Eat Fire Spring continued to offer an abundant supply of water.</p>
							<p>Like its namesake, Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute; seems to have a restorative quality. It&#146;s a retreat in the center of the action&#151;an ideal spot to escape and recharge. Its many local patrons say that at Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute; they feel like they&#146;re the ones on vacation.</p>
							<p>Meals are served outside under a wide canopy on a brick patio with a lush border of cheery pink and white and lavender impatiens. Guests can enjoy the fresh island air and watch the activity along the wharf as they dine. Tables are decorated with colorful splatter painting and adorned with gorgeous hand-blown glass vases with fresh flowers and hand-blown hurricane globes with candles. The effect is bright, airy, and clean; casual with touches of elegance.</p>
							<p>Should the weather be less than inviting for outdoor dining, clear sides can be dropped from the canopy to shelter diners from the weather. Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute; also has an indoor dining room with windows that overlook the Boat Basin.</p>

							<p>The caf&eacute;&#146;s waitstaff is warm and welcoming, and several of them are members of the Madden family. Tim is everpresent, making sure that all runs smoothly. His oldest daughter Alexandra is a manager and bartender; middle daughter Rose is a hostess; and 11-year-old Molly is &#147;dessert taster&#148; and general assistant. Reservations are not accepted, but parties of 8 or more are encouraged to call ahead. If there is a wait, the location provides plenty of options for sightseeing and shopping until a table is ready.</p>
							<p>Lunch is served from noon to 3 p.m.; dinner begins at 6 p.m. In between, the caf&eacute; is open for cocktails and is a relaxing spot for a late-afternoon break. The beer and wine selection is ample and well-matched to the menu. And they have a list of frozen drinks that are especially appealing on a hot August day.</p>
							<p>The hand-blown wine glasses, tumblers, and martini glasses as well as the vases and candle holders, were created by well-known glass artist Robert Dane to Tim Madden&#146;s specifications. These and other fine glass pieces and gifts are available in Eat Fire Spring Gifts, a few doors down the wharf from the caf&eacute;.</p>

							<p>Live entertainment is provided on the six evenings that dinner is served (the caf&eacute; is closed for dinner on Sundays), from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. Performers vary from a jazz trio to acoustic guitar to a cellist playing contemporary and jazz pieces, but no matter what the musical fare, it is an enhancement to the dinner ambiance and a real draw for those who stop by for after-dinner cocktails.</p>
							<p>Appetizers and entrees at the Caf&eacute; are innovative and impressively good. Owner Tim Madden makes sure his kitchen uses very fresh ingredients, organic when possible, and he draws on his talents and years of experience for helping the chef design well-balanced dishes. In many cases, the central ingredient is simply and perfectly prepared and it is the accompaniments and sauces that make the dishes intriguing and highly satisfying.</p>
							<p>With six appetizers, four salads, and a half-dozen entrees, the dinner menu is modest, but there is not a single selection that we would not recommend. Evening specials add at least one appetizer and two or three entrees to the mix. The choices are all refreshingly different from the typical Nantucket menu, and all are served in generous portions at sensible prices.</p>

							<p>Their <b>Clam Chowder</b> is a great way to launch a meal. It&#146;s a traditional version&#151;very creamy, thick with potatoes, New England comfort food. Or try the <b>Twin Crab Cakes</b>. These are pure crabmeat, flavored with onions, leeks, and portobello mushrooms, and served with dollops of fiery sirachi remoulade.</p>

							<p>The <b>Grilled Asian Shrimp</b> left our party of four competing over the last two. The six plump shrimp, marinated in soy and ginger, are grilled exactly the right amount of time and served curled around a salad of seaweed and julienne vegetables. A citrusy ponzu sauce is provided for dipping.</p>

							<p>Another sensational way to begin is with the <b>Eat Fire Spring Rolls</b> &#151;tightly wrapped packets of shrimp, red pepper, carrot, celery, and Napa cabbage. They arrive piping hot and crunchy, the filling delicate and crisp. A vibrant dipping sauce of soy and ginger served alongside adds a vivid tang. We liked this gingery sauce so much that we finished it off by dipping into it the greens that the rolls were served upon.</p>

							<p>You don&#146;t often see <b>Grilled Lamb Chops</b> as an appetizer, but after tasting them at Eat Fire Spring Cafe, we definitely be back for more. More an abbreviated entree than a starter, the dish is three small, succulent chops served with buttery mashed potatoes in an impossibly good orange mint sauce that lifts and brightens the rich, savory flavor of the lamb. We gave up all pretense, picked them up with our fingers, and ate them down to the bone.</p>

							<p>Consider yourself lucky if the <b>Grilled Rib Eye</b> is offered as a special when you&#146;re at Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute;. Cooked perfectly to temperature, this handsome cut was slighly charred on the exterior yet medium-rare and juicy on the inside. It was served over a bacon and blue cheese risotto cake, sauteed till browned and crunchy. A luxurious bourbon gravy with some black pepper heat was poured overtop and the steak was topped with a tangle of sweet, thin Vidalia Onion Rings.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>A better name for Eat Fire's hearty Penne Pasta with mushrooms and chicken might be &#147;<b>Chicken and Mushrooms with penne pasta</b>,&#148; because there is as much, if not more, of the &#147;topping&#148; in this entree than there is pasta. The large pieces of chicken tossed with the pasta are moist and the sauteed portobello and shiitake mushrooms are in chunks big enough to retain their earthy flavors. Fresh basil and generous shavings of parmesan cheese deepen the flavor of this very appealing entree.</p>

							<p>A delightful mix of the subtleties of earth and sea can be savored in the <b>Nantucket Striped Bass</b>. For this, the chef starts with a base of buttery mashed potatoes with chunks of fresh lobster folded in. The striped bass, fresh from the docks and roasted till the outside is golden and the flesh moist and flaky, comes next. The entree is finished with a topping of wild mushrooms. This dish of gentle flavors is a deliciously elegant choice.</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p>It was nearly impossible to pick a table favorite, but the entree that drew us back to Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute; for more is the <b>BBQ Grilled Salmon.</b> Gloriously fresh, the salmon is painted with a tomatoey house barbecue sauce that brings out the natural sweetness of the fish. The salmon is served on a bed of sweet corn that is the very essence of summer sunshine and with smaller accents of cinnamon spiced apple-mint chutney. A forkful of the salmon eaten with the corn tastes completely different from a forkful of salmon with the chutney, and both are sensational. This is a dish that would please even the most jaded gourmand.</p>

							<p>Desserts at Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute; change very frequently, and most are made for the caf&eacute; by Fahey and Fromagerie. Two that are usually offered are the <b>Chocolate Globe</b> and the <b>Cappuccino Globe</b>, two different flavors of mousse served in an edible chocolate cup. Espresso and cappuccino are available, or you can sample the house specialty: a cappuccino martini.</p>
							<p>A dinner at Eat Fire Spring Caf&eacute; is a delicious way to relax and recharge.</p>
