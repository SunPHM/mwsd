</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Are you planning a trip to Dallas or Ft. Worth? Well if you are, we have
found the ideal place for you to stay and have some fun.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The DFW Lakes Hilton, as we found out, offers convenience, comfort and much
more. The much more we are referring to are the restaurants, athletic club and
swimming pool and of course the rooms and the conference rooms for meetings,
weddings or what ever a large group would require.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">As we do in all of the properties that we review, will look at the different
aspects that will make you want to stay at the DFW Lakes Hilton.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We will look at the overall hotel including the restaurant and the menu items
served, the amenities including the meeting facilities, bar and the athletic
facilities. Lastly, we will rate the overall hotel experience.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">For starters, we will start with some background information that will make
this property well worth checking into when considering staying in the
Dallas/Fort Worth area.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hotel</font></p>
</b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The hotel, which is located two and one half miles from DFW International
Airport, offers the ease of a short drive or a hotel shuttle can be provided
depending on what your stay requires while in the area. By car, the hotel can be
reached from I 635 or Texas 121.<img border="2" src="dfw%20hilton%20outside.jpg" width="300" height="192" align="right"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The DFW Lakes Hilton, which sits lake side in the town of Grapevine, has all
a traveler will need when coming to the area. The very modern Bass Pro Shops are
located directly across the street and as we found out is well worth the trip
across the street.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If the Bass Pro Shop is not enough for you, then we suggest taking another
walk to the Grapevine Mills mall, which is right to the left of the hotel and is
sure to offer anything a traveler, could possibly want. So whether you are
staying for business or pleasure, the DFW Lakes Hilton has everything you need
within walking distance.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Now that we have described what a traveler should expect around the hotel we
will look at the amenities.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Amenities</font></p>
</b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Next, we looked at the amenities of the hotel, which included the meeting
space and the recreational facilities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">We would have to say the Hilton goes above and beyond many properties in the
Dallas area to please the guest with both incredible meeting and recreational
facilities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The meeting areas which are located on three different floors in the hotel
are perfect for anything such as weddings or week long conventions, which are
very frequent at the hotel. If the hotel meeting space become full they can even
use the 14,000 square feet indoor tennis courts for additional space.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If you are the kind of person that likes to work out then we have found a
place that is second to none in the hotel industry. The DFW Lakes Hilton offers
a full fitness center complete with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis
and racquetball and courts and a full pro-shop which even offers racquet
stringing if you need it.<img border="2" src="health%20club%20at%20dfw%20lakes%20hilton.jpg" width="250" height="168" align="right"></font></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Rooms</font></p>
</b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">After a guest has had the chance to walk around the hotel it might be a good
time to retire to the spacious rooms and enjoy relaxing on one of the Hilton’s
king sized beds. Many of the spacious rooms are also available in suites on
private floors accessed only by room keys.<img border="2" src="dfw%20hilton%20rooms.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="168"></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Other amenities of the rooms include hair dryer, coffee makers, Jacuzzi’s
and bathrobes in the suites and premium Neutrogena bath and body products.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">All of the essentials along with the designed folding of towels and wash
clothes give the rooms a homely setting that any traveler is going to admire.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The mini bar and the data ports for a laptop use are all premium items that
many business travelers enjoy and Hilton provides standard in many of their
hotels.</font></p>
<b>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Restaurant</font></p>
</b><font SIZE="2">
<p></font><font color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, we could not forget about the delicious food offered in one of
the three restaurants inside of the hotel. The Miratage Grill, which offers
steaks, seafood and traditional southwest cuisine, is highly recommended and
once we sampled some of the items we could easily see why any one would should
try their menu items.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">For starters we decided to try what Texas is known for, great steak. A great
steak is exactly what we received. The 10-ounce filet mignon is a healthy
portion and is cooked to order and is mouth watering.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">According to Assistant Food and Beverage Director Arthur English, the filet
is one of most ordered items from the menu. From what we tasted we see why
people continue to order this time after time.</font></p>
<p>
<img border="2" src="dfw%20resteraunt%20items.jpg" width="250" height="165" align="right"><font color="#FFFFFF">All of the seafood items especially the sea bass are highly recommended. The
buttered shrimp as an appetizer is also highly recommended.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">After we sampled the fine items in Miratage, we decided to step over to the
Boardroom, which offers the complete lounge setting with big screen television
and a full service bar with many beers on tap including beers exclusive to the
State of Texas.</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Rating</font></p>
<p></b><font color="#FFFFFF">Overall, we give the DFW Lakes Hilton high marks and a total of four out
of five stars. The staff is very courteous and will help you with any needs. The
bell staff is attentive and will help any guest with bags and anything to get a
guest situated in checking in. The only flaw we saw was the hours of the
athletic club and the fact The Vineyard offers limited hours at night, sort of
channeling all guests into the other two establishments.</font></p>
