  19 is NHLA night at Shorty's Mexican Roadhouse restaurants across the state. 
  Shorty's will donate 15% of the food bill to NHLA for anyone who eats at a Shorty's 
  between 5:00 and 9:00 p.m., and tells their server that they are there in support 
  of NHLA. Anyone can participate, librarians, Trustees, Friends, or members of 
  the public. This is a great opportunity to talk to people about supporting libraries, 
  to get the staff together for a fun night out, to have a social evening with 
  Coop members and spouses, or for your Friends group to mobilize its forces. 
  Encourage everyone to get out, get together, and get to Shorty's for NHLA. Shorty's 
  restaurants are located in Newington, Nashua, Bedford, Manchester, and West

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fifty-four librarians and trustees 
  journeyed to Washington D.C. with staff from the New Hampshire State Library 
  for "NH Librarian's Day" on September 19th. It was a good mixture of public 
  and school librarians, with a few specials tossed in for good measure. We were 
  half asleep as we gathered at Manchester Airport at around 5:00 a.m. for our 
  check in with Darlene, who was well-prepared with our itinerary for the day 
  and nametags, just so we wouldn't get lost! (By the way, is a group of librarians 
  a "gaggle" or a "pride"?) Representative Charlie Bass had invited librarians 
  to Washington, D.C. for the day to tour some of the sites, especially the Library 
  of Congress, and to have lunch with him. </font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="bass-lunch.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0" title="bass lunch" alt="bass lunch" align="right"> 
  We were met at Union Station by Matt O'Hearn, an aide to Mr. Bass who was our 
  guide for most of the day. We then took a walk to the Capitol Building-or rather, 
  around the Capitol Building-as we made our way to the steps and a "meet and 
  greet" with Mr. Bass. Right now a visitor's center is being constructed and 
  a tree preservation project is in place so getting around the Capitol is quite 
  a walk. Charlie Bass is quite proud that the "tree preservation" project was 
  initiated by him and another representative as they engaged in a process to 
  save the oldest tree on the grounds, one that has been around since before the 
  Capitol Building was begun in 1793. John Sununu stopped by to greet the librarians 
  as well and talk about some of his current legislation. After some picture-taking 
  the group departed for the United States Botanic Garden, just a short walk away. 
  The Botanic Garden is full of exotic plants and trees mainly from the southern 
  hemisphere, a few of which are left over from the Wilkes Expedition in 1842. 
  The Orchid Room was beautiful! Lunch followed in a small room at the Cannon 
  House Office Building, one of many impressive buildings in the Capitol area 
  and where Representative Bass has his office. Charlie Bass spent some time speaking 
  to librarians individually and then addressed the group during lunch. He was 
  quite complementary and is truly interested in bringing New Hampshire librarians 
  to Washington D.C. annually for a visit to the Library of Congress and other 
  sites. </font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="bass-sununu.jpg" width="252" height="235" border="0" title="bass-sununu" alt="bass and sununu" align="right"> 
  Our afternoon began with an architectural tour of the Jefferson Building of 
  the Library of Congress, by far the highlight of my day. The building is beautiful 
  and truly awe-inspiring, with sculpture, paintings and mosaics on walls and 
  ceilings. We were then treated to a presentation by Dr. Parr who gave us an 
  electronic review of the National Digital Library and the immense amount of 
  information available there, including digitized documents, photographs, maps, 
  music, and texts. This was valuable for all of us to bring back to our own libraries 
  and communities; it's a great resource for children and adults alike. The rest 
  of our afternoon was free time, to do as we wished, before getting back to Union 
  Station and the ride back to BWI for the return flight. A few of us chose to 
  remain at the Library of Congress and go through the process of getting our 
  picture ID/pass in order to visit the reading rooms. We were able to enter the 
  Jefferson Reading Room with our pass and it is difficult to even say what a 
  special place it is. It is architecturally beautiful and as quiet as a church, 
  despite the research being done there by a number of individuals. We were hesitant 
  to make the slightest bit of noise and disrupt the feel and "sacredness" of 
  the place. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Next year when Darlene Reinhard 
  and Michael York begin to organize the next Washington trip, I urge all of you 
  to consider attending. It is a great opportunity to see part of the city for 
  the first time and visit the largest library in the world. The transportation 
  costs are inexpensive, less than $120, and it wasn't too bad recovering from 
  the 20-hour day! (I can say that now!) </font>

  Public Library Welcomes New Director</strong><br>
  <strong>Colleen C. Fall, Business Information Supervisor, Nashua Public Library</strong></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Joseph Dionne is a name that may 
  be familiar to the New Hampshire Library community. More than twenty-five years 
  later, he returns to New Hampshire as the Director of the Nashua Public Library. 
  He replaces long time director Clarke Davis who retired earlier this year. Mr. 
  Dionne first came to Nashua in 1972 as a reference librarian, and left after 
  becoming assistant director. He brings back a wealth of progressive experience 
  that has kept pace with the changes that have taken place in libraries. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Since leaving Nashua, he earned 
  a Masters Degree in Business and Public Administration and worked at the Lawrence 
  (MA) Public Library for sixteen years. Most recently he was the Director of 
  the Haverhill (MA) Public Library. Among his long list of accomplishments are 
  the completion of automated library systems, major facility renovations, progressive 
  circulation increases up to forty percent annually, acquisition of federal, 
  state, and private grants, joint fund raising ventures, and development of a 
  Job Resource Center. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mr. Dionne looks forward to carrying 
  on his philosophy of community partnerships as he begins networking with neighboring 
  libraries and schools, colleges, businesses and the community at large. "We 
  want everyone in the community to be able to use the public library," he is 
  quoted as saying. </font>

  </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The third annual e-government report 
  by the Tauban Center for Public Policy at Brown University was released earlier 
  this month and New Hampshire's rank showed great improvement. Rising from 48th 
  place to 14th, the Granite State's move represents the largest jump of any state 
  in the nation. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Darrell M. West, director of the 
  Taubman Center, and a team of public policy students examined 1,265 state and 
  federal sites and evaluated the variety and quality of the electronic services 
  they offered. The team ranked sites on a 100-point scale based on availability 
  of information and services, quality of citizen access, and access to material 
  that helps citizens hold leaders accountable. </font>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As the administrator of Webster, 
  (the state's website) the State Library is very pleased with this year's results," 
  said Michael York, State Librarian. "New Hampshire has worked very hard to make 
  our online services the best they can be. Webster provides universal access 
  to state government information. In addition the library has been working to 
  expand the comprehensive suite of databases we've made available to citizens 
  since 1997." These resources include NHewLINK, an outstanding collection of 
  general interest and academic periodicals, newspapers, business and health resources 
  and genealogy sources, as well as the New Hampshire Automated Information System, 
  an online catalog of library holdings statewide. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> According to Theresa Paré, IT Librarian 
  and supervisor of the Electronic and Government Resources section at the State 
  Library, "Webster is becoming a critical component in how citizens learn more 
  about the services and resources provided by the state. We are very pleased 
  with the progress that has been made to make government information more accessible 
  to the public." </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the Taubman Center survey, New 
  Hampshire gained points across the board, improving in the areas of providing 
  information and services online; protecting the security and privacy of citizens 
  using the Internet; responding to emails from citizens; and ensuring access

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hi everyone!</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I'm excited to report that the executive 
  board had a very productive and enthusiastic retreat in August. We had some 
  great discussions about the association and how to best serve the members. Our 
  day was focused on reworking the mission/objective of the association to more 
  accurately describe what we are trying to do and then to come up with some goals 
  & tasks that will support the mission.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The mission/objective is a part 
  of the association's constitution, so the change will need to be adopted by 
  you, the members at the fall conference/annual members' meeting. We're hoping 
  that we can all use this forum to start discussion about the new mission and 
  be ready to adopt this draft (with any changes that may arise from the discussion) 
  at the fall conference on Nov. 7.</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The good news is, it's short -- 
  so please take just a minute to read it & send off a quick message with any 
  thoughts or questions that you may have. Also feel free to contact me individually 
  to discuss anything about NHLA that is on your mind.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It shall be the objective of the 
  Association to promote good library service from all types of libraries to all 
  people of the State and to cooperate with other groups of similar interest. 
  In support of the objective, the Association may carry on any activity permitted 
  under applicable state and federal law, including receiving gifts, endowments, 
  and bequests. The Association is organized exclusively for charitable and educational 
  purposes as defined by applicable state and federal law. No part of the net 
  earnings of the Association shall benefit or be distributed to any member or 
  other individual. The Association shall not participate in any political campaign 
  in support of a candidate. No substantial part of the Association's activities 
  shall be making propaganda or other efforts to influence legislation. If the 
  Association is dissolved, any remaining assets shall be transferred to one or 
  more groups organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes which 
  are tax exempt under IRC Section 501(c)(3). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> New England libraries have a proud 
  heritage and a promising future. A new generation of librarians is needed now 
  more than ever to carry on the noble responsibility to provide access to informational, 
  educational, cultural and recreational library materials and services in a variety 
  of formats and technologies to those they serve, and to support the principle 
  of intellectual freedom as a foundation of a free society. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 2002 Annual NELA Conference, 
  to be held October 20th - 22nd in Sturbridge, MA, will offer many excellent 
  programs for all categories of librarians, support staff and trustees. Pulitzer 
  Prize author, Richard Russo, will be the keynote speaker at the Sunday Annual 
  Banquet. Be sure to read his popular novel, Empire Falls. An all-conference 
  book discussion will feature author Chris Bohjalian and his latest novel, Buffalo 
  Soldiers. Bohjalian will be Tuesday's luncheon speaker. If you missed the chance 
  to hear him at the 2001 Annual Conference don't miss the opportunity this time. 
  ALA President Mitch Freedman and ALA Executive Director will host an ALA forum. 
  Joan Knight, Director of the Jaffrey (NH) Public Library will co-present a program 
  that will teach you how to incorporate puppetry into activities at the your 
  library. Virginia Euwer Wolff, author of Bate 6 and True Believer, will be the 
  featured speaker at the NERTCL luncheon on Monday. Come watch the "Halloween 
  Games" and see which State wins the infamous Snail Award. Learn how to provide 
  users of your library with reliable online and print consumer health information 
  resources. Need to write a marketing plan? Learn how to target your message 
  to different segments of your population. Find out what you can do to recruit 
  the next generation of librarians, and what is behind the title Library Associate. 
  And certainly drop by the exhibitors' booths to hear what new products they 
  are offering. Don't forget to say "Thanks" to them, too. After all, they are 
  major sponsors of the conference. Last, and most important of all, if you are 
  not a member of NELA already, JOIN US! </font>

  State Library and the current President of the New Hampshire Library Trustees 
  Association, will be honored for her dedication and commitment to librarians 
  and trustees working together. To everyone she meets whether it be in New Hampshire,

  of the NHLA Executive Board for over a decade. It is one's professional obligation, 
  I believe, to contribute to the growth and development of our state library 
  association. I urge every NHLA member to find the time to join a NHLA Section, 
  or serve on at least one NHLA committee during his/her library career in NH. 
  There are capable, bright, visionary women and men among us who can lead our 
  Association into the future. Our current Executive Board is comprised of such
