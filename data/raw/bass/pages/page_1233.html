<font size="2" face="Arial">The 
origin of the woods which I use in my instruments and the way in which they are 
harvested are just as important to me as their appearance and tonal properties.</font></i></b></p>
	<p>Since the 
beginning of my guitar-making career in 1990, I have made it a major part of my 
process to utilize both reclaimed and sustainably harvested tonewoods for my 
instruments as well as for the materials which I furnish to other builders. I 
made this decision after seeing the diminishing supply of traditional luthery 
woods such as mahogany, ebony, spruce and rosewood. I discovered that there&nbsp; is 
a wealth of both re-claimed traditional tonewoods and under-utilized woods which 
can produce a superb instrume</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">nt 
and help to stretch the supply of these precious materials.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Some of the 
woods I like to build with are Claro Walnut (urban tree removal), Redwood ( 
building demolition), Bay Laurel (driftwood log), Sitka and Englemann Spruce ( 
blowdowns or bug-killed trees), Red Cedar and Port Orford Cedar ( fire-killed 
trees).<img border="1" src="beachwood.jpg" width="275" height="196" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Dave and Mark harvesting beachwood."></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Ultimately, 
I get a lot of satisfaction from creating a fine guitar or bass from a piece of 
driftwood or from a street tree cut down and destined for the landfill. It must 
be the joy of recycling!</span></p>

prized native trees or reclaimed from old growth timbers.  My guitars and basses are noted for their playability, state of the art design, and wonderful 
rich tone,


with the bass having enough acoustic volume for a small group in an
unamplified setting. Building a limited number of instruments each year allows 
me to put more
attention into each one, assuring that it is optimally playable and has the kind of


tone


and acoustic output that I'm trying to achieve.<IMG SRC="maizemill.jpg" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=208 BORDER=1 align="right" hspace="12" alt="(Photo by Randy Wrighthouse)" vspace="10"></p>

&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">The path that has led me to build acoustic guitars has been a long


and interesting


one.  My first woodworking experiences as a child were whittling a sailboat


and carving


small figures.  As a teenager this evolved into intricate mandalas and


floral carvings.  I had never taken any woodshop classes but forged ahead


with my handsaw,


chisel, carving tools and electric drill.  In college I attended a guitar


building


class and my skill level took a big leap.  The class was taught by Mark Platin of


Wildwood Banjo fame.  Playing guitar since my early teens, I was ready for


a better instrument.


 I couldn't really afford to buy<IMG SRC="images/maizeHW-1995.jpg" ALT="Headwaters model 5-string bass made entirely with woods certified by SmartWood" WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=380 BORDER=1 hspace="12" vspace="10" align="right"> a better guitar so I decided to build one.


My first handbuilt guitar turned out to be successful enough to play, and I was


hooked.   


It was at this point, however, that I took a major detour from guitar


making that


took me to Wisconsin, Tennessee, Chicago, Florida and finally southern


Oregon.  Living


in a spiritual community building wooden orchard ladders, doing


construction, cabinet


making, house painting, alternative energy projects and making handcarved


entry doors


helped me focus my skills.  At the same time I began to seriously play bass
 and guitar.


 All of these points along the way have helped me to accumulate the skills


that I


bring to building acoustic guitars.  Also, being a player I am


sensitive to what


makes an instrument playable and the kind of tone that it should have.</p><p align="right" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

My acoustic basses and guitars are more than a collection of wood and steel


pieces -- more
than a fine, hand built instrument played by renowned players in a range
of musical
styles.  It is also an answer to a question of my own: how to create a
quality instrument and be mindful of our ecological predicament.  I choose
to build with woods that
are less utilized, reclaimed, sustainably harvested or non-endangered,
while not making any tonal or aesthetic sacrifices.<H2>
