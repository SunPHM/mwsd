<P>
The rock bass's name is sort of a misnomer.  It isn't really a bass at all.  Instead it is a member of the sunfish family along with other species such as bluegills and largemouth bass.  But the other half of its name, ROCK, fits perfectly as the rock bass prefers a rocky habitat.
<BR><BR>
The rock bass has a deep, laterally compressed body that very closely resembles that of the warmouth/google-eye. So if you catch a fish similiar to a google-eye but with less mottling and 5 to 7 spines in the anal fin then you have caught a rock bass.
<BR><BR>
The native range of the rock bass is from southern Manitoba east Quebec, southward to the northern Alabama and northern Georgia.
<BR><BR>
Rock bass eat a crayfish, smaller fish, and insects.
