<h4 align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Construction:
4.5</font></h4>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS">Workmanship
</font>is a make-it-or-break-it deal in this price range. Even average
construction should be darn good above the $2,000 line. Good news: Mike Lull's
basses are built for keeps. Our Modern 4V had a super-solid Fender-style
neck/body joint, carefully mounted hardware, and a beautifully applied metallic
finish. One of our tester's volume knobs was a little loose (a relatively easy
fix), and we thought we detected some minor fret lifting around the 12th fret,
but even our .005 feeler gauge couldn't wiggle its way beneath any of the
medium-size wires. (Mike Lull responds: &quot;Our frets are pressed and glued in
place, which makes it near impossible to lift out of the fingerboard.&quot;) The
4V is a winner in the looks department, too. The combination of that
aged-looking &quot;mint green&quot; pickguard and striking maple fingerboard
perfectly convey its vintage-meets-modern aesthetic.</p>
<h4 align="left">Electronics: 4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../images/M4Vgraph.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="201"></h4>
<p align="left">The sonic flexibility and impressive attention to detail (see
photo) Lull brings to his electronics are to be expected, if you're spending
three, four, or even five grand on a bass. Discovering such quality at this
price is a delight.</p>
<h4 align="left">Playability: 4.5</h4>
<p align="left">At an even eight pounds, the 4V makes for one comfy J-style. All
the familiar Jazz attributes are here, fast neck friendly control layout, and
sweet body contours, but the Modern's real playability plus is it's light
weight. Surprisingly, the 4V is also quite balanced, exhibiting very little
headstock dive when played sitting down. (Those&nbsp; Ultra-Lite open-back
tuners are a good call.) Also impressive: Lull's setup job. Right out of the
case, our test bass played like your favorite pair of sneakers.</p>
<h4 align="left">Sound: 4</h4>
<p align="left">Plugged into a variety of amps, from small combos to an 8x10
stack, the 4V gave up an impressive array of classic Jazz tones. Testers partial
to 60's soul and 70's funk lined up beside lovers of 80's and 90's hi-fi sheen.
Like the best vintage Fenders, the Lull excels at producing noteworthy clean
tones, from bright and snappy to warm and burnished. Two exceptions: One tester
cited the 4V's pick-friendly grind in active mode (bass volume: 70%, treble
volume: 95%, bass tone: 50%, treble tone: 70%), and several players loved the
gritty warmth that came from blending both pickups at 75% and rolling off both
tone controls to around 40%. This is definitely a groove-inducing tone.</p>
<p align="left">When discussing the 4V's tone, it's worth mentioning playability
again. Sure, a great-sounding instrument helps, but tone really does come from
your fingers, and some player-friendly basses elicit better tones then others.
The Lull's sleek, creamy-smooth neck encourages all sorts of left-hand
articulation, and the light, snug-fitting body invites a variety of right-hand
attacks. Whether your plucking is feather-light or you like to dig in deep, the
4V feels right.</p>
<h4 align="left">Value 4.5</h4>
<p align="left">The 4V isn't cheap, but when you consider the workmanship,
materials, and setup savvy the makes this bass such a winner, you may wonder how
Mike Lull does it. Certainly a comparable instrument from some of the bass
world's higher-profile luthiers would cost you much more. A bargain at 2,300
bucks? Maybe so.</p>
