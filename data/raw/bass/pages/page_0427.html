<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><big><big><big>B</big></big></big>IG SANDY, Texas--Stan Bass, 70,
regional director in the Caribbean from 1968 to 1990 and Ambassador faculty member from
1990 to 1994, died at home of cancer Aug. 2.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Charles Fleming, Caribbean regional director, reported: &quot;Mr. Bass
went home to be with his Lord at 11:15 this morning. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Thanks to the wonderful grace of God, he had a full assurance of
his salvation. Two days ago he was visited by two of our ministers, and his final words to
them were, `See you in the kingdom!'</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A true man of God, Stan Bass will be remembered by all of us in
the Caribbean for his love of God, for his integrity, gentleness and for always being
there for us. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We in the Caribbean ministry are--directly or indirectly--his
legacy, his heritage. Our prayer is that by the grace of God we may prove as faithful in
our ministries as he proved in his.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Audrey Huntley, Mr. Fleming's administrative assistant, had traveled
from Florida to Big Sandy to help Millicent Bass take care of her husband.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Huntley said she could feel God's presence in the house over the
last few days, and knew that many people were praying for the Basses.</p>

<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Family history</h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bass was born in Ennis, Texas, Dec. 6, 1928. He was baptized in
1954. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Paul Quinn College in Waco, Texas, and a
master of arts from Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas.</p>

assistant in Chicago, Illinois, working with the late Harold Jackson and Dean Blackwell.
He attended Ambassador College from 1963 to 1964, after which he participated in a
baptizing tour through several Southern states. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In October 1967, he married Millicent Kerr, and a few months later they
were sent to Barbados to pastor the church there and to lay the foundation for the
church's work in the Caribbean. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the next 22 years, they were instrumental in establishing
congregations and Bible studies in numerous countries throughout the region, from the
island of Bermuda in the north, to Guyana in the south. They also visited countries in
Central and South America. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1974, Mr. Bass set up the Caribbean Regional Office in Puerto Rico
from which he could adequately serve all the islands. While there, he learned to speak
fluent Spanish in order to serve the Spanish-speaking members of the church. </p>

He was described as a man of compassion, humility, kindness, gentleness and patience, with
a good sense of humor and a love for music. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bass was a mentor and father figure to many ministers and members
alike, an outstanding example of true Christianity. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pastor David Orban, in his eulogy, described Mr. Bass as a man who
exemplified many of the attributes of holy living found in Colossians 3:12-17.</p>

touched. He is survived by his wife, Millicent. The couple had no children.</p>

Joseph Tkach. </p>
