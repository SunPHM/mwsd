man who HATES Senator Goodman. Also, I understand this Roy Goodman is heir
to the Ex-Lax fortune. In the mid-seventies, my grandfather had one of his
bus-length campaign posters on the wall of his garage, with the
Senator's
smiling face replaced by my 4-year-old face. Second best google

religious Hot-rodding, he'd be number 3. &nbsp;Those website

 align="right"> Roy Goodman, British Painter (far be it from me to
comment on his work,
on view at this site).</a> &nbsp;Born in London in 1947, Roy started
drawing
and painting as a young child and never stopped. He studied art at
school,
but apart from a short dalliance with the Hornsey College of Art had
little
formal training. He taught himself through a process of trial and error
and of observation. Influenced by the usual artists and especially
moved
by the Fauves and by Kadinsky and Kokoshka. Trained as a scientist and
currently practising as a research chemist, Roy would say that he is
the
archetypal amateur painter and has always thought that painting is too
good to leave until you retire.&nbsp; Look, he has some <a
