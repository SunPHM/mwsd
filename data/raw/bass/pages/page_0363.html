The MIMForum Bass Project
</font></b></p></center>


<p><font size="+1">The MIMForum Bass Project was born on July 24<sup>th</sup>, 2001, when Larry Davis of <a href="http://www.galleryhardwoods.com">Gallery Hardwoods</a> posted this message on our <a href="http://www.mimf.com/cgi-bin/WebX">Forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>I was just hammering nails into a crate when a HUGE light bulb went off just over my head...... Thank goodness, 'cause I could then see
I had the nail head on the wood and was driving the pointy end with the hammer.... </p>

<p>Along with the light bulb was this huge flashing neon sign, " MIMF Guitar Auction". What I'm thinking is the MIMF folks get together
and decide on some instrument to custom build for the MIMF and auction off as a fund raiser for the forum. Maybe it's to much, really,
to ask for building time donations????? The auction could run for a month to get really good coverage?????? </p>

<p>If it's not such a crazy idea let's here from some folks. I for one, would donate the wood needed....No BRAZILIAN ROSEWOOD :)
(except fingerboards or bridges or headstock or....)</b></p></blockquote>

<p>And so, we were off.  We decided to build a solidbody bass built from plans drawn by longtime MIMForum member and teacher <a href="http://mollinst.com">Bill Moll</a> for our online bass-building courses.  Bill also did the finish work on the bass.</p>  

<p>These plans, for a 4- 5- or 6-string fretted or fretless bass, are available <a href="https://secure.mimf.com/order.htm">for sale</a> if you want to build your own.</p>

<p>MIMForum volunteer staff member <a href="http://www.MarkSwansonMusic.com">Mark Swanson</a> took on the task of organizing the project.  All the wood for the bass was donated by member Larry Davis of <a href="http://galleryhardwoods.com">Gallery Hardwoods</a>.  The body is made up of layers of myrtle, ebony, bubinga and black limba, carefully chosen by Larry for the best match. </p>

<p>Victor Wooten liked our bass!  His exact words were, "This Bass seems to be of top notch quality, has a good sound and a good feel. It will make someone very happy. Great work guys.  Peace, Vic."</p>
