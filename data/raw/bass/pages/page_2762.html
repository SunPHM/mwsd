There are four lakes on the West coast of Mexico where you can go Mexico bass fishing. There is Lake El Salto, Lake Agua Milpa, or as some call it just Lake Milpa, Lake Huites and Lake Baccarac. The Mexico bass fishing at each Lake is a little different because of the age of each Lake. Generally speaking the older lakes produce larger bass but not quite as many numbers as the newer lakes. A Mexico bass fishing trip to one of these four lakes can make any bass angler’s dream come true. <a href="mexicobass.asp"><b>Click here to learn more about Mexico bass fishing</b></a>.</p>

Lake El Salto has produced more double-digit bass than any bass lake in the world. According to Bassmaster Magazine, “if you are in Mexico bass fishing on Lake El Salto, you are on the absolute best trophy bass lake in the world.” The Lake El Salto fishing season is from October 1st through June 30th. The rainy season at El Salto is July 15th through September 30th. <a href="elsalto.asp"><b>Click here to learn more about Lake El Salto</b></a>.</p>

If you are Costa Rica fishing, you are enjoying some of the best deep sea fishing for blue marlin in the world. Costa Rica fishing also offers you some of the best deep sea fishing for sailfish there is anywhere. When you are Costa Rica fishing, you are in one of the hottest fishing areas for rooster fish known to man. In addition to the blue marlin and sailfish, anglers while deep sea fishing also land numerous dorado. Anglers also catch large quantities of blue and yellow fin tuna when deep sea fishing off the West coast of Costa Rica. Deep sea fishing on the East coast of Costa Rica is not as popular as it is on the West coast. Costa Rica fishing on the East coast of Costa Rica is primarily for trophy snook and tarpon.

<p><img src="images/homepage/triangle_blu.gif" width="7" height="10" border="0" alt="Mexico Bass Fishing">&nbsp;<b><a href="alaska_fishing.asp">Alaska Salmon Fishing</a></b></p><p> Alaska fishing offers anglers many options for going salmon fishing. When planning an Alaska fishing trip to go salmon fishing one has many decisions to make. The first is which species of salmon do you want to go salmon fishing for. When going Alaska fishing you can catch king salmon, silver (coho) salmon, sock eye (red) salmon, chum salmon and pink salmon depending on which month you chose to go. Almost all Alaska salmon fishing takes place in June, July, August and September.  There are two reasons why salmon fishing takes place during these months. The first and primary is because that is when the salmon make their annual migration into the rivers to spawn making salmon fishing possible. The other is, in most cases the rivers in Alaska thaw in May making Alaska fishing in its great rivers possible. We think the Unalakleet River offers some of the best salmon fishing that Alaska fishing has to offer. The Unalakleet has a huge king and silver salmon run. <a href="alaska_fishing.asp"><b>Click here for Alaska Fishing and see all about the Unalakleet River Lodge</b></a>.</p>

Just the name itself carries a sense of greatness. For years, Alaska has been known for its wondrous size, its magnificent mountains, its trophy size game, and of course its salmon. But very little has been said about its huge northern pike. In fact Alaska's best kept secret is its large northern pike. And not just 10 or 15 pound northern pike, but 25, 30, and the occasional 40 pound monster northern pike! We are talking about 45 to 55 inch northern pike! Located on a tributary that feeds the Yukon river, Midnight Sun Trophy Piker Adventures offers the pike fishing trip of a lifetime for those anglers interested in hooking the largest northern pike of their dreams. <a href="/northernpikefishing.asp"><b>Click here to see more about Northern Pike Fishing</b></a>.</p>
