  <p align="left"><b>Deep Creek Lake (Garrett County): </b>Water is clear and 
    in the upper 60's. Bluegills continued to have a good bite with many catches 
    around 10 inches coming from 3 to 12 feet of water. Worms fished off the docks 
    have been the ticket. Walleye action continued to be hit or miss. Minnows 
    and worms fished in 6 feet of water is one method used to catch them. Minnows 
    and plastic worms have been catching (must be released) smallmouth bass in 
    4 to 6 feet of water. Surface plugs have been good on calm evenings. Streamers 
    and poppers have produced for fly fishermen. Chain pickerel are biting well 
    and have been caught with the bass. Worms fished on the bottom in 6 to 8 feet 
    of water continued to be the hot bait for yellow perch. </p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span>): Liberty is down 16.88 feet as 
    of June 11, 2002. As a general rule, fishing has been best at daybreak and 
    late in the day. Bass anglers have been using medium to large shiners, crayfish, 
    crankbaits, and 10-inch power worms. Shoreline action continued to be productive 
    for bass. Fly fishermen have been catching on foam crickets. Fathead minnows, 
    Mini Mites, and maggots have been catching crappies off points. Some small 
    crappies have been reeled in from Nicodemus Bridge late in the day. Some striped 
    bass have also been caught early and late in the day using extra large shiners. 
    Crayfish patterns have caught carp in shallow water for fly fishermen.</p>

    Seneca Lake (Montgomery County):</b> Water temperature was 75 degrees last 
    week with 6 feet of visibility. Hydrilla was approximately 12 inches. Bass 
    fishing has been good with many averaging 11 to 14 inches. Places to target 
    were wood lay downs, submerged brush, beaver huts, and standing timber. Jigs 
    with a plastic trailer and Texas-rigged hula grubs were productive when fished 
    in 3 to 20 feet of water. Pictured on the left is Chris Peloquin with a 4 
    pound, 14 ounce, 20 7/8 inch largemouth bass. That bass was caught fishing 
    standing timber in 16 feet of water. Nighttime fishing opportunities for this 
    year are June 26, July 17, August 22, and September 18th. </p>
  <p align="left"><b>Loch Raven Reservoir (Baltimore County): </b>): Loch Raven 
    is down 3.68 feet as of June 11, 2002. Loch Raven Fishing Center reports that 
    white perch have been caught trolling a spinner hook with a night crawler 
    in 12 to 15 feet of water. Chain pickerel and smallmouth bass have been active 
    throughout the impoundment. Bass fishing has been fair using plastic worms, 
    pig and jigs, or stickbaits worked on points. Plugs are catching in the morning 
    and evening. Move from shallows into deeper water as the rises. Some yellow 
    perch have been caught on the bottom using worms. Nesting bluegills have been 
    caught in coves. </p>

  <p align="left"><b>Piney Run Park (Carroll County):</b> PRP staff reported steady 
    action on largemouth bass with small plastics including the "wacky" worm. 
    Average catches were between 2 and 4 pounds last week. Staff expects action 
    using crankbaits, buzzbaits, spinnerbaits, and topwaters to start soon. Big 
    yellow perch and bluegills hit well last week. Redworms and night crawlers 
    were the key. Brad Martin of Sykesville, MD caught a 13.128-inch yellow perch 
    last week. </p>
</div>
<p><b>Prettyboy Reservoir (Baltimore County):</b> Prettyboy is down 29.66 feet 
  as of June 11, 2002. Launching a boat is possible although difficult. Crankbaits, 
  jerkbaits, fished in 12 to 15 feet of water over points and ledges as well as 
  around the islands have been productive. The average size bass has been 2 to 
  2.5 pounds.<img src="/fisheries/art2002/Mr%20Tubby3%208Jun02.jpg" width="320" height="126" align="right" alt="Photo of a largemouth bass."></p>
<p><b>WSSC Triadelphia and Rocky Gorge Reservoirs:</b> Water temperature was in 
  the upper 70's last weekend at Triadelphia with 3 feet of visibility. Anglers 
  have been catching and releasing largemouth and smallmouth bass up to 4 pounds 
  in both reservoirs at rocky points, humps, and flats. Carolina rigged lizards, 
  drop shot-rigged plastics have been the most productive but spinnerbaits and 
  lipless crankbaits have also caught a few bass. Pictured on the right is an 
  18 inch largemouth bass caught by Chris Peloquin on June 8th. This bass weighed 
  4 pounds, which is considered fat by us (DNR Fisheries Service). Crappies have 
  been taking jigs, worms, and crankbaits. Live worms or minnows, crankbaits, 
  and jigs have caught some walleyes. </p>
