      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">This pier, located just 
        down the shoreline from the San Diego-Coronado Bridge, has become a popular 
        pier since its dedication in 1980. The facilities are nice; it is close 
        to both the center of town and several hotels, and fishing has been surprisingly 
        good. A plus for some is the nearby Seaport Village where family members 
        not wanting to fish can readily spend their money on other activities 
        and items.</font></P>

width="240" height="160" align="right" border="0"></a>The Embarcadero &quot;Marina&quot; 
        Park Pier (or South Embarcadero Park Pier) is small and extends out only 
        95 feet from shore but it has a T-shaped end and is 300 feet wide. This 
        pier is located over typical bay mud bottom and has considerable areas 
        of eel grass growth which can at times interfere with fishing but which 
        also acts to attract fish. In addition, an artificial reef was constructed 
        nearby which provides an attraction for some species. Main fishing effort 
        is on the bay side of the pier which fronts the deeper water and the reef 
        but good angling can also be had at times close to the shoreline rocks. 
        Typical species include calico bass (kelp bass), sand bass (barred sand 
        bass), bay bass (spotted sand bass) -- and it's one of the better piers 
        for all of these, jacksmelt, walleye surfperch, yellowfin croaker, spotfin 
        croaker, white croaker, queenfish, sargo, lizardfish, needlefish (some 
        years), diamond turbot, halibut, shovelnose guitarfish, bat ray, leopard 
        shark, round stingray and gray smoothhound sharks.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">When the schools move 
        into the bay there can be good fishing at times for bonito, mackerel, 
        jack mackerel, and small barracuda. Although not really common, horn sharks, 
        thresher sharks, and white sea bass have also been landed here.</font>

			width="120" height="90" align="right" border="0"></a>Since this is 
        an excellent pier to catch bass, you might want to first try on the bottom 
        using ghost shrimp, bloodworms or cut anchovies. Both ends of the pier 
        seem good for bass but the right end seems to produce more, at least in 
        my visits. Artificials, especially curly-tail lures like small Scampis 
        and Scroungers, as well as grubs, will also produce some bass. The second 
        most common fish on the bottom are croakers, mostly yellowfin croaker 
        but also a few spotfins and even an occasional China (black) croaker. 
        Most of the croakers prefer live ghost shrimp, fresh mussels and bloodworms, 
        but they will also sometimes be caught on clams or cut anchovies. Halibut 
        are a frequent goal and fish are caught but they would be far more common 
        if anglers used live bait. Unfortunately live anchovies are not sold at 
        the pier. Go to a good tackle shop and buy the following: a bucket, an 
        air pump (aerator), an A battery, and a drop net (umbrella drop net). 
        Put the battery into the air pump, attach it to the bucket, add water 
        and use the net to catch yourself some live bait. The nets, 3 1/2 feet 
        square, are attached to a rope and lowered into the water. Usually a few 
        pieces of bread sprinkled near the net will attract anchovies or small 
        smelt (although some people use a soft mixture of moistened corn meal). 
        Use the live bait on the bottom with a sliding sinker. The next best bait 
        after live anchovies would be live ghost shrimp or bloodworms, then frozen 
        anchovies or squid.</font></P>

			width="120" height="90" align="right" border="0"></a>Perch prefer 
        fresh mussels or bloodworms but will also sometimes hit a plastic grub, 
        and opaleye often prefer frozen peas. Light tackle, by the way, is usually 
        the way to go at this pier unless the current requires a heavy sinker. 
        Water here is often crystal clear and the fish can be very wary of the 
        heavier lines, especially during the middle of sunny days. For most species 
        an incoming tide seems best; for the rays and sharks night is by far the 
        best time. At times, fishing around the inshore rocks proves productive 
        for small bass. If you use ghost shrimp or bloodworms, the inshore area 
        will also yield an occasional rubberlip seaperch, blackperch or opaleye.</font></P>

			width="90" height="120" align="right" border="0"></a>When mackerel 
        are present the two most common riggings will be either a single hook 
        setup or a bait rig. When the mackerel are biting light, use the single 
        hook setup. A single size 4-1 hook is tied to the end of the line and 
        a small split-shot sinker or twist-on sinker is added a few feet up the 
        line. The most common bait is a small strip of squid about three or four 
        inches long by a quarter inch wide or a bloody piece of mackerel -- and 
        I generally prefer to use mackerel. The goal is to keep the bait just 
        a few feet under the surface of the water (since the mackerel like to 
        hang right under the schools of smelt). If the mackerel are on a &quot;mac 
        attack&quot; and you really think you want to catch a bunch, use a bait 
        rig such as a Lucky Lura rig. These riggings contain 4-8 hooks and do 
        not really need any bait -- although you may want to sweeten a couple 
        of hooks with bait. The problem with using these rigs is that you may 
        catch 3, 4, or even more mackerel at a time and their twisting techniques 
        will quickly mean the end of your expensive bait rig. If bonito are present, 
        artificial lures seem to offer your best chance for success. A plastic 
        bubble with a trailing feather (yellow and green seem best) about 3-4 
        feet behind often works best. If barracuda show up, and they often will 
        at night, a chrome jig like a Kastmaster or Krocodile often proves the 
        best action.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">There are also a lot of 
        sharks and rays in this area. For best results fish at night and use a 
        piece of squid or mackerel. Most of the sharks and rays will be small 
        to medium size so you don't really need heavy tackle. However, you will 
        latch on to an occasional big bat ray so come prepared with a large net 
        or treble hook gaff.</font></P>

			width="90" height="120" align="right" border="0"></a><B>Hours: </B>Although 
        the pier is supposedly open 24 hours a day, the park and the parking lot 
        close at 10 p.m.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>Facilities: </B>Restrooms 
        are adjacent to the pier, fish-cleaning stations and lights are on the 
        pier. A combination bait store and snack shop is situated near the entrance 
        of the pier. Metered parking ($1 an hour from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.), a picnic 
        area, and basketball courts are near-by in the park. Fish a little, play 
        a little hoop, fish a little................</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>Handicapped Facilities: 
        </B>Handicapped parking and restrooms are available. The pier surface 
        is planking and gaps are sometimes fairly wide which may cause problems 
        for some wheelchairs. The height of the railing is 42 inches. Posted for 
        handicapped.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><B>How To Get There: </B>Take 
        I-5 to the Market St. exit, take Market west to Harbor Dr. Turn left on 
        Harbor Dr. and take it to 8th Ave., turn right onto Convention Way (formerly 
        Harbor St.). Follow it a short block to 5th Ave. and the pier. It seems 
        that with the new Convention Center the city is constantly working on 
        these streets near the pier and renaming them; if you get confused remember 
        that the park and pier are immediately to the southwest of the Convention 
        Center.</font></P>
