ACCOUSTIC GUITAR: only a theoretical deduction from analogy. The doctrine of love for humanity alone is based on the social conception of life. The essence of the social conception of life consists in the transference of the aim of the individual life to the life of societies of individuals: family, clan, tribe, or accoustic guitar This transference is accomplished easily and naturally in its earliest forms, in the transference of the aim of life from the individual to the family and the clan. The transference to the tribe or the nation is more difficult accoustic guitar requires special training. And the transference of the sentiment<br><br>
ACCOUSTIC GUITAR: to the state is the furthest limit which the process can reach. To love one's self is natural to everyone, and no one needs any encouragement accoustic guitar do so. To love one's clan who support and protect one, to love one's wife, the joy and help of one's existence, one's children, the hope and consolation of one's life, and one's parents, who have given one life and education, is natural. And such love, though far from being so strong as love of self, is met with pretty often. To love--for one's own sake, accoustic guitar personal pride--one's tribe, one's nation, though not<br><br>
ACCOUSTIC GUITAR: so natural, is nevertheless common. Love of one's own people who are of the same blood, the same tongue, and the same religion as one's self is possible, though far from being so strong as love of self, or even love of family or clan. But love for a state, accoustic guitar as Turkey, Germany, England, Austria, or Russia is a thing almost impossible. And though it is zealously inculcated, accoustic guitar is only an imagined sentiment; it has no existence in reality. And at that limit man's power of transferring his interest ceases, and he cannot feel any direct sentiment for that<br><br>
ACCOUSTIC GUITAR: fictitious entity. The Positivists, however, and all the apostles of fraternity on scientific principles, without taking into consideration the weakening of sentiment in proportion to the extension of its object, draw further deductions in theory in the same direction. "Since," they say, "it was for the advantage of the individual to extend his personal interest to the family, the tribe, and subsequently accoustic guitar the nation and the state, it would be still more advantageous to extend his interest in societies of men to the whole of mankind, and so all to accoustic guitar for humanity just as men live for the family<br><br>
ACCOUSTIC GUITAR: or the state." Theoretically it follows, indeed, having extended the love and interest for the personality to the family, the tribe, and thence accoustic guitar the nation and the state, it would be perfectly logical for men to save themselves the strife and calamities which result from the division of mankind into nations and states by extending their love to the whole of humanity. This would be most logical, and theoretically nothing would appear more natural to its advocates, who do not observe that love is a sentiment which may or may not he felt, but which it is useless accoustic guitar advocate;<br><br>
