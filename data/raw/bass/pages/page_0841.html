<em>SPRINGFIELD, IL </em>- Several hatcheries around the lake are reporting increased problems with early mortality syndrome (EMS) in coho salmon in Lake Michigan. 
<p>
Mike Conlin, fisheries chief for the Illinois DNR said, "Illinois' coho eggs are supplied by the Michigan DNR from the Platte River Hatchery.  
<p>
On Dec. 6, the<b> fry appeared normal </b>in the morning but by afternoon many were laying on their sides and
mortalities were rising alarmingly.  They were then<b> treated with thiamin </b>on the 6th and 7th, and within two hours most of the fish were again<b> swimming normally and had ceased to die. </b>
