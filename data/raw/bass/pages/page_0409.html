<p><font color="#663300"><font size=+1>Targeted mainly in lakes, the Largemouth
Bass is the most popular of all the sunfishes.&nbsp; There's so much information
out on the web, TV, various books, and even dozens of magazines devoted
specifically to the Largemouth that I'll just go into how we fish for them.&nbsp;
However you manage to get one on the end of your line it will battle ferociously
to the end and test your angling skills, leaving you wanting more action.&nbsp;
Largemouths spawn in early summer, when water temps reach 65 degrees. Males
guard the large, dish-shaped nest viciously, attacking anything and everything
that comes near.&nbsp; Bass should not be targeted on thier beds, however,
because in the short time the male is off the bed all smaller fish in the
vicinity will raid the nest of its' precious eggs.&nbsp; Fishing for the
females off the first break can be successful at this time, but most are
recuperating from the spawning process and not yet feeding consistently.&nbsp;
The Largemouth is really a fish of summer, as they thrive in the bright
sun and heavy, choking weeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Forage would include frogs, mice,
crayfish, other sunfishes, shiners, crayfish and ducklings, just to name
a few.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will lay under logs and stumps in the shallows,
and ambush anything that wanders near.&nbsp; Fishing for the Largemouth
is mainly a game of fishing these areas of shoreline cover after a careful
and quiet approach.&nbsp; Also make a cast to any rock, weed clump or depression
right on shore.&nbsp; Bass will be up in these types of cover at dawn and
dusk, ready to pounce on anything that annoys them.&nbsp; Mid- day may
find them off cabbage edges or deep pockets in the lily pads, still under
10 feet deep. For shallower work deer-hair bugs or bendback divers, along
with weedless streamers all work well when fished on an 8 wt. flyrod.&nbsp;
Chuck your flies basically onto land, then give them a twitch or two.&nbsp;
Let it sit for 10 to 60 seconds, then begin a steady retrieve.&nbsp; Bass
will absolutely try to destroy a surface bug, but try to wait a second
before jamming the hook home.&nbsp; This will definitely hook more fish
for you.&nbsp; Another great presentation for covering expanses of thick
cover is a buzzbait.&nbsp; Buzzers will go through anything without getting
hung up, and the ruckus they kick up drives bass crazy.&nbsp; Pike love
'em too.&nbsp; Another method you can employ, my personal favorite, works
best on waters that don't recieve a lot of pressure.&nbsp; Simply poke
the nose of your craft around a point and scan the shallows for cruising
or holding bass.&nbsp; They aren't all that spooky, and sight-casting to
trophy largemouths with some kind of soft plastic or fly presentation is
about as exciting as bass fishing gets.&nbsp; We all need to remember that
a lake's population of Largemouth bass is a truly fragile resource.&nbsp;
I personally know what strict catch and release can do for a lake, and
have also fished on waters with a lot of&nbsp; catch and kill.&nbsp; There
is no comparison in the quality of fishing.&nbsp; Keep a big bass and you're
contributing to the weakened genetics that lead to stunting.</font></font>
