shot was taken at Scully's Pub in the early '90s. </p>
<p><b>J.D. Blues </b>was playing a gig.</p>
<p>Someone captured a picture of me playing bass. It hasn't been common
knowledge that I played. The gear's too heavy, so I didn't spread it around.</p>
<p>The bass belongs to Steve Trohoske of <b>3Bop</b>. Thanks, Steve.</p>
<p>I wish I still had this hat.</p>
