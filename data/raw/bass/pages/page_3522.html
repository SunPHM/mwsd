Those located at the edges of diverging   plates are called <b>passive margins</b>, because in these areas not much happens   in terms of volcanoes or earthquakes. They are sinking areas where thick sequences   of sediments accumulate. In contrast, margins at the edges of converging plates   are called active margins, because they experience frequent volcanic or earthquake   activity. The are generally rising so are not sites of extensive sediment accumulation.   Passive margins occur around Australia, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean,   in Europe, Africa, and North and South America. <b>Active margins</b> occur   around much of the Pacific Rim, in North and South America, the Alaska and Kamchatka   Peninsulas, the Aleutian Islands, and Japan. </p><p>The continents are surrounded by a gently sloping (less than 1o) submerged   plain called the continental shelf.. The widths of <b>continental shelves</b>   vary considerably, in some areas they are very wide (over 1000km along some   passive margins) while in other areas a shelf barely exists at all (along some   active margins). The edge of the shelf, called the <b>shelf break</b>, is marked   by an abrupt increase in slope (average of 4o) occurring at an average depth   of 135 m.</p><p>The topography of continental shelves is generally the same as the coastal   areas they border. In fact, almost all shelves were above water during the maximum   extent of the Pleistocene ice ages (approximately 18,000 years ago). Coastal   canyons and ridges that extend to the shoreline are often continued underwater   to the edge of the shelf where they form <b>submarine canyons</b> funnelling   sediment from the shelf to the Abyssal Plain.</p><p><img src="images/BASS_CANYON.jpg" width="300" height="203" align="right"><font color="#993300"><b><font color="#000000">&gt;</font></b>   This is a processed image of the sea floor from eastern Bass Strait (70 X 120   km)</font>. It shows the continental slope, submarine canyons and abyssal sea   floor of eastern Bass Strait. Depths range from 500m (red) to 4,500m (purple)   - a section is blown up to the left! The main canyon is called Bass Canyon. </p><h2><a name="B"></a>Our very own shelf</h2><p>The NSW and southern Queensland shelf extends from Bass Strait in the south   to Capricorn Channel in the north. The shelf is relatively narrow in comparison   with other parts of Australia, having an average width of about 25 km. It is   narrowest adjacent to Montague Island (10 km) and widest between Morton and   Fraser islands (75 km). </p><p>The shelf break occurs at a depth of between 145 and 165 m along the southern   to middle parts of the NSW shelf. Northwards however, the shelf break occurs   at progressively shallower depths, reaching a minimum of about 70 m adjacent   to Fraser Island. In general the shelf gradient is steepest between the shoreline   and the 60-100 m isobath. In contrast, between 100-150 m the shelf is almost   flat and has been termed the &quot;middle shelf plain&quot; by some researchers.   The depth and morphology of the shelf break is thought to be controlled partly   by the underlying bedrock geometry and by the prograding sediment wedge and   its differential compaction (Jones et al., 1975, Davies, 1979).</p><p>Terraces (breaks in slope) occur along all sections of the shelf but are particularly   evident between Sugarloaf Point and Jarvis Bay. In this area 3 main terraces   have formed, at 40-60 m, 80-100 m and 120-140 m. The terraces formed during   periods of lower sea level when the shelf was subject to erosion. </p><p><img src="images/profile13.gif" width="547" height="293" align="left"><br>  <font color="#993300">Yellow &#150; Cainozoic, Green &#150; Cretaceous, Purple   &#150; Triassic, Brown &#150; Late Devonian, Pink &#150; Oceanic crust.

Active continental   margins, like the west cost of American, can be pretty dangerous places. Volcanoes   and earthquakes are caused by the subduction of the oceanic plate under the   continental plate (see section on plate tectonics). A trench is formed at the   subduction site and sediments eroding from the continent accumulate on the shelf   or are transported into the trench (continental rises are generally absent on   active margins because the presence of the trench doesn't allow for sediment   to accumulate). In addition, sediments lying on the oceanic plate can be scraped   off by the continental plate and form what is known as an accretionary wedge.   These sediments can be many kilometers thick. The accretionary wedge is composed   of deformed sediment and may also contain bits of the oceanic crust (see section   on ophiolites). This jumble of rocks is termed a tectonic melange. </p>  <br clear="all"><h2><a name="C"></a>Deformation &#150; Californian active continental margin</h2><p><img src="images/fence.gif" width="200" height="339" align="left"><img src="images/actmargin.gif" width="366" height="241" align="right">   <br clear=right>  <font color="#993300">A poorly constructed fence.</font> From <a href="http://www.muohio.edu/tectonics/at_report/%20active_tectonics.html">http://www.muohio.edu/tectonics/at_report/   active_tectonics.html</a></p><p><font color="#993300">Above Right.

The East Pacific Rise (that runs   down the west coast of America) has one of the fastest spreading rates &#150;   as high as 15 cm per year in some segments. In contrast the poor old Mid-Atlantic   Ridge is only spreading at about 1 to 2 cm per year. It takes about 50 my for   new ocean lithosphere to cool (from &gt; 1000&deg;C) to an equilibrium state   and sink to its maximum depth below sea-level. </p><p><img src="images/age_depth.gif" width="382" height="273" align="left"><font color="#993300">Depth   to the top of the ocean crust versus age &#150; averaged for the Pacific, Indian   and Atlantic Oceans.</font> The increase in depth with age is due to cooling   and consequent contraction of the crust as it moves away from the mid ocean   ridge. </p><p>Slow spreading ridges (&lt; 4 cm/yr) are the most common type of ridge. They   develop a deep rift valley along the main ridge axis &#150; up to 2000 m deep   and 8-20 km wide. Erupted pillow lavas form ridges or circular seamounts in   what is termed the neovolcanic zone (ie. spot where active volcanism is occurring   or has recently occurred). The floor of the valley is a mass of faults and fissures   and large earthquakes are common. Eruptions are thought to be very infrequent,   happening at 1000 to 10,000 year intervals.</p><br clear="all">   <p> <img src="images/slowridge.gif" width="430" height="133" align="right"><font color="#993300">Bathymetric   profile across an idealised slow spreading ocean ridge, showing the rift valley.</font><br>  Fast spreading ridges (8 -15 cm/yr) have no axial valley but instead develop   a narrow trough, generally 5-40 m deep and up to 250 m wide. Volcanism appears   to be concentrated in a line below the ridge, forming an elongate shield volcano   1 to 2 km wide, up to 100 krn long. Fast spreading ridges. have a more constant   magma supply than slow spreading ridges, which translates into more frequent   eruptions (on a scale of 1 &#150; 10 years). Lavas are dominated by fluid sheet   flows, in contrast to the pillow lavas of the slow spreading ridges (high temperature   lavas are less viscous than lower temperature ones, so erupt as sheet flows   rather than as pillows).</p>  <br clear="all"><p><img src="images/fastridge.gif" width="430" height="133" align="right"><font color="#993300">Bathymetric   profile across an idealised fast spreading ocean ridge.</font><br>  Intermediate spreading ridges (4 - 8 cm/yr) have characteristics in common with   both fast and slow spreading ridges. They are morphologically variable but generally   have a small axial valley 1-5 km wide and 50 &#150;200 m deep. The neovolcanic   zone is located in the floor of the valley. Eruptions occur on a scale of 10   &#150; 100 year intervals. Both sheet and pillow lavas are common. Examples   of intermediate spreading ridges are the Galapagos Ridge and the Southeast Indian   Ridge. </p><h2><a name="E"></a>Fracture zones</h2><p><img src="images/sanandreas.jpg" width="266" height="317" align="left">As we   noted in the section on plate tectonics, transform faults or transform boundaries   as they are sometimes called, occur when two plates slide horizontally past   each other. Transform faults commonly connect two spreading centers (divergent   plate boundaries) or, sometimes trenches (convergent plate boundaries, eg the   Alpine fault zone on the South Island of New Zealand). When they offset active   spreading centers they produce a characteristic zig-zag plate boundary pattern.   Because transform faults are associated with spreading centers most are found   on the ocean floor, however a few occur on land, for example the San Andreas   fault zone in California. </p><p><font color="#993300">The San Andreas fault photographed from the air above   California's Carrizo Plain, east of San Luis Obispo</font>. A linear valley   has been eroded along the main trace of the fault. The black line at left is   a fence line. Photo courtesy of the USGS.</p>  <br clear="all"><p>Transform faults occur only between the offset ends of the ridge segments.   Anything beyond this is called a fracture zone. Unlike transform faults, where   lithosphere on either side of the fault is moving in opposite directions, the   lithosphere on either side of the fracture zone is moving in the same direction.   Because of this transform faults are associated with shallow earthquakes (as   the plates slip past each other friction builds up and is released as earthquakes),   whereas fracture zones are seismically inactive. Transform faults and fracture   zones are visible on the sea floor as cliffs &#150; the height difference is   due to the differences in age of the lithosphere on opposite sides of the fault   or fracture.</p><p><br clear="all">  <img src="images/fractzone.gif" width="342" height="261" align="right">Transform   fault offsetting the spreading ridge axis. As the faults move away from the   area of active spreading they become aseismic fracture zones.</p><h2> <a name="H"></a>Abyssal Plains, seamounts and guyots.</h2><p><b>Abyssal plains</b> are those deep parts of the ocean - 4000 to 6000 meters   deep - that begin at the edge of the continental margin and continue to the   ocean ridges. They represent nearly 30% of the earth&#146;s surface (30% of   the Atlantic and nearly 75% of the Pacific ocean floors) and are generally extremely   flat. The original rough basalt topography is covered by a layer of fine sediment   that can be up to 5 km thick (but is usually less than 1 km). There is much   more exposure of the original topography in the Pacific, because the trenches   stop sediment from blanketing the sea floor. Occasional oval-shaped abyssal   hills and seamounts protrude from the plain. Abyssal hills are less than 1 km   high and form as part of the spreading process. They are often located parallel   to mid-ocean ridges and may be found alone or in groups. Seamounts are extinct   volcanoes formed by stationary hot spots in the mantle (see section on seafloor   volcanism). If the volcano extends above the sea level, it is called an &quot;island&quot;,   if not it is a &quot;seamount&quot;. A guyot is a former island that has had   it&#146;s top eroded off by waves. Seamounts are most common in the Pacific   Ocean. </p><p><b>Abyssal hills</b> are less than 1 km high and form as part of the spreading   process. They are circular or elliptical and range from 1 to 8 km in width at   the base. They are often located parallel to mid-ocean ridges and may be found   alone or in groups. In the Pacific they cover more than 80% of the ocean floor.</p><p><b>Seamounts</b> on the other hand, are extinct volcanoes formed by stationary   hot spots in the mantle (see section on seafloor volcanism) or less commonly   by volcanism at mid-ocean ridges. Active volcanoes in the oceans are generally   less than 30 million years old (because they move off the hot spot or away from   the ridge volcanism). If the volcano is active for a reasonable length of time,   eg 10 million years, it may develop into an island. If it doesn&#146;t make   the grade it is called a seamount. Volcanoes that do extend above sea level,   will eventually become dormant, cool, and sink below the waves. As they sink,   the top is eroded flat by the waves and they become guyots. They are less common   than seamounts, but can be found in linear trends in the Pacific Ocean. They   illustrate how the sea floor subsides as it moves away from the mid-ocean ridges.   <br clear="all">  <br>  <img src="images/traney.jpg" width="300" height="234" align="left"> The five   volcanoes of the Traney seamount chain located off the coast of San Francisco.<b>   &lt;</b> <font color="#993300">GLORIA image is from the USGS. </font></p><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">  <tr>    <td bgcolor="#99FF00">An underwater landslide on a seamount in the Pacific       Ocean is now thought to be the cause of the tsunami that killed 2100 people       in coastal villages of Papua New Guinea in 1998.

In a typical island-arc environment,   volcanoes lie along the crest of a ridge that is bounded on its convex side   by a deep oceanic trench They are analogous to the volcanic arcs that form on   land when an oceanic plate descends below a continental plate. However, the   formation of island arcs requires the collision of two oceanic plates.

It has been argued that the dip of the subducting slab determines whether   spreading occurs in the back arc region. A steeper dip seems to be more conducive   to the development of back arc spreading. Back arc basins are most common in   the Western Pacific (eg Woodlark, Fiji and Lau Basins) where old oceanic crust   is steeply subducted (cf the Eastern pacific where much younger less dense oceanic   crust subducts at a shallow angle). </p><hr><h1 align="center"><a name="J"></a>Exercises</h1><h2 align="center">Ocean Floor Terminology</h2><p align="center">This exercise is simply designed to test you understanding of   the terminology required to describe and explain Basin topography. </P>  <h4 align="center"><A HREF="javascript:newWindow2('ex/term/bas_term.html',600,600)" >Lets   go!</A> <br></h4><hr><h2 align="center">Interpreting Seafloor data.</h2><p align="center">Interpreting seafloor features is a three dimensional task.   Often, it is deep processes which ultimately control the features that we see   at the surface.
