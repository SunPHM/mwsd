<h2>It&#146;s White Sea Bass, man!</h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It&#146;s like Davey Jones threw on some switch and said get 
  it on. Starting two weeks ago, the White Sea Bass bite went off at Catalina, 
  San Clemente and Santa Barbara islands, as predicted by all local captains. 
  For over a month the sport boats were watching the Bass and Yellow Tail bunching 
  up like roses; but not biting a thing. There was just too much candy bait, squid, 
  in the water. Anything wit a hook on it? Well, what for? Then the squid dried 
  up and the bite went off! Aarg&#133;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The calm seas and good weather at the islands have kept the 
  bite going. Oh there have been up and down days; but that&#146;s fishing. On 
  Thursday a boat load of boys went over for a look see and found no fish or live 
  squid. The captain tried every spot to no avail. If it weren&#146;t for them 
  slimey Barracuda the trip would&#146;a been a total bust.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inshore, the local boys continued to hunt for the remnants 
  of what few Halibut are left after two back to back derbys. Most captains gave 
  up the hunt and went out on them banks for those sweet meated Rock Cod. However, 
  the Barracuda have arrived and more are expected. As the water warms, even the 
  Calico Bass are starting to bite. Keep your eye on Rocky Point for a few White 
  Sea Bass and some Yellow Tail, which are now making a good show at the islands; 
  so they got&#146;ta be here sooner or later.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the mountains to the sea: the Trout are still snapping 
  in the local mountains, the bucket mouth Bass have moved off the flats and the 
  Catfish are moving up out of the deep. Keep an eye on the Striped Bass bite 
  on Lake Mohave and the Colorado River. Watch the Salton Sea for the Corvina 
  bite. Lite winds and mild weather at the sea should get the Corvina on the prowl 
  and air temps are up&#133;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the King Harbor: the Bonito have yet to move in, however, 
  if you like to catch and release, on lite line, tons of California Mackerel 
  have invaded every finger of the harbor. The wee fishermen can have lots of 
  fun with mom and dad. Rentals for this family event are available at Rocky Point 
  Fuel Dock, Portofino Marina.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local Board Meeting: Last year, I wrote about a surfer fishing 
  off of his board for Halibut in ten feet water. Well, Mr. Hang Five Halibut 
  is back. He was off the Chart House just outside the surf line trolling or paddling 
  for them big flatties. Not a bad idea. The Grunion have been running and the 
  inshore Halibut are in tight and looking for a meal. Think about it. Catch a 
  wave, catch yer dinner and call it a morning. I like it. Mr. Five send me a 
  picture. Aarg&#133;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Medical Update: Peg O&#146;me Heart sends her thanks for all 
  who sent those special get well thoughts to her. She is doing fine and her arterial 
  tubes are clear. A welcome back BBQ was held on F Dock, Portofino Marina, for 
  Peg by none other than Yoda and the Philidelphia boys, Mr. Catch and Release 
  and What de&#146;hey, Dan, Peg sez, &quot;Catch me some Halibut and I&#146;ll 
  cook for ya.&quot; Aarg Sez the Captain&#133;<I>ER</i></P>
