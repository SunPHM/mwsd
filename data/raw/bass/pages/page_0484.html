This event was heralded by many as the best event in 6-8 months.  There were over 33 posts about this party on the local mesage board and not one was negative.  
</p>
<P>
DJ Trancelott played amazing and wrote us this note: "... That party was the best I have ever played, largely in part because of how good the sound was. It was perfect, no reverb off the back wall and clear as a bell, you made me sound awesome. ..."
</p>
<p>
DJ Emotion writes: "... quite impressed with the sound. Better than most in Calgary. Good visuals. ..."
</p>
<p>
There was a 'pumpin system, 1000 lumen projection screen, live video visuals, 4 Technobeams and a some conventional lighting.  
</p>
<p>
Atomic Dog's Parties kick ass, we have never been treated so nicely before.  Vik from Atomic Dog is one of the most classy and together people we have ever met.  If we were 1/10th as cool as Vik, we'd be up for sainthood.  All the staff at Rollerland deserve some credit too.  You guys are great!!!

This isn't a Rave at all, but we thought we'd mention it because it is for such a worthy cause.  This AIDS Calgary annual fundraiser has over 500 voluntiers and over $200 000 gift in kind donations.  Feroshus asked us to help out so we donated a <I>seriously</I> pumpin club system so that everyone could stay and dance after the fashion show.  Levi and some of the F.B.I. crew spun some thumpin house/trance.  This was a lot of fun and next year we are really going to transform the whole palce into an instant nightclub.

This special benefit event for the Calgary Foodbank was organized by volunteers from Ravehard, Firepark and Underground Productions.  Approximately $500 was donated to the Foodbank.  In fact, this was a 'promoter free' event.  
<p>
What was really amazing about this event was the totally kick ass sound, light and video visuals and tickets were ONLY $10.00 in advance.  It is very likely you will never see an event of this magnitude with only $10 tickets again, unless these folks plan to do another benefit, which would be very cool (hint hint hint).  Attendance was roughly 800+ people.  
<p>
The visuals on the big screen were quite trippy along with one live cam feed on the DJ, one live feed on the crowd and DJ's names superimposed on top.

This was an excellent party with an excellent vibe.  1500 people.  The lineup was superb.  30 000 watts of sound power.  It was an awesome party.  

<!--The promoters have not paid off the bill yet so <B>please</B> bug the hell out of them until they take care of that.  It's only common courtesy to pay people for the work that they do.  Normally we wouldn't mention it here, but since they refuse to return our phone calls after we busted our asses for them and gave them free promotion on our website... Feel free to bug these guys until they pay up (we will also eccept 10 tonnes of gummies, 75 pizzas at our next rave [we'll share with all the ravers -- don't forget the plates], or 1000 glowsticks, etc ... we're easy and we're cheap!).

We honestly had mixed feelings about this party.  There was over 1300 people there in a building that only had exists for 250 (90 people per door).  On the good side, the upstairs house room was totally amazing -- the heat coming off of everyone was totally intense.  Who were those DJ's upstairs, they totally rawked!!! 
<p>
On the not so good side this wasn't the right place to hold an event of this magnitude.  A nicer venue would have made all the difference.  
<p>
Paintballs never dry because they have vegetable oil in them.  We don't recommend doing events there unless you can get the place scrubbed down.  We really felt quite sorry for the girl in the white dress that got covered in paint (the poor thing was in tears).  We even brought in extra bass without asking for more dough.  We were promissed lots of volunteers to help with clean up and none showed (and man, it was messy) -- we didn't get out of there until 11:30 AM.  Our bass cabinets are looking a little more colorful than they used too.  Black used to go with everything, now we just clash :(

Much props to Justin and Brian -- these guys really know how to throw a party!!!  We debuted our new signal processing system at this event.  You could hear every subtle nuance of the phat beats at the back of the room.  Even we were impressed and it's our equipment!  The mid's and high's were so clear it was amazing.  You always know when we are in the house, the sound is going to kick!  The last event of this magnitude was Chunky Soup II.  Our only complaint:  Where the heck were all the volunteers at the end of the event???  You know who you are ...

Truely one of the best locations we have ever done a Rave at.  We had 2 large systems pumping out seriously phat beats.  One room had a subdued retro feel with low phat bass and the main room was full on, four on the floor beats with more intense sound and light.  Maybe we can even get three large warehouse bays next time!!!  Mucho Kudos to Focus Productions: Janet, Laura and Piper.  A swell job!!!

This was the first outdoor event of it's kind in Alberta.  There was dust, rain, sun and cloud and we had to bring in 2 generators to power the light and sound.  <B>This entire weekend was a non-stop party!!!</B>  We got sound complaints from 14 Km's away (turns out sound travels very easily in the badlands).  You should have seen the looks on the RCMP's faces when they showed up!  That was more excitement than they had seen in while!  

</p><p>
Some of our raver friends wondered why had to shut everything down at 6:45 AM.  The reason was we were contracted (in writing) for quiet time between 6AM and 2PM Saturday morning so the sound techs could get some ZZZ's after working 24 hours straight.  Unfortunately, the DJ's ran past the contracted time, the techs gave the unfortunate DJ an extra half an hour, but then they had to pack it in.  Regrettably, there are certain labor laws we must abide by as to length of shift.  By the time the guys got back to the motel, slept, ate and got back to the gig for 2PM, they had only managed to get about 5 hours sleep before having to go till 8:30 AM the next morning (Sunday).  So, the crew worked 24 hours, slept 5 hours and worked another 16.5 hours straight, slept 3 hours, ate, then started striking down to be back in Calgary for 4PM. </p><p> 
If anyone at the event was curious as to why the sound would cut out from one side of the sound system, it was due to one of the turntable cartridges and a turntable RCA plug being worn out.  The tables and mixer were donated from one of the DJ's.  We shut things down for a few minutes to re-wire and hopefully alleviate the problems.  It helped a little and we switched the system to mono which stopped the one side from cutting in and out.  Being two hours from Calgary, we didn't have access to our repair shop so our ability to do on the spot repairs was limited, which totally sucked.  It's always a good idea to carry a spare cartridge even if someone else is supplying the tables.  It's a lifesaver!  
</p><p> 
We apologize to everyone and the DJ's who thought we were playing 24 Hours a day, <i>but we were not contracted to do so</i> and if we had, we would have gladly supplied extra staff and made the necessary arrangements.  We love a good party as much as anyone!  We did play out till 9:00 AM Sunday though!
</p><p>
Peace, and once again, our sincerest apologies to anyone who thought our staff just left the party without good reason.  We'll always be there to the bitter end unless someone with a big stick tells us otherwise!!!
