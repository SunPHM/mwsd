</BIG></B> I recall walking down the hallway at the Frankfurt Music Messe (something like a NAMM show for Europe), and first hearing and then seeing one of the finest bassists I have ever come across. Standing in front of a display was a tall man working magic with his 6-string bass, aside him a lady also working some pretty nice vocals around what he played. What struck us at the time was that it was patently clear not only that they knew what they were doing, but also that they needed no help at it at all.
</p>

<p>Upon introducing themselves as the duo of Reimer-Setzer they offered us a copy of their debut CD. Proving itself to be an interesting and very well produced first release, we held an interview in a previous magazine. With their newest release <i>The Inner Light</i> now out there, it was time to do a bit of a catch-up on what they were up to. The new album is a more adventurous bit of music, stretching into new areas comfortably. As a bass-related magazine, we will be focusing upon Markus, the bassist in this duo, but reinforcing the interview with comments from his wife and duet partner.

<P><B>Bass Inside: </B>When I interviewed you about two or three years ago, you had just released your first 'Solo-duo' album, <i>Between The Worlds</i>. I would like to ask you a bit about what has happened to the two of you this past two or so years to bring about those changes…
</P>

<p><B>Markus: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">Those changes are the result of constant development. We’ve grown up along with our music. It’s been a step-by-step process. We tend to go our own way and do not even try to follow the mainstream. Now this has also included a lot of gigs, and an equal number of rehearsals, and so on. That means we get a broad spectrum of experiences in singing, bass playing, working on playing tight together and so on. And of course the personal discussions about our music which are very important to develop deeper and deeper understanding of our songs and to discover new aspects and ways of clearly expressing ourselves. Because of this growth we are not hesitant to show that part of ourselves. 
</FONT></P>

<P><B>Bass Inside: </B>Firstly, previously you mentioned that you were shutting down any other projects between yourselves and other musicians, that you were going to concentrate upon what you referred to as the ‘mystery of the magic’ of your music.  Has this turned out the way you had planned, as you had had hoped?
</P>


<P><B>Markus: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">Yes, we have learned that it is well worth it to give 100% of our energy in this venture. Through the years our duo has become like our second child. So we fill it with love. And that gives us a lot of satisfaction. 
</FONT></P>

<p>In the time since we last spoke, did you have the opportunity to play your own music often? I know you do clinics for some manufacturers, but were there also venues that wanted you as yourselves? That I suspect would prove the most rewarding.
</p>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Yes, we have done a lot of gigs where people come just to listen to our music and not through microphones or amplification. And that is our favourite kind of audience. And it is of course completely different to play a whole show. It is much more interesting to create a whole evening with our music than to play 10 minutes at Frankfurt surrounded by 100 decibels created by other musicians all at the same time.
</FONT></P>

<P>Markus, at that earlier time you told me that you have had “problems with guitar and piano players, because of my style of playing”. Would this still be true, or has it changed somewhat?
</p>

<P><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="setzerbass.jpg" HEIGHT="283" WIDTH="186" alt="Markus Setzer"><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="283"><FONT COLOR="blue">Now I think it´s not really a problem at all with guitar or piano players. It was a personal problem, based on my approach to the bass guitar. I am not a traditional bass player in the sense of the history of bass playing. I like to play chords and harmony on the bass. And some traditionally thinking players have problems with my style. You know, that tells something about various functions in music. </P>

<P>Open-minded musicians won’t mind. And I have my own ideas and concepts on what makes groove and harmony. I think everyone should have his own ideas on groove. I tell it to my students, too. You don’t have to catch the kick of the drummer. You have to form a symbiosis. When you build a good groove with a drummer together, then it just smokes! </P>

<P>One good example for that is with RUSH accomplished! These guys are truly great at this. Geddy and Neal are the best example for a real rhythm section working in their own unique style. Groove is always the most important thing to go after. Even if your are slapping or tapping, soloing or whatever... Play it in time and people will listen to it. I am very glad to know that the people I spoke of before are of the minority. It has to be said that in the last two years I have met a lot of great guitar and piano players and we had a lot of fun. But it could also be a personal problem for people who cannot deal with attention given to others. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Your partner in life and music, Sabine, also looked for a long time for that ‘right’ person to share her music with. Sabine, have you seen musical growth with Markus as a player and a co-writer as well and if so, in which ways?
</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I have learned a lot with Markus as a duet partner. First of all I have to mention my feeling for rhythm. In a duo it is very important to find a common groove and to give a lot of attention to that rhythm in the music. So in this case I can tell you that bass players are the best teachers. And even if the compositions and their rhythm seem to be complicated and strange it is worth it to learn them because in the end it is just a question of getting a relation to them. That is what I have learned as well, not to give up too early and to find the facility in the music.
</font></p>



<P>While I think of it…your child Jule, any chance of following in the parents' musical footsteps or are you just a couple of weird eccentric musicians like most parents appear to their kids? If there is an interest, is it instilled, encouraged by both of you or is it Jule’s idea?
</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Jule has her own ideas and ways of doing things. But she is a part of our lives and therefore she is also a part of our music and our inspiration. She hears our music every day. Sometimes when I do my practicing on the bass guitar she takes her little guitar to play with me or she is dancing to the music. But it is always her own choice. She has her own mind and her own opinion and will surely let you know if she is enjoying something or not!! 
</br clear="right"></FONT></P>

<P>I was also told that you have to go through a lot of songs when listening to prospective ‘copy’ songs, before you find those that fit.  Can you tell us a little bit about that selection process? Is there a major song of musical piece you would like to tangle with at some point?
</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">There are two covers on the new album <i>The Inner Light</i>, but we are sure that these will be the last ones we will be doing. We started the duo with cover songs, but after the years we have discovered that we have more fun with our own compositions. With our own music we can better express ourselves and develop a distinct and unique style.
</FONT></P>

<P>Markus, as this is predominantly a bass-based magazine, I guess it is my ‘duty’ to ask if it is still Yamaha basses that most faithfully reproduce what you hear in your muse, or have there been any instrumental additions or even changes of pace? And is your choice of acoustic (Josef) still the one from Magnus Krempel?  Would you have any interest in electric acoustics at this point, if even just for portability?
</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Oh, Joseph is my upright bass. He is more than 130 years old and made by a Czech guy. Sure, for some Bassists it´s a good argument to play electric upright 'cause of portability. But I think when I compare Josef with an electric upright I have to compare entirely different instruments. The tone-building for example is completely different. But the biggest difference is that you can feel the tone of Joseph with your whole body. The energy you put into an upright comes directly back. And Joseph shows no mercy. When you have a bad day, Joseph is like a mirror. But my bass guitars are built by Magnus Krempel. 
</P>


<P>I have known Magnus for about 15 years and our contact was never broken. He is a magician in building basses and acoustic basses of course. Magnus built me my very first six-string in the 80’s, and it was he who told me to take the chance as Yamaha offered me the endorsement. Yes, I have played Yamaha for three years. It was a good experience to work with such a big company. But my ideas how a bass has to sound and has to be played had changed. I needed a very individual instrument to make my ideas come into reality. 
</p>


<p>So I checked out some German builders. One day Magnus gave me a call and asked me about how I imagined that my new dream bass would have to sound like. I told him, and two months later (it was the 8th June 2002), the bell rings and the UPS man is standing at the door with a big parcel. It was a Sharkey seven-string bass. And this bass blows me away. It sounded exactly the way I dreamed of. Magnus also built me a 5 string J-Bass with a high C string. You can hear this Bass on our latest release, too. 
</FONT></P>

<P>Sabine, one of the things that you spoke of last time was the room for freedom in a duet with just your voice and the bass. Does this still find a special place in your heart as well?
</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Oh yes and this feeling becomes more intensive because I find out that it is an important part of our music. Each of us is absolutely free in what he or she is playing or singing. Markus is responsible for the bass line and my part is the voice, and this passes also for our compositions. I think that this makes our music so intensive. Each of us gives his own inspiration into a song, and that means also freedom to me. To sing my own music in my own way, now that makes me really happy.    
</FONT></P>

<P>Many bassists, when they go solo or attempt the route of being part of a duo, and for the very adventurous, simply bass and voice, fall prey to overplaying or sounding like a guitar. There is a thin line between a bassist just playing guitar-bass or finding a way to say it differently. I think you have found that way and I know you aspire to pursuit that too. How do you differentiate and stay clear of the usual trap of overplaying?
</p>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I do not think it´s a conscious decision. I never think about overplaying. I think about music. And my problem is that I only play bass guitar. And because of that it is not so easy to transport the whole music that is inside me. Sometimes I have to play difficult and complex stuff to let the music sound the way I want it in our duo. But it also has to sound simple. When I build my voice to the song I look at the parameter, rhythm, harmony and groove. And how it could all work together. Then I try to combine them and hope to find a way or a technique so I can play all this on the bass. So the technique is only my tool to transport the music.
</font></p>

<p>Your goals two years ago were to one day find a way to just make a living from your work together. Are you any closer, or does it still feel a bit like a dream on the distant horizon?  This, of course, has to take into account the current musical climate.
</p>


<p><FONT COLOR="blue">You are right. At the moment it is not easy to make a living from our work with the duo, but we have a good financial base. We are giving lessons and writing for a technical magazine and so on. But we are coming closer to our dream. We can now see it on the horizon.   
</font></p>

<p>Knowing your approach from the last time, I am certain you already have your minds upon the next project, things you will do differently, songs you have started working upon. Would you share some of those things, or is it best to leave it a surprise?
</p>

<p><FONT COLOR="blue">There are a lot of new songs. And we have a lot of new ideas. We also have our own record label. So, there are no frontiers for us in the future.
</FONT></P>

<P>Listening to this new release, <i>The Inner Light</i> will inspire you. It will make it clear in short order that the limits to what a bass is capable of lies only in you. If you need some clarification on this, someone who is a bit further down that path, you now know where to look.
