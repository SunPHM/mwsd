Both species  may be found in most all of the states lakes and rivers. The average bass caught is between 1 and 5 pounds, but there are many fish  taken every year over 5 pounds. Bass fisherman by majority are a catch and release group so that affords this species a bit more protection than they would other wise recieve. The state wide size limit on bass  is 12 inches in lenght and a daily creel limit of 5. Open season on bass is the 3rd Saturday in June through November 30th.The state record largemouth bass was caught by John L. Higbie he was using a spinnerbait fishing in  Buckhorn Lake on 09/11/87. This majestic fish weighed an amazing 11 lb. 04oz. The state record smallmouth bass was caught by Andrew C. Kartesz on Jig and Grub Tail from  Lake Erie on  06/04/95. This incredble fish weighed 8 lb. 4oz.">

<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;The two primary species of bass inhabiting N.Y. State waters are smallmouth and largemouth bass. Both species  may be found in most all of the states lakes and rivers. The average bass caught is between 1 and 5 pounds, but there are many fish  taken every year over 5 pounds. Bass fisherman by majority are a catch and release group so that affords this species a bit more protection than they would other wise receive.  </font></p>

<p>
<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;The state wide size limit on bass  is 12 inches in length and a daily creel limit of 5. Open season on bass is the 3rd Saturday in June through November 30th.The state record largemouth bass was caught by John L. Higbie he was using a spinnerbait fishing in  Buckhorn Lake on 09/11/87. This majestic fish weighed an amazing 11 lb. 04oz. The state record smallmouth bass was caught by Andrew C. Kartesz on Jig and Grub Tail from  Lake Erie on  06/04/95. This incredible fish weighed 8 lb. 4oz. </font></p>

<p>
<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallmouth bass prefer deeper and colder water than largemouth bass which enables both species to coexist in the same environment without competing directly against each other. In rivers they prefer the faster moving water and will be found around large boulder or bridge abutments. Largemouth on the other hand prefer shallower and more turbid water and are often found in weedbeds and around fallen timber in the slower moving stretches of rivers.</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Both species will feed on minnows, crayfish, insects, worms, snails, frogs, or most anything that they can catch and  swallow. This is one reason so many fisherman love bass fishing, because they are fairly easy to catch and will hit most any lure that invades their space. 
</font>
</p>


<p>
<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tackle for bass fishing is as simple as you want it to be, or can be as complex as you want with many tournament fisherman having 5 or 6 rods all rigged with different lines and lures for certain fishing conditions. Most any medium action rod 6 foot in length and spooled with 10 or 12 pound test line would be sufficient for most fishing conditions.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Ontario and Lake Erie offer some of the states most fantastic smallmouth bass fishing. The bays along Lake Ontario also offer some great largemouth fishing, but the best largemouth bass fishing is in the Finger Lakes with Cayuga, Keuka, and Seneca Lake being the number one choices. Lake Champlain, Black Lake, Chautauqua Lake, and many of the reservoirs outside oy New York City offers some trophy bass fishing as well.

<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in May of 2003 Rick Burrows from Philadelphia P.A. and some friends were on a fishing trip to Keuka Lake when he caught this big 4 pound smallmouth bass. After a quick photo it was released. Keuka Lake has a  good population of both smallmouth and largemouth bass, northern pike, perch, crappie, rockbass, bluegills, and bullheads are plentiful here as well. Lake trout, rainbow trout, brown trout and landlocked salmon also abound in it's crystal clear waters.</font>

Pictured here is Julie Stewart. She just started bass fishing 3 years ago, but has learned really quickly. She is holding a fabulous 5 and half pound Largemouth Bass she caught from Lake Champlain south of Crown Point. After a quick photo the fish was released to fight another day. Julie was using Yum Tubes and fishing the edges of the weed matts in the bays.

<font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Corey White from Hallstead Pa.  was fishing with his Mother and Father on Cayuga Lake, and caught this awesome Largemouth Bass. It fought reel hard , but he finally did manage to get it in the boat. After his father took a few pictures he let it go. He used a Quantum bait casting reel with  8lb. test stren. The Fish was caught around the Island. The bait  is a secret sorry, but he plans to catch alot more on it. Very nice fish Corey and keep up that catch and release.

The big bass was taken on a jig fished off the edges of a weedbed. Weedbeds are fish magnets early in the spring because they collect the solar energy and warm more quickly than the deeper open water. They also provide cover for the forage base that has been under siege all winter.</font></p>
