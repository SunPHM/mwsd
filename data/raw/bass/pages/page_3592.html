<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="5" face="Arial"><strong>(R)evolution?:</strong></font><font
face="Arial"><strong> Delegates at a recent conference in Lisbon,
Portugal, expressed concern that cod, once the most popular of
fish is losing market share. According to Intrafish one speaker
at the &#145;(R)evolution in the cod market&#146; conference said
that it was absurd that the industry still had so little
knowledge of consumer preferences. </strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Another speaker
said that a 20% drop in cod consumption has occurred in the space
of only a few years and this has had a serious effect on the
industry, especially for those who deal exclusively in cod
products. He suggested that market researchers should use their
theoretical models to generate more data to help counter the fall
in consumption.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>We, at Callander
McDowell, are not so convinced that a reliance on theoretical
models would help. Whilst it is always important that any
industry should know and understand its consumers, this fall in
consumption may have more to do with the availability of supplies.
The current state of the wild-catch cod fisheries is well
documented and the subject of serious debate in the European
Community. Stocks of cod have fallen to an all time low and this
is reflected in the market place with fewer supplies and higher
prices.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:4.0cm 8.0cm"><font
face="Arial"><strong>As cod becomes less available, the rising
price has deterred many consumers who have sought cheaper, more
accessible species. Farmed salmon, which has a more predictable
price and widespread availability, has become much more popular
with consumers as a result and it is likely that salmon producers
will continue to benefit from declining marine species. Yet,
unlike their colleagues in the wild-catch cod industry, salmon
producers really do need to invest in marketing so that they can
understand changes in consumer demand and react to them
accordingly.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>The decline in
wild cod stocks has not just created an opportunity for the
benefit of salmon farmers, it has also prompted the marine
aquaculture industry to move into cod farming. This has been the
subject of extensive discussion in both the press and news
services. </strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>The editorial in
the latest issue of Fish Farmer magazine posed the fundamental
question as to how realistic an option is farming cod? Certainly,
the experience of the last thirty years has shown that marine
aquaculture has not been as successful as salmon farming. Why
should cod be any different?</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Cod has the
advantage over any other marine species in that it is already
popular and well established in the consumers&#146; mind.
Consumers will not have to be persuaded to buy farmed cod as long
as it is available at the right price.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>The problem is
that whilst cod is a favourite with consumers, there is no
tradition, which would induce consumers to pay above market
prices for farmed cod. This can be already seen from the way
consumers have swung away from cod to lower priced salmon.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>However, there is
a suggestion that cod farmers do not intend to compete with the
wild catch at whatever level quotas allow, but instead aim to
complement them by developing a niche at the top end of the
retail sector. Yet, the salmon industry has already tried a
similar strategy, without real success. European producers have
tried to promote their fish as a high quality product, which
merits a premium price. Unfortunately, consumers faced with a
choice of high quality Scottish salmon or cheaper imported fish
have consistently opted to buy the lower priced salmon.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>The question for
cod producers is whether identifying the fish as farmed will be
sufficient incentive for consumers to pay a premium price. The
adverse publicity aimed at farming would suggest not. It is more
likely that most consumers will view farmed cod as just being cod
and will insist on paying the same price. Certainly, there is
already a question mark over whether high prices for niche market
farmed fish can be sustained. </strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Top store group
Marks &amp; Spencer launched a pack of farmed halibut this year.
These were priced at £7.99 per pack, but at launch were
discounted to £5.99 as an initial promotion. However, once the
promotion came to an end, the price remained at £5.99 and this
has been further discounted to £5.49 during further promotions.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Halibut is often
viewed as more of a luxury fish than the more widely available
species such as cod and haddock. Its potential market is much
smaller and although production is already more established than
for cod, the need to reprice the product in M&amp;S must be of
concern. M&amp; S customers are much less price conscious than
the wider public and if they are unwilling to pay £7.99 for
halibut, will they react similarly when offered more expensive
cod?</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>If prices cannot
be sustained for farmed marine fish even at launch, what will
happen to prices once production starts to increase? According to
Intrafish, the official estimate of production output for farmed
cod in ten years is 25,000 tonnes although other forecasts put
this up to 30,000 tonnes. As output increases, the experience of
the salmon industry is that prices will come under increased
pressure. Yet, there are sufficient differences between salmon
and cod farming to persuade some to consider that cod will
perform differently. It therefore may be more pertinent to look
at the price development for another marine fish instead. The
following figures come from the Federation of European
Aquaculture Producers (</strong></font><a

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>The graph clearly
shows that as production increases, the price of sea bass has
fallen. Can we expect the same to happen to cod? The answer must
be yes.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Salmon farmers
have been able to reduce production costs to compensate for lower
prices, but marine fish producers have only been able to do this
to a limited extent. This is because of the difference in larval
rearing, which is much lower cost in salmon production. Cod
farmers will probably experience the same difficulties as their
counterparts producing sea bass, leaving cod farmers with the
possibility of low margins.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>There is already
a great deal of hype about the economics of cod production.
Recently some Norwegian farmers rearing wild caught fish were
credited with margins of NOK 20-30/kg. The farmers concerned had
to correct press reports saying that they would be lucky to break
even.</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>The greatest
unknown for cod farmers is how much the wild catch, if there is
one, will influence the uptake of farmed fish. This is a problem
which salmon farmers did not have to face to the same extent, as
wild salmon stocks have always been small, which is why the fish
was regarded as a luxury food. By comparison, reports indicate
that the UK , for example, consumes over 140,000 tonnes of cod in
total. Although declining stocks will influence this consumption,
it will be some time before it is clear whether the availability
of farmed cod has any effect on the way that cod is consumed?</strong></font></p>
