<P>Remember back in January when you couldn't buy a fish, let alone find one, 
  and the boys at the Portofino Fuel Dock and the Redondo Beach Fishing Pier were 
  crying the blues. Well, nobody is crying now, 'cept those who can't get out 
  on the water. I hear tell there's a fella down on the WaterFront that keeps 
  his fishing pole in a bucket of water as a mojo on his boss to let him go fishing. 
  I never heard of such a thing. But if'n it works I say, "We need mo mo jo." 
  Aarg, sez the Captain.
<P>
Now, I can get into all the hot details of what's biting and what's not. However, there ain't nutt'n not biting, 'les it's already been caught or it ain't in season. Now the Captain here went out this week to see all this spring fever unfold before his very eyes. I tell ya, mates, the sea was a living wild kingdom. There were a million sea gulls along with pelicans and other sea birds, seals and porpoises all crashing on the bait fish. Under all that life were barracuda. From Malibu to Rocky Point and every outer Island there must'a been a ga'zillion of'em.<P>
The Captain here was slamming them slimy silvery snakes on the deck of the "Special" out of Redondo, one rite after the other. That's when I got tired of catching fish and decided to hook my mate's hat. All by accident. My mate accidentally wanted to punch the Captain here out. In all the excitement the Captain's special lucky fishing hat went over the side. It was a USS Missouri hat given to the Captain by an old buddy who has long since passed away. However, when I got that hat on, I catch fish.<P>
Well, there it was floating like a cow cod on the water drifting slowly away. That's when my other mate yells, "Don't worry, Captain, I'll hook it. It's rite under my line."<P>
As he slowly reels in his jig, line right smack over the hat, not one foot away from it he yells again, "Got it. No, damn it. I ain't got it.  I got another barracuda."<P>
That dang barracuda hit his jig not two inches from my hat. Off into the blue sea went the hat and on the deck came the biggest barracuda I ever did see in my life.<P>
"Well, that was almost a fair trade," I sez. A little prayer went out in memory of my departed friend who gave me the hat, all those who ever served on the USS Missouri and the fish I put on the table. I went down to the galley and ordered a brew. I knew I wasn't going to catch another fish so I'll catch what cookey was serving. Wouldn't you know it. Thirty minutes later the sea was blowing a gale with eight-foot seas...  Ain't that the way it is???  That ole hat must of had one heck of a MO JO!!!<P>
Be sure to send in your photos and fish tales to Captain Jack C/O the Easy Reader, P.O. Box 427, Hermosa Beach, Ca 90254. ER<P>

CAPTAIN OF THE WEEK:  Goes to Jeff Jessop of the Redondo Special.  Who is a local fella who grew up in the South Bay. Worked his way down to Diego and back up to the Redondo Fishing Pier. He is determined to put you on fish every time he goes out. Let's hear it for this fine Sea Captain.  And rumor has it that the White Sea Bass are biting off Rocky Point..... "It's a fact," he sez... <P>
