<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">No Mexico bass fishing lake 
has ever received the amount of hype that Lake Huites (pronounced Wee-tez) did 
prior to its opening in the fall of 1997. With forecasted fishing reports of 
100-250 bass per day in the 3-6 pound range and new sport fishing laws in place 
to protect them, anglers locked in droves to dabble their hooks in what some 
believed would be the hottest lake in the history of Mexico bass fishing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<img src="images/Huites/huteus1.jpg" width="281" height="194"
alt="Lake Huites" align="left">During the last six years, anglers going to Lake 
Huites to do some Mexico bass fishing have proven that hype to be true. 
According to fishing reports, the hottest Mexico bass fishing lake in the world 
might be Lake Huites, located on Mexico's West Coast, outside the city of Los 
Mochis. When at full pool, Lake Huites is a 30,000-acre man-made reservoir that 
had been initially stocked with Florida strain largemouth bass fingerlings to 
jump-start the fishery. These Lake Huites bass have taken a liking to the 
mountainous climate, long growing season and an abundant, protein-rich diet of 
tilapia and shad. They have been growing at a rapid rate. When conditions are 
right, fishing reports indicate that skilled Mexico bass fishing anglers are 
catching in excess of 75 bass a day and 10 pound plus trophies are being caught 
frequently at Lake Huites. The local guides have an intimate knowledge of this 
deep, clear lake and will take you to prime structures that concentrate Lake 
Huites' fantastic bass population.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<img src="images/Huites/huteus3.jpg" width="204" height="293"
alt="Fishing Report" align="right">Bass, by nature, are object juts. Lake Huites 
offers them a variety of the good stuff. Wood Cover and rocks are abundant in 
Lake Huites, and the bass use both to their advantage. For best results, anglers 
should try spinner baits, soft plastics, top waters, Rat-L-Traps and crank baits 
around shoreline brush and on main lake and secondary points. Anglers will enjoy 
trouble-free casting from the decks of 17 1/2 -foot custom bass boats. The boats 
are equipped with 55 and 65 horsepower motors and dual tanks that'll allow you 
to get to those special Lake Huites fishing holes quickly and easily.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">Lake Huites has to rate among 
the most scenic impoundments in Mexico. The 30,000-acre lake was built on the 
Rio Fuerte River and winds for 30 miles through the steep, rocky bluffs of the 
Sierra Madres. The lodging facility we represent on Lake Huites is one of the 
finest on the water. It's the Lake Huites Lodge. The lakeside complex features 
air-conditioned, spacious bedrooms, private baths, shower and a rustic palapa 
where anglers can dine on gourmet meals and exchange those incredible tales of 
the day's fishing action.</p>
