<p><font face="Arial">Winter fishermen often look for cold weather when targeting big
schools of Amelia Island seatrout. The cold water temperatures of winter, which often run
in the low sixties, excite the feeding habits of area seatrout, making the winter season
the best time of the year to target these fish.</font></p>

    <td width="50%" height="302" valign="top"><font face="Arial">&quot;Gator&quot; trout which
    tip the scales at six pounds or better are often found at deep water fish havens that
    adjoin shallow water structures. Many of these productive structures include oyster bars,
    jetty rocks, docks, broken pilings, sand bars and rocky bottoms.</font><p><font face="Arial">Look for the best action for big schools of winter specks to come during the
    last of the outgoing tide and all of the incoming tide. Also, your key to great speck
    fishing often lies in finding clear water. When stained or muddy conditions exist, try to
    find a nearby seatrout structure that has clear water conditions.</font></td>

<p><font face="Arial">Fishing with live shrimp and a seatrout float is by far the most
productive tactic for hooking into a great catch of winter seatrout. Here, the live shrimp
is barbed with a #4 kahle hook just in front of the dark spot, which is located right on
top of the shrimp's head. Adjust the trout float so that your shrimp floats just off from
the bottom. This is a great fishing tactic when the seatrout are holding in water depths
of five to thirty feet.<br>
<br>
When winter seatrout are holding in depths of less than five feet, a live shrimp is rigged
some 18 inches under a popping cork. Here, the popping cork is cast into the shallow water
structure and popped very loudly in hopes of attracting a nearby seatrout.<br>
<br>
Lures are also very effective when targeting winter seatrout. When the trout are holding
deep, try a 1/4-oz. led head jig with a plastic tail. Some of the more productive tail
colors include white, pink, chartreuse, motor oil and white with a red tail. Led head jigs
can also become very deadly seatrout lures when tipped with dead shrimp, live shrimp,
bullhead minnows or finger mullet. Other popular deep-water seatrout lures include the
Mirror Lure, Rattlin Flash and the Count Down Rapala.</font></p>

    <td width="50%" valign="top"><font face="Arial">When the seatrout are working the
    shallows, try a top-water plug for some exciting fishing action. Top-water plugs that make
    a loud popping noise are often the most productive, including the Pop-R, Johnny Rattler,
    Devil's Horse and the Chug-A-Bug. If the water is dead calm, try a Heddon Zara Spook.<br>
    <br>
    Although northeast Florida seatrout are off limits during the months of December, January
    and February, they are still great fun to catch. Be sure and remove the barbs on your
    hooks so that you can release your seatrout unharmed. The local seatrout season opens
    again on March 1, 1999, where fishermen can keep up to five seatrout per day. The seatrout
    must measure at least 15 inches in length and fishermen may keep one seatrout that
    measures over 24 inches.<br>

    redfish, flounder and blues. </font></td>

<p><font face="Arial">All of these species can be caught with the same fishing tactics and
in the same locations as mentioned earlier regarding seatrout.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Offshore fishing during the winter produces excellent action for
black sea bass, grouper and red snapper while fishing the many nearby sunken wrecks, rock
ledges and man-made reefs. Most of these offshore structures are located from 10 to 25
miles from the mouth of the St. Marys inlet and all are marked with latitude and longitude
headings on local offshore fishing charts. Look for the best action to come while fishing
right on the bottom with fresh local squid, dead cigar minnows or cut bait. </font></p>

    <td width="50%"><font face="Arial">Fishing action at northeast Florida's Gulf Stream often
    slows down during the cooler months of winter. However, great wahoo action can be enjoyed
    by trolling deep with planers, downriggers, trolling weights or wire lines. Some of the
    better wahoo baits include large ballyhoo, the C &amp; H &quot;Wahoo Whacker,&quot; Flame
    and the &quot;Islander.&quot; One of the best lure colors is red and black.<br>

<p><font face="Arial">Surf fishing is excellent during the winter months for beach
whiting. Fishing right on the bottom with a small piece of fresh shrimp is definitely the
key to hooking up to this great fishing action. Look for blues, reds, flounder and
seatrout to run in the surf as well.<br>
<br>
Bass fishing in local freshwater streams including Boggy, Mills, Lofton, St. Marys, the
Little St. Marys and Plumbers often produce great fishing action during the last of the
outgoing and the first of the incoming tide. Casting a white spinner bait or minnow-type
plug works best here. Stripers weighing up to 10 pounds are common catches in these
streams, too.<br>
<br>
Crabbing is also excellent during the winter months. Fish right on the bottom with a
chicken neck that is tied to a small string and a two-oz. weight. When a slight tug is
felt, bring the blue crab right up to the surface and net. For great eating, boil your
catch in a pot of water&nbsp; with crab boil seasoning added.<br>
<br>
Non-Florida residents will need a saltwater fishing license when fishing or crabbing from
land or boats. For more fishing and charter information, call the Amelia Angler at (904)
