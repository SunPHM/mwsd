<BR><H3>My Job:</H3>
I'm a Senior Design Engineer and supervisor of <A HREF="ltftext.html">The Low Temperature Facility</A>. My office is in<A HREF="http://www-physics.mps.ohio-state.edu/~phys111/brent/floor2.html"> room 2144 and my shop is in room 2138</A> of Smith Lab. I design and fabricate low temperature apparatus from Dilution Refrigerators ( that will go down very close to absolute zero ) to simple dip probes that will work from 4k up to room temperature.  I also design and build gas handling systems, pumping systems, and etc. needed to run these apparatus for low temperature research. I do all my design and machine drawings on the computer using the Acadr12 program. I started at this job on September 3, 1963. <P>

A little history of Bob Kindler, of whom I've known from day one, is as follows. <BR>
<P>I have a wife, <A HREF=" doris~1.jpg"> Doris ( 24k ), </A> who I married 44 years ago, and everyone said that young marriages never work out........ I have 4 grown children, Robert Jr. 42 years old, Kathy Sue 38 years old, and twin sons, <A HREF="richpic.html">Richard ( 72k )</A> and David 27 years old. I also have 6 grandchildren, the youngest one,<A HREF="abbypic.html">  Abby ( 109k )</A>   being 11 months old, and the oldest one, <A HREF="jenni~1.jpg">Jennifer ( 86k )  </A>being 16 years old. I have a dog named Huggles being 3 years old, which is part Chow and part Sheppard. She minds me better than my wife or children ever did......  <P><BR><H3>Favorite Quote:</H3><BR>

My hobbies are dependent on the seasons and my moods. In the spring and summer it's boating, fishing, camping, and gardening. In the fall and winter it's computers or " puters " as my granddaughter calls them, writing to pen-pals, and reading about the " unknown " , be it physics, U.F.Os, or whatever.<P><BR>
