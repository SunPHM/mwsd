          <p>Our reception was held at The Manning House immediately after the 
            ceremony. The first hour was the cocktail hour. I spent the whole 
            time taking photos since I was late arriving to the ceremony and only 
            had time to get dressed and ready. Rey was able to spend some time 
            mingling, however, before the photos of us together began. Here is 
            a photo of me getting my dress bustled right before we entered the 
            reception.</p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/bustle.jpg" width="408" height="273"></p>
          <p>While we were having photos taken, our guests enjoyed fruit punch, 
            mimosas, and margaritas while listening to the music of Hector on 
            Stilts, a local band. They are an acoustic duo made up of 2 friends 
            of mine. I love their music and felt it would be perfect. A lot of 
            people told me how great they were, and I'm glad that they were so 
            well liked!</p>

          <p>Once the cocktail hour was over and the guests were seated in the 
            main hall for the meal, our wedding party was announced, and then 
            Rey and I were announced and we did our first dance. </p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/enterance.jpg" width="277" height="290"></p>
          <p>The song was &quot;At Last&quot; by Etta James. </p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/firstdance.jpg" width="229" height="241"><img src="wedding%20pics/firstdance1.jpg" width="171" height="246"></p>
          <p>Right after that was the father/daughter and mother/son dance which 
            we did at the same time to the song &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; 
            by Louis Armstrong.</p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/fatherdaughterdance1.jpg" width="419" height="279"><img src="wedding%20pics/fatherdaughterdance2.jpg" width="419" height="279"></p>

          <p>The meal was amazing. Guests had their choice of Chicken Piccatta 
            or Chilean Sea Bass with Mango Salsa. Salad was served as the first 
            course. Light music played in the background. During the diner, my 
            dad made a short toast wishing us happiness, and then came the toast 
            from the Best Chick:</p>
          <p>My name is Jackie Dotson, and this is my best friend's wedding. </p>
          <p>When I first became friends with ReyAnthony, I never would have thought 
            in a million years that I would one day be the best chick at his wedding. 
          </p>
          <p> Anthony and I have been friends since 1988. 13 years! He and I have 
            shared many things over the years, and one of those things has been 
            a love of music. In fact, if it wasn't for music, we would have never 
            met.</p>
          <p> I met Anthony by random chance in the Brooklyn Tech high school 
            ID office. We had both lost our ID Cards and were waiting on line 
            to get our photos taken. We never would have noticed each other, but 
            I had a giant photo of John Lennon on my notebook and a NY Yankees 
            pin on my bag. He had Yankees and Beatles stuff all over his jacket 
            and bag. Needless to say, it was an instant friendship. </p>
          <p>And it has been a friendship that has stood the test of time. Lots 
            of fun times and too many sad times, both with music always right 
            there in the background. Our friendship was cemented in the many shows 
            we went to: Hungerthon ‘89, Hungerthon ‘90 at the Ed Sullivan Theater, 
            Elvis Costello and many more. </p>
          <p>Our friendship became closer and deeper after our high school years. 
            We believed, as we approached the ripe old ages of 19 and 20, that 
            we were real world grownups. During this time, oh, 9 years ago, we 
            spent the most formative and influential years of our lives in Paddy 
            Reilly's Music Bar, seeing our favorite band Black 47. Ant and I spent 
            hours upon hours in that little dive, chatting, dreaming and hoping 
            that our futures would bring us everything we wanted. A hundred pints 
            later, those dreams are coming true! They were times I would never 
            trade for anything and I would not be the person I am today without 
            your friendship in that place, in that moment. </p>
          <p>Now, given the depth of our friendship, people often ask, Well How 
            come you never got together as a couple? I just think that fate had 
            bigger plans. I do know that had we gotten together back the, we'd 
            never be friends now. The maturity just wasnt there at the time. Anthony 
            and I were destined to grow up together, not grow old together. And 
            besides, Stacy was out there waiting, for music to bring her to my 
            best friend.</p>
          <p> I was there on the day they met, July 16, 1998. And for the record, 
            I saw Stacy first. Sitting in TGI Fridays on that oppressively humid 
            July New York Day, I saw a small girl in a Ben Folds Five T-shirt 
            and said to myself, "Oh, she must be one of THEM" (Keep in mind I 
            was never a big Ben Folds Fan). Later, at the gathering, She sat next 
            to me and Ant across from us. I could instantly see something going 
            on there. So it came as no surprise two days later when I received 
            an e-mail from Anthony that began with "Last night was the best night 
            of my life..."</p>
          <p> And so it, began, the story of Anthony & Stacy. The long distance 
            relationship. They got together, they broke up. They kinda got back 
            together, then they weren't talking to one another. Then they fell 
            in love, for good this time. FINALLY! </p>
          <p>When the time came for Anthony to decide whether to move to Tucson, 
            everyone was telling him what to do. I was no exception of course. 
            Most folks thought he was crazy to go, myself included ( I must confess). 
            But I said to him, GO. As Larry Kirwan from Black 47 would say, "nothing 
            ventured, nothing gained" and you are going to spend the rest of your 
            life wondering what could have been if you don't go, so pack your 
            bags! </p>
          <p>I held my breath for oh about six months after that!!! And I will 
            admit that even though I knew that somehow, they would one day marry, 
            I was skeptical mostly of the six year age difference. When Stacy 
            came to NY to visit in 1999, she had no one to hang out with while 
            Ant was at work. He told me this and my response was "I'm your best 
            friend, of course I will babysit". I took her ice skating, to the 
            movies, all over town. And something really special happened. Stacy 
            and I became really good friends. From that point on, I wanted nothing 
            more then for the two of them to be together forever because that 
            meant I would have two best friends. And now I do.</p>
          <p> [PAUSE]</p>
          <p> So, Anthony & Stacy. May misfortune follow you for the rest of your 
            life, but never catch up. Dance as if no one were watching, sing as 
            if no one were listening. Live Every day as if it were your last. 
            And ALWAYS let the music play. </p>
          <p>And.... </p>
          <p>Brindo por Anthony y Stacy. Que tengan muchos anos felicidades y 
            que se mantengan muy unidos. Brindo por los novios. SLAINTE, SALUT, 
            CHEERS TO MY BEST FRIENDS!!!</p>
          <p> [End]</p>
          <p>It was the best toast anyone could have given us.</p>
          <p>As the dinner winded down, Rey and I mingled with our friends and 
            talked to as many people as we could. Then came the cake cutting!</p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/cake1.jpg" width="419" height="279"><img src="wedding%20pics/cake2.jpg" width="419" height="279"></p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/cake3.jpg" width="419" height="279"><img src="wedding%20pics/cake4.jpg" width="419" height="279"></p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/cake5.jpg" width="419" height="279"></p>
          <p>The cake was so delicious! I wish I had eaten more of it! Rey and 
            I spent more time with the guests and then dancing began. I danced 
            with Rey a few more times, which was nothing short of a miracle! I 
            also danced with my cousin Miles, Alex, Dave, Mark, Jackie, and more! 
            I had so much fun just being with everyone. </p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/dancing.jpg" width="333" height="228"><img src="wedding%20pics/dancing2.jpg" width="334" height="234"></p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/dancing3.jpg" width="403" height="233"></p>
          <p><img src="wedding%20pics/dancing4.jpg" width="459" height="228"><img src="wedding%20pics/dancing5.jpg" width="398" height="212"></p>
          <p>By around 3:30 most of the people except family had left and it was 
            winding down, but family and close friends stayed til about 4:00. 
            At that time Rey and I got changed and my parents started cleaning 
            up and gathering the things to take back home.</p>
          <p>It was the best day of my life. Everything went so well. We had about 
            70 people in attendance, and all of them had such a wonderful time. 
            I didn't trip, my dress fit fine, no one passed out, or cried, it 
            didn't rain, the dinner and cake was amazing, the place was beautiful, 
            the flowers were gorgeous, the photographer and Videographer were 
            so easy to work with, and our DJ couldn't have been better. It was 
            amazing day that was just so full of love. I had the love of Rey, 
            and I gave him all of my love, and I could just feel the love from 
            each and everyone of my friends and family. Everyone was so happy 
            and joyful. It was perfect.</p>
