The rhythm that is life.  You come to life the moment that your heart
starts beating.  And, if you are fortunate, it will keep the beat for 
a long, long time.  But, is that all that life is... a simple... constant beat?
<p>
Is the frequency and intensity of the beat what we refer to as 
"emotions that are from the heart"?  Is the chaotic rhythm 
of the ventricular system our soul?
<p>
This multimedia project attempts to scratch the surface.  
Though it is a simple scratch test, the multiple dimensions
of the chaotic system provide for multiple facets.  Does 
that make it multifaceted multidimensional multimedia?
<p>
In any event, here are some basics:
<ul type=square>
<li> The project started as an attempt to gather some simple rhythm 
tracks with a simple rhythm section:
drums, bass and rhythm guitar.
<li> The sound was recorded live as part of an experiment
in the benefits of exposure to a wide range of frequencies.
<li> The music was written on-the-fly as part of an experiment
in chaotic systems.
<li> Asynchronous events and harmonics are explored.
<li> The action is presented unedited... in real time... so, that you, too...
may partake.
</ul>

<p>
The scene:<br>
A few simple souls gathered in the midst of atrocities... waiting
for the pizza pie to be delivered.
<p>
Instruments:<br>
Drum kit, Ibanez bass, Ibanez electric guitar

<li> Just When I Thought I Was Fixated....<br>
I'm standing there... minding my own business... when he says to 
me, "Mind if I play the bass for a while?  You can play the guitar."
As it turns out, this is a perfect song to illustrate the fundamental
principle I seek to understand -- how can I adapt in a fluid situation?
<p>
<li> Stay Hungry<br>
So, we shut the camera's down 'cause we figure the pizza had to 
arrive any second.  Twenty minutes later still no pizza.  This 
is where the camera comes back on.
<p>
<li> We're Coming Through... Today!<br>
The cowboys ride off into the sunset.
</ol>
<p>

That's it.  Well, that is it for now.  Some of these rhythm tracks
will be planted... and, hopefully they will grow.
