was born on March 16th, 1971 (a twin I might add) in Mt. Pleasant,
Michigan.&nbsp;
Mt. Pleasant is a small town located in the center of Michigan's lower
peninsula, and incidentally does not have anything resembling a
mountain
nearby.&nbsp; I am the youngest of 8 children born to Leo and Patricia
Kipfmueller.&nbsp; My other siblings are mostly still living in
Michigan, but
one resides in southern Florida and another in Brooklyn, NY.&nbsp; I
lived
in Mt. Pleasant until I was old enough to know better, about the age of
22.&nbsp; All kidding aside, Mt. Pleasant was actually a pretty nice
place
to grow up and I still try and visit every summer.</font></font><span

 size="-1">Growing
up the youngest of 8 was a great experience, mostly because I learned
an
immense amount from my siblings and was exposed to things at an early
age
that most kids were not.&nbsp; Yes, they were hard on us growing up
(I'm certain getting
thrown repeatedly off the dock at our cottage has probably contributed
to my wariness of the water).&nbsp; I also wasn't too fond of wearing
clothes
from the 70's well into the 80's and I'm pretty sure my poor fashion
taste
is a direct result of hand-me-downs (and down, and down, and down).</font>

<font size="-1">We spent most of our summers,
weekends,
and longer breaks during the winter at our cottages on Fife Lake,<img
 src="http://www.ltrr.arizona.edu/%7Ekurt/personal/Fife_sunrise.jpg"
 nosave="" border="0" height="150" width="200" align="right">
about 30 minutes south of Traverse City.&nbsp; It was a great place to
spend summers and probably the main reason I am interested in the
environment
today.&nbsp; I learned the plants, trees, birds, and insects at a
pretty early age while out collecting fire wood with my family.&nbsp;
Fife Lake remains a
pretty quiet lake, all things considered.&nbsp; Cottages are built only
about 1 deep from the lakeshore in contrast to many other inland lakes
in northern
Michigan.&nbsp;
Common loons and bald eagles still make the water's edge their home
which
adds a nice ambiance during summer visits.&nbsp; Given the pressures of
development and the rise in powerboating and jet skis I'm not sure how
long this will last.&nbsp; So far the eagles and loons have been
remarkably tolerant.<br>

<font size="-1">I graduated from Mt. Pleasant High
School (admittedly not at the top of my class) in 1989 and entered
Central
Michigan University the following fall.&nbsp; CMU is located in Mt.
Pleasant
so I didn't go far.&nbsp; I graduated from CMU in December 1993 and
moved
to Longview, WA the following March to work for the Washington
Department
of Natural Resources looking for northern spotted owls.&nbsp; It was a
great job but seasonal so I ended up moving<img

 nosave="" border="0" height="150" width="200" align="right">
back to Michigan for more permanent work as a land surveyor in Traverse
City, Michigan.&nbsp; Of course, my fiance (now wife) lived in Traverse
City too so that was a bit of a draw.&nbsp; I worked mostly as a GPS
surveyor helping to site natural gas wells on public land.&nbsp;
Another great job since I was out doors in pretty remote areas most of
the time.&nbsp; I also learned how to conduct conventional surveys from
perhaps some of the greatest, most patient teachers out there.&nbsp; Of
course they had to put up with my constantly training the transit on
birds. <br>

<font size="-1">In 1995 I entered graduate school
at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.&nbsp; I spent the next two
years
working with Bill Baker on a fire history study in subalpine forests of
the Medicine Bow National Forest.&nbsp; It was an extraordinary
opportunity
and the experience prepared me well for Ph.D. work.</font></div>

 size="-1">I
started my Ph.D. research with Tom Swetnam at the Laboratory of
Tree-Ring
Research during the summer of 1997.&nbsp; I was baptized by fire so to
speak because I went directly from Laramie to the research site in the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area (on the Idaho/Montana border) before
I even met Tom (I met him for the first time in the SBW).&nbsp; The
research
involved collecting fire history information&nbsp;<img

 hspace="2" vspace="2" nosave="" border="0" height="181" width="245"
 align="right">as
well as reconstructing climate in subalpine forests.&nbsp; The Selway
was
a spectacular place to work and I hope to continue conducting research
in the area in the near future.&nbsp; I completed my dissertation in
January 2003 much to the relief of my wife and dissertation committee.<br>

Kaylee,
born January 30th 2002, has pretty much become the focus of our
life.&nbsp;
I am busily trying to teach her how to core trees but she still lacks
the
coordination to do so.&nbsp; Instead I have begun working with her to
develop
her backward skating technique in hopes to get her to one day play
defense
during hockey games.&nbsp; I continue to work at the Tree-Ring Lab with
Malcolm Hughes on a variety of paleoclimate projects and also teach
courses in the Geography Department.</font><br>
