<p>Low concentrations of dissolved oxygen may suppress growth of fish. Only little is known, however, about the effects of oscillating oxygen conditions. Early experiments from the 60s on brook trout, largemouth bass, and coho salmon suggested that fluctuating oxygen levels may restrain growth more severely than constant intermediate conditions.

<p>In our experiments with sea bass a reduction of growth was found under hypoxic conditions (Fig.&nbsp;1). The growth of sea bass exposed to oscillating conditions was not significantly reduced (Fisher's protected LSD, alpha = 0.05).

<p>In experiments with salmon, growth varied considerably between the 4 to 6 specimens (ca. 100&nbsp;g each) within a tank. It may be assumed that such variations are due to a hierarchical order in the group, suppressing growth of subdominant individuals, probably an artifact of the small tank size (140&nbsp;l). To analyze the growth potential of salmon exposed to different oxygen regimes the maximal growth per tank may therefore be a better indicator than the arithmetic mean. There was a significant positive correlation between DO and maximal specific growth rate (SGR; Fig.&nbsp;2). The maximal growth of fish exposed to oscillating conditions was similar to maximal growth of those exposed to an intermediate concentraton of DO.
