	<h4>Alaska Salmon Fishing</h4>
	
<img border="0" src="topofuna.jpg" width="246" height="167" alt="alaska salmon fishing" align="left"><p>Alaska fishing offers anglers many options for going Alaska salmon fishing. When planning an Alaska fishing trip to go Alaska salmon fishing one has many decisions to make. The first beings of course, which species of salmon do, you want to go Alaska salmon fishing for. When going Alaska fishing you can catch king salmon, silver (coho) salmon, sock eye (red) salmon, chum salmon and pink salmon depending on which month you chose to go. Almost all Alaska salmon fishing takes place in June, July, August and September.  There are two reasons why Alaska salmon fishing takes place during these months. The first and primary is because that is when the salmon make their annual migration into the rivers to spawn making Alaska salmon fishing possible. The other is, in most cases the rivers in Alaska thaw in May making Alaska fishing in its great rivers possible.</p>  

<p>The next decision is what type of tackle do you want to use when you are Alaska fishing.</p>

<p>Alaska salmon fishing can be done with bait casting gear, spinning gear or fly-fishing equipment.</p> 

<p>The last decision in going Alaska fishing when you are interested in Alaska salmon fishing is to decide which of Alaska’s rivers you want to go salmon fishing on. We think the Unalakleet River offers some of the best salmon fishing that Alaska fishing has to offer. The Unalakleet has a huge king and silver salmon run.</p>

<p>There's a rustic lodge situated high on a mountain bluff overlooking the Unalakleet River in western Alaska on the Norton Sound/Bering Sea.  Its remote location boasts the sense of seclusion and wildness you'd expect to find deep in the heart of America's Final Frontier.  The lodge I'm speaking of is the Unalakleet River Lodge.  It's built on hand-hewn logs with massive beams to compliment a towering cathedral ceiling and cozy rock fireplace.  Outside there's a wooden deck that renders a birds-eye-view of a gorgeous mountain valley, its inner core dissected by a slow moving river that seems to run forever.</p>

<p>While the scenery is spectacular, the seasonal fishing opportunities for Silver Salmon, King Salmon, Dolly Varden, Artic Char, Artic Grayling, Pink Salmon and Chum Salmon are among the best to be found anywhere in the world.  NO matter if you're an avid fly fisher or spin cast enthusiast, you'll find plenty of hungry takers in the clear waters of the Unalakleet River.</p>

<img src="images/Una/una1.jpg" width="201" height="292" alt="alaska salmon fishing"
align="left"><p>The best time to go? The bulk of the runs occur between June and September, but the quality of fishing may vary due to the strengths of the individual runs, water conditions and weather.  If you're interested in targeting a particular species, let us know and we can fill you in as to when the peak action occurs.</p>

<p>Now for a little more about the accommodations. Lodge owners Jeff and Sally Appel have put together the ultimate setting for an Alaskan getaway.  Guests can lounge around the spacious lodge after a five-star meal, and then retire to their cabins for a comfortable night of slumber in the Alaskan wilderness.  Each cabin comes with twin or king size beds, private showers and bathrooms.  Just call it "roughing it" -- Unalakleet style.</p>

<p>Many anglers book this lodge for the same week year after year. Make your plans early then email or call us and we will save you a spot at this great Alaska fishing destination.</p>
