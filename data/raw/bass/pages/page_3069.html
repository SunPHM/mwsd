		<p align="left">If you have ever dreamed of catching big bottom fish that can weight 
			200-400 pounds, the waters off of Alaska are the next destination 
			for you. Our charters run out of Sitka, Prince of Wales, and the 
			Cook Inlet near Homer, AK. These are all professional fishing guide 
			services with a long reputation for producing world class halibut 
			fishing excursions. In many cases the cost of the halibut trip can 
			include salmon as well for no additional expense. We book these 
			trips for June through August. Packages will vary from $500 to $2500 
			depending on the package booked. In some cases we work with high 
			quality lodges and remote destinations, in other cases we provide 
			daily guide services only and fishermen can stay in local hotels or 
			lodging facilities not included in the price of their package. These 
			trips are totally customized to fit your needs. Please call our 
			office today for more information on how you can book your next 
			Alaskan fishing adventure. </p>
