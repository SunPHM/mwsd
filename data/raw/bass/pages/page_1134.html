It's practically impossible to do two things at once, and thus Kasim Sulton has left Utopia to pursue a solo career.  "If I were ever going to be serious about this," the twenty-five-year-old Brooklyn-born bassist says about <B>Kasim</B>, his debut solo album, "I had to devote all my time to it.  I had to leave 
Utopia. It was about time; I'd been in Utopia for six years."<p>

For the past couple of years, whenever Utopia wasn't performing or recording and while the other members embarked on solo endeavors, Kasim Sulton gigged around the New York club circuit.<p>

"I don't consider myself a bassist," informs Sulton, "or a guitarist or a keyboardist. They are instruments I play. If you're a bassist, that's all you should play.  I play all three, and I played all of them with Utopia. I consider myself a singer/songwriter."<p>

Like so many hot-shot virtuosi, the bass started out as just an entree. "I only started playing bass to get in a group. You see, a band in Staten Island had two really good guitarists and needed a bassist, so instead of passing up the band, I switched over from guitar and taught myself bass.  At first, I thought it was a cinch, but in order to be a really good bassist, you have to work at it. I practiced for three to four months solid.<p>

"There's a lot more to bass than just root notes and following the chords. It's really not easy playing the bass. You're half the rhythm section, and you got to be real sensitive to the music. You can't plod along. You have to learn to be an accompanist and know how to take a back seat, yet be a 
driving force for the music. You don't want to overplay, but at the same time, you don't want to be invisible."<p>

Although Sulton doesn't consider himself a bassist, he <i>will</i> be playing bass in his new group. "I wouldn't be comfortable with anyone else playing the bass parts but myself," he smiles.  "Plus, people know me as a bassist."  How's that for <i>reductio ad absurdam</i>?</font><p>

<center><h2>A Kasim Sulton Axology</center></h2>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sulton has seven basses. His favorite is a 1964 Precision, which he has had longer than any other bass. "It's great because there's nothing to it," he says of his rosewood neck bass. "There's not a lot of switches or knobs.  This is the quintessential rock and roll bass to record on."<p>

Of his 1962 Precision, he says, "I like old basses because they're made better than the newer ones. When I first handled this bass, I felt a good piece of wood.  I used to use both Precisions on the road but due to the risk of having them stolen, I keep them at home, except for recording.<p>

"I was looking for a smaller bass because I'm not that tall, and I found the Kramer 400B. It has a semi-aluminum neck, which can be interchangeable as both fretted and fretless. However, it's a pain in the neck because you have to glue it together everytime you change over. I used the fretless when I was in Utopia, but I found I couldn't stay in tune with the guys. It's a good bass but heavy. It's a better bass though for jazz groups. But it's small, and I look better on stage with a small bass."<p>

Sulton has an eight string Veillette Citron, hand-made in Brooklyn, which he used on <B>Kasim</B> for overdubbing
the Precision. "The Precision is good for the real low end," he explains "and the eight-string makes it brighter. It's like a double-bass sound, like the difference between a six-string and twelve-string guitar. I use it a lot on the road to get a full sound. It's also very good for ballads."<p>

Sulton's Hamer Prototype is Fender-like. "It's a real fast bass," he describes. "You don't have to press down hard because it plays itself. It has a really low action, which is good for live dates. It has two pickups, which are designed after a Fender Jazz Bass - a P-Bass pickup at the neck and a Jazz Bass pickup at the bridge. When you finger-pick, you can get soft sounds, and when you use a pick and play towards the bridge, you get a harder sound."<p>

When Sulton first joined Utopia, one of his first basses was a Rickenbacker Stereo. "It's good for the Chris Squire sound," he notes. It's real trebly, a real fat sound. It's a good bass to have 
around. if you have two amps, you get bass on one amp and treble on the other. I used it on the first Meat Loaf album."<p>

Sulton employed his Hofner Violin Bass on Utopia's <B>Deface the Music,</B> their humorous ode to the Beatles. "It's a Beatles' bass," he states. "It was the original bass Paul McCartney [one of Sulton's main influences] used, and it has a sound all to itself - a real doinky sound, a flat without a ring, sound. It's a semi-hollow bass and hard to tune.<p>

"I used to use Rotosound Strings," he continues, "but they ate the shit out of my frets. A year after using them, you would need a fret job. I then found Jeff Block in Brooklyn, who custom makes strings. He designs his own strings, and then sends them to a company in Chicago that makes piano strings. They are thicker than normal strings - heavy gauge."<p>

A Roland Blue Box for a little chorus effect is the only special effect Sulton employs. He used an Ampeg SVT amp and a MXR ten-band Graphic EQ for outbound tone control.<p>

Sulton's journey to Utopia came by accident. He started on guitar at age nine and kept switching back between guitar and bass for about seven years. He was performing in the Staten Island bar circuit when he got into piano in order to learn how to block out a song. He bought an upright piano and taught himself how to play. He eventually wound up in ex-Bowie clanner Cherry Vanilla's band as a keyboardist for a year when Michael Kamen (New York Rock and Roll Ensemble founder and noted arranger and keyboardist) asked casually one day if Sulton knew of a bassist who might want to join Utopia. Kamen wasn't aware of Sulton's past and only thought of him as a keyboardist. Sulton was so excited that he had to borrow twenty dollars for the bus ticket to Woodstock - a two and a half hour trip that he would take many times over the next six years.<p>

He was in the right place at the right time.</font><p>
