      During February and March 1999, if you want a whopper of a deal,
      purchase a <a href="http://MyFWC.com/Fishing/license.html">5-Year
      Freshwater Fishing License</a> for $61.50, at your <a
      href="http://www.hsmv.state.fl.us/offices/">tax collector's
      office</a> (or call 1-888-FISH-FLORIDA and use a credit card; a $3.95
      service charge will be added). You will receive five full years of
      freshwater fishing fun, and a <a href="5yr-1999.html">bonus pack</a> in
      the mail with more than $40 worth of free lures, magazines, programs
      and other samples, plus over $400 worth of special offers and
      rebates. The license you receive will be an embossed plastic card
      that won't break down and get lost like annual cardboard licenses.

      PEAKS>>></b><br>
      March is peak spawning season for <a href="../Fishes/bass.html">largemouth
      bass</a> throughout most of the state. South Florida heats up to the
      preferred water temperature of 58 to 65 F a little earlier, and in
      panhandle Florida cold weather can delay the spawn somewhat.
      <p>When water temperatures are right, mature males (typically at
      least two years old and 10 inches long) move into the shallows and
      begin digging nests or beds. Protected areas with sandy bottoms and
      some vegetation debris in 2 to 4 feet of water are preferred.
      <p>The male digs the nest by planting his &quot;chin&quot; in the
      center and fanning out a hole using his tail (caudal) fin. As a
      result, nests are typically about the same width as the male is long
      or perhaps half again as wide. This activity also explains why so
      many male bass in spring have sores under their chin and along the
      bottom of their caudal fin.
      <p>Females meanwhile begin cruising the shorelines looking for the
      &quot;right man&quot; —who needless to say is out looking for her
      too. When they pair up, they return to the nest and the male
      stimulates the female by bumping her sides. As the eggs are released,
      the couple often roll slightly and the male fertilizes the eggs.
      <p>Males then guard the nest and fan it to provide sufficient
      aeration for the eggs. The female may or may not stay around and
      often visits several nests over the course of the spawning period.
      <p>Each nest contains tens of thousands of eggs, which begin hatching
      in one to two weeks. The male continues to guard the fry (baby fish
      with yolk sacs still attached). For about two weeks, fry stay in or
      near the nest using stored energy reserves in their yolk sac to grow.
      <p>Fingerling bass then begin foraging in schools of several
      thousand, normally with the male near by for protection. Once they
      reach a length of about an inch the male moves on and begins
      aggressively feeding to restore his own energy levels.
      <p>How many of the tens of thousands of eggs laid per spawning
      survive to recruit to harvestable sizes is largely dependent on
      quality habitat and weather conditions. The presence of firm sand
      bottoms so the eggs don't sink into the muck, the need for vegetation
      to prevent wave action from burying the eggs, water levels that don't
      fluctuate too rapidly while the eggs are in the nest and temperature
      considerations are all critical. Having the right sized zooplankton
      (microscopic animals) available when the yolk is used up and numerous
      small insects and other fish fry available for the fingerlings also
      impact the success of a year class. Typically, however, mother nature
      has provided an abundance of young bass to replace those that have
      perished naturally or have been harvested by anglers. That is why
      stocking bass is not normally a successful management tool–it is
      much more efficient and beneficial to protect and enhance aquatic
      habitats.

      SO DOES FISHING!</b><br>
      March is also a peak fishing season in Florida. The weather is great,
      and anglers swarm to lakes and rivers for some of the most productive
      fishing of the year.
      <p>Fishing for spawning bass has always been controversial. Game and
      Fresh Water Fish Commission staff have consistently avoided managing
      angler ethics in favor of providing effective habitat programs and
      management regulations that affect the fish populations–not angling
      preferences. Permanently removing males from the bed results in loss
      of eggs and fry the male was protecting. However, catching and
      immediately releasing the male back near the nest can be
      inconsequential. Similarly, most females that are full of eggs and
      ready to spawn will resume spawning activities successfully if
      carefully and quickly released after they are caught. It is important
      that fish be landed quickly and not stressed by a prolonged fight.
      <p><b>FREE FISHING IN APRIL!</b><br>
      This April 3rd and 4th is Free-Fishing Weekend. No license is
      necessary. So it's a great opportunity for you to take an unlicensed
      family member or friend out to share your enthusiasm for fishing. All
      other rules remain in effect.
