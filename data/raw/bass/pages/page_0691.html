      <p>This part of the site examines the travelogue, and the centrality of 
        the <i>tour</i> to the Films of Scotland documentaries.  It does so for 
        two reasons.  Firstly, travelogues make up the majority of the films produced 
        by the second Committee.  Secondly, the figure of the <i>traveller</i> 
        is central to the documentaries produced by the first committee, and the 
        way in which Scotland is represented as an <i>object</i> of knowledge 
        approached from the outside, 'discovered' by an other culture.  </p>

 <h3>Early Travellers</h3>
      <h4>The Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century </h4>
      <p>Until parliamentary union with England in 1707 Scotland traded directly with 
  her European neighbours.  T. C. Smout has documented how trade took place from 
  burghs, communities in which merchants and tradesmen (immigrants as well as 
  natives) were granted specific rights to support their purpose of internal and 
  external trade.  In the middle ages the main Scottish exports to the Low Countries 
  were wool, hides, coal, salt and fish.  Wine was the most regularly imported 
  luxury, brought home by Scottish ships from the wine ports of France, Spain 
  and Portugal.  By the 18th century the Scottish west coast ports were competing 
  with the older east-coast burghs, and the burghs became gateways to the European 
  world.  Equal trading opportunities with England, provided under the Union of 
  1707, provided access to a British foreign market vastly enlarged by imperial 
  expansion in North America, India and the Caribbean.  Merchants grew wealthy 
  with the opening of new trades to North America, the West Indies and Russia, 
  then to the export markets of France and Germany, and finally with the trade 
  to India and China (Smout, 1990, pp. 153-60).</p>

<p>The production and consumption of material wealth was matched by the reproduction 
  and circulation of the cultural wealth or mimetic capital of these countries.  
  Mimetic capital is best described as a stockpile of representations, the images 
  that matter, that merit the term capital, that achieve reproductive power.  
  This 'capital' was commonly appropriated on what is known as 'The Grand Tour'.  
  From the early 17th century onwards gentlemen's sons visited Europe to perfect 
  the languages at first hand, to acquire the fashionable arts of swordsmanship 
  and equestrian skills and the gentler accomplishments of music and drawing.  
  They visited Holland, Germany, France, and above all, Italy where they studied 
  the remains of the classical world and the painting of the great masters.  By 
  the turn of the eighteenth century the studious Grand Tourists were joined by 
  the sightseeing travellers, the forerunners of the modern tourist.  From the 
  medieval period then, Scottish merchants were caught up in a system of material 
  exchange with other lands and other cultures.  Scholars and travellers passed 
  along these trade routes in search of mimetic capital.  Not until the eighteenth 
  century, however, did they journey to Scotland's own geographical margins, the 
  Highlands and Islands.</p>

    <td> <h4>Boswell and Johnson</h4>
<p>Amongst the most famous of these eighteenth century travellers was Dr Samuel 
  Johnson and James Boswell, who in 1773 journeyed from Edinburgh up to Aberdeen 
  and on to Inverness, down the Great Glen, and across to the Western Isles, before 
  travelling back to Oban, Inverary, Loch Lomond, Glasgow, down to Boswell’s family 
  seat at Auchinleck, then back to Edinburgh.  That certain parts of Scotland 
  were now the destination of a growing body of travellers is supported by Boswell's 
  (1965) comment on Loch Lomond that it 'is so well known by the accounts of other 
  travellers, that it is unnecessary for me to attempt a description of it' (p. 
  407).  Rapid improvements in transport in Scotland during the previous fifty 
  years facilitated their travels in the Highlands (Butler, 1985, p. 374), but 
  their journey to the Isles was an unusual one; Boswell refers to it as 'our 
  curious expedition', and recounts how on mentioning it to Voltaire, 'He looked 
  at me, as if I had talked of going to the North Pole' (p. 167).  In 1773, there 
  was no infrastructure for travellers in the Western Isles; Johnson (1965) remarks 
  that 'In the Islands there are no roads, nor any marks by which a stranger may 
  find his way' (p. 47), and that 'in countries so little frequented as the Islands, 
  there are no houses where travellers are entertained for money.  He that wanders 
  about these wilds, either procures recommendations to those whose habitations 
  lie near, or, when night or weariness come upon him, takes the chance of general 
  hospitality' (p. 48).  There were also no guide books, and their route was provided 
  by the minister of Calder, an acquaintance of Boswell's. </p>
<p>Why then, despite these considerable difficulties, was Johnson, to use Boswell's 
  words, 'particularly desirous of seeing some of the Western Islands' (p. 169)?  
  Why then, despite these considerable difficulties, was Johnson, to use Boswell's 
  words, 'particularly desirous of seeing some of the Western Islands' (p. 169)?  
  Towards the end of his journal, Johnson notes that: 'We came thither too late to 
  see what we expected, a people of peculiar appearance, and a system of antiquated 
  life' (p. 51).  He concludes that 'a longer journey than to the Highlands must 
  be taken by him whose curiosity pants for savage virtues and barbarous grandeur' (p. 51).  
  What this suggests is that Johnson came to the Isles in search of cultural difference, 
  a cultural difference that the accounts of the early voyages of discovery had 
  led him to expect.  As popular as they were, these 
  accounts were highly exaggerated and often fictional, the product of a European 
  desire to encounter cultural otherness.  But as we shall see in the travelogues 
  themselves, this desire was to remain a central component of twentieth century travel. </p>
