height=300  width=500><FONT color=black>Absolute Blue was formed in 1993 by Tom and John from the remnants of Hot Gossip, a blues 
outfit that featured traditional and contemporary blues. The band has featured 
different players through the years, including keyboards and harp, before 
deciding on their present 5-piece no holds barred format. Not 
content to settle for a simple blues format, the band quickly expanded their 
versatility by adding a variety of music to their song list, all the while 
keeping true to their roots (they still frequently play an entire set of Stevie 
Ray Vaughn). Since forming, the band has developed a reputation for energetic 
renditions of blues and classic rock standards, moving comfortably from southern 
rock to blues to funk, consistently providing a responsive, interactive show. No 
set lists here; no risk of hearing the same songs each night, as the band has 
such an extensive repertoire and directly responds to the audience, openly 
taking requests. The band also features many regular guest performers, including Big Dick and the acclaimed Jeff Weathers. From the 
stripped down sound of Muddy Waters to the funked up rhythm of the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, the band maintains its rapid pace, dance-till-you-drop energy. Once you 
hear them, you’ll be hooked on Absolute Blue – The Ultimate Grooving 
Machine.<p>
