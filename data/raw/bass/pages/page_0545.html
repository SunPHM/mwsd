  <font size="+1">Onward and upward, as they say. Here are some more pictures
 of my bass. These first two show gluing the body wings onto the neck. I
cut  the inside of the horns out before attaching the wings per Bill's instructions
 to keep from having to swing the long neck around while cutting them after
 attaching the wings. Unfortunately, after attaching the wings I found that
 the curve didn't blend smoothly into the side of the neck and so I ended
up gluing on two small wedges to smooth out the curve. I attempted to use
a mix of glue and mahogany dust to help fill any small gaps. This didn't
work out very well, the mix turned black after it dried. I don't know if
I used too much dust, or if it was a reaction with the yellow glue I used
and the dust. Either way, I've got some areas to clean up because of it.
You can see the black areas in a couple of the following pictures.</font>

<p><font size="+1">Here you can see all the clamps used to glue the wings 
 on. The neck is positioned so that the step of the fingerboard is hanging 
 off the edge of the bench and the wings are aligned along the front face 
with the neck by being held down to the bench. It didn't come out perfect, 
apparently the joint had slipped just a little while clamping without my noticing.
I was able to clean it up the uneven joint without any problems, but it ended
up leaving me with slightly less body thickness than I wanted. So, for that
reason and to cover up the black lines from my glue/dust mix I decided to
put on a rear cap of curly maple also.<br>

  <font size="+1">Here on the left is the gutiar with the body wings attached,
 before smoothing the top or the inside curves. The picture on the right
shows  how I cut a small channel into the fingerboard step for the top cap
to fit  into. This allows for a cleaner joint and hides the edge of the cap.
You can also see the black glue/dust mix there just below the piece of scrap
maple. Most of that has sanded off, but not all. I think that once I finish
shaping the neck-to-body transition most of these black marks will be gone...at
 least, I hope so. If not, I may have to do something creative with the finish
to cover it up.</font> <br>

  <font size="+1">Here, I have the top cap glued on and clamped down. As
you  can see, I used several pieces of wood(maple) clamped across the body
and  another long one down the middle of the others to provide even pressure
across  the body.<br>

  <font size="+1">And here is the top cap attached. Notice the tight fit
around  the fingerboard step, the cap actually goes underneath the edge by
about 1/16" or so. I'll still have to fill some small areas around the channel
but this time I'll use clear epoxy and mahogany dust iinstead of yellow glue,
or I'll experiment on some scrap first to get the right tone in the dried
filler. On the right I've laid out the templates to mark the shape on the
new top surface. You can see the curl in the wood that will really look nice
when finished. The glare in the pictures does wash it out a bit, but you
can still see how nice it is.<br>

  <font size="+1">Now it's finally starting to look like a guitar! I've cut
 the rough profile out on my bandsaw. I still need to do some more shaping

<p><font size="+1">Here is the bookmatched bottom cap I made from a piece 
 of maple I got from work. It was a piece about 8-1/4" wide by 13/16" thick. 
 I used my table saw and a handsaw to resaw it into two pieces. I roughly 
smoothed them with my surface planer and then jointed the edges glued them 
together. After that I ran the piece through the belt sander at work to smooth 
it and remove the chip-out areas caused by the planer. It came out pretty 
nice, not as good as the top cap, but it will look good when finished. It 
as some color variation in the grain that adds to the beauty of the wood...even 
some small knots will be visible, but they're hard and stable and no larger 
than 1/16" or so.</font> <br>

  <font size="+1">And here I've got the bottom cap glued and clamped in place
 using the wood cauls again to spread the clamping pressure. After the glue
 sets I'll use a router and flush trim bit to trim off the excess around
the  body shape. That's why I went ahead and cut out the rough shape before
gluing  on the rear cap, that way I had about 1/4" less thickness to go through
my  bandsaw. It was much easier to glue on since I didn't have to worry about
 notching around the fingerboard at all, just spread the glue out on both
sides and then clamp it in place, making sure the center seam lined up with
the centerline on the guitar.</font> <br>
  <font size="+1">&nbsp;I've done some work on smoothing and shaping the
body  edges and shaping the neck, but no pictures yet. I still have a long
way to go. I have to get some more sanding sleeves for my drill press drum
sander  as well as some long, narrow drums to get inside the horns so I'm
on another  minor delay now. I've still got a lot of work to do on the neck
though so  I've got plenty to do until they arrive. I've also decided to
order pickups  from <a href="http://www.carvin.com">Carvin</a>. They have
a 2 pickup kit  at a fairly reasonable price that should do the job nicely.
I'll be ordering  that in the next couple of weeks so I'll have the pickup
dimensions to make  routing templates for the pickup cavities. I'm going
to use chrome knobs also, to match the chrome bridge. I still haven't decided
on a finish yet....</font>  <br>
