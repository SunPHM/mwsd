      Led by Special Agent Richard Tourzos, NOAA special agents recently seized 
      over 33 tons of illegally imported Chilean sea bass in Boston. The shipment, 
      valued at approximately $275,000, was seized after NOAA Fisheries law enforcement 
      agents received information from the Australian government that the fish 
      were illegally harvested from Antarctic waters. <br>

      NOAA Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement and the U.S. Customs Service are 
      coordinating an initiative with several other countries to crack down on 
      illegal fishing for Chilean sea bass. <br>
      <br>
      Following a federal investigation, the violators may also face civil penalties 
      and criminal fines, along with forfeiture of the valuable shipment of fish. 
      Seizure of the shipment harvested by the Arvisa I, an Uruguayan-flagged 
      commercial fishing vessel, occurred with coordination from the Department 
      of State and counterparts in Australia.<br>
      <br>
      "This seizure is another example of our commitment to ensuring that Chilean 
      sea bass marketed, sold and consumed in the U.S. is legal product and not 
      contributing to the depletion of this valuable resource," said Bill Hogarth, 
      director of NOAA Fisheries. "I want to send a message to all those attempting 
      to import illegal Chilean sea bass into the United States that we will catch 
      you and confiscate your shipment." This seizure is one of several recent 
      cases involving the attempted importation of illegally harvested Chilean 
      sea bass. In April, NOAA special agents seized approximately 32 tons of 
      Chilean sea bass landed in New Bedford and Los Angeles. Last July, two shipments 
      totaling 23 tons were seized in Newark. <br>
      <br>
      Chilean sea bass, also known as Patagonian toothfish, is a high value fish 
      that is primarily harvested from waters surrounding Antarctica. The fishery 
      is managed internationally under the Convention for the Conservation of 
      Antarctic Marine Living Resources (Convention). Certain fishing grounds 
      of the Patagonian toothfish fishery are at risk of becoming overfished, 
      largely due to illegal and unreported fishing. <br>
      <br>
      The United States is a member of the Convention and strongly supports international 
      efforts to protect this fishery and eliminate illegal fishing for Chilean 
      sea bass. As part of these efforts, NOAA and the U.S. Customs Service aggressively 
      monitor imports of Chilean sea bass to ensure that imported fish are lawfully 
      harvested and comply with all Convention requirements. </font></td>
