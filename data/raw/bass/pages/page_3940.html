sailing with Gordon aboard the T.G. Ellyson in the<br>Gulf of Fethiye. Actually, it was a 
toss-up as to which was the best. We hope to make this an annual event!!<br>Sailing with Gordon 
and Philippa is an absolute treat. The weather and the sights are terrific, but they make it all 
perfect. Their warmth and hospitality, great food, interesting excursions and fun evenings equal 
the perfect holiday. Thank you both. Love Debra xxx. Debra Walton-Collings, New York,

<a href="images/Photos/Salon04-3v.jpg" alt="Sailing Turkey And Greece">below</a> her 44' deck the 
T.G. Ellyson is spacious and uncluttered. There are two <a href="images/Photos/TGE_AftCabin3.jpg" 
alt="Sailing Greece In Style">private cabins</a>, each accommodating two 
guests. A teak-paneled salon incorporates a fully-equipped galley and navigation station. Two 
water closets include fresh-water showers. Throughout there is ample cupboard and closet space 
notwithstanding stowage for additional sails. Three sails are colorful spinnakers for off-wind 
sailing. Three others are large genoas for speed on the wind. Three smaller sails brought the TGE 
across the Atlantic at an average speed of 7 knots.

<p>The TGE's crew is experienced at sea and knowledgeable of local geography and culture. Gordon 
Abercrombie has cruised the Greek islands and the coast of Turkey since 1980. Jennifer 
Abercrombie, Brigitte Pelletier, and others of the crew have lived and worked in Turkey and have 
traveled through much of Greece, as well.</p>

<p>The T.G. Ellyson takes guests on a first-come, first-served, basis. Those booking early are able 
to customize their itineraries using any or all or none of the <a href="Itinerary.htm">itinerary 
outlines</a> a part of this web site. While often not a problem, those guests booking later must 
book around the beginning and ending ports as well as the beginning and ending dates of guests 
booking earlier. <img src="images/Photos/Salon04-2.jpg" height="320" width="480" align="right" 
hspace="10" vspace="10" v:shapes="_x0000_s1027" alt="Sailing Greece"> The TGE normally cruises the 
western and southern coasts of Turkey between the Dardanelles and Antalya. The TGE also frequently 
cruises among Greek islands off Turkey's coasts, the Sporades and Dodecanese. In addition, the TGE 
cruises among Greece's mid-Aegean Cyclades Islands including Mykonos and Santorini. Excursions
even further afield are possible.</p>

<p>A typical day aboard the T.G. Ellyson begins with a view of pine-clad slopes and crystal-clear 
water. Breakfast may be taken on deck or from a stone kiln ashore. During breakfast the guests 
plan their day. Hiking and exploring may come next, or sailing while trolling for tuna and sea 
bass. Swim stops may be frequent, depending on inclination and destination. The destination may be 
an idyllic cove affording opportunity to snorkel or to go <a href="images/Photos/KayakStrokes.jpg" 
alt="Sailing Turkey And Greece">kayaking</a>, or simply to relax and read in the warmth of the sun. 
And in the evening guests may wish to enjoy a local taverna or the<img height="320" width="480"

alt="Sailing Turkey">  campfire cuisine of an enterprising restaurateur skilled in the art of 
preparing fine regional food. Nearby there may be ancient Lycian, Greek, Roman or Byzantine ruins 
not often seen by tourists, or the ruins of a pirate village climbing slopes from which watchful 
eyes once peered out to sea. Alternatively the destination might be a charming town home to wily 
rug merchants, to silver shops, or to an agora or bazaar offering a myriad of shopping 
opportunities. And likely, in such a town, the dining will be memorable.</p>

<p>Here, there, or elsewhere, TGE guests will be meeting and conversing with people of many 
nationalities and varied backgrounds, listening, learning, and experiencing the holiday of their 
lives. Try it. Try it with us. Charter our yacht to sail Greece and to sail Turkey. The honeymoon 
or holiday of a lifetime!<br><br><br></p>

Sailing in Greece. U.S. policy in the Middle East is faulted. Every smart bomb programmed with dumb 
intelligence kills terrified innocents. Each incidence of collateral damage in Afghanistan and Iraq 
creates scores of additional terrorists, members of large extended families and larger tribal 
families. On 5 November 2003 five children were killed by U.S. forces in a night raid on a village 
near Gardez, Afghanistan, a night raid which missed its intended target. One day later nine more 
children<img src="images/Photos/CleopatrasBay.jpg" height="320" width="480" align="right" 
hspace="10" vspace="10" v:shapes="_x0000_s1029" alt="Sailing Greece"> were killed in a U.S. air 
attack on the village of Hutala, also in Afghanistan, an air attack which also missed its intended 
target. In both instances the U.S. <i>&#147;had no indication there were noncombatants&#148;</i> in 
the villages. As though villages in Afghanistan might be populated solely by combatants. How many 
additional insurgents were created upon the death of those fifteen terrorized children? One each? 
Or ten each? Alternative sailing routes and cruising areas for sailing Greece and sailing Turkey

more than forty guests at Makr al-Deeb in western Iraq was obliterated by successive waves of U.S. 
smart-bombers, attack helicopters, and ground assault forces. This massacre replicated a similar 
incident on 1 July 2002 at Deh Rawud in Afghanistan, an incident also killing more than forty 
innocent people. How many additional insurgents <img src="images/Photos/SifnosKastroChurch1.jpg"

collateral damage in Afghanistan and Iraq has continued unabated throughout the "war on terror" 
launched by the Bush administration. On 2 January 2006 a night airstrike on a farm near Baiji in 
Iraq's Salahuddin Province dispatched a family of twelve. This tragic incident resulted from a
spurious assumption on the part of U.S. intelligence that because an unmanned drone had observed 
three of these farmers digging near a road, they must be planting a bomb. These twelve innocents
were part of Salahuddin Governor Ahmad Mahmud Kaissi's extended family. How many additional 
insurgents, members of the governor's extended family, were created upon the death of those
terrorized relatives? One each? Or ten each? What proportion of the governor's tribe favors a 
continued U.S. presence in Iraq? Any at all? Charter your yacht in Turkey. Charter your yacht in 
Greece. A crewed charter sailing yacht cruising the Aegean from Rhodes. Or Kos. A crewed charter

Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff testifying before a Congressional committee, commanders in Iraq 
are required to obtain advance approval from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for any planned 
air strike likely to result in the deaths of more than thirty civilians. Through the summer of 
2003 more than fifty such raids were proposed <i>and all were approved</i>. That was in the first 
few months of a war now approaching its third anniversary! Rid us of Rumsfeld before it is too late! 
Demand his ouster! Send this lord of the earth to McNamara’s hell! The TGE's experienced crew will 
welcome you aboard their charter yacht for a sail among Aegean islands of Greece, the Cyclades, the 
Dodecanese, the Sporades, or for a cruise along Cleopatra's route up the Turkish coast to ancient 
Samos, or for a sail paralleling Alexander's port-closing path down the coast of Turkey. A crewed
