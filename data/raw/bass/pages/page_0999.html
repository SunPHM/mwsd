<h2 align="center">Turl Street Arts Festival: Review of &quot;Open Mic&quot; Evening</h2>

<p>As part of the Turl Street Arts Festival, an &quot;Open Mic&quot; evening was held in
Lincoln College's Deep Hall on Tuesday 13th February.</p>

<p>The evening was opened by compere Ben Whittaker (Lincoln vocalist) and Nick Day
(acoustic guitar) who gave an admirable rendition of Oasis's &quot;Hello&quot; followed by
a brief airing of their own composition &quot;Loved you so&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;mic&quot; was then officially open and first to take to the floor was a<br>
visiting student, Isaac from Exeter,who moved the mood to the blues of the deep south.
&nbsp; His version of &quot;Walking after midnight&quot; proved him to be a very
accomplished soloist.</p>

alt="PGFH: Andy Storey (Saxophone), Marcus
Dubois (guitar) and James Ellis (bass guitar)">Next
up were Andy Storey (Saxophone), Marcus Dubois (guitar) and James Ellis (bass guitar) who
formed a Lincolnite jazz trio under the name PGFH. The first piece, &quot;Pick up the
pieces&quot; was followed by two of the band's own compositions whose liveliness meant the
audience were treated to some very energetic saxophony from Andy coupled with inspired
bass and guitar contributions from Marcus and James who held the pieces together. At this
point in the evening, the bar was very well populated and a version of the James Bond
theme tune and George Michael's &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; pleased the crowds.</p>

<p>John Treadway opened his set with a Leonard Cohen piece and then treated the audience
to a choice of &quot;A song they'd probably never heard before or one they'd heard far too
much.&quot; Toploader's &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot; proved to be a winner. All in
all, an admirable effort from &quot;the Rag man&quot;.</p>

<p>John was followed by an anonymous musician, not particularly well received by the
audience, who played Dire Straits' &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. He had a good voice
although the piece was a little too lengthy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/news/2001/02/21/02.jpg" border="0" hspace="10" width="221"
height="300" align="right" alt>Introduced as the &quot;amazing Nick Gill&quot;, Nick Gill
did in fact live up to his name.&nbsp; Some very skilful guitar playing was mixed with a
little audience participation to give an impressive range of music from Jimmy Hendrix's
&quot;All along the Watchtower&quot; to his own compositions. Nick's unique and tricky way
of playing along with his technical ability and extensive use of fret tapping gave his
pieces some sparkle that helped create a good atmosphere in the bar.</p>

<p>Another jazz trio consisting of a saxophonist, guitarist and a Lincolnite on the double
bass followed. They played a variety of pieces, opening with one of Charlie Parker's hits.
These musicians were obviously very accomplished and apparently they form part of the
acclaimed jazz band &quot;Aphrodisiac&quot;.</p>

<p>The style reverted briefly to pop next when Ben Walker from St Anne's gave us David
Bowie's &quot;Survivor&quot;. The evening was concluded with Lincoln's very talented
Marcus Dubois who lifted the audience with a variety of contemporary pop songs adapting
the vocals to each style. His talent was demonstrated by the diversity of artist's music
he covered from David Gray's &quot;Babylon&quot;, REM's &quot;Day Sleeper&quot; to a
rather polished version of Santana's &quot;Smooth&quot; in the Latin American style.</p>

<p>All in all, the evening was a success. Ben's organisational skills alongside the wide
variety of talented musicians provided an unusually &quot;rocking&quot; Tuesday evening in
Lincoln bar.</p>
