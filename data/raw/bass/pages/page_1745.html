            <p class="innerheaders">Who was Herold? </p>
            <p><span class="body"> Raymond Elgar in his reference dictionary "Looking 
              at the double bass" (1967 &#8211; published by the author.) 
              writes that Herold worked in Brunndobra in the early part of the 
              19th century and made well made instruments that were based on a 
              Stradivarian model. Elgar praises Herold`s instruments for their 
              good tone and notes that his label was usually affixed in a difficult 
              to find position - against the lining of the G-string side upper 
              inside table. Indeed we did find the original label located more 
              or less in that exact position. It reads (printed) "Reinhold 
              Herold, Bass-und Cello-Fabrikation, Brunndobra b. Klingenthal" 
              followed in hand written ink "in Sachsen, Germany". 
              </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Why place the label in that inaccessible position? 
            </p>
            <p><span class="body"> One theory proposed by one of our expert restorers 
              - namely Roger Dawson - was that Herold had an outlet for his instruments 
              either through the "trade" or via some other reseller or retail 
              outlet who actually stipulated at the time of their order that Herold`s 
              own label would not be required. This sort of request never goes 
              down well with any maker worth his salt &#8211; so the practice 
              of hiding ones personal details in a non visual position was frequently 
              adopted under such circumstances. To make viewing of the label easier 
              The Contrabass Shoppe has taken the liberty of relocating the label 
              to a more conventional position - on the back and visual through 
              the bass-side F-hole. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Description:</p>
            <p><span class="body"> So an excellent write up about Herold from 
              Henley - and quite deservedly so &#8211; for this really is a well-made, 
              well-proportioned viol outline instrument. Of note is the use of 
              spectacularly flamed maple in the back, ribs and scroll and the 
              subtle use of scalloped linings on the rib-plate join is original. 
              The original spirit varnish is particularly well preserved and is 
              of an appealing golden brown in colour. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">How do you know that the instrument dates 
              from circa 1840? </p>
            <p><span class="body"> That's a very good question for the instrument's 
              appearance is deceptive and besides one does tend to make a later 
              date assumption due to the fact that early nineteenth century German 
              instruments are infrequently found these days. So - in answer to 
              the question - we at The Contrabass Shoppe were fortunate to see 
              - shortly after purchasing this instrument - a near identical instrument 
              by Herold. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body"> In addition to a date of 1840 on the label 
              there was also an 1840 date accompanied by the makers signature 
              on the inside table. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">The instrument looks to be in great condition:</p>
            <p><span class="body"> Yes it is. The Contrabass Shoppe has really 
              gone to town to put this instrument into the really tip top condition 
              that you now find it. In addition to badly torn edges and cracks 
              being sorted out we've replaced the old bass bar and we've secured 
              the critical post area with a patch of the right size and shape. 
              So as to complement the beautifully flamed wood of the back and 
              ribs we've put in (specially selected out of a number of neck-blocks 
              that we imported some two years ago from Bosnia) a highly figured 
              maple neck. In addition - and as you'd expect - we've fitted a superb 
              quality fingerboard imported from India, a top quality bridge imported 
              from Mirecourt and a brilliantly engineered endpin unit that was 
              made to our own specifications - here in England. In total nearly 
              four months of work have been lavished on this one instrument by 
              our repairer M.J.Bailey. It is now well ready to see out it's next 
              164 years plus of music making. </span></p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Will the instrument suit me?</p>
            <p><span class="body"> This instrument has all the right sound qualities 
              (tonally rich with plenty of volume) suitable for a life in the 
              symphony or chamber orchestra. The dimensions are smallish, so for 
              those player who are of a slightly smaller stature this instrument 
              should be placed high up on your list of worthy contenders. </span></p>
            <p><span class="body"> As estate agents say &#8211; "an early viewing 
              is highly recommended".</span></p>
