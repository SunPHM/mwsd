    <b>This is my first home built electric guitar. &nbsp;I wanted a high probability 
of success so I opted to buy a completed neck from <A HREF="http://www.stewmac.com/">Stewart MacDonald's</A>. &nbsp;Maybe next time I'll build my own. &nbsp;The body is a single piece of mahogany which I found in a local exotic wood shop for $25. &nbsp;The fretboard is rosewood. &nbsp;The bridge pickup is a Seymour Duncan JB model. &nbsp;The neck is a Seymour Duncan Jazz model.</b>
<br>
    <b>The body is finished with Tru-Oil gunstock finish which is a polymerized linseed oil. &nbsp;
It cures hard and can be built up into a thick finish, unlike raw or boiled linseed oil. &nbsp;
I applied it with a paper towel. &nbsp;About 5 coats with 0000 steel wool in between every other coat. &nbsp;Took about half of a 3 oz bottle. &nbsp;Total cost of finish.....$3.00. &nbsp;Cha-Ching!
<br>I was afraid that the guitar would be especially "dark" sounding due to what I've read 
about mahogany and rosewood, but it turns out it's not. 
It sure is fun playing a guitar you made yourself!</b>

   <b>I've included a close-up of the string ferrules as this part gave me a lot of trouble. &nbsp;
I ended up doing the inlay to cover up the first attempt. &nbsp;
Just had to show that I did finally get 
it right.</b>

<b>One year later I built a bass guitar. &nbsp;This one is made from Ash. &nbsp; Not swamp ash, just ash. &nbsp;Probably the kind a baseball bat would be made of. &nbsp;The color is Minwax Accents Stain, Hunter Green. &nbsp;I think it may be more of a dye than a stain, maybe a mixture of the two. &nbsp;There was no clumpy substance in the can that needed to be mixed in. &nbsp;Anyway, it was very easy to get a light even color but a bit more difficult to get it dark and even. &nbsp;I persisted and it turned out ok. &nbsp;
This one is also covered with Tru-Oil. &nbsp;4 or 5 coats. &nbsp;Nice and shiny although I didn't bother with filling the pores. &nbsp;Doesn't matter though because it looks just fine. &nbsp;Neck by Carvin. &nbsp;Still haven't wanted to tackle a neck. &nbsp;The pickup is a Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound. &nbsp; Since this picture was taken I've added a Quater Pound Jazz pickup also, along with a blend pot. &nbsp;The bass sounds great through my Nemesis 2-10 combo. &nbsp;

<b>My second bass is pictured below - completed in December of 2001. &nbsp; This one is also made of Ash. &nbsp; It's a bit lighter than the 4 string (thank goodness!). &nbsp; The neck is from an Ibanez SR-405 which someone let fall over. &nbsp; The truss rod popped through the back of the neck near the headstock, so they bought a new one. &nbsp; I was granted ownership of the broken neck - which I repaired and set on the shelf for a couple of years while I got up the courage to actually use it. &nbsp;
Anyway - I left this one natural colored, the finish is again Tru-Oil, purchased from the local Walmart. &nbsp; On my previous bass and guitar I just did a few coats and didn't bother to fill the pores fully. &nbsp; This created a problem on the bass - because my right hand thumbnail tended to get into wood a bit and was removing the finish and color, leaving exposed bits of wood. &nbsp;On this bass I used several coats in order to fill the pores on the front completely. &nbsp; Leveling the suface after each coat of finish has left a mirror smooth finish. &nbsp; Thin coats of Tru-0il - let them dry fully - and a nice finish you will have.<br>I couldn't really find passive pickups with pole pieces that would line up with the strings on this bass - so I went with the Active Soap Bar pickups from Seymour Duncan. &nbsp;I was initially unhappy with the sound of the bass - I was getting an annoying "thump" type of sound, especially on the A string. &nbsp; I finally figured out that it was my finger striking the open E string after plucking the A string that was causing the "thump" sound. &nbsp; I didn't have that problem on a four string bass, since my thumb would be resting on the E string in that situation. &nbsp; The problem was solved by restringing the bass with a high C string instead of the low B. &nbsp;Now I can play a somewhat annoying version of Blackbird. &nbsp;:)
