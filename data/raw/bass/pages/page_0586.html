<p align="left">PROGFEST? What in the hell is a &quot;Progfest&quot;? Almost by accident,
or perhaps it was luck, I was handed the fliers. I have lived here in Southern California
for more than ten years and never heard of this festival. My loss! For the uninitiated or
those to young to remember progressive music (the prog in Progfest) had its birth during
the late '60s and '70s with the emergence of bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, Emerson Lake and
Palmer (ELP), RUSH and older Genesis to name but a few. The music was characterized by
complex, almost orchestral themes that were often expressed over the course of entire
albums. Examples? Well, how about Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall,&quot; RUSH's &quot;By-tor
and the Snow Dog,&quot; &quot;2112,&quot; &quot;Cygnus X-1 Book 2&quot; or, more recently,
Dream Theater's &quot;Scene From a Memory.&quot; Progressive music was most popular during
my days of pitch-black bedrooms and WZMF in Milwaukee playing the entire album side of
&quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">But you can't stop the world from turning can you? For better or worse
those days are gone, but progressive music isn't. On September 1-2 bands from around the
world made La Mirada, California the veritable hub of technically diverse, sonically
mature and inescapably intense music.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008080"><strong>September 1st</strong></font></p>

<p align="left">First band up was <font color="#808000"><strong>Códice</strong></font>.
Hailing from Mexico, Códice was billed as one of the most promising up-and-coming
progressive rock bands playing today. Their debut CD, &quot;Alba y Ocaso,&quot; has
received rave reviews since its release a year ago. Their music weaves almost like an
orchestral piece with bursts of adrenaline followed by floating astral periods of calm.
The crowd was very quiet and sometimes struggled with knowing when to applaud. When there
is an obvious break it was met with a thunderous response. The music is instrumental with
the rare exception where a guest vocalist emerges on stage to sing what seemed like
fragmented lyrics. If you liked King Crimson or ELP you will enjoy this band.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="../images/Prog4.jpg" width="328" height="228" alt="Prog4.jpg (120287 bytes)" align="left"><font color="#808000"><strong>Kenso</strong></font>
was next. Kenso's music has more of a rock feel than Códice. They are much more
groove-orientated in their arrangements. Between each song, the guitar player would do his
best to speak with the audience, reading from a prepared text that attempted to explain as
much as entertain. From the press release, I knew that this was the first time that Kenso
had played America, but was surprised to learn from guitarist Yoshihisa Shimuzu that
&quot;this is the first time we have played anywhere outside of Japan.&quot; Utterly
remarkable when you consider the caliber of musicianship and that the band has been
together for more than 25 years. The music is passionate with a mixture of some serious
crunch and ballads. At the end of each piece the crowd was spontaneous with their
applause, frequently standing after many of the songs. Bassist Shunji Saegusa was
incredible. One of the best all-around players that I have ever seen. His remarkably fluid
runs are made even more astounding by his economy of motion -- making the difficult appear
effortless. </p>

<p align="left">Percussionist Masayuki Muraishi had a very natural jazz feel to his cymbal
work, while at the same time a ferocious hard rock attack to the skins. The guitarist and
bassist displayed extremely evolved exchanges of melody / counter-melody which allowed
much of the dynamic of each song. I was fortunate enough to speak with the Yoshihisa and
Shunji a couple of days after the show. The interview, perhaps their first one done in the
west, will be posted in our next update, Oct. 1st. Watch for it.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><strong>Transatlantic</strong></font> was the final
band of the evening. The set was very loose, very relaxed. The stage setup was unusual in
that Mike Portnoy's (Dream Theater) drums were stage left and facing toward the center of
the stage leaving us with a side perspective of him. Neal Morse and his keyboards were on
the opposing side of the stage. The two created a sense of&nbsp; bookends for the guitar
and bass players in the middle.<img src="../images/Key-Guitar-Bass.jpg" width="351" height="230" alt="Key-Guitar-Bass.jpg (50062 bytes)" align="right"></p>

<p align="left">Guitarist Roine Stolt was plagued the entire evening with low frequency
feedback problems through his monitor. To the extent that Morse commented that they were
in &quot;Transatlantic Hell&quot;. As true professionals, the show must go on and it did.
When music allowed, Stolt took every opportunity to adjust his monitor, a boot here. a
nudge there, eventually pushing it away from him and flipping it onto its side. Problem
solved! As for the show, in what has become almost a trademark with bands associated with
&nbsp; Portnoy there were musical surprises. This night they finished one Transatlantic
tune with an excursion through the Beatles' &quot;Magical Mystery Tour.&quot; After which
Morse commented, &quot;Well if you like that one I'm sure you'll recognize this.&quot; A
classic version of &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; followed.&nbsp; Bassist Pete Trewavas
demonstrated his musical ability by donning a Richenbacker doubleneck (bass and 12-string)
in, what for me, was a flashback to Geddy Lee and RUSH's &quot;2112&quot; days. Trewavas
stepped up to the mike to sing backup, play his doubleneck and occasionally work the bass
pedals while he played the 12-string. The press release has billed Transatlantic as a
&quot;super group&quot;. They could be nothing less. The musicianship speaks for itself.</p>

<p align="left">The day after the show, I ran into guitarist Roine Stolt. He was nice
enough to answer a few questions for DaBelly.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#008000">DaBelly</font></strong>: &quot;I wanted to
congratulate you on the show last night. It was amazing.&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;Thank you, we had fun.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;Transatlantic
hasn't played very many shows have you?&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;No, actually this is only the
seventh show we've played. The funny thing about that is we have only rehearsed as a band
twice!&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;You're
kidding, that's incredible!&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;Are there
thoughts of a tour?&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;No, nothing organized. It is
much to difficult for us to all be in the same place. We all have commitments to our other
bands.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#008000">DaBelly</font></strong>: &quot;Yes, I
understand.&quot;<img src="../images/Roine%20Stolt.jpg" alt="Roine Stolt.jpg (13581 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="264"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;How were the
sales of this CD, I mean did it sell as you had expected?&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;Actually the record company in
Europe was surprised with sales. The CD did better than expected and because of this we
have had offers to tour Europe. But as I have mentioned, previous commitments are what's
stopping us right now.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;Will there be
a follow on CD for Transatlantic?&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;Yes, we are committed to doing
another CD next year. We will keep working together as long as it remains fun.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;Who's idea
was it to form Transatlantic?&quot;<br>
<strong><font color="#800040">Stolt</font></strong>: &quot;It was Mike Portnoy's idea. He
wanted to put this band together so he called everyone up.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;I can't
believe how busy that guy is!&quot;<br>
<strong><font color="#800040">Stolt</font></strong>: &quot;Yeah, you should've seen him on
the bed last night after the show. He was exhausted. This morning he had to fly back to
New York.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#008000">DaBelly</font></strong>: &quot;Between Dream
Theater, Liquid Tension Experiment and Transatlantic he never stops.&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;He's doing drum clinics
too.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>DaBelly</strong></font>: &quot;Yes, I saw
that on his Web site. I believe he will be in Arizona, Michigan and California.&nbsp; I
want to thank you for your time. I look forward to seeing Transatlantic again.&quot;<br>
<font color="#800040"><strong>Stolt</strong></font>: &quot;Sure, anytime.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">Perhaps one of the most amazing things about Progfest is the audience
contact with the bands. It was not uncommon to find entire groups milling around the
lobby, chatting with all that would listen. This personal contact is what makes this
festival so special for many of the concert attendees.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#008080">September 2nd</font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><img src="../images/Prog6.jpg" width="321" height="275" alt="Prog6.jpg (134886 bytes)" align="left">Day two of Progfest and the first band up is
the Brazilian band <font color="#808000"><strong>Tempus Fugit</strong></font>. Like many
of the other bands on the bill, their music is mostly instrumental. The band has more of a
rock feel to their music; large sweeping melodies dominate the musical landscape. Tempus
Fugit's debut CD, &quot;Tales From a Forgotten World,&quot; was released in 1997, with a
follow-up CD, &quot;The Dawn After the Storm,&quot; coming out last year. I enjoyed this
band and hope to see them again.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#808000">Mona Lisa</font></strong> was the next band
on stage. This group was very unique, musically they seemed to be a straight-ahead rock
band, but their progressive nature was evident in performance. Mona Lisa opened the show
with the French national anthem; they appeared in the back of the auditorium and worked
their way through the crowd. After the band had made its way to the stage they were joined
by singer Dominique Le Guennec, dressed in an ogre or troll's mask and robes, carrying a
giant book. He brought it to the front of the stage and opened it. As smoke poured from
inside the book, Le Guennec was transformed back into human form and he began to sing.
Mona Lisa played a list of visually dramatic tunes that included several costume changes.
At the halfway point of the show, Le Guennec announced that the band wanted to share a
piece of their French culture with us and they served wine and cheese to the crowd. To say
the least the stage performance was entertaining and the audience showed its appreciation
at every opportunity.<img src="../images/Prog3.jpg" width="326" height="218" alt="Prog3.jpg (94835 bytes)" align="right"></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#808000">SUPERSISTER</font></strong> played an
unusual show. For me, this Dutch band was more background then anything else. Musically,
they were more like something I would hear in an elevator. They lacked the energy that I
enjoyed with many of the other bands on this two-day bill. Not my cup of tea, but
interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#808000"><strong>Banco</strong> (Del Mutuo Soccorso)</font>
was the final act of the festival. Their show was delayed for better than an hour as the
band endured the sound check from hell. Equipment failures (keyboards) as well as dead
microphones abounded. The vast majority of the Progfest patrons were left out in the lobby
as each of the sound check problems were eventually resolved, until the only thing left,
was for the crowd to take their seats. Banco plays a passionate blend of music that
incorporates the spectacular voice of Francesco Di Giacomo with that of complex musical
arrangements. For some 30 years this Italian band has filled each show with energy and
intensity. Their approach to music can be characterized by &quot;the finesse of classical
themes combined with the ferocity of rock.&quot; If you can; when you can. SEE THIS BAND!</p>

<p align="left">When all was said and done, I felt that KENSO stole the show this year. I
must admit that I was completely unfamiliar with this band before Progfest, but I walked
away a fan. They put together a set that brought a standing ovation after most of the
songs. They were absolutely incredible. I would like to thank the promoters of Progfest
for putting on a spectacular show. I look forward to next year.
