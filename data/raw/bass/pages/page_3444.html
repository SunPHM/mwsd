City of Dundalk (about 30,000 inhabitants) is the administrative centre of
County Louth, near the mouth of the Castletown River at Dundalk Bay. It has a
port that exports livestock, barley, and other crops.</font><font face="Tahoma,Comic Sans MS,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;</font><font size="1" face="Tahoma,Comic Sans MS,Arial,Helvetica"><br>
<br>
Industries include tobacco, clothing, shoe, and computer factories, distilleries
and breweries, flour and linen mills, fishing. Dundalk has facilities for the
manufacture and maintenance of railway equipment.<br>
<br>
The town was often besieged because of its strategic location at a natural pass
into Northern Ireland.</font></strong>
<p><strong><font size="1" face="Tahoma,Comic Sans MS,Arial,Helvetica">Monasterboice
monastery was founded by an obscure saint named Buite who died in 521. We know
that the monastery remained in existence up till 1122. The Vikings occupied it
until they were attacked by Domhnall, King of Tara, in 9687.&nbsp; The Cooley
Peninsula Forms the Lough's southern coast, a place of fresh green hillsides,
woodland, forest, mountains and myths.<br>

was the legendary home of the giant Finn M’Cool and the setting of Ulster’s
greatest saga, the Tain bo Cuailgne, an epic tale of the hero Cuchullain, the
Red Branch Knights of Ulster, wicked Queen Maebhe of Connaught and the mighty
Brown Bull of Cooley. The place whispers of thousands of years of civilisation
through the Long Woman’s Grave, the Proleek Dolmen of Ravensdale and the
Clontygora Court Graves of Omeath.</font></strong></p>

is one of Ireland's foremost medieval towns - a place of narrow streets and
castles, over-shadowed by mountains and lapped by the sea.<br>
<br>
The many historical buildings include the 12th century King John's Castle, the
fortified Dominican Abbey dating from 1305, The Mint and The Tholsel, a medieval
toll house, both dating from the 15th century.<br>

<br>
King John's Castle - 12th century.&nbsp; This early Norman fortress was named
after King John who visited Carlingford in 1210. The western portion of the
castle predates this visit and was probably commissioned by Hugh de Lacy around
1190.<br>
