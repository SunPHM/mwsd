    </p>
    <p>Constructive feedback is always welcome.</p>
    <h2>What's all this about?</h2>
    <p>These are my thoughts on bass sound shaping.</p>
    <p>
      You may ask yourself what the heck is that supposed to be and why is
      the guy so full of it that he creates this page about it? :)
    </p>
    <p>
      It's supposed to be a kind of a brain dump. A summary of what I've
      learned about bass sound shaping over the years so I can share it and
      discuss it with others interested in bass sound shaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bass sound shaping is the attempt to keep in mind as many factors
      that affect your bass sound as you can in order to control and shape
      the sound the way you want by minimizing the number of variables where
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I am a rather technical guy, please bear with me. Statements
      like &quot;it sounds killer&quot;, &quot;kicks ass&quot; or &quot;is
      way better than...&quot; without any explanation make me smile at best.
    </p>
    <h2>Where does bass sound shaping start?</h2>
    <p>
      It may not be so apparent, but there are quite a few things shaping
      bass sound and only some of them have to do with electronics.
    </p>
    <p>Factors affecting your bass sound before any amplifiers are involved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>bass instrument (materials used, mechanical features, fret board (length), no frets, etc.)</li>
      <li>strings (steel, nickel, old vs. new, gauge, flat wound, etc.)</li>
      <li>bass setup (action, octave, frets worn or OK (if any))</li>
      <li>playing technique (finger style, hard vs. soft, plectrum, thumb, slap, tapping, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Two basses from one vendor will often not sound the same since
      materials like wood come from mother nature and there is some
      inherent variation coming from that alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two sets of strings from the same vendor also may not sound exactly
      the same and over time their sound changes dramatically. You can
      either replace them regularly or wait till they are completely dead
      and won't change their sound at all. Great soul bassists did that,
      but it may not be everybody's cup of tea. It's not mine.
      One reason not to do that is dead strings don't tune well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another factor is that we don't play exactly the same every moment
      in our lives. Some days are better than others, some are not. After
      all we're humans, not robots. At least at the time of this writing
      this is a valid assumption. ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course your bass pickups and electronics will also shape the sound
      of your bass. The &quot;wars&quot; on &quot;passive vs. active&quot;
      are not over and probably will never be. Permutations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>passive pickups and passive electronics</li>
      <li>passive pickups and active electronics</li>
      <li>active pickups and passive electronics</li>
      <li>active pickups and active electronics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I've never seen active pickups combined with passive electronics before I
      purchased a <a href="http://www.zerberus-guitars.de/">Zerberus</a> Red-Shark
      on 2002-09-09. :)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are differences between single coil, double coil, humbucker and
      piezo pickups and what not but even within those categories sounds differ
      a lot. Since different people have very different tastes, we should
      consider us lucky that there is such a variety of basses, pickups,
      electronics, strings, etc. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally as soon as active components are built into your bass, you'll
      need at least a battery (some use two batteries or some alternative power
      supply). If you are too &quot;challenged&quot; to keep replacing them and
      removing the cable while you don't play, active basses are not for you.
      In this case I personally I think basses are not for you since it's folks
      like you who give us bass players a bad reputation. Just kidding. ;)
    </p>
    <h3>Why active electronics?</h3>
    <p>
      The only real drawback using active electronics in a bass I can think
      of is that your battery can go dead when you need it most, but many
      basses with active electronics allow some sort of a bypass in that
      event so you're not dead in the water even then. You can easily prevent
      this by <i>always</i> having a spare battery in your bass case or gig bag.
      We have to play by some rules... Here are some advantages using active
      electronics, which I'll explain below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>low output impedance</li>
      <li>high level output (at least in theory)</li>
      <li>cable quality has far less effect on sound</li>
      <li>bass and treble can be both attenuated and boosted (active sound controls), some active sound controls allow for even more sound tweaking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I don't really want to go into details as to why. Those people who are
      technically oriented already know those details and those who aren't most
      likely won't want to know or understand. Sorry, that's my experience.
      However both parties may be interested in knowing the effects rather than
      why that is so. After all you don't need to be able to construct and build
      a car to drive one. From time to time I may not be able to refrain from
      giving some technical background. I hope you won't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Low output impedance means you can feed your bass signal into a broader
      variety of inputs. Passive basses will always need a high impedance input
      like those in bass amps. An active bass however can be directly plugged
      into a mixing board without any pre-amp still sounding OK. And that's just
      for starters. If your bass needs a very high impedance input and is fed
      into a rather low impedance input it will affect your sound. Also cables will
      have more effect on your sound. It's better to have as few variables
      (components that can modify your sound) as possible in order to make your
      sound reproducible. If such trivial things like a cable can have a great
      impact on your sound it is not&nbsp; very likely you will ever have control
      over your sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A high output level helps to get high volumes and high signal/noise ratios.
      In other words less annoying noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cables have some properties which you can more or less ignore when active
      electronics are involved, but when everything is passive the choice of your
      cable between your bass and your amp may have a real great impact on your sound.
      Cheap/bad cables will kill your treble among other possible problems. Invest in
      quality cables in any case, especially with passive basses. I personally
      prefer active basses since I don't want to have to worry about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least it's of great help if you can effectively control your
      bass sound on your bass and not only on your amp. You don't really want to step
      back to your amp in a live environment to add or lower some bass or treble. On
      passive basses usually all you can do is to attenuate treble. Often that's just
      not enough. That's my opinion. Play your passive basses if you like. I won't
      talk you out of it. They can
      also sound just great. It's just more variables with those making it harder to
      keep the same sound. Then again this may not be your goal, anyway. ;)
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some active electronics are better than others. Some make a
      lot of noise, some change the sound in undesirable ways. Make sure
      that you get proper active electronics in order to really enjoy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you're settled on a type of bass and pickups, setup, type of
      strings and playing techniques, you got some level of control over
      your basic sound - hopefully.
    </p>
    <h2>What other factors are there?</h2>
    <p>Bass amplification systems in general are comprised of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pre-amp (impedance matching, boosting, sound control, sound processing)</li>
      <li>power amp (drive speaker cabinets)</li>
      <li>speaker cabinet</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: there can be more than one power amp and more than one speaker cabinet.</p>
    <p>
      Most pre-amps do more than impedance matching and boosting such as
      sound controls, compressor/limiter and probably other sound processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The components mentioned above can be combined in one box. Most so called
      &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tops&quot; are pre-amps combined with power amps,
      e. g. the Hartke 3500. Sometimes these tops are built into speaker cabinets
      which most people will call a combo such as the SWR Super Redhead. While
      they are rather compact, the tend to be very heavy. Having components in
      separate boxex allows for the greatest flexibility but you have to move
      around more boxes. Sometimes they are also more expensive. I personally
      think it's worth it.
    </p>
    <h2>We're plugged in. What next?</h2>
    <p>
      In order to describe my ideas about bass sound shaping I use a setup I
      used for quite a while as a reference starting with my pre-amp. My setup
      did the trick for me. It may not work for you. In any case it can help
      deliver my ideas which in turn hopefully inspires you. I'd love to hear
      from you if it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea behind my approach to bass sound shaping is that I try to keep
      the parts &quot;power amp&quot; and &quot;speaker cabinet&quot; as
      transparent/neutral/HiFi as possible. If I have to factor in amp and
      speaker sound coloration my experience is I will never get a reliable bass
      sound. My idea is to feed the PA through my DI a sound that could be
      recorded without having to process it much. Again I'm trying to keep the
      number of variables as low as possible. You may not like my sound but I
      don't get my sound by chance and if I wanted a different sound I have a
      good chance to &quot;dial it in&quot;. Choose a different sound if you
      will, but believe me it's good to be able to reproduce it.
    </p>
    <h3>Very low frequencies</h3>
    <p>
      Let's hope you're plugged into a high impedance input, especially if your
      bass has passive electronics. Now there are some amps that are supposed to
      go really, really low, such as 5 Hz. This sounds great at first but it's
      not really. How comes? The problem with that is, that's way below what humans
      can hear, what a bass should produce and bass speaker cabinets can reproduce.
      You will end up wasting a lot of amplifier power trying to reproduce something
      nobody can hear which leaves less headroom for your bass sound. We're talking
      live instrument amplification. Every bit of power counts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally all frequencies below your lowest note on your bass should
      be cut off since it will not help your sound and will only lower the
      maximum volume and sound quality you can achieve.
      How low are we talking about, then? Well, it depends on how your bass
      is tuned. Let's check out a number of rather popular tunings and see
      the lowest note they can produce:
    </p>
    <h3>Tuning and lowest notes</h3>
    <table border="0">
      <tr>
        <td class="Title" align="center"># of strings</td>
        <td class="Title">tuning</td>
        <td class="Title" align="right">lowest frequency</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">4</td>
        <td><b><font color="#FF0000">E</b>-A-D-G</font></b></td>
        <td align="right">41.2 Hz</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center">5 (6)</td>
        <td><b><font color="#FF0000">B</b>-E-A-D-G(-C)</font></b></td>
        <td align="right">30.9 Hz</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Some people even go down to the A below that be which results in 27.5 Hz.
      Let's assume standard 5-String tuning. In that case all frequencies below 30.9
      Hz will only eat up your amp's power and headroom, produce nothing but heat in
      your amps, speaker cables and speaker coils, not adding anything to your sound
      and lowering your maximum sound pressure. That is assuming you don't use
      octavers and such which can make your bass signal go even lower. In any case
      humans don't usually hear anything below 20 Hz. We hear that barely, some people
      notice frequencies down to 16 Hz. Most bass speaker cabs won't go much lower
      than 35 Hz (if your lucky). Many 4x10&quot; will not get even near that. Check
      out my <a href="basscabs.htm">bass speaker cabs overview</a>
      to learn more about that (and cry?).
    </p>
    <h3>First job for my pre-amp</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing a bass pre-amp should do is match the impedance from high
      to low. My pre-amp boosts the signal by factor 11 and cuts
      lows by 6 dB/octave using a 6.8 nF capacitor and a 1 M Ohm resistor. Usual RC rules apply which make this cut off
      frequency ca. 24 Hz (-6 dB). Since RF can be a problem, I've added some high
      frequency roll off as well using a 1 kOhm resistor and a 100 pF capacitor (not
      in the scheamtics, yet). So I have four functions in one little circuit:
      very high impedance input, low cut, RF protection and factor 11 boost with low output impedance. The output of this pre-amp is directly
      connected to a Behringer Ultra-Q PEQ 2200 mentioned below for sound control using 6.3 mm
      plugs. I might replace that with a simple sound control (three or four band)
      some time in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't want to mess with electronics yourself you can use ready to use
      devices such as BOSS CS-3, equalizers etc. Plain simple anything &quot;active&quot;
      that allows for direct connection to your bass and tolerates a low output impedance.
    </p>
    <h3>Isn't treble good?</h3>
    <p>The instrument is called bass, not treble. :)</p>
    <p>
      Of course this depends on the style you play and the sound you want, but the
      more treble is in your bass sound the less you will hear real lows. It's
      basically because we can hear higher frequencies better than lower ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you listen carefully to great recordings of basses, treble often is not the most
      dominant part. It may sound great alone but together with a band you may want
      to have rather little treble.
    </p>
    <h3>Sound Control</h3>
    <p>
      <img border="0" src="../../bitmap/Behringer-PEQ2200.jpg" width="500" height="119" alt="Behringer-PEQ2200.jpg"></p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.behringer.com/">Behringer</a>
      <a href="http://www.behringer.com/02_products/prodindex.cfm?id=PEQ2200&amp;lang=eng">Ultra-Q
      Pro PEQ2200</a>  can cut off highs with a low pass filter at 12 dB/octave if you want to. Which frequency? Well, it can be tuned from ca. 2.5 kHz to 30 kHz (off). In
      addition to that it has a high pass filter which can be tuned from 10 Hz to 400
      Hz which I have dialed into 25 Hz. Last but not least it offers a five band parametric EQ. Not just frequency and
      amount but also bandwidth can be tuned. Using this I can get many different
      sounds out of my basses. The output of the PEQ 2200 goes directly to a Behringer MDX
      2200 Gate/Compressor/Limiter shown below using an XLR cable. The Behringer PEQ 2200 fits nicely into 19&quot;
      racks and is rather affordable. If you don't like parametric EQs you can
      substitute it by a graphic EQ. Try to get one that has a low pass/high pass
      filter as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not build my own sound control? Well, I can't build this as cheap as the
      Chinese. Too much work (for me that is - you
      can try your luck). Then again I did some research. I might end up experimenting
      with a three or four band sound control. If it is any good, I'll let you know. :)
    </p>
    <h3>Compression</h3>
    <p><img border="0" src="../../bitmap/Behringer-MDX2200.jpg" width="500" height="117" alt="Behringer-MDX2200.jpg"></p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.behringer.com/">Behringer</a>
      <a href="http://www.behringer.com/02_products/prodindex.cfm?id=MDX2200&amp;lang=eng">Composer
      Pro MDX2200</a> offers a gate/expander, compressor and limiter function (two channels - I
      use only one). This device is great sounding and very flexible considering the price. It also fits nicely into 19&quot;
      racks. So far I have not found usable schematics for compressors, so bear with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Output signal levels at this stage are at +4 dB. One has to set threshold levels on the
      compressor accordingly. The XLR output of the Behringer MDX 2200 is directly connected to
      my Samson S1000 power amp using an XLR cable. Of course any good power amp can
      be used, you're not limited to any brand.
    </p>
    <h3>Pre-Amp OK, but when will I hear anything?</h3>
    <p>
      After the compressor output levels are setup to be between +4 dB and +10 dB (using
      a limiter) which is great
      to feed into a power amp as long as I run the amp's volume below -10 dB. Since the Behringer MDX 2200 also has a 6.3 mm output
      I can use that to go directly into another OP amp with
      1:1 amplification driving a 10:1 transformer which I use for my DI. The
      signal is low enough again since it's divided by factor 10 to avoid sound people from
      going crazy because of input overload and unwanted distortion. Also the signal
      is galvanically separated from the rest of your electronics (no hum and such).
      This is not a must, it just saves you from dragging around some DI box. However,
      I've never heared of a PA company not having a spare DI to connect you, so you
      may be very OK without that little gadget.
    </p>
    <h3>I just can't imagine it. Draw a picture?</h3>
    <p>Yeah, OK. Some people will prefer a picture, so why not:</p>
