        By Phil Junker</p>
        <p align="left"><br>
        Jim Raymer was fishing in Morse Reservoir north of
        Indianapolis for crappie. He and his long-time fishing
        partner, Rick Priebe had marked a number of fish at
        several locations with their fish locator. They headed
        back to the first school of fish they had marked, and
        Raymer started jigging for crappie. He quickly had a fish
        on. I thought I had a good crappie, but when I landed it,
        I thought it was a big yellow bass, said the Greenfield
        angler. But, Raymer also knew he had never seen one as
        big as the fish he landed. The fish he boated is a new
        Indiana state record, and also should be a world record.
        The fish weighed 2.95 pounds on the certified scales at
        the Marsh grocery in Greenfield. Raymer¹s fish topped
        the old state record of two pounds, four ounces, caught
        in 1977 by another Hoosier, Donald Stalker, who took his
        fish at Monroe Reservoir, near Bloomington. Stalker also
        owned the world record until early this year, when angler
        caught one that weighed two pounds, eight ounces. After
        catching the fish on Saturday, Nov. 4, he kept the fish
        alive over the weekend, and decided to take it to the DNR
        office at Martinsville for positive identification. When
        he (Raymer) called and said he had a big yellow bass that
        weighed nearly three pounds, I thought it probably was a
        hybrid striper, said DNR biologist Doug Keller. ³But,
        after I checked the fish scale, there was no doubt it was
        a yellow bass. Based on the scale sample, the fish
        appeared to be five and a half years old, and he said it
        had displayed rapid growth. A similar size white bass
        would be about seven years old, said Keller. The fish was
        16.7 inches long and had a girth of 12.7 inches.<br>
        ³It looked like a football with a small head,² said
        Raymer. It seems yellow bass hang around the same
        structure as crappie, and I¹ve caught a lot of them. But
        this one was so big, it just seemed to be
        disproportionate. I thought it was a yellow bass. It
        really looked yellow, and I wanted to make sure. Yellow
        bass are considered a nuisance by most anglers, because
        the fish usually are so small. Keller said a 10-inch
        yellow bass is a ³big one. I¹ve heard people say they
        are fine to eat. I don¹t know why they wouldn¹t be just
        like a largemouth. They just don¹t get much size, added
        Keller. Raymer agrees they are good eating. ³One time we
        were fishing at Kentucky Lake and the crappie weren¹t
        hitting, but we really got into a lot of yellow bass on a
        flat. They weighed about a half pound each. We filleted
        them, and they were almost as good eating as crappie, he
        said. He caught his record bass on a 1/16th ounce Mizmo
        orange and chartreuse jig. He had sprayed the jg with
        Kodiak fish scent, which he utilizes for crappie fishing,
        and was using a Sam Heaton signature B&amp;M crappie rod.
        These things become of interest when you catch a world
        record fish. He received word on Monday that the Indiana
        DNR has recognized his fish as a state record, and he has
        contacted the International Gamefish Association, and the
        Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame for forms to submit his
        catch for world record recognition. Raymer¹s record fish
        in his home freezer and waiting to be mounted. The DNR
        has asked to borrow it for display at next year¹s state
        fair,² he said. Raymer and Priebe, who lives in
        Morristown, have been fishing buddies for years, and have
        fished the Crappie USA tournament circuit the past six
        years. They won the crappie tournament at Patoka Lake
        this spring. </p>

        Jim Raymer of Greeenfield proudly displays his new <br>
        Indiana and possible world record yellow bass<br>
        caught at Morse Reservoir while fishing for crappie.</p>

        <p>Jim Raymer of Greenfield, Ind. knew he probably had a
        state record fish as soon as he pulled the big yellow
        bass from Morse Reservoir. But Raymer's fish not only
        clobbered the existing Indiana yellow bass size record,
        his catch also apparently shatters the existing 2-pound,
        9-ounce world record. <br>
        &gt; <br>
        On Nov. 4, Raymer hauled in a 2-pound, 15-ounce yellow
        bass while fishing for crappie at Morse Reservoir in
        Hamilton County. His catch measured 16.7-inches long and
        had a 12.7-inch girth. The fish bested the past state
        record by 11-ounces.<br>
        &gt; <br>
        Raymer was using an ultra-light spinning reel and rod
        with an artificial crappie tube bait. Raymer has 25 years
        of fishing experience and had previously caught yellow
        bass that weighed in the half-pound range. As soon as he
        realized what he had caught, he said to his fishing
        buddy, &quot;I think this might be a record fish.&quot;<br>
        &gt; <br>
        Raymer took his fish to the Greenfield Marsh grocery
        store where store employee Shannon Campbell weighed it
        for him on a state-certified scale. The scale required a
        product code before it would show the weight and print a
        receipt, so Cambell entered bananas to match the color of
        the yellow bass. The fish should be worth considerably
        more in bragging rights than the $1.74 banana price tag
        printed out on his receipt. Raymer then took the fish to
        Cikana State Fish Hatchery in Martinsville, Ind., where
        fisheries biologist Doug Keller verified the fish
        species.<br>
        &gt; <br>
        The current International Game Fish Association
        all-tackle sport fishing world record yellow bass is a
        2-pound, 9-ounce Duck River fish caught near Waverly,
        Tenn. Most yellow bass weigh mere ounces, but these
        scrappy little fighters are abundant in some waters and
        can provide hours of excitement on ultralight tackle. For
        many years, a 2-pound, 4-ounce Monroe Lake specimen was
        the world's largest officially documented yellow bass.<br>
        &gt; <br>
        Yellow bass (Morone mississippiensis) are true bass,
        related to white and striped bass. Yellow, white, and
        striped bass and white/striper hybrids (wipers) are
        easily confused. White bass have one patch of teeth on
        their tongue, while striped bass have two distinct
        patches of glossohyal teeth. Hybrids have two patches
        that are joined and yellow bass have no teeth patches on
        their tongue.<br>
