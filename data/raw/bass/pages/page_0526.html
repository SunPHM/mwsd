fished with your guide Steve Albaum on Friday, Oct. 1st. out of Clewiston. I
can't say enough about the wonderful day of fishing your guide provided. The way
Steve and Mark Shepard kept informing each other of where the fish were hitting
doubled my chances of finding fish. Although the overall number and size left me
a little disheartned it had nothing to do with your guides service. Steve was a
great fishing companion, teaching me and answering all my many questions.
Without a doubt my best day fishing ever. Thank you all so much! Mark Van

<p align="left"><font ptsize="10" face="arial,helvetica" size="1">About 4
weekends ago 3 friends and I rented two of your boats and guides to fish
Okeechobee. &nbsp;By best friend and his two younger brothers had contacted me
to say they would be passing through Ft. Lauderdale to deliver a furniture
shipment and wanted to stop by to spend some time with me. &nbsp;We all grew-up
fishing the Lakes, rivers and streams in the central NY area. &nbsp;We would
peddle bicycles for hours to get the best fishing and the competition between us
was high.<br>
<br>
Knowing I had only a few hours with them I had contacted your company and you
were able to accommodate us. They were very surprised when I told them we were
going bass fishing. This was a very special trip for us first of all because we
all had not been together at the same place for over 25 years. &nbsp;Secondly,
Jamie, the youngest of the three brother has been stricken by a terminal illness
and unfortunately we don't know how long he will be with us. &nbsp;As your
guides immediately put us on top of the big bass it was a great sight to see the
excitement in Jamie's as he pulled in one Bass after another. Your people were
able to provide my friends a memorable moment that will forever allow us to
reflect on a time when Jamie was not concerned about tomorrows, but the events
of that day and beating the rest of us in pulling the most bass and biggest bass
out of the water. &nbsp;As I said we are very competitive and we had made some
bets that day. &nbsp;Well, it was Jamie who pulled the most bass and the
biggest. &nbsp;So now we have another memory and that is listening to him
telling us how he &quot;Smoked&quot; us that day. &nbsp;Thank you for providing
my friends this memorable event.<br>

  my husband Jeff and son Jaryd went on with your guide service.&nbsp; They&nbsp;had
  to get up pretty early but to a true fisherman that is part of the excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
  Jeff returned and told us&nbsp;that he set two Lake records I wish I could
  have been&nbsp;on the boat to help him celebrate.&nbsp; He said he stuck his
  dismount, from the boat seat and into Lake Okeechobee, with perfection.&nbsp;
  &nbsp;And the second record of fastest self rescue from the Lake into the boat
  while my son Jaryd watched in amazement.&nbsp; What memories
  we will all have of this story.&nbsp; Jeff and Jaryd had an awesome time
  fishing&nbsp;including the stories that were told about the Lake
  and living in Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

  devastation that Florida is suffering from on the News.&nbsp; We have had
  earthquakes the last few days but nothing like you've all been put through
  lately.</font> <font size="1">Thanks again to you for the excellent customer

We had so much fun that we are planning&nbsp;
on booking a trip for next year. Maybe
this time I can catch a peacock bass.&nbsp; Please tell Mark that the tips he
gave James and I during the Everglades trip really paid off during our fall
season up here. We caught
<a href="images/9-16-2002_4_Art_Edsall_web.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/9-16-2002_4_Art_Edsall_web_small1.jpg" alt="9-16-2002 (4) Art Edsall web.jpg (45032 bytes)" width="100" height="65" align="right"></a>
bigger and better fish using the crank bait techniques
he showed us. We even caught an 8lb bass (at least I did) and a bunch of 5-6
pound fish the day after we got back from the trip. I think you got my dad
hooked on the G-Loomis rods and Shimano reels he got a GLX rod for X-mas and he
also ordered a Chronarch SF reel. I still don’t think that will help him catch
fish, but at least he looks like a pro.&nbsp; I still have yet to put the video
we made to CD but I plan on doing so soon and I will send you a copy if you
want. I think it would be funny to put the scene of my dad attempting to set a
hook on a fish up on the site as a blooper reel. The last day we didn’t catch
many big fish but the experience we gained is much more valuable then any fish I
could have caught. Hopefully one day I will be able to fish some tournaments
like you guys. Once again THANK YOU VERY MUCH for the fun time fishing and
heckling we had during our trip and we are defiantly looking forward to doing it
again. &nbsp;Good luck to yourself and Mark during this year tournaments and

I did want to send you a note to you that would possibly help anyone that
arrives at your web site looking for feedback on your guide service.&nbsp;I have to be honest with you as the group of my friends that fished with you
and your guides usually will get together one to two time per year just to fish, all over this continent.
The trip to Ft. Lauderdale and the North Miami area has turned out to be the best trip we have had in the last five
years.
<br>
Not only did we have a great time catching up to 70+ plus bass per boat
per day, in the Everglades, but the weather was awesome and the caliber of the guides and their equipment was very good.
Your team kept on fish throughout the three days and we enjoyed a grand time. My only regrets will be that the next trip will be measured against
this one and we will be hard pressed to top it!
<br>
Thanks Again for an Excellent Adventure!<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>
Dale Ames</font>

the photo show a weird date. Somehow it was screwed up. Please let me have and

Let me also tell you that both Laura and I enjoyed the day tremendously. I asked
you if you were the best guide when I booked the day, but I forgot to tell you
at the end of the day that you are indeed the best guide we have been with. Our
fishing trip to FL in general was great after we went with you. Laura caught a
sailfish 79&quot;, We caught big black-fin Tuna, Big Wahoo and on the flats I
got a nice Tarpon. Lots of other fish too, but this is the highlight.&nbsp;</font>

over the internet.&nbsp;Finally
we arrived after 20 hours of flying. But as a result we caught many big bass,
Why I mean "MANY", because we stopped counting. After fishing in
Florida we will never be satisfied with fishing in Japan. Someday we will go to
