Cool weather has finally arrived and the fall bass bite is breaking loose 
throughout our lakes and rivers here in northern California. The months of 
November and December offer up some of the most consistent fishing of the 
year as hordes of fish strap on their feed bags in preparation for the long, 
cold months winter.
<P>
When it comes to targeting big largemouth in the fall, Clear Lake has to be 
considered one of the top impoundments in the nation and no one knows this 
body of water better than bass fishing phenom Skeet Reese of Auburn, CA.
<P>
I had the opportunity to spend a day on Clear Lake with Reese on Sunday, 
October 26, the day after the final weigh-in of the Bassmaster Clear Lake 
Open. After watching the weigh-ins on Saturday, the vast majority of fish 
being brought to the scales were surprisingly small by Clear Lake standards 
and most five fish limits were running 6 to 10 pounds.

To be honest, I was afraid we might have trouble catching a decent fish for 
the article. Clear Lake had just been hammered for six straight days by 130 
of the top professional bass fishermen in the country and reason would have 
it that any fishing willing to bite had most likely been caught. 
<P>
Fortunately, Skeet managed a fourth place finish in the event and didn't 
seem concerned in the least about catching a few quality "picture" fish.
Reese has surged into the national spotlight in recent years and has to be 
considered one of the great success stories in professional bass fishing. 
<P>
"I've been fishing full time for six years now, but a lot of people don't 
realize it's taken me twenty years to get here," he explained. "Clear Lake 
is actually where it all began. I fished my first tournament here exactly 
twenty years ago at the age of 13."
<P>
Since the Bassmaster circuit arrived to the west coast, Reese has dominated 
Clear Lake events. In a total of four Opens and one Top 150 event, he has 
finished second three times and fourth twice. Include his win at the Western 
Bass Open in the fall of 2002 and Reese has taken home 4 boats, $20,000 in 
cash and a 200 hp Yamaha Outboard in the last six pro/ams he has fished 
here!
<P>
It was just after 6:00 am as we idled Reese's Champion 196 Elite out of the 
5 mph zone at the Library Park launch ramp in Lakeport. "We'll spend the day 
up here on the north end throwing reaction baits," said Reese. "I've got 
several areas that are producing fish on crankbaits and spinnerbaits."
<P>
According to Reese, fall is his favorite time to fish Clear Lake. "The fall 
bite can be just as awesome as the spring time bite and this is by far the 
best time of year to throw reaction baits," he explained. "The thing I love 
most about fall fishing on Clear Lake is you can pull a 20 to 30 pound bag 
off a single dock, even a single piling. You definitely need to cover a lot 
of water, but once you find the fish, there should be a bunch of em'."
<P>
We made a short run to a series of small creek channels and started working 
crankbaits in 1 to 5 feet of water. "The fish are stacked up in these 
ditches right now," said Reese. "Some are sitting in a foot or two of water 
on the points and I'm also catching a few fish in the center of the channels 
in four or five feet of water. Most of my early bites are coming off the 
points, then by late morning, the fish are moving out to the weed beds in 
deeper water."
<P><IMG SRC="images/120503c.jpg" WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="184" ALT="Crankbaits ready to go" align="left" HSPACE="7" VSPACE="7">
Reese started off with a Lucky Craft LV 100 lipless crankbait in the aurora 
craw pattern and I tied on a perch patterned Speed Trap. Reese had all his 
reaction baits rigged on a Lamiglas 705 SR rod with a Pfleuger Trion Reel 
and 17 pound Spider Line Super Mono XXX. "During the months of October and 
November, I typically fish lipless crankbaits in red and chartreuse 
patterns," said Reese. "Early in the season, I'll use 50 pound Spider Wire 
to rip the baits through the grass. Once the grass starts to thin out as it 
has now, I'll switch back to monofilament line."
<P>
As we made our way across the first point, Reese was burning his crankbait, 
firing it up against the shallow tules and retrieving it at a blistering 
pace. "I can see you like to fish fast," I said. "I'm at my best when I fish 
fast and make as many casts as possible. I can tell you right now, a big 
part of the reason I did well in the tournament this week is because I know 
I made more casts than any of my competitors," he replied.
<P>
While Skeet was working over the point, I made a cast in the center of the 
channel and started working my Speed Trap through the grass. At one point 
the bait broke free of the grass and my line suddenly went slack. I swung 
hard and immediately knew I was into a quality fish. After a few hard runs, 
I had our first fish of the day in the boat and it was just shy of four 
pounds. "Man I could have used that one yesterday," said Reese. "I lost all 
three quality fish I hooked during the day and came up four pounds short of 
a win. I lost two close to that size along with a much larger fish in the 
six to seven pound class."
<P>
Not five minutes later, we were working the next ditch and I hit another 
four pound class fish on the exact same cast. Just when I was starting 
entertaining the idea that I might outfish one of the best bass fishermen in 
the world, Skeet hit a 3 pounder on his Lucky Craft crankbait and proceeded 
to put the next five fish in the boat, crushing any thoughts I had of taking 
him to school on his home lake.
<P><IMG SRC="images/120503d.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="300" ALT="Reese's Clear Lake catch" align="right" HSPACE="7" VSPACE="7">
By 8:00 am, we had a solid 18 pound limit and took a little time out for an 
early morning photo shoot. "I should have known this was going to happen," 
he said in disgust. "All I needed was a little over 15 pounds to win $50,000 
yesterday and we catch it in less than two hours today." Of course I was 
elated knowing we had some quality fish for the article.
<P>
The bite dropped off after the photo shoot, but we managed to catch a fish 
every half hour or so and Reese never backed off on his frantic pace easily 
making two to three casts for every one of mine. To top off our day, Reese 
decided to hit one more creek channel near the County Park and we hit the 
Mother Lode bagging seven more fish from two to five pounds.
<P>
When asked how he managed to keep up such a pace for days on end, Reese 
replied, "I make a point of being in the gym running and lifting weights 
three to four days a week in the off season and I try to work out when I can 
while I'm on the road. I just look at it as part of the job and my 
performance definitely improves when I'm in good shape."
<P>
Reese averages 200 to 250 days a year on the road between fishing 
tournaments and fulfilling obligations to his sponsors. "The most 
challenging part of this job is being away from the family for three to four 
weeks at a time," he explained. This year will be especially tough since he 
and his wife Kim now have a 10 month old daughter, Lea Marie. "Believe me, 
this life isn't for everybody. Fortunately, I really enjoy traveling the 
country, seeing new places and fishing new bodies of water all the time."
<P>
So what is the key to Skeet's tremendous success? "I believe in fishing on 
instinct and running seasonal patterns," he explained. "Things change too 
much during the course of a tournament to simply rely on what you learned in 
pre-fish. A lot of guys will do great for a day or two fishing one spot, 
then they run out of fish. Fishing three and four day events takes most of 
the luck out of it and forces you to rely on your experience. You can read 
all you want and listen to the best fishermen in the world, but there's no 
substitute for spending time, and I mean years, on the water."
<P>
As for Clear Lake, Reese says the bite should only improve into the month of 
December. "As water temperatures continue to drop, the grass will die off 
and this will isolate fish on the hard cover, docks, rocks and tules and the 
bite can be tremendous. Stick to the lipless crankbaits and spinnerbaits 
until water temperatures drop into the low 50's. By mid to late December, 
the jerkbait bite will dominate until water temps drop into the mid 40's or 
the lake gets blown out by a big storm."
<P>
Reese also wanted to send out a big thanks to his sponsors; Champion Boats, 
Crown Royal, Mercury, Lucky Craft, Terminator, Lowrance, Minn Kota, 
Lamiglas, Flowmaster and Spider Line.
