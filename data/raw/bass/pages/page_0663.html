lots of fun and exciting entertainment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
you are like most anglers, it doesn't matter where you fish, just so long as
there is enough water to dangle a hook, line and bait in, with the hopes of
enticing a fish to bite!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One of our
favorite pastimes when we go to visit my parents in South Texas is to get dad,
John Barnes, and go over to the pond or the creek and spend a few quality hours
probing the waters for the ever elusive black bass.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">When
preparing for a fishing trip, no matter how big or how small, your success often<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>depends on how well you have planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After years of fishing ponds and creeks with dad, it becomes routinely
habit to gather certain items to throw into the tackle box for the trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of those items include: needle nose pliers, assorted hooks, weights
and soft plastic baits, small spinnerbaits, scissors, sun screen, bug spray,
bottled water and of course, my Skeeter hat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">As
pond and creek bass are pretty selective, colors for soft plastics are fairly
simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The water is stained, so
they seem to consistently want small baits in neutral colors with some form of
pumpkinseed as the primary color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
may vary as to preference for the day being either green, blue, or red flake
mixed in with the pumpkinseed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We've
tried other colors, but they always bite better on pumpkinseed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I've fished other ponds with dark, clear water and the primary colors are
usually darker such as black, blue, watermelon, red shad, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">When
selecting bait size for small water fishing, it has been my experience that pond
and creek bass want smaller baits than<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>we
use on the big man-made reservoirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
accommodate them, I usually select centipedes, small Zoom Trick worms, 4&quot;
ring worms, or 4-5&quot; lizards (all plastic).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only time we use live bait is when we're working a kids fishing
tournament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">After
gathering an assortment of soft plastics, I also throw in some small
spinnerbaits.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Blitz makes a spinnerbait called the Clown which is
great for pond fishing as well as the bigger reservoirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Norman and I have caught really big bass on this bait no
matter what lake we're fishing. Excalibur and Strike King also make a good bait
in the 1/8 to 1/4 oz. size, as well as the old H&amp;H spinnerbait, which<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>works really good with a yellow or chartreuse/yellow skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The H&amp;H will usually catch more fish, but they are generally smaller
in size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A Beetle Spin is a hard
bait to beat on these kinds of waters, especially in the yellow/orange color,
primarily because it looks like a natural food in small waters.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><img border="0" src="../misc_img/pond_bass1.jpg" alt="Creek and Pond Bass Fishing" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="243" height="309">In
addition to downsizing baits, you also have to downsize line and equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We prefer to use spinning gear so that we can cast under and around the
bushes and throw at angles rather than straight overhead casts typical of
traditional baitcasting equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most
ponds and creeks have quite a bit of underbrush, weeds, overhanging trees,
bushes, etc. as obstacles for the angler to get either the rod tip or line
tangled in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We prefer to use 8-10
pound test line in Bagley Silver Thread, Berkley Big Game or Stren lines.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Once
you've gathered all the equipment, how do you rig it for the most productive way
to fish these kinds of waters?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
lot of it is trial and error.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
keep trying different methods until you find something that works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On our particular pond, a favorite way to rig is with the mini Carolina
rig.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cut off about 12-14&quot; of
line to be used as a leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tie a
small barrel swivel to the line on the end connected to the rod, and<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>attach one end of the leader to the swivel, to the other end
of the leader, tie on a Gamakatsu 2/0 wide gap flippin hook or a size 1/0 wide
gap hook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Depending on the wind
conditions, you may or may not want to experiment using a split shot (you need
enough weight to get the bait to go down, but not so much weight that it mires
down in the muck on the bottom).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
you do need to use additional weight to get the bait to sink, place the split
shot on the line about ½-inch above the hook; or if you want the bait to float
up more to attract suspended fish, place the splitshot just above the swivel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Next rig up your plastic worm, Texas style, and your in business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When rigging a centipede, we like to use the Owner 1/0 riggin hook or a
1/0 light wire hook tied to our leader.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
the hook is so light, it lets the centipede float up off the bottom and tends to
trigger more aggressive strikes.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Depending
on the time of year and the conditions, you're likely to find the fish in
different places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the spring,
look for them on the shallow end of the pond, usually around some type of cover
such as laydowns, submerged trees, logjams, buckbrush, bushes, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Always make a point of fishing where the cover is on the pond or creek.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Other good areas are points, either on the sides or in front of the
point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, cuts and drains that
run into the pond, etc. are always likely places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Always spend a little extra time in these areas as you're very likely to
get bit!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the heat of the summer,
the bass are more likely to be suspended in the deeper water, although this is
not always the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just like on
the bigger reservoirs, during the summer the fish are likely to be more
aggressive in the early hours of the day and again later in the evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But most other times of the year the fish are slow to rise and get going,
so it's not critical to be on the pond at the crack of daylight!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">While
visiting my folks last weekend, a friend of dad's, Raffael Garcia, went with us
to the pond. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Raffael had never been
bass fishing, but he caught the first bass of the day on a small pumpkinseed
with blue flake Zoom Trick worm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad
caught the most; and, he caught them all on an H&amp;H spinnerbait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Almost every cast he caught a bass or had one knock the blades of the
spinnerbait as it was being reeled back to the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I caught the biggest bass on a Zoom Pumpkinseed red flake
Trick worm, with the fish going about 4-pounds or so.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We fished from a little after 7:00 a.m. until around 9:00
a.m. and dad must have caught at least a dozen or more bass on his H&amp;H
spinnerbait with the yellow skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
fished until the mosquitoes started carrying us off and the air just got to hot
and too still.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was time to head
back to the house for some of mom's wonderful biscuits with homemade dewberry
jam, bacon and eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What a way to
top off a great morning of fishing!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dad
couldn't recall when he had caught so many bass in such a short period of time,
but it tickled me to watch him reel fish after fish in and<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>holler for me to get the camera to take a quick photo before
we would gently release the fish back into the pond so it could be caught
another day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Remember,
not everyone starts out with a fancy rig like our Boots Follmar Marine Pro Staff
Skeeter with a big Yamaha 225 EFI engine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We've
each spent over twenty years in this sport competitively fishing and have
gradually worked our way into the bigger and finer boats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You don't have to be rich to fish, but you do have to have patience and a
strong desire to succeed and be willing to work at improving skills, techniques
and performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It's
always more fun to take along someone new to fishing and to share the experience
and the fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Introduce them to a
sport that will likely stay with them a lifetime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fishing is a great experience and the love of the sport should be passed
on from generation to generation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Till
next time, no matter where you're fishing, have fun, take pictures for the
memories; and remember to practice catch and release.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It just doesn't get any better than this, not even on the big waters!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
