described elsewhere on this webpage is much more of a real 
instrument which I recommend highly.

A SIMPLE PRACTICE INSTRUMENT FOR LEARNING TO PLAY THE DOUBLE-BASS

As a newcomer to the instrument, I'm trying to figure out how to 
play the double-bass (upright bass). Being as big as it is, I
found a need for a very simple practice instrument that could be
easily carried around, noodled with while relaxing on the sofa etc.

This article details the construction of such an instrument, which
was made in about two hours at the cost of a little more than a 
few dollars.

Although it plays an octave above (& it's string length is about 
half that of) a big string bass, it is very useful for working on 
runs, figuring out tunes etc. The "shortened fingering" is really 
no problem & very quickly the going back and forth between this 
thing & a real bass becomes second nature. I make it a point to 
use the same "fretting" fingers as on the big bass.

You might ask why not just practice using the bottom 4 strings on 
a guitar? I gave this a determined try, but it just seems akward & 
un-natural -- not to mention the inability to slide properly 
considering the guitar's frets. The practice instrument (dedicated 
to the purpose as it is) has none of these shortcomings.

Being a practice instrument, it was not intended that such an 
instrument necessarily sound great, but considering what the 
thing's made out of, it does not sound bad at all.

Normally for such purposes I use nylon monofilament weed-whip line 
for strings. In this case this line "thudded" too much so I 
instead used metal guitar strings which brightened up the tone 
considerably. It has a very pleasant tone using this configuration 
of strings:

- G  .012" plain steel, unwound
- D  .029" round-wound on steel
- A  .035" round-wound on steel
- E  .041" round-wound on steel

The "raspy sound" from using round-wound strings is negligable -- 
you can still slide nicely.


Materials needed include:

- A 7 1/4" diameter (or so) cookie-tin. These cookies are 
  particularily prevalent during the Christmas season at K-mart 
  and Wal-Mart, costing two or three dollars.
  
- A bit less than 7 1/4" diameter piece of 1/8" plywood. My 
  favorite source of this material is from old discarded doors. 
  Hobby shops sell or can order small pieces of this plywood for a
  few dollars.

- One strip of 3/4" thick, by 1 7/8" wide, by 27" long 
  hardwood. I had some oak laying around and that worked nicely.
  
- One half of a set of mandolin machine tuning heads, which can 
  cost as little as a few dollars.
  
- Guitar (or banjo) strings (see above)


The four flat-headed brads nearest the "nut-wire" serve to 
determine the string spacing (there are no grooves in the 
"nut-wire" as there would be in a conventional nut). They also 
serve to keep the strings pushed-down so that they pass solidly 
over the "nut-wire" without buzzing. Additional brads are inserted 
in the pegblock to "guide" any string that approaches the 
"nut-wire" at a "bad" angle (see diagram). A regular nut can
certainly be used instead of this brad affair.

Sand/shave the back-side of the neck to round it off some. I find 
that, given there are only 4 strings, the neck bottom need not be 
rounded much.

Whittle a bit off the right hand end of the neck so that it 
follows the inside contour of the cookie-tin diameter.

Other dimensions include: place the bridge so the edge closest to 
the tuning head is 2 5/8" from the right hand end of the 
instrument. The string length is somewhere around 20", nut to 
bridge - this is not at all critical. Actually I can't think of
anything that is critical in the overall construction of this
instrument.


                        COOKIE-TIN BODY

Using a utility knife, cut a disk out of the bottom of the 
cookie-tin. Leave only about a 3/16" "shelf" remaining around the 
entire perimeter of the bottom. This is the ledge upon which the 
plywood sound-board rests.

Cut a 1/8" plywood disk and sand/fit it's edges until it nicely 
"plugs into" the "shelf" described above. Drill several 3/4" 
diameter sound-holes in the plywood (stay away from the 
center-line where the neck will run) and then silicone glue the 
plywood disk into the shelf area.

Using a hefty utility knife, carefully cut a rectangular hole in 
the side of the cookie tin just big enough to pass the neck 
through. Locate this hole JUST inside the reinforcing rim that 
runs around the outside of the tin's bottom - so that only the 
thin metal need be cut.

Insert the neck through this rectangular cut until it hits the 
opposite side of the tin. Where the neck attaches here determines 
the string-heigth and fingering "action", so it deserves some 
thought. The best way to determine this is to "mock-up" a string 
(or carefully use a straight-edge) and fasten the neck-end to the 
cookie-tin so that there is just a bit over 3/8" clearance between 
the string and the fingerboard surface at the point where the neck 
disappears into the tin (at the high end of the fingerboard). Once 
this is determined, simply drill a pilot hole and insert a 1 1/2" 
long (or so) woodscrew through the tin and into the end of the 
neck. Leave about 1/4" to attach the strings to.

I keep the lid on for better rigidity. This seems to project the 
sound out the sound-holes better as well.

A scrap of wood, notched deep enough to keep the strings from 
popping out, makes the bridge. Space these notches so that the 
strings run parallel down the length of the neck. Glue the bridge 
down lightly to keep it from wandering.


                             TUNING

Tune the instrument one octave above that of a big double bass,
that is E-A-D-G (low to high).

PS: Although I used the word "practice" a number of times above, 
    I've never been really comfortable with that word -- conjures 
    up images of practicing my piano lessons as a kid. The 
    "practice" I'm getting at here is more the "diddling around", 
    semi-mindless tinkering with a run or tune -- all the while 
    becoming more familiar with the instrument & it's fingering as 
    a welcome by-product.
