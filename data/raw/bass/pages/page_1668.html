Itwas a cylindrical pipe with a single reed. The Celts had a similar instrumentmade of animal bone with seven finger holes.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Thechalumeau was developed by the 16th century. It had eight finger holesand two keys. This instrument became popular in Europe and was used inorchestras.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>JohnChristopher Denner modified the instrument in the late 1600's by addinga special key. It was also made in multiple parts.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Theinstrument was originally named the clarionet when this new chalumeau tookthe place of the clarion. The clarion was a type of trumpet that soundedsimilar.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Theclarionet only had one key. This made it difficult to play in tune in differentkey signatures. Extra joints which fit on the end were made to change thekey of the instrument itself. This let to the development of clarinetsin different keys.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Thebass clarinet was constructed by Gresner of Dresden in 1793. New modelswere produced with the addition of more keys. The improvements of the clarinetwere also applied to the bass clarinet.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Morekeys were added during the 18th century. The Boehm system of keys was addedto the clarinet in the 1840's. This is still used today.</font></font></font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><center><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+4>Description</font></font></font></center><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Theclarinet is 2 feet 2.25 inches long. It is in the key of B flat. The bassclarinet is 4 feet 6.25 inches long. It is one octave below the clarinet.Both have a cylindrical bore and are made of grenadilla wood or Africanblackwood.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Theclarinet is very versatile in the orchestra. This is from the three verydistinctive ranges it can produce. The lowest register is rich and hollowin sound. The middle register is smooth sounding. The upper register soundsthin and shrill. The bass clarinet has the similar versatility in lowerregisters.</font></font></font><center><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+4>SoundProduction</font></font></font></center><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Soundis produced by a single reed on a mouthpiece. The player drawing the lipsbetween the teeth into the mouth. The reed is against the lower lip. Theair is forced in at a high rate of pressure. The reed vibrates and setsthe column of air in motion.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Thereed is usually natural cane, but plastic or fiberglass has been used.The mouthpiece is of wood or ebonite. The reed is held to the mouthpieceby a metal ligature.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Thenotes are produced by changing the length of the tube. This is accomplishedthrough the use of keys. An open key permits air to escape the tube. Adepressed key causes the air to continue through the tubing. This lengthensthe air column.</font></font></font><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+2>Tohear the clarinet, press the play button.</font></font></font><br><embed src="clarinet.aif" width="70" height="20" controller="TRUE" autoplay="FALSE" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/indext.html"><p><a href="woodwind.66.html"><img SRC="partydots.jpg" BORDER=0 height=40 width=40></a><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ED181E"><font size=+1><a href="woodwind.66.html">ToWoodwind Family</a></font></font></font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</body></html>
