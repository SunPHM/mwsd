Ian Edmundson's bass has the power to turn heads and rearrange internal 
organs...&quot;</span></b></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">Most novice players buy copies of their 
favorite players' instruments. I started off buying a cheapish Avon copy of Jim 
Lea's souped up Gibson basses, and later on an excellent Aria ZZB, an 
Explorer-shaped imitation of John Entwistle's mighty Alembic. Both of these 
still give loyal service after around twenty years, by the way.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">As a Cheap Trick fan of many years, I was 
naturally greatly impressed by Tom Petersson's sound (and also his excellent but 
rarely mentioned replacement Jon Brandt.)&nbsp; I searched high and low for an 
8-string of any make (including an abortive trip to Edinburgh to try a slightly 
derelict Washburn) all to no avail. Much later I talked to a guy in a local band 
who owned a Hamer guitar and regarded himself as a bit of a rocket scientist 
when it came to guitars. He mentioned an 8 or 12-string on sale in Manchester. I 
finished work early the next day to go bass hunting.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">There it was, hanging innocently on the wall, 
its headstock covered in glittering machine heads. It was new, red, beautiful, 
and scarily expensive. The shop staff regarded it as an oddball gimmick. No one 
could get their head round it, as it takes time and effort to adjust your 
playing style to the different fingering and playing styles it imposes. I tried 
the Hamer through a rig similar to the one I use on stage - two Trace Elliot 
715s wired parallel. Once I'd decided they could handle its output, I went home 
to think seriously about parting with such a lot of money. I agonized over the 
cost with a couple of friends who advised me to grit my teeth and buy it as I 
would probably spend several years kicking myself. So I went back the next 
morning and returned significantly poorer but happier.</span></p>
<p align="left">
<span lang="en-us">That night my old band was working (in 
Rochdale, rock 'n' roll capital of the universe) and I took the bass with me. 
When I got it out from behind my rig and plugged it in, the reaction was 
unbelievable - dropped jaws and stares, and its been the same ever since. Once I 
had worked out how to compensate for the extra boom and clang and overtones that 
it gives off, it became a regular fixture in the menagerie of basses I take on 
stage (at least four), and I found a couple of songs to feature it on.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">
<img border="0" src="ian2.jpg" alt="ian2.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" width="250" height="357">The sound of the Hamer is quite unbelievable. 
The strings are grouped in threes. The thickest being the lower of each three 
when hitting a down stroke. The thinner strings are tuned an octave higher to it 
'that' sound. The active circuitry makes it louder too. Every harmonic I hit 
comes loud and very clear and in triplicate. With such an odd string 
arrangement, the player has to work harder to hold down all three strings at 
once. This is not the easiest thing to use for ultra-fast riffs, but it gets 
easier with practice. I have to use a pick, and slaps and pulls are out of the 
question!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">The Hamer is slightly neck heavy. It's 
obvious why when you look at the headstock! The machine heads are in stepped 
order to avoid confusion, and fortunately, they are extremely stable. There are 
two truss rods to stop those dreaded banana impressions and, despite the tension 
on the neck, the action is lower than on most quality 4-strings I've bought. The 
general weight is a bit on the heavy side, but I don't use it all the way 
through the set, so I can cope!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">If the guitarist's signal packs up, I am 
putting out a good enough wall of sound to fill the gap. My old drummer used to 
whine endlessly about the boom and volume. He asked me not to use the Hamer 
because the deep bass was on the verge of giving him mental problems. He decided 
I should put Tippex on the custom knurled knobs so I could see when I stepped 
the volume down! The very last time I played with him, I used the Hamer for two 
solid hours - on every song!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">My one and only gripe is that the Gs don't 
come out as loud and clear as the others. A guitar tech has suggested to me that 
it may have guitar pick-ups rather than bass pick-ups. If this were the case, I 
would be appalled at such a mistake on a bass of this quality and cost. A 
suggested solution is to replace the EMGs with a pair of Bartolini's, but this 
would be butchery in my humble opinion.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">To sum up, this is a dream of a bass to play. 
The sound I get from it is like nothing else. Other players just gawp at it. 
It's brightened up several deadly dull jam nights too! I would love to find the 
matching 4-string version to accompany this. It is a seriously sexy bass and, 
sorry, it is definitely not for sale!</span></p>
<p align="left"><span lang="en-us">If you ever see one of these basses, whether 
it's a 4, 8 or even 12-string, try it out and persevere with it a while. There's 
nothing like them. Thank you Tom Petersson for starting the ball rolling.</span></p>

Arrangement on a Fretless Hamer 12ver</font><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#66CCFF"><br>

</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The quest for a bigger sound in a three-piece rock band
led me to the 8 string bass, then ultimately to the 12ver. My 12ver is a <b>fretless</b>
Hamer B12L Chaparral in the Candy Blue finish, made for me in 1999. The neck has
no inlays or fret-lines whatsoever, and it‚s strung with the standard round
wound strings. And if being fretless isn‚t odd enough, it is also unusual in
that the string configuration is different than the vast majority of 12vers
encountered. This is quickly evident in the different positions of the large and
small tuning pegs versus the standard arrangement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The stereotypical response often given when people ask <i>„Why
are there 12 strings?‰</i> is that the sound is a lot fuller, and the extra
strings make it sound as though a bass and guitar are playing together. Yes, the
sound <i>is</i> fuller. But as to the bass / guitar connection, this is actually
only true in one <b><i>very</i></b> limited case, when the guitar line happens
to consist solely of individual notes played in unison with the bass. This
seldom happens in the real world. As such, the 12 string bass doesnŒt really
live up to this part of the stereotype at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There <b><i>is</i></b> a way to make this bass / guitar
connection come much closer to reality. By changing the arrangement of the low
and high octave strings, the 12 string bass can be converted into an instrument
that can play bass lines and guitar chords simultaneously and in their correct
octaves!<b> </b>This unorthodox string arrangement is seldom seen on a 12ver,
but in my opinion is the only „right‰<i> </i>way to string a 12 string bass.
When I talked with Kim Keller at Hamer in 1999 about stringing a bass this way,
I was told that two or three other 12vers had been strung this way in the last
decade or so. Without exception they had all been returned to the factory to be
restrung to the standard arrangement.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="Inverted.gif" alt="Inverted.gif" width="473" height="283" border="0"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Diagram A shows the standard 12ver string arrangement.
Looking at the instrument from the front and upright, the high-octave ŒE‚
strings would be to the left of the low-octave ŒE‚ string, and so on through
the rest of the strings. This is the same string arrangement used on 12 string
guitars, although obviously the guitars only have a single high-octave string
instead of the two high-octave strings found on a 12 string bass.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The alternative string arrangement in Diagram B, which I
call ŒInverted‚, simply reverses the positions of
the high and low octave strings within each note. This is the same string
arrangement that Rickenbacker uses on their 8 string basses. Rickenbacker made a
fretless 8 string bass for me in 1987 (which is the only fretless 8 string they
have ever made), and it was from this bass that I learned about this unorthodox
string configuration. Superficially this arrangement wouldn‚t seem to make any
difference in how the instrument would play or sound. Nevertheless, this
variation produces a very dramatic change in the entire nature of the
instrument and opens up many new musical possibilities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As an example, suppose that on a 12ver strung Inverted the
ŒD‚ and ŒG‚ strings are played. Use the thumb to mute the low ŒD‚
string. You are left with a low ŒG‚, the high ŒD‚ strings, and the high
ŒG‚ strings- A ŒG-Major‚ bar chord! If you were to try to play this same
chord on a standard 12ver, the low ŒD‚ string would be on the inside of this
group of strings, making muting the low ‚D‚ very difficult. Remember that
you‚ll need to mute the ‚E‚ and ‚A‚ strings with your thumb to keep
them from sounding, then wrap your finger around the neck and position it
precisely to mute only the low ŒDŒ while letting the rest of the strings
sound. Unless you‚re like ET and have long fingers that taper down nearly to
points, it isnŒt easy to do, especially when you‚re rockin‚ out in the
middle of a Cheap Trick<i> </i>tune!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img src="hamerfretless1.JPG" alt="hamerfretless1.JPG" width="204" height="428" hspace="6" border="0" align="left">The
Inverted configuration opens up so many chording possibilities that I haven‚t
even begun to discover them all. Take the bar chord in ‚G‚ previously
mentioned, continue to mute the low ŒD‚ string, and simply move up the neck.
You can now play any bar chord you want by playing these remaining five strings
with a single finger in a single position! Now drop down to the ŒA‚ string,
mute the low ŒA‚ with your thumb and also mute the ŒG‚ strings, and you‚ve
got a bar chord in ŒD‚, which is a note lower than the lowest chord a
standard 6 string guitar can play! Or instead of muting the ŒG‚ strings,
play the second fret ŒA‚ notes, and you‚ve got a bass note in ŒD‚ with
a ŒD‚ chord played as though on a 12 string guitar. Talk about a full sound!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I could give dozens more examples of specific chording 
techniques available using this inverted string configuration, but for the sake 
of brevity suffice it to say that I frequently play five or eight strings at any 
given time. I like to drone on a ŒD‚ chord, and just experiment with the 
variations available playing positions on the ŒG‚ string. Or play a steady 
pattern on the low ŒG‚ and add an arpeggio with the ŒG‚ bar chord. The 
possibilities are limited only by your imagination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There are a few idiosyncrasies when playing a fretless
12ver. Like any other fretless bass, it doesn‚t have the Œbite‚ to the
sound provided by the interaction of the strings with the frets. And every so
often the neck will have to be repaired due to the damage caused by the round
wound strings. The intonation becomes a lot trickier, particularly when playing
5 or 8 strings simultaneously. Add in the extra tension from these additional
strings, and at the end of the night my hands feel like they‚ve had a
tremendous workout! In terms of playing degree of difficulty, if this bass isn‚t
a Œ10‚, then it‚s really close to it!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The sound that this bass produces makes it all worthwhile!
It can do the slides and has the character of the fretless. It makes the big
sound of the 12ver. Plus it can play the chords of the 6 or 12-string guitar.
This is why I claim that this is the „right‰ way to string a 12ver. It can
do everything that a standard 12ver can do, plus a whole lot more! It really is
the perfect bass to fill up the sound in <span lang="en-us">a </span>three piece rock band!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF8000" face="Impact" size="5">Comparison of EMG 
and Lane Poor M3.5W Pickups in Hamer Chaparral B12L</font><font face="Arial"><strong><br>
<font size="4">Submitted by Kevin Macza <span lang="en-us">on</span> Nov<span lang="en-us">. 
10,</span> 2000</font></strong><br>
<br>
Both of my Hamer 12-strings came stock with&nbsp; EMG pickups: the B12S had EMG HBs while
the Chaparral came with EMG 35Ps.&nbsp; I only found out that I didn't like EMGs after
hearing basses with other types of pickups that had a tone that I preferred.&nbsp; The
first eye-opener was comparing my original 12-string (B12S) with a Hagstrom 8-string, and
finding that the Hagstrom had a much warmer, yet clearer sound.<br>
<br>
This led me to wonder about how the EMGs were transferring the tone of the bass, and what
it was that the Hagstrom pickups were doing that I liked better.&nbsp; After selling the
B12S, I decided to replace the EMG 35Ps in my Chaparral 12 with EMG 35DCs.&nbsp; The 35Ps
sounded thin and harsh, so I was hoping for a smoother, deeper sound, and the 35DCs were
better in this respect, however, they always had a harsh 4-5 kHz spike in their response
that made the 12-string sound abrasive, and they were still lacking in top end clarity and
low end depth.<br>
<br>
Enter Lane Poor....<span lang="en-us"> </span>I had heard a lot of good things about Lane Poor pickups, and decided to order a pair of
them to replace the EMGs.&nbsp; Originally I bought an M3.5W (wide aperture) and an
M3.5HB, for the neck and bridge position respectively.&nbsp; After having them installed
for a little while, I determined that the wide aperture (M3.5W) was the sound that I
wanted, so Lane was kind enough to send out a pair (I found the M3.5HB to be too dominant
in the low-mids for my taste).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I ended up with the M3.5W model in both
neck and bridge position.&nbsp; I found the wide aperture to give the closest to the
natural acoustic sound of the instrument of all the pickups that I have tried.&nbsp; For
the record, I have also tried Bartolinis, and while they are very warm sounding, they are
a little blanketed in the top end, and not as deep in the lows as the Lane Poors.<br>
<br>
Now, how do the Lane Poors compare to the EMGs?&nbsp; I think this is the important
question, as we all need to compare things to get a sense of what is better or worse.
&nbsp; I knew the EMGs weren't the sound I wanted, but I didn't know what the 12-string
would sound like with Lane Poors until I installed them.&nbsp; Well, it was a _world_ of
difference, so much so that I'll never use EMGs again, because they seem so lacking in
comparison.&nbsp; The resulting tone with the Lane Poors is so much more natural, and
rings with an open piano-like clarity and depth that sounds almost acoustic in nature.
&nbsp; By comparison, the stock EMGs seemed to choke the sound, and make it harsh and
middy, with a cardboard tone. (Yech!)&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind that a 12-string bass is a
unique instrument with it's broad frequency range, so the what I heard may be out of the
ordinary on &quot;normal&quot; basses, but I think that the extended range of Lane Poor
pickups nicely compliments and transfers the extended range of the 12-string bass to your
amplifier.<br>
<br>
With the LPs think wider, flatter frequency response, and a transparent reproduction of
the instrument.&nbsp; To me, every instrument with EMGs has that &quot;EMG&quot; sound:
sterile, processed, and _not_ natural.&nbsp; So, until I tried other pickups, I didn't
know how much I disliked the EMGs.&nbsp; I think most of us are the same way: We like
something until we find something else that we like better.&nbsp; From my experience, the
Lane Poor M3.5W pickups are the best best for clearly capturing the whole range of the
12-string bass sound.&nbsp; For any of you with Hamer 12-string basses, I highly recommend
yanking out the stock EMGs and replacing them with Lane Poor wide apertures. <br>
