            - Almost every guitar company is copying 30 or 40 year old designs, 
            which are not their own. I subscribe to the belief that you can't

            - The word &quot;tone-wood&quot; is a misnomer. I do not discriminate 
            against different species because I consider every piece of wood to 
            be a &quot;tone-wood&quot;. I do not reject wood and for bodies I 
            use almost any type, including wood with knots, insect or wormholes 
            and even rot, as long as its structurally sound. Some diseased wood 
            make for the most unique and interesting pieces. Some of the woods 
            chosen for the bodies are: Mahogany, Ash, Alder, Maple, Walnut, Oak, 
            Cherry, Korina and others. The necks are constructed from quarter 
            sawn or flat sawn maple or mahogany.</font><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

            AND ERGONOMICS</font></u></i></b> <font color="#C0C0C0">- My totally 
            original Z1 body shape besides being elegant was also designed to 
            be the most ergonomic and the best balanced shape you will ever play. 
            A computer did not arrive at the shape of this guitar. Instead I used 
            my 22 years of guitar playing experience to determine what feels good 
            and what doesn't; as simple as that.</font><br>
            <br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">THE TONE HOLE OPTION</font></u></i></b></font><font size="3" color="#C0C0C0"> 
            - One of the unique design features of the <i>Z-1</i> series is the 
            Body Tone Hole Option, which not only adds to the intricate beauty 
            of the guitar, but reduces the overall weight, changes the feel and 
            alters the resonance.</font><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            <br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">DYNAMIC ACTION NECK &#153;</font></u></i></b> 
            <font color="#C0C0C0">- Let's face it, playing fast on a guitar is 
            impressive and cool. My main goal is to make the necks as fast and 
            as effortless to play as possible. These necks are contoured in such 
            a way as to facilitate motion. The <i>Dynamic Action Neck&#153;</i> 
            is shaped to create a feel that induces movement of the hand up and 
            down the fingerboard. While some other necks slow your hand down and 
            make your playing sluggish, my necks will make your hand want to move, 
            instead of staying motionless. These necks actually make you play 
            faster. We all know that speed is not the only thing; it's everything 
            (just kidding).<br>
            </font><br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">FINGERBOARD AND SCALE LENGTH</font></u></i></b> 
            <font color="#C0C0C0">- The radiuses are quite flat, and I use all 
            popular as well as some uncommon scale lengths with a 1.75&quot; (45mm) 
            nut width. This is all designed to to make playing more comfortable 
            without that cramped feel.<br>
            </font><br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">INLAYS</font></u></i></b> <font color="#C0C0C0">- 
            I do not believe in fancy inlays. Inlays do not make a guitar play 
            or sound better. I use contrasting-color, wooden position markers 
            placed in a unique diagonal pattern. Not only is this simple and tasteful, 
            but the diagonal pattern enhances the look of action and speed.<br>
            </font><br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">NECK JOINT</font></u></i></b> <font color="#C0C0C0">- 
            I either glue-in or bolt-on the necks using a simplified neck joint 
            with heel-less construction; the simplest joint possible. The neck 
            pocket is much larger when compared to other guitars and therefore 
            much stronger and better at transmitting tone to the body. This contributes 
            to better sustain and a bigger sounding guitar.</font><br>
            <br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">COMPARTMENTALIZED CONTROL CAVITY</font></u></i></b> 
            <font color="#C0C0C0">- I carve out a cavity, which leaves more wood 
            in the guitar. My goal is to take away as little wood as possible 
            from the cavity and to leave the top of the guitar at the cavity as 
            thick as possible. This is why each pot and switch has its own individual 
            compartment within the main control cavity.</font><br>

            HEADSTOCK&#153; SHAPE</font></u></i></b></font><font size="3" color="#C0C0C0"> 
            - I use a very unique headstock shape which I call the <i><b>&quot;Samurai 
            Headstock&quot;</b> &#153;</i>. This shape - which is essentially 
            the continuation of the fingerboard - is a very compact design made 
            possible by the reverse stringing of the two outside tuners. It literally 
            is &quot;sharp&quot; looking and functional.</font><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            <font color="#FF0000"><br>
            </font></font><font size="3" color="#FF0000"><b><i><u>UNIPLANE, - 
            NO-TILT HEADSTOCK&#153; DESIGN</u></i></b></font><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"> 
            <font color="#C0C0C0">- This headstock design is a true innovation 
            in terms of tone transfer and strength. The headstock on my guitars 
            have no angle, they do not tilt back. This flat headstock design is 
            essentially a continuation of the neck itself. The grain of the neck 
            travels uninterrupted past the nut, into the headstock, to the end 
            of the guitar. This flat <i><b>&quot;Uniplane&quot;</b></i> headstock 
            is more &quot;alive&quot; in terms of resonance than a tilt-back design: 
            the strings create minimal down-pressure on the nut. Since the grain 
            of the neck is uncut and uninterrupted, it results in the strongest 
            headstock possible with virtually no chance of breakage.</font><br>
            <br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">DOUBLE ACTION TRUSSROD</font></u></i></b> 
            <font color="#C0C0C0">- I use a powerful double action rod, which 
            is made up of an active, and a passive rod. The adjustment nut is 
            accessed at the body end of the instrument. I do not want to compromise 
            the integrity of the headstock by drilling and removing any wood at 
            that end.</font><br>
            <br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">HARDWARE</font></u></i></b> <font color="#C0C0C0">- 
            The very best hardware is used from around the world in chrome, black 
            or gold finishes.<br>
            </font><br>
            <b><i><u><font size="3" color="#FF0000">NUT </font></u></i></b><u><font color="#CCCCCC"> 
            <i><b>&nbsp;ZACHAROID&#153; &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; </b></i></font></u><font color="#C0C0C0">- 
            I searched long and hard for a nut material, which will keep the guitar 
            in tune well and which is also great for tone. It would have been 
            easy to use a simple precut plastic or graphite nut like the ones 
            used by most other companies, but instead I wanted something better. 
            I feel that most nut materials - whatever fancy name they are given 
            - kill tone and some graphite-type nuts are actually not good for 
            tuning stability. My special nut is made of a certain material and 
            hand cut specifically to fit each individual guitar. I can't divulge 
            the actual material but this nut its great for tuning stability and 
            it also sounds wonderful. Called by one Zachary Guitar owner the &quot;Mission 
            Impossible&quot; nut because of its ability to keep the strings in 
            perfect tune after a half hour of insane whammy abuse.<br>
            </font><br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">FRETS</font></u></i></b></font><font size="3" color="#C0C0C0"> 
            - For guitars I either use super-jumbo (insanely wide and high bass 
            guitar frets) or tall medium width frets. The taller the fret, the 
            better the ability to bend strings and the wider the fret, the better 
            the sustain.<br>
            </font></p>
          <p><font size="3" color="#C0C0C0"><b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">PICKUPS</font></u></i></b> 
            - I do not pretend to be a pickup manufacturer. Therefore, I use pickups 
            from the experts; companies who specialize exclusively in pick up 
            design and manufacturing.</font><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            <br>
            <img src="zach4.jpg" alt="DiMarzio Pickups to Melt Your Amp or to Make it Weep"
    width="175" height="250" align="right" valign="TOP"> <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">ELECTRONICS</font></u></i></b></font><font size="3" color="#FF0000"> 
            </font><font size="3" color="#C0C0C0">- (Very versatile switching) 
            - As always, I want to keep things simple. This is why I keep pots 
            and switches to a bare minimum. The first thing I set out to do was 
            to eliminate that seldom-used tone pot and that troublesome toggle 
            switch. Instead, I use better quality mini switches which take up 
            much less space and are more accurate and reliable. Each pickup can 
            be used in single-coil or double-coil mode. This simple yet effective 
            switching makes use of the single and double coil capabilities of 
            each pickup, both individually and in combination. You will get a 
            great variety of real usable tone colors. These guitars are very versatile 
            for any style of playing, ranging from full overdrive, country picking 
            to mellow jazz. These instruments have all the great tonal variations 
            needed for any musical style.<br>
            </font><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">PICKUP PLACEMENT</font></u></i></b> 
            <font color="#C0C0C0">- Strategically placing the pickups in just 
            the right location in relation to the strings will determine the frequencies 
            which are picked up or canceled. I utilize this technique to get many 
            usable and interesting sounds out of the pickups when selected either 
            individually or together. My guitars will never sound muddy or dull 
            and the pickups will complement each other creating great new sound 
            possibilities and tone variations.<br>
            </font><br>
            <b><i><u><font color="#FF0000">FINISH</font></u></i></b> <font color="#C0C0C0">- 
            These guitars have a super fast and comfortable oil finish instead 
            of the thick plastic finishes, which are all too common these days 
            on most other guitars. I want to enable the player to feel the wood. 
            It is unfortunate that most players can't ever feel the wood of their 
            guitars. Since playing guitar is quite a sensual experience, the more 
            sensitivity the player has the better. Feeling the wood creates a 
            more intimate relationship between player and instrument. A heavy 
            finish will also dull a guitar's sound. Thick finishes can smother 
            the body's vibration and dampen its response, causing high-end loss 
            and general &quot;lifelessness&quot;. This is why I use a simple oil 
            resin finish to seal the wood while still allowing for that great 
            feel and excellent tone. The oil resin soaks into the wood where it 
            hardens and it does not build up on the surface of the instrument. 
            Some of my guitars receive a colored stain before the oiling process 
            which give the guitar an antique finish.</font></font></p>
