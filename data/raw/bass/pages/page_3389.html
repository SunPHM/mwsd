Salad</font></i></p>
<p><font size="3">A little effort goes a long way.  Sea Bass is a good firm fish and lends itself well to this style of cooking.  This recipe is for 2 people.<br>
</font><img border="0" src="seabass.jpg" width="430" height="301" align="right"><font size="3"><br>
2 Sea Bass Fillets<br>
2 - 3 Medium Chilli Peppers Chopped into Matchsticks<br>
2 Garlic Cloves Chopped<br>
7 Floz of Double Cream<br>
1 Glass Good Dry White Wine<br>
1 Teaspoon Brown Sugar<br>
2 Portions Short Leave Salad<br>
10 Cherry Tomatoes<br>
2 Tablespoon Finely Chopped Parsley Leaves<br>
4 - 5 Chives<br>
Paprika Powder<br>
Olive Oil<br>
Sea Salt and Fresh Ground Black Pepper<br>
4 - 5 Brazil Roughly Chopped.<br>
Small Bunch Coriander Leaves<br>
1 Teaspoon White Wine Vinegar<br>
<br>
OK, preheat your oven to gas mark 6 or equivalent.<br>
<br>
Coat the fish with a little olive oil and then sprinkle on some sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste.  Now of the side of the fish that will be served facing upwards, sprinkle on a little paprika.  Put to one side.<br>
<br>
In a saucepan, add a little olive oil and heat until starting to smoke.  Now add the Chilli peppers and chopped brazil nuts.  Do not stir too often; allow the chilli to get slightly burnt at the edges!  After about one minute remove from heat.  Remove the chilli and nuts from the pan and put to one side.<br>
<br>
Chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters and remove the skin from 2 of the chopped tomatoes.  Put to one side.<br>
<br>
Start heating an ovenproof griddle pan (if you have one) to quite hot.  Otherwise a good frying pan...but not so hot.<br>
<br>
In the same pan that you cooked the chilli and nuts, add if required a touch more olive oil.  Heat and add the garlic, skinned tomatoes and grind in some black pepper.  Cook until the tomatoes have gone soft and have started to break down.  Reduce the heat a little and add the wine.  Allow the wine to reduce to 1/3.<br>
<br>
Whilst the wine in the pan is reducing, reduce the amount of wine in the bottle by drinking a glass or two.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Start to prepare the salad by adding the now cooled chilli and nuts, coriander leaves, 1/2 tablespoon chopped parsley, tomatoes, a little olive oil, white wine vinegar and salt and pepper.  Mix well with your hands....much more fun that way and taste to ensure the flavor balance is right.<br>
<br>
When the wine in the pan has reduced, remove from the heat and add the remaining parsley.<br>
<br>
Put the sea bass "face down" onto the griddle pan or frying pan.  Do not move the fish, otherwise it will stick, I know that sounds bizarre!<br>
<br>
Cook on a high heat for 8 - 10 minutes.  Now transfer into the oven for 10-15 minutes baking.  If you have got ovenproof pans, then just leave the fish on the pan where you cooked it on the hob (if you can do this all the better).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Start to re-warm the wine sauce and add the cream. Heat gently and add the sugar and a little salt.<br>
<br>
When the fish is cooked, serve it on the salad, dress with the warm wine and cream sauce and garnish with the chive chopped and another sprinkle of paprika.<br>
<br>
Open a fresh bottle of wine, cos the last one should be empty by now.</font></p>
