<p><span class="norm"><img src="images/capt.jpg" alt="Capt. Randy is just waiting to guide you to the Trophy lunkers." width="129" height="144" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">Hello 
Friends, I'm Captain Randy Camps and I'll be your guide for one heck of a darn 
good bass fishing trip. Whether we're out trying to bust that Lunker of a lifetime 
or just plain catching plenty of mean Florida black bass. I'll do everything in 
my power to ensure you have a successful and enjoyable trip. I've been bass bust-n 
for most of my life and I'm a full time local guide. No bull and no hype, and 
when it comes to knowing how to catch bass in these parts I'm the real deal.<br>
<br>
Realistically fish don't slam the baits everyday, and knowing where, when, and 
about how many will bite helps ensure a great trip. Big Bad &quot;TROPHY BASS&quot; 
are possible everyday!<br>
I'll use every advantage to make that Florida dream of a trophy fish come true. 
My goal is to meet your needs and deliver that lunker of a lifetime. Providing 
you with a safe and enjoyable fishing trip is a top priority. Check out the lunker 
gallery and picture yourself catching that trophy fish you've dreamed about. When 
the lunkers won't bite there is plenty of ACTION catching high quality bass in 
the 3 to 8 pound range. <br>
<br>
Live wild golden shiners produce the biggest fish; artificial 
bait action tends to be the most challenging.<br>
When I'm not out chasing Trophy fish, I enjoy teaching beginners how to use artificial 
bait's to catch bass. You will learn the basics from top to bottom and catch your 
first bass using artificial baits. No hassle and no pressure. Just using basic 
techniques that every beginner can apply and have success with. Check out &quot;our 
daily rates page&quot; for an affordable rate for a day out on the water learning to catch 
Bass. Ladies, Gentleman, Young and old everyone can learn to enjoy the great sport 
of bass fishing. <br>
<br>
You can expect to fish with top of the line spinning gear or bait casters if you 
prefer. The big bad lean mean fishing machine is always kept clean and in perfect 
running order. Fishing with 2 guests and a guide is very comfortable. A third 
guest will usually get in the way if you are using artificial bait and it is not 
recommended. Live wild shiner fishing with 3 guests is permissible yet it can 
get crowded. A single guest gets pampered and is the preferred way to fish.</span></p>
<p class="norm">Give me a call and reserve your Florida Trophy bass fishing adventure
today! Pack your bag's friend and bring your sunglasses, hat, rain gear, and
fishing license. We are off on a fishing adventure full of good times and lots
of Bass Bust-n action that you won't soon forget. Let's go fishing!<br>

<br>
<span class="norm"><img src="images/bass_aboutus2.jpg" alt="Capt Randy Bustin Some Bass!" width="123" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Top quality freshwater fishing rods and reels are used. The 
Spinning outfits are lightweight yet strong and work well for most anglers. Bait 
casters are available and in general are for the more experienced angler. Shimano, 
St. Croix, and ALLSTAR rods and reels make for extremely reliable and trouble 
free operation. Super Pro Monofilament, Fire line, triple fish, and Gorilla braid 
make for extra tough lines that can turn those lunkers your way.<br>
 <br>
30 pound SEAGUAR Leader keeps them hooked up and coming to the boat. Artificial 
baits are provided on all artificial fishing trips at no extra charge. Rods and 
reels are pre-spooled with the correct line for proper presentation and quick 
clips are used for easy bait selection. You will have an excellent selection of 
baits to choose from. We fish out of 3 tackle boxes marked Rattletraps, Top water, 
and crank baits. All Spinner baits, worms and flukes are separated into separate 
containers.</span></p>
<p><span class="header">Things You Need To Bring</span><br>
<br>
<span class="norm">It's Florida and the sun will fry you into a crispy critter, 
cloudy or not, if you are not prepared. At the Top of the list are Sunscreen, 
sunglasses, and a hat. Next you need a current fishing license. Finally rain gear. 
Rain can come at anytime! Generally during the winter months lighting is not associated 
with these storm cells and it is possible to fish through each cell. A nice pair 
of soft sole shoes will fill out the list and make for a comfortable day. Everyone 
who plans on fishing should come with a great attitude and be prepared to have 
a Marvelous time relaxing and Catching BASS! <br>
Life's too short Let's have fun! </span><br>
