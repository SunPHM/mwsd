        <b>Hello all you fishermen and welcome to the Carolina Princess update. 
        I usually like to tell you all the exciting fishing news from the last 
        month, which I shall, but first I'd like to share with you and get your 
        opinion of something that is coming up, in fact has very much already 
        come up, that you from North Carolina can do something about. If fact, 
        even those of you from outside of North Carolina may be able to help 
        with. I'm talking about of course the salt water fishing license. I am 
        VERY, VERY much against this and you should be also. <br>
        <br>
        This, in my opinion is just another tax. Don't you fell that you are 
        taxed enough already? This tax will never add ONE, not ONE fish back to 
        the water. In fact why should you have to buy a 10-15 dollar license to 
        fish one or two days a year? <br>
        <br>
        Tourism is North Carolinas second largest industry. Salt water fishing 
        plays a major part in this. The fishing business has already been 
        crippled by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the South Atlantic 
        Fisheries Management Council and now North Carolina has intentions of 
        making it even harder for you the fishing public to keep fishing. North 
        Carolinians and non North Carolinians do not need this useless financial 
        abuse. <br>
        <br>
        We already have, as those of you know very many regulations on fishing. 
        There is talk of season closures of some species and total closures on 
        others already. Am I against regulation on the fish? No, I'm not and 
        with the exception of the red porgy (silver snapper) I don't have a 
        problem with what is already in place. A lot of my passengers do but I 
        don't. <br>
        <br>
        North Carolina has already hurt its tourist business with its school 
        schedule. We now start school in mid summer and don't get out till 
        almost the second week in June. I wonder how much tax revenue is lost 
        because of that, and now you the fisherman are being asked to pay for 
        that short fall under the guise of a fishing license. This of course is 
        my personal opinion and I think it's a lot of bull crap. <br>
        <br>
        I appreciate every person that fishes with us on the Carolina Princess. 
        You do so much more than buy a ticket on by boat which I'm sorry to say 
        is expensive by head boat standards but necessary in order for me to 
        keep operating. You also buy gas here, you eat in our restaurants, and 
        you sleep in out motels, and spend monies, all State taxable monies in 
        our many shopping places. I thank you for it buy enough is enough. Where 
        on earth would you buy a fishing license at 4:30 in the morning in the 
        first place? I'm sure there are some state employees that start work 
        that early. I just don't know any. Please call our state senators and 
        representatives, and those of you from out of North Carolina can call 
        them also and let them know you do not support this license. Call the 
        representative and senator in your district. Those of you from outside 
        of North Carolina can call State Senator Scott Thomas at 919-733-6275 
        and Jean Preston at 919-733-5706 or Lt. Governor Beverly Perdue at 
        919-733-6248. Thank you very much for your help. <br>
        <br>
        Getting back to fishing - the first part of August was pretty rough 
        weather but we sailed just about every day and still done some partly 
        fair fishing. The last part of August was great weather and even better 
        fishing. Good catches of trigger fish and large red snappers also some 
        nice sized vermilion snapper showing up. <br>
        <br>
        We are finished with our 1/2 day trips for the 2003 season but the 
        Monday and Wednesday stand up sport fishing trips are starting so don't 
        forget to make your reservation to catch giant Wahoo this fall. Dolphin 
        and a few tuna are still around and so far it has lots of hot sailfish 
        action. As always call at any time for fishing information or 
        reservations either on the Carolina Princess or for a private charter 
        boat. </b></p>
