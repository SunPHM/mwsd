          <p>Spinnerbaits, worms, jigs or crankbaits? When it comes to bass 
          fishing, the angler has a wide range of baits to choose from, 
          oftentimes too many. If you're like me, you buy every new lure and 
          gizmo that comes on the market, causing tackle boxes to bulge, and 
          wallets to shrink. There is, however, a bait that is still relatively 
          new on the scene, and often under-utilized, yet produces bass of 
          braggin' proportions. That lure is the soft plastic jerk, and it's the 
          one bait I reach for when I want guaranteed results. Although this 
          lure resembles nothing more than a lump of plastic to the naked eye, 
          put it in the fish's world, and watch it dance and shimmy seductively, 
          and proceed to ring the dinner bell loudly. By using the following 
          techniques and tactics, knowing where to throw the bait, and by being 
          willing to try something new, your bass angling success will increase 
          greatly, and isn't that what every one of us is trying to accomplish?
          </p>
          <p><strong>What's a Plastic Jerk?</strong></p>
          <p>The plastic jerk comes in basically two forms: one that resembles 
          an earthworm, such as the Berkley &quot;Power Floatworm&quot;; or one that 
          resembles more of a baitfish, like the Kalin's &quot;Super Floozy&quot;. All 
          range in length between five and seven-inches, and most on the market 
          use hand-poured plastic, although there is a difference between 
          texture and suppleness between different brands. Most are quite narrow 
          on the tail end, (in order to impart more action), and about twice the 
          thickness on the front end. Quite a simple looking bait, but in the 
          hands of an angler, can become a genuine bass slayer.</p>
          <p><strong>Where to Throw a Jerk</strong></p>
          <p>Dawn and early morning periods will often find bass cruising the 
          shallows in search of food. If the day remains overcast or rainy, bass 
          may spend the entire day in the shallows, while remaining quite 
          active. It's during these periods that a plastic jerk really shines.</p>
          <p>Early morning will find me slowly working the shoreline area, 
          looking to intercept hungry bass. What you're basically looking for is 
          water in the one to four-foot-depth, with some type of weed cover 
          present. Largemouth bass are very much a weed-orientated fish, and 
          will use vegetation in order to conceal themselves, and ambush prey. 
          Look for inside weedlines, or irregular weed patches, just something 
          different that might hold a fish. Instead of fishing a large area of 
          lily pads, concentrate on isolated patches, or any pads away from the 
          main group. Bass like to key in on cover that is a little different 
          from the rest, and understanding and utilizing this knowledge, will 
          pay big dividends. </p>
          <p>Another dynamite spot to fish plastic jerks is in, and around, 
          docks and moored boats. Largemouth will seek shelter under these 
          objects, and there's nothing more appetizing to a bass than to see a 
          life-like plastic jerk, shimmying and darting lazily by.</p>
          <p>If the sun comes up, or you are starting to find the shallows 
          devoid of largemouth, then move out to deeper water, and start fishing 
          the flats. Basically, flats are the first area beyond the shallows 
          that are generally uniform in depth and weed cover. Depths can range 
          from three feet to 10 feet, yet since this presentation is relatively 
          shallow, it is best to concentrate on water less than eight feet deep.
          </p>
          <p>Over the last few years, I have discovered how tremendous this lure 
          can be on the smallmouth bass population. Again, sticking to the 
          shallows is your best bet, as long as there is rocks, boulders and a 
          bit of weed thrown in. A technique I started using last year was 
          actually sight fishing for smallmouth in the shallows. I would cruise 
          around using my electric motor, and with the aid of my polarized 
          fishing glasses, would actually spot fish first before throwing a bait 
          to them. I would then either cast, or pitch, a plastic jerk to the 
          spotted fish, and work the bait by him to entice a strike. Depending 
          on the mood of the fish, they will either smash the bait the minute it 
          comes into view, or slowly swim up to it to suck it in. Either way, 
          it's a different dimension to fishing that elicits a lot of 
          excitement, due to its visual nature, and &quot;cat and mouse&quot; strategy.</p>
          <p><strong>Tackle</strong></p>
          <p>The majority of my fishing with soft plastic jerks is done with 
          spinning gear, as I've found that this is the easiest tackle to throw 
          these baits on, and also seems to suit this fishing style best. My 
          personal preference is a medium-action, six-to-six-and-a-half-foot 
          rod, with a fairly fast tip, yet lots of backbone. The fast tip helps 
          you cast these fairly light baits out farther, and the added backbone 
          helps greatly in hooksets, and landing these hard-fighting fish. I 
          will usually match this up with eight or ten-pound-test monofiliment, 
          depending on water clarity, or cover being fished.</p>
          <p>There are times when I'll reach for a baitcaster, but only under 
          certain conditions. If I'm faced with extremely heavy cover, or if I'm 
          fishing docks or wood cover in very stained water, then I've found 
          that the baitcaster can be an added advantage. It allows the use of 
          heavier pound test line, and a stouter rod, in order to combat the 
          added cover. Spool up with twelve to seventeen-pound-test-line, and 
          remember to make adjustments to your cast control, in order to throw 
          these lighter baits. Some baits, such as the &quot;Big Gun&quot;, or the &quot;Sluggo&quot;, 
          are no problem to throw on baitcasting gear, however, the Berkley 
          &quot;Power Floatworm&quot;, may give you some trouble. Try the different baits 
          available on the different setups, and see which you find easiest to 
          work with, and the most comfortable to fish with. There is some debate 
          over which are the best colours to use, and again, its best to let the 
          fish dictate what they want. Fishing plastic jerks is a sight game 90% 
          of the time, so it is best to choose colours that will be visible from 
          far away. Bright yellow, pink and white are my top choices, yet if I'm 
          fishing extremely clear water, and the fish seem spooky, then I may 
          change to a more natural colour, such as grey, black or smoke. Try 
          different clour combinations and see which ones work best for you.</p>
          <p>The rigging of a soft plastic jerk is very straightforward and 
          easy. My number one choice is an Owner offset worm hook, in either the 
          4/0 or 5/0 size, depending on the size of the bait being used. I very 
          rarely use weight with these rigs, since I like to have a very slow 
          and subtle drop. Depending on the cover you are faced with, you have 
          the choice to either texas-rig the bait, or else leave the hook 
          exposed. If fishing around heavy cover or docks, I usually find it 
          best to make the bait weedless, although the heaviness of the cover, 
          will be the ultimate deciding factor.</p>
          <p><strong>Techniques and Tactics</strong></p>
          <p>The soft plastic jerk is a lifeless bait in the water, relying on 
          the angler to impart the action. There are many different varieties of 
          retrieves, and it's best to try different kinds until you connect with 
          a fish. Try using a high-speed retrieve with short jerks, mixed with 
          pauses. If this doesn't pay off, change to a&nbsp; slow retrieve with long 
          sidearm jerks. I have found that my most effective presentation, when 
          fishing boats and docks, is to cast out and just let the bait slowly 
          sink and flutter to the bottom. This &quot;easy meal&quot; seems almost 
          irresistible to most bass, and there's nothing easier in fishing, than 
          casting out and doing nothing.</p>
          <p>I can't stress how important it is to wear a quality pair of 
          polarized fishing glasses when using plastic jerks. Keeping your bait 
          in sight at all times will help you see what the bait is doing, and 
          whether a fish is close by, or already has it. Bass are notorious for 
          grabbing your bait, and swimming off with it, often times without you 
          knowing it. By maintaining eye contact, you will be able to spot these 
          &quot;light-hitting&quot; fish, and can react with a positive hook set.</p>
          <p>By taking the time to discover this new bait, and the techniques 
          needed to fish it effectively, you will be on your way to becoming a 
          more proficient bass angler. Fishermen will never stop buying every 
          new lure that comes on the market, but hopefully by discovering this 
          &quot;secret&quot; bait, bass fishing will become less of a guessing game, and 
          more of a guaranteed result.</td>
