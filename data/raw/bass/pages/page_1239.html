<H1>The Electric Bass (Guitar)</H1>

<P>I've been playing bass for about nine years. Currently, I play for
fun with a group of friends in our band, <I>The Good Thing.
</I>Here's a photo of me with my newest toy:

ALIGN=bottom></A>

<P>(Click for a bigger version).  The instrument is an NS Upright,
designed by Ned Steinberger.  Information
<A HREF="#NSUpright">below</A>.

<P>Over the past few years, I've managed to collect quite a few bass
guitars. A few years ago, I decided to sit them all down for a family
portrait:<BR>

<IMG SRC="FamilyPortrait.jpg" WIDTH=387 HEIGHT=261 ALIGN=bottom>

<P>From left to right, they are:<BR>

o A
<A HREF="http://www.gibson.com/products/steinberger/steinberger.html">Steinberger</A>
XL-2 (pre-Gibson), modified with active electronics and a DB
bridge.<BR>

o A <A HREF="http://www.ssdbass.com/ns.html">Spector NS-2</A>
(pre-Kramer) four-string fretted, built by
<A HREF="http://www.ssdbass.com">Stuart Spector</A>.<BR>

o A Spector NS-5 (post-Kramer, #079) five-string fretted. (now
sold)<BR>

o A Spector NS-2 (pre-Kramer) four-string fretless. (now sold)<BR>

o A Zon Legacy Elite I fretless, custom, built for me by
<A HREF="http://www.cruzio.com/~gvm/zon.html">Zon Guitars</A> of
Redwood City, California.<BR>

o A Washburn 8-string fretted. (now sold)<BR>



<P>The Steinberger was my first "real" bass, and it's a great one.
It's basically indestructable (it's all-composite), and it sounds
good! It was designed by Ned Steinberger, and has won several design
awards. It even fits in the overhead bin on an airliner!

<P>Although I enjoy the Steinberger, the Spector NS-2 was my first
true love (it was also designed by <U>N</U>ed <U>S</U>teinberger!).
My friend Paul Boutin got me hooked on Spectors when I was in college
by lending me his for a day, and when I saw the white bass in a music
store, I bought it! (I went to the music store to buy strings. Well,
the Spector did have strings...)

<P>I bought the five-string about three years ago, and the fretless
at around the same time. Since then, though, I decided that, with my
<A HREF="#MTD">new MTD</A> and my Zon fretlesses, I couldn't justify
having the 5-string or fretless Spectors any more. So, they've been
sold to new owners, and I hope they're getting more use than I was
able to give them!

<P>Here's a closer look at the three Spectors, before they parted
ways:<BR>

<P>Here are two pictures of me with two of my main basses. On the
left, the Zon fretless. On the right, the Spector NS-2.

<P>(By the way, the four photos above (not the one of the upright)
were taken with an Apple QuickTake 100 digital camera. Antique!)

<P><A NAME="MTD"></A>Here's my new bass, the MTD 535:

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="Bass/MTD.jpg" WIDTH=211 HEIGHT=435

<P>I think the MTD has usurped the Spector NS-2's title as my
favorite bass. It doesn't have the cool curved back, but the sound is
just as good, it slaps just as well, and it has five strings! What a
beauty!

<P>Arriving last year was a new Zon Sonus V-1 five-string fretless!
[pic to come!] I ordered this bass custom with a figured top, and the
wood ended up being from the mango tree! Unlike my Legacy Elite, the
Sonus has a bolt-on neck and a phenolic-impregnated wood fingerboard.
This gives the bass its own distinctive tone which is really great
for rock!

<P><FONT COLOR="#AF0000"><A NAME="NSUpright"></A>News flash! 
</FONT>In with the new year came a new challenge.  I bought an
<A HREF="http://www.nedsteinberger.com/dbass/dbass1.html">electric
<I>upright</I> bass</A>.  Also designed by Ned Steinberger (do you
sense a pattern?), this bass is pretty damned radical.   Looks like
it's time for a new family portrait!

<P>Sometime soon, I'll also take the camera and get some pics of my
band, "The Good Thing".
