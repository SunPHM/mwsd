<p>Aside from creating the solid foundation upon which any percussion ensemble rests, the
bass drums also add that necessary punch that makes a musical piece pulse with rhythm.</p>

<p>The Cal Bass Drums have a directly vital role in the Cal Band, often serving, from a
performance perspective, as the leaders of the Band. For instance, at basketball games
and other Straw Hat Band (SHB) performances, the Cal Band marches into the show area in
typically a single-file line, with the bass drums leading in the front; in fact, the cue that
signals entry into an SHB performance is the "click-off," which is a set of four clicks
done by the leading bass drummer. Also, before the Band rushes out of North Tunnel,
they are called to attention, and then shout out the North Tunnel Yell, which is always
initiated by a bass drummer raising his or her mallets. (The yell goes, "Sticks up! Pick
up your heels! Turn your corners square! And, Drive! Drive! Drive!") These are only a couple
of examples of many important Cal Bass Drum traditions, and only a narrow look at how
important they really are to the Band. Because bass drummers
are so integral to any Cal Band performance, a certain level of experience, proper attitude,
and skill is required. As such, by tradition that is very rarely broken, it is required that every Cal Bass Drum be an oldman (that is, a member of the Cal Band who has marched at least one
season).</p>

<p>Also, because of the unique role that Cal Bass Drums have in the Band and in the
percussion section, we do <i>not</i> use multi-tonal bass drums, with the exception of Spring Drumline performances. Many Cal Band performances
will have, at most, one or two bass drummers, and because of what the Band requires of them,
each bass drummer must be on equal footing and have the same repertorial knowledge
as the rest; therefore, mono-tonal bass drums are essential.</p>

<p>The Cal Bass Drums carry the insignia of the University visibly in front of them,
and carry with them the pride and confidence which come along with that responsibility.</p>
