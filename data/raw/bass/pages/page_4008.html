The  history  of  the  Covenanters  is  one  of  persecution, execution and  imprisonment in  a  wide  variety  of  local  prisons  especially  in  Glasgow,  Leith and  Edinburgh  in  the  "Tolbooths".  <P>

After  the  battle  of  Bothwell  Brigg  on June 22, 1679, there  was  the  infamous  incarceration  of  prisoners  in  the  Greyfriars Kirkyard where  prisoners were poorly  cared  for and many  died  during  months  of  imprisonment  in  the  open  air  without  shelter.  There  are  two  particularly  desolate  places  where  many  of  the  leaders  of  the  Covenanters  were  held, these  being  the  Bass  Rock and  Dunnottar  castle.
<p>
The  Bass  Rock  lies  about three miles off  the  North  Berwick  coast  although  it  looks  closer, and is  opposite  the  ancient castle  of  Tantallon .  Today  it  is  a  well  known  sea  bird  sanctuary  with  a  large  colony  of  gannets but  it  has  a  much  darker  past  as  a  singularly  desolate  prison  for  many  of  the  Covenanter  leaders  between  1673  and  1687.
<p>
The  island  at  one  time  belonged  to  Sir  Andrew  Ramsay  who  sold  it  to  John  Lauderdale, Secretary  of  State  for  Scotland  for  £4000. Lauderdale  had  it  turned  into  a  prison  which  was  to  house  39  Covenanters  in  extremely  tough  conditions.

The  Bass  Rock  is  itself   only  about  three  quarters  of  a  mile  in  circumference  with  sheer  cliffs  on  three  sides, on  the  fourth  is  a  narrow  and  dangerous  landing  point.  Even  on  calm  days  the  seas  swell  and  roll  round  the  island  with  a dangerous  tidal  flow  between  it  and  the  mainland -  not  a  place  to  attempt  escape by swimming   On  the  island , once  a  retreat  for  a  Welsh  monk  in  the  seventh  century, there  was  little  shelter  until  the  building  of  the  prison  quarters  and  a  Governor's  house, which  in  heavy seas  would  be  awash.
<p>
Some  of  the  cells  had  only  one  small  window  which  was  out  of  reach  of  the  prisoner  who  was  therefore unable  to  view  the  outside. Other  cells  looked  only  upon  a  paved  walkway  where  the  soldiers  stood  guard.  There  was,  too,  a  dark, dank  dungeon - the  Black  Hole.
<p>
Into  the  Bass  were  cast  many  of  the  more  troublesome  Covenanters  for  periods  ranging  from  a  few  months  to  six  years including :

Dunottar  Castle, now  a  ruin, is  near  Stonehaven and  about  15  miles  south  of  Aberdeen.   Built  on  an  outcrop of  sandstone  that  juts  out  into  the  sea  it  has  a  rugged  beauty and in its  day  was  a  fearsome  stronghold. It  is  thought  that   St  Ninian  had  been  here  in  the  5th century  and  the  castle  was  besieged  by  William  Wallace  in  1297  when  he  burned  the  English  garrison  alive  in  the  castle  church. Later  in 1336  Edward  III  seized  it  and  held  it  for  a  few  months  and  in  1645 it  withstood  siege  by  the  Marquis  of  Montrose.  
<p>
The  castle  is  remembered  as  the  stronghold  in  which  the  <A HREF="honoursofscot.html">Scottish  Crown  Jewels</A>  were  held  for  safe  custody. The  garrison  of  69 men  with  some  42  guns  withstood  assault  by  Cromwell's   troops  for  eight  months  in 1651.  But  the  Regalia  had  been  smuggled   to safety  by  lowering  them  in a basket to a  servant  woman  apparently  gathering  seaweed  on  the  shore,  who  took  them  to  the  parish  church  of  Kinneff  a few  miles  away  where  they  remained  hidden  below  the  floorboards  until the  Restoration  in  1660.
<p>
Dunnottar's  place  in  Covenanter  history  is  from  its  use  as  a  prison  in  1685 for  122  men  and  45  women.  In particular  they  were  thrown  into  the "Whigs  Vault",  which  was  a room about  55 ft long , 15.1/2 ft wide  and  12 ft  high  with  two  tiny  barred  windows.  Here  they  were  packed  so  tight  that  they  could  not  sit,  lean or lie  down  and  many  of them died .
<p>
The incarceration of the Covenanters  in Dunnottar  stemmed  from  fears  that  a  rescue  attempt  might  be  made when the  Duke  of  Argyll  arrived  from  Holland  with  troops.  So  it  was  that  224  Covenanters  from  the  Tolbooth prisons in  Edinburgh  were  hurried  away  in  May  1685.   Of  these  some 36  men  and  4  women  were  able  to  convince  the  authorities  that  they  were  not  dangerous  and  were  returned  to  Edinburgh.  Of  the  remainder,  some  escaped  and  others  died  on  the  march  through  Fife  and  Forfar  to  their  prison  in  the  dungeons  of  Dunnottar Castle.

The  cell  was  described  as  cramped  without  room  to  sit  down , the  floor  ankle  deep  in  mire, and  little  fresh  air  to breath. Their  keep  was  rudimentary  and  they  were  even  forced  to  pay  for  water  to  drink.  Forty  of  the  Covenanters  were  later transferred  to  a  deep  dungeon, and  some  relief  was  afforded  the  women  who  were  allotted  two  rooms  to  themselves. 
<p>
There  was  an  attempt  by  25  of  the  prisoners  to  escape  by  descending  the  steep  cliff overhanging  the  sea  but  in  their  feeble  condition  15  of  their  number  were  soon  recaptured. Despite  their  poor  condition  the  escapees  were  lashed  to  low  benches  and  tortured  for  three  hours by placing burning  slivers  of  wood  between  their  fingers.  For  some,  this  treatment  was  too  much and  they  lost  fingers  or  subsequently  died  from  their  injuries.

Among  those  cast  into  Dunnottar  were:

After  the  danger  of  insurrection  had  passed  the  prisoners  were  released  from  Dunnottar  and  30 men  and  seven  women  took  the  Oath  of  Allegiance.  The  remainder,  who  refused  to  take the oath, were  transported  to  America.
<p>
 In  Dunnottar  Kirkyard  there  is  a  simple  memorial commemorating  those  who  died  in  the  dungeons  of  Dunnottar  Castle and  in  an  attempted escape:
<I><blockquote>Here lyes John Stot, James  Atchison, James Russell & William  Broun and one whose name wee have not gotten and two women whose names also wee know not and two who perished comeing doune the rock one whose name was James Watson the other not known who all died prisoners in Dunnottar Castle Anno 1685  for their adherence to the word of God and Scotlands Covenanted work of  Reformation.    Rev 11. Ch 12 Verse</I></blockquote>
<p>
It is  thought  that  the  four  missing  names  from  the 
inscription  are  John  Whyte, William  Breadie,  Mary  Gibson  and  Jean 
Muffet.  Of  historical  interest  is  that this  stone  was 
created  by  Robert  Paterson, " Old  Mortality "  of   <A HREF="famscots/waltscottmain.html">Sir Walter  Scott's</A>
 novel, whom he met  there  while  the  work  was  being  done.<P>
