<P>WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Good news for seafood lovers: there's new evidence
that seafood is good for your heart, and just a little seafood may go a
long way.  According to a new study, people who ate just one serving of
fish a week dramatically reduced their chances of cardiac arrest.  A
study on the subject involving more than 800 people in the Seattle area
was published in this week's Journal of the American Medical
Association.</P>

<P>"[The test subjects] had an approximately 50 percent reduction in their
risk of cardiac arrest, compared to persons who didn't eat any
seafood," said Dr. David Siscovick of the University of Washington.</P>

<P>Researchers at the University of Washington compared the diets and
blood of the people in the study and found that those who ate moderate
amounts of seafood rich in what are called Omega-3 fatty acids had a 50
percent to 70 percent reduction in their risk of a cardiac arrest
compared with those who ate little or no seafood.</P>

<P>Salmon, albacore tuna, herring, mackerel, sea bass, oysters, and
mussels are all seafoods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids.</P>

<P>Cardiac arrest is a condition in which the heart suddenly stops
pumping.  It's not clear how Omega-3 fatty acids protect the heart. 
They may make the blood less likely to clot and block the blood flow to
the heart, or they may reduce the irregular electrical rhythms of the
heart that result in cardiac arrest.</P>

<P>Researchers recommend that people include the above types of fish in
their diet once or twice a week.

However, the researchers' findings do
not suggest that eating more seafood than that is beneficial.  In fact,
a recent Harvard study found that those who ate fish at least six times
a week were no less likely to suffer a heart attack than those who ate
fish only a couple of times a month.  "We really didn't see that
wolfing it down made a great benefit," said Dr. Walter Willett of the
Harvard School of Public Health.</P>


<P>Most health experts also do not recommend taking fish oil pills because
most of the evidence for fish's benefits come from studies on fish in
the diet, not pills.  In addition, the pills may have side effects.</P>
