<p><p>In reading my archives to prove a point to Christopher, I realized that readership has gone way down. I am not writing this for myself - I got bored with that a long time ago. So what do I do?</p>

<p>Do I go back to writing <a href="http://tangerine.prerecorded.net/2004_01.shtml#002378">gibberish</a>? Do I <a href="http://tangerine.prerecorded.net/2003_10.shtml#001261">start picking fights with words again</a>? Or should I just <a href="http://tangerine.prerecorded.net/2003_09.shtml#001207">get angry and make short posts that tell you to go fuck yourself</a>?</p>

<p>CLEARLY none of this has worked, ever. And I am also not posting any more free music because nobody even noticed.</p>

<div class=inset><h2><a name="002478"></a>WEEKEND</h2>

<p><p>This was the kind of weekend that was productive AND entertaining. I'm telling you, good times.</p>

<p>Saturday began with my lying in bed for two hours, drifting in and out of a dream that I'm pretty sure involved having Room 29 in my basement, and afros. Then I headed over to ye olde Hunterwells' house to work on our science video which, I must say, is awesome. The gorilla quotient is high.</p>

<p>Acadamia out of the way, we went to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It was perfect - acting-wise, story-wise, cinematography-wise. Jim Carrey pulled off a very non-Jim-Carrey performance and Kate Winslett was pretty cool as Clementine (who was an obvious shout-out to me. Clementine... Tangerine...?) It's the best movie I've seen in quite a while.</p>

<p>Then I went to Chapters and Diana sold me a John Lennon book. ON SALE.</p>

<p>Today, I woke up to my cat's incessant whining at my door. After about 45 minutes of "meow meow I am so cute so let me in!" I relented and he pranced in and made himself a pain in the ass until I finally got up and kicked him out again. Then my parents dragged me to their secret mall walking cult - I don't want to get into it. Finally, I headed over to the Chris's house and we had a Macbeth project party, + <a href="http://www.rutles.org/">The Rutles</a> and The Cure.</p>

<p>On a less "this is what I did today!" note, I hear Cecilia Zhang was found - albeit dead - in Missisauga. I cannot put into words how much that sucks, so I suppose "arr!" will have to suffice. All the kids are putting X's in front of their MSN names, and I suppose that is a fitting tribute... kind of.</p>

<div class=inset><h2><a name="002476"></a>EXCELLENT</h2>

<p><p>Yesterday was, by some fault of my own, Eighties Day. And by some, I mean all.</p>

<p>First of all, I made my second terrible eighties CD on Thursday night, and so was listening to it in Computer Science. Then Jenn was listening, and Mr. Anandarajan walked by and noticed the brightly coloured case. He started reading all the songs off it and got really, hilariously, excited.</p>

<p>"VAN HALEN'S JUMP! And... WHITESNAKE!"</p>

<p>At this point he started singing and doing a bit of air guitar. Mr. A. is clearly the coolest ever.</p>

<p>Later at Amnesty letter writing we listened to more synthesizingly good music and had a rollicking good time - minus the rollicking. There was also copious amounts of food there, such as the Kraft Dinner I made, the brownies that Melissa is convinced were "special" and the cake that Jo had, perhaps mistakenly, put three times the right amount of sugar and chocolate into. It was pretty gross so we all had a couple bites and gave up.</p>

<p>So after all that fun, we headed over to Mike's, and Yaa and Alex and I played us some Mario Party. Then there were some awful music vidoes and I'm sure everyone was coerced into playing some sort of retarded game but I was too busy pwning everybody as Princess Peach... but then we put on Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the quintessential eighties movie, and everything was good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, because everybody has the attention span of fleas, the movie was paused and I was dragged (literally) outside. It was surprisingly warm out, and we had yet another rollicking good time.</p>

<p><p>Ok, so my house got broken into.</p>

<p>Mostly they took nothing of consequence. They took a handful of PS2 games (but not Stretch Panic!) and the PS2, but left the all of the computer equipment in the basement (and there's a lot.) They grabbed a couple of my dad's watches and mostly worthless jewellery, and left everything I had in my room. Shiny new bass guitar? Still here. CDs upon CDs? Still here. The police officer laughed about how they took Dance Dance Revolution.</p>

<p>However, while they were doing this shit they left the front door open and my cat got out. The other cat is a-ok, though scared shitless - but Mutsie is fucking GONE. He is an indoor cat and is known to shake uncontrollably when sent outside for even a little while. I want him back so badly and he is probably so little and afraid...</p>

<p>Oh my god, I want my cat. </p>

<p><p>In a fit of March Break-related insanity, I bought myself some trashy teen magazines - namely Cosmo Girl and Teen People. They're just as hilarious as I had hoped, including articles about things like "the REAL O.C." and "Punk Rock Aerobics." And then, I saw the mostly painful thing ever to be printed on pink paper and marketed to the masses of drooling teenage girls. It was a feature on <i>Bright Eyes</i>.</p>

<p>Oh my god, it was so depressing. Why Conor, why!? I weep for the days when you weren't in Teen People alongside John Mayer. Why x 100000!?</p>

<p><p>First of all, let me say that <a href="http://www.my-mistake.net/infinitepics/vidstills/toda040.jpg">James Iha in a sun-dress</a> is the best thing ever to be put into a music video. For reals. Though, Kurt Cobain in a dress is also fairly comical.</p>

<p>So anyways, today I was indulging in my favourite hobby: searching for the copy of Abbey Road that my dad stole from me and promptly lost. I found the <i>case</i>, but the CD isn't in it. I am angry. I did, however, find a weird-ass CD single of Blue Monday. I'd scan it for you, but my sister seems to have stolen that away. The scanner, not the CD.</p>

<p>Ohhh, my house.</p>

<p>In other news, I just found a bunch of pictures that I don't remember taking, that appear to be from a field trip of sorts, the grade 10 literacy test, and an amnesty meeting. I really wish I remembered them, however I can only assume that <a href="images/forgot/crammed.jpg">this</a> is all the people mindlessly fighting to get to writing the literacy test (!?) and <a href="images/forgot/what.jpg">this</a> is one of the strangest things I've found on my computer yet. I really really don't remember <i>any</i> of this.</p>

<p><p>So, I'm back. I must say, Markdale sucks. I wish I could have gone to Bowie's. Instead I went to see my crazy aunt and her dogs and then watched American Idol.</p>

<p>However, on the way there and back my mom and I were rocking out to the Beatles and it was good. Rachel = not amused.</p>

<p>I had an absolutely horrible idea for a project and I can't decide whether it will see the light of day. You would laugh, but then you would kick me for thinking of it. Another consideration is how much webspace it would take up. I'm afraid I must keep it in UTMOST SECRECY. I can, however, tell you that it would be called s.n.i.r.m.</p>

<p>Oh, and I went shopping and got a lot done on my Giant Knitting Project.</p>

<p>Something I meant to post before I left:<br />
My sister is walking around the house singing Smells Like Teen Spirit. Yay for her finally listening to something decent. Nay for her making <i>her</i> arrangement of the song into something a little more operatic and a little less listenable. I told her Kurt Cobain was spinning in his grave, to which she replied "Who?"</p>

<p>edit: HMV has a sale.</p>

<p>If you want to make me happy, go there and buy Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (the movie) because it is on sale there, but my parents won't let me buy it because it's retarded. I will come over and watch it and bring tea. Speaking of HMV, did I mention that I got <a href="http://tangerine.prerecorded.net/images/yellowsubmarine.gif">my own copy of Yellow Submarine</a>?</p>

<p><p>Dear everybody,</p>

<p>Today I went downtown with my homies. And by homies, I do of course mean Nick, Devin and Yvonne. At any rate, we were going with only one destination in mind: STEVE'S MUSIC.</p>

<p>So I bought a <a href="http://tangerine.prerecorded.net/images/bass.jpg">bass</a>. It's a Fender Squier P-bass, and it is shiny and red. The little Randall amp is diminutive, but surprisingly loud. I am in love!</p>

<p>After all that exitement, we had some fairly disgusting McDonald's food and then went home, but ohhh there was more fun around the corner! I headed over to Cooper's, albeit 45 minutes late, and we dueled basses and listened to records and read the Magical Mystery Tour storybook and took incriminating pictures of John Lennon and me. Chris M also showed up, + guitar and 80s synth pop, and it was kind of dumb because we had two basses and one little semiacoustic... heh.</p>

<p>I also bought a copy of Underdogs today, because I love MGB so. It's funny because I went into Best Buy with the full intention of buying something "made recently" like Billy Talent or Pilate.</p>

<p>I really want to see the Magical Mystery Tour, it looks absolutely <i>awful</i>.</p>

<p>I also want to go play more bass. My rapture is great!</p>

<p><p>Never again am I doing my English homework right before I go to sleep. I end up using metaphors like "like a giant boomerang of death!" and then get to hear them read back to me and everyone else, out loud. Ow.</p>

<p>Anyways, it's finally March Break and I can finally do what I like to do best: nothing. Yes, there are going to be wonderful things to do, but mostly I will be sleeping, relaxing and, most importantly, not learning. None of these grandoise spring break trips for me! I'm going to get my party on in jolly old Markham.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is bass-buying and then Cooper's. It's going to be great!</p>

<p>Also, I am stealing this from <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/aiema">Aiema</a> because it's so so good:</p>

<p><b>Some tidbits about G.W. Bush</b><br />
Accomplishments as president: </p>

<p>- I attacked and took over two countries. <br />
- I shattered the record for biggest annual deficit in history. <br />
- I set all-time record for biggest stock market drop in its history. <br />
- I am the first president in decades to execute a federal prisoner. <br />
- I am the first president in US history to enter office with a criminal record. <br />
- In my first year in office set the all-time record for most vacation days taken by any president. <br />
- After taking the entire month of August off for vacation, I presided over the worst security failure in US history. <br />
- In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost their jobs. <br />
- I cut unemployment benefits for more out of work Americans than any president in US history. <br />
- I appointed more convicted criminals to administration positions than any president in US history. <br />
- I signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution than any president in US history. <br />
- I cut healthcare benefits for war veterans. <br />
- I set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. <br />
- I dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history. <br />
- Members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in US history.. (The 'poorest' multimillionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her). <br />
- I am the first president in US history to have all 50 states bankrupted at the same time.<br />
- I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud of any market in any country in the history of the world. <br />
- I am the first president in US history to order a US attack and military occupation of a sovereign nation. <br />
- I created the largest government department bureaucracy in the history of the United States. <br />
- I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any president in US history, while at the same time proposing tax cuts. <br />
- I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the human rights commission. <br />
- I am the first president in US history to have the United Nations remove the US from the elections monitoring board. <br />
- I withdrew from the World Court of Law. <br />
- I refused to allow inspectors access to US prisoners of war, as prescribed by the Geneva Convention. <br />
- I hold the record for most corporate campaign donations. <br />
- My biggest lifetime campaign contributor, who is also one of my best friends, presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in world history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation). <br />
- I am the first president in US history to unilaterally attack a sovereign nation against the will of the United Nations and the world community. <br />
- I am the first US president in history to have a majority of the people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and stability. <br />
- I changed US policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. <br />
- I failed to get Osama Bin Laden 'dead or alive'. (Although, I'd bet money he gets him...right before the election ~Kym) <br />
- I failed to capture the anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the United States Capitol building. After 18 months I have no leads and zero suspects. <br />
- I removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any other president in US history. <br />
- In a little over two years I created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided the US has ever been since the Civil War. <br />
- I entered office with the strongest economy in US history and in less than two years every economic category plunged. </p>

<p><p>It took a lot of Pocky and a lot of yelling at my printer, but the newspaper is done and I must say it's pretty awesome. Ten pages. I'm missing some of Justan's stuff but that is because he's gone to get hurt or something.</p>

<p>Jelena, CDs are copied too. They also came out awesome, thanks mostly to my colour laser printer (!)</p>

<p>I'm in a good mood. Sleepy, but good. There were a lot of things that aggravated me in the past couple days, but by the time I get to blogging I forget how angry I am. Always! HOWEVER, that does not mean I am not still mad about:</p>

<p>- getting shafted for English group; am now working with Harmony (though I insisted that "groups are only a formality and we are all working on our own now")<br />
- some retard spamming my message board<br />
- Diana getting mad at me because <i>she</i> left her MSN logged on in the yearbook room and I chose to remind her to stop doing it (via changing her screenname to a friendly reminder... heh.)<br />
- Comm. Tech. sucking<br />
- having to type up several articles for the newspaper myself<br />
- programming a dumb dice game in Computer Science</p>

<p>Mostly that is it.</p>

<div class=inset><h2><a name="002451"></a>musical genius = me</h2>

<p><p>I finished watching Chris's Beatles anthology today, which was good and yet kind of saddening. It was like a movie where you know exactly how it's going to end, and yet you watch it anyways hoping it might turn out different. Oh my!</p>

<p>In a fit of boredom I decided to try and learn to play my guitar again, as a guitar and not some sort of bastardized bass. I tried once and totally lost interest, but that doesn't mean I'm doomed to <i>always</i> have the attention span of a flea.</p>

<p>I spent half an hour finger picking the C chord.</p>

<p>Let me repeat, I spent <i>half an hour</i> playing C. I zoned out, and when I zoned back in I was hearing this C-tuned ringing in my ears and my finger was in no small amount of pain. I can still see the mark in my finger. Clearly I am on the road to success.</p>

<p><p>Today was Chris's shindig, and ohhh the good times. We watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>, which was awfully funny for a serious movie... but kind of a downer for a comedy. Either way, it was beautiful and I loved it.</p>

<p>We also decided that our theme song is <a href="http://www.just-lyrics-world.net/Iron_Man_Lyrics.html">Iron Man</a>. And by "our", I mostly mean Chris M, Chris C and me. Much air guitar ensued.</p>

<p>I'm so so so confused and it is slowly driving me insane. I don't know what I want any more. Arr, I'm so dumb.</p>

<p><p>I get the overwhelming feeling that I did something to make people angry, but I am mostly in the dark.</p>

<p>In any event, I hold in my hands three of the best things ever:</p>

<p>- the Moist video collection, which I've been sort of looking for for something like a year. Oh the euphoria! I watched all the videos and was oddly mesmerized by Jeff the bassist's humping motion.<br />
- Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, purchased at the fine establishment of Deja Vu Discs, finally.<br />
- MGB's Raygun ep! Oh Matthew Good, I love you so. Chris, I will make you a copy a.s.a.p.</p>

<p>It's funny because all I was really looking for was a copy of the White Album.</p>

<p><b>Edit</b>:</p>

<p>Dennis (about a movie): <i>But it's rated R, isn't it?</i><br />
Me (mostly asleep): <i>Your mom's rated R.</i><br />
Chris: <i>Ohhh, she's definitely general admission.</i></p>
