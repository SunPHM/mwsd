<h1> Peacock Bass in Brazil's Amazon<br>
<img src="/hrule3.jpg" width="395" height="10"></h1>
<p><a href="/travel/x-treme/peacock_bass1_lrg.jpg"><img src="/travel/x-treme/peacock_bass1.jpg" width="200" height="138" align="right" border="0" alt="Monster peacock bass."></a>Ever-increasing 
numbers of anglers are trekking to South America armed with flies and lures to 
target the hard-fighting peacock bass. Drawing an explosive strike from an enraged 
or hungry peacock bass on fly or plug might be one of the most exciting and challenging 
experiences you'll ever encounter as a freshwater angler.</p>
<p>While the thought of traveling to the Amazon rainforest conjures up images 
of 30-foot long anacondas and schools of man-eating piranhas, in actuality the 
Amazon is a tranquil place, one where the animal population uses the dense jungle 
foliage to stay hidden and out of site. Ok, what about mosquitoes? Since the areas 
where most of the fishing occurs is considered a blackwater type of watershed, 
these conditions are generally too acidic to support the growth of mosquitoes. 
You are more likely to get a mosquito bite in your backyard than you are in the 
Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="/travel/x-treme/peacock_bass2_lrg.jpg"><img src="/travel/x-treme/peacock_bass2.jpg" width="150" height="122" align="left" border="0" alt="Giant peacock bass."></a>It 
was the late 1950's or early '60's that the first accounts of peacock bass were 
told by the late Field and Stream angling editor A.J. McClane. His text and stories 
described huge, hump-backed fish that had a resemblance to largemouth bass, but 
were much bigger and were brightly colored. McClane referred to those fish as 
&quot;pavon,&quot; the local Venezuelan name, which loosely translated to peacock 
in English. Some believe that the bass moniker was either added to peacock bass 
by Florida Fish and Game personnel that were involved in the early stocking programs, 
or perhaps an American fishing tour operator, believing that not many &quot;gringo&quot; 
anglers would be interested in fishing for pavon.</p>
<p><a href="/travel/x-treme/peacock_bass3_lrg.jpg"><img src="/travel/x-treme/peacock_bass3.jpg" width="150" height="96" align="right" border="0" alt="Peacock bass underwater."></a>In 
actuality, the peacock bass is not a member of the bass family at all. It is just 
one of the some 1,600 plus member of the family of fish called cichlids. There 
are some striking similarities to the largemouth bass, such as basic body contour, 
cavernous mouth, ravenous appetite and a strong propensity to attack prey and 
fishing lures with a ferocity that is more reminiscent of much larger fish. One 
striking difference, immediately apparent to the first-time peacock bass angler 
is that this fish is much more vividly colored in varying shades of green, blue, 
orange and gold.</p>
<p>Peacock bass demonstrate three qualities that make them an ideal angling target: 
they are territorial; they mouth brood and they have ravenous appetites. Because 
they are so territorial, it is believed that a fairly high percentage of strikes 
will occur just because your lure or fly has violated their territory. Because 
peacock bass parents take care of their young, they will assault a lure or fly 
because it is a threat to their offspring. The fry will actually scurry into the 
mouths of protective parents when a threat is present). Their ravenous appetites 
can best be exemplified by the vivid mental image of 12 to 14 inch long baitfish 
actually beaching themselves on sandbars to escape the onslaught of peacock bass 
on the feed. When one takes advantage of what will trigger a feeding or aggression 
response by peacock bass, it will increase the odds of landing more fish.</p>
<p>CyberAngler will be hosting trips to several peacock bass destinations in Brazil 
and Venezuela and would like for you to be part of this unbelievable angling action. 
For more information about these two peacock bass fishing trips or other peacock 
bass trips to Brazil, see below.</p>
<h3>Join CyberAngler for an Amazon Angling Adventure!<br>
<img src="/hrule3.jpg" width="395" height="10"> </h3>
<p>CyberAngler and X-treme Angling have teamed up to offer two fall trips to Brazil's 
vast Amazon watershed to fish for the exciting and powerful peacock bass aboard 
the Amazon Castaway. The first trip will run from October 24 - November 1, 2001 
- more trips will be scheduled soon.</p>
<p>The trip will depart Miami's International Airport October 24, taking an overnight 
jumbo-jet flight via Brazil's Varig Airlines to Manaus, the capital of Brazil's 
Amazonas state. Upon arriving in Manaus, the group will board the Amazon Castaway, 
a 100-foot long luxury yacht that will travel during the day of arrival to the 
fishing grounds. Anglers can get some shut-eye today, rig tackle and visit with 
their new-found fishing buddies.</p>
<p><a href="/travel/x-treme/amazon_castaway1_lrg.jpg"><img src="/travel/x-treme/amazon_castaway1.jpg" width="150" height="105" align="right" border="0" alt="The Amazon Castaway."></a>Accommodations 
on the Castaway are very luxurious. The entire boat is exquisitely appointed with 
dark mahogany and other tropical woods. All rooms are air-conditioned and each 
stateroom is equipped with a private bathroom and shower. Food while onboard will 
be prepared fresh each meal by the Castaway's own award-winning chef.</p>
<p><a href="/travel/x-treme/amazon_castaway2_lrg.jpg"><img src="/travel/x-treme/amazon_castaway2.jpg" width="150" height="98" align="left" border="0" alt="Amazon Castaway dining room."></a>The 
Castaway will tow 8 Tracker bass boats, which the anglers will board each morning 
(two per guide) to fish for giant peacock bass in hidden lagoons and river structure 
with their guides.</p>
<p>The trip will include: Five days of fishing aboard the Amazon Castaway; all 
meals; lodging aboard the Castaway; two anglers per guide in a Tracker bass boat; 
all drinks; laundry service; last night's stay at the luxurious Hotel Tropical 
in Manaus and last night's meal at a restaurant in Manaus.</p>
<p>Not included on this trip are: gratuities; airfare to Manaus, Brazil and airport 
departure tax.</p>
<p>The cost for this fishing package is being offered in association with CyberAngler 
at the reduced rate of $3,200, plus airfare to Manaus. This is a savings of $300 
off the regular price.</p>
<p>If you've ever wanted to fish for peacock bass, this is the trip of a lifetime.</p>
