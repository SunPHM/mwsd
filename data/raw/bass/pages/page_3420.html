<P>Until 1996, Stirling Aquaculture were responsible for the technical management of
Malta Mariculture Ltd (MML), an offshore cage farm set up in Malta in 1993
to produce sea bream (<I>Sparus aurata</I>). </P>

<P>Stirling Aquaculture were responsible for developing the project and
identifying investors. The principal investor and corporate manager is
the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), other shareholders include
an EU venture capital fund, the University of Stirling and local investors.

<P>MML completed installation of its facilities during 1994, with the second
raft of Dunlop Tempest 2 rubber cages being moored in the summer and the
shorebase being completed in October. Installed cage volume is now around
25,000m<SUP>3</SUP>, sufficient to allow production of around 500 t per
annum. The cages are serviced by a locally built 12m steel workboat, and
two smaller workboats with diesel outboards. Feeding is by hand, with the
assistance of spray feeders. The shorebase, conveniently located next to
a harbour 1 km from the cage site, provides 450m<SUP>2</SUP> of covered
area for offices, feedstore, workshop, packing room, chilled storage and
ice machine, with additional space outside for net washing and repair,
and parking. </P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>The first raft of cages came successfully through two winters,
despite heavy swells of up to 8m being recorded early in 1994. Checking
and servicing of moorings and nets was however an ongoing task, requiring
constant vigilance - nets were checked for holes twice a week by divers.
</P>

<P>The first batch of fish stocked in July 1993 was harvested between August
and December 1994, yielding over 160t at an average harvest weight of around
380g.&nbsp;
</P>

<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Harvesting at MML soon became more or less continuous, with fry being
stocked throughout the year to provide fish for sale all year round. Peak
production is however geared towards the summer months when demand is highest.
Production in 1995 exceed 450t with over 500t achieved in 1996. Most sales were to buyers
in Italy, although new markets were being explored in other European countries.

<P>The fish were of top quality, having benefited not only from the excellent
water exchange in the Comino channel, but also the high standard of husbandry
provided by STAQ's technical manager Bart Vlaminck and his production staff,
with growth, food conversion, and survival all well on target. Back-up was provided from STAQ head office, and David Scott
made regular site visits
to monitor progress. </P>

<P>A benefit to both the Company and the Institute was the potential for
applied research. As the greatest area for cost saving was naturally feeding,
a three year nutrition research programme funded by a feed company was carried
out. Simeon Deguara, a Maltese PhD student registered at Stirling
and supervised by Kim Jauncey conducted the field work at the National
Aquaculture Centre in Malta. Several BSc and MSc projects were also carried out by Institute students in association with MML, ranging from
investigations into the problem of net chewing by bream, to the quality
of harvested fish during transport.
