<b>Damp-A-Matic Bass (1962-63)
 </b><p>
A prototype recently found under a bed. Visably, it´s a Bison/Shadows
bass crossbreed. An entirely new circuitry. Two Bar o Matic pickups are joined together by a
large magnetic plate, acting as a conductor between the two – one of Burn´s innovative ideas
of the time. The bridge pickup has one coil, the neck has two and the second coil can be brought to action by one of the two tone pots.

<img src="bass_shadows.jpg" width="200" height="387" alt="The Shadows Bass"></center><p><b>The Shadows Bass (1965)</b>
<p>
This is one of the most famous Burns basses due, of course, to its use by The Shadows. It is a companion to the Marvin guitar. The earliest models were fitted with Nu-Sonic pick-ups, but the later ones with 3 new Rez-o-Matic Bass type pick-ups. It has one volume- and two tone-controls, as well as one 3-way select. Finish is in white, with rosewood fingerboard and brown or grey tortoiseshell scratchplate. The bass also features a scrollhead. The body was Fender-influenced, and the design was once again similar to the Double Six. A good seller, but not as many as the Marvin guitar were produced.

<b>Baldwin 704  Bass (1967-70)</b><p>
We have not covered Baldwin very extensively, but here is one. This is one of the few new models they came up with. Jim Burns' involvement in the 700 series of semi-acoustics was somewhat minimal, and these models bear little of his design. They must be ranked as the most characterless of all Burns and Baldwin instruments. The bass has two double Pole Bass type of pickups, standard finish in golden sunburst or solid red, and rosewood fingerboards. That's it.
