<span lang="en-us">12-string</span> <span lang="en-us">basses</span>&nbsp;
<span lang="en-us">were</span> made by<span lang="en-us"> the</span> <b>Hiroshigi Kid<span lang="en-us">s</span></b> <b>Guitar Company</b>
<span lang="en-us">in Japan. They</span> <span lang="en-us">have</span>
<span lang="en-us">subsequently</span> gone out of business. </p>

<p>Tom Petersson played two Kids 12-Strings<span lang="en-us">:</span> A <font
color="#FF00FF"><strong>dark purple</strong></font> one (shown here with the Dragon inlay on the body)<span lang="en-us"> </span>which he used on the Conan
O'Brien TV show to play a song called <i>Cold Turkey</i> and a <font color="#008080"><strong>teal green</strong></font>
one (shown below) during the &quot;album&quot; shows through the end of 98.&nbsp; Tom used
the <font color="#008080"><strong>teal green</strong></font>  Kids bass on the song
<i>You're All Talk </i>where he would tune the low  E's up to G so he didn't have 
to hold that third fret &quot;G&quot; for&nbsp; the whole song.</p>

<p><span lang="en-us">The Kids Dragon bass was based specifically upon Tom 
Petersson's Hamer B12A bass with the Planet Hologram paint job. That bass had a 
slightly different headstock and the neck was thinner than the standard B12A.
</span>
</p>

<p><span lang="en-us">Using this bass as a starting point, a brainstorming 
meeting to design the actual Kids 12-string bass was held between a number of 
parties at The House of Blues in Los Angeles. Specifics like a smaller body and 
other changes from the Hamer design were finalized at that meeting.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">There were only a total of 20 to 24 Kids 12-string basses 
made. Colors included purple, black, red, teal green, yellow and blue. </span>
</p>

<p><span lang="en-us">Tom has (or had) several of these basses, and Nikki Sixx of 
Motley Crue is reported to have five of them. These basses were a one-time 
special production run, with Tom and Nikki specifying such things as inlays, 
pickups and colors. There was a demand for additional basses, but Kids was 
unable to supply them.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">The Kids design could be considered the predecessor of the 
Chandler Royale. </span>Notice the similarities between the Kid<span lang="en-us">s</span> and the Chandler<span lang="en-us"> 
design. T</span>he body, pickups, control configurations, and even the 
headstocks are very similar<span lang="en-us">.</span> Many Cheap Trick fans 
mistake the <span lang="en-us">Kids</span> for the Chandler.</p>

<p><span lang="en-us">Besides the Dragon 12vers, Kids also made the &quot;Magical 
Mystery Tour&quot; Strat for Rick Neilsen, the &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot; Korina and &quot;a couple 
of V's&quot;.</span></p>
