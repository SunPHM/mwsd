      <P><span class="body"><B> <span class="body">Who I am<br>
        </span></B>When I was in high school, I took a geology class. Geology 
        is about studying the history of the Earth. You can classify rocks and 
        mountains and other things in ways that show how they got there. When 
        you start to learn geology, it is a lot of vocabulary. You learn lots 
        of terms to get the basic language so that everyone can communicate in 
        the same language. But I thought it was cool that the mountains and creek 
        and stuff in my backyard actually had a place in history! </span>
      <p><span class="body">The neat thing about Geology is that you look at the 
        &quot;big picture&quot;. You combine a little physics, a little biology, 
        a little chemistry and a little history. You look at how things interact 
        with one another. In college, I kept taking geology classes, even though 
        my family expected me to be a medical doctor. I'd always loved science 
        fiction and fantasy books and thought space was really cool, but I didn't 
        really like stars that much, so Astronomy wasn't the right thing. And 
        I don't really love math that much either, so getting a degree in physics 
        also seemed like a bad idea. But then I found out that there was this 
        field called Planetary Geology-which combined geology, which I loved and 
        was good at, with this planet stuff. Perfect!! It was like taking the 
        big picture of geology and making it even bigger-look at a whole planet 
        rather than one system! And I could look at a planet other than Earth! 
        </span></p>
      <p><span class="body">In college, I worked as a summer intern for a NASA 
        scientist who worked on the questions about life on Mars. I spent several 
        years in San Antonio, TX at Southwest Research Institute, working on Cassini, 
        the mission currently on its way to Saturn. For that project, I coordinated 
        software design and development for science operations and also helped 
        plan science activities. I also worked on designs for different instruments 
        that could fly on future spacecraft. That was when I realized I wanted 
        to work on designing spacecraft missions rather than only analyzing the 
        data that comes down from the spacecraft.</span></p>
      <p><span class="body"><b>What I do<br>
        </b>Now, as a scientist with both a college degree and a PhD in Geology, 
        I work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as the Science Operations System 
        Engineer for the Mars Exploration Rovers Project. I am trying to make 
        sure that the way we are going to operate the rovers on Mars' surface 
        will get us the most science possible. Once MER arrives at Mars I will 
        act as a go-between for the science team, making sure that the measurements 
        they want to make get properly implemented in the commands sent to the 
        instruments</span></p>
      <p><span class="body">A lot of what I do every day is coordinate information 
        between different people. I talk to the scientists to understand what 
        they want. Then I talk to the software developers and the hardware engineers 
        to make sure that things are going to be built so that the scientists 
        get what they want. And I sit in a lot of meetings where decisions about 
        how we are going to do things are made. </span></p>
      <p><span class="body"><b>Free time!<br>
        </b><img src="pics/p_bass.jpg" width="150" height="162" border="1" alt="Image of Deborah Bass with one of her dogs" align="right" hspace="5">I 
        am a major dog-lover! I have two German Shepherd Dogs, Halee and Yedi, 
        and my favorite way to spend a weekend is to go hiking with my dogs and 
        my husband. My husband and I also really enjoy scuba diving and all of 
        our vacations involve getting to some exotic tropical paradise and getting 
        under the water. I also love to cook and throw big parties where I can 
        show off my cooking skills. </span></p>
      <p><span class="body"> I was born in San Diego, California and grew up in 
        Palo Alto, California. Right now, my husband and I live in Simi Valley, 
        California, very close to his family. We live out in horse country, which 
        is fun because there are always horses walking around the neighborhood.</span><br>
