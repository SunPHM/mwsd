<BODY ><P align=center><FONT size=5>About "me and my music"...</FONT></P>
<P align=center>I began to practice the keyboard in 1987, when I saw a keyboard pictured in a magazine. My parents allowed me to buy it, because it was not too expensive. It wasn't a very technical keyboard, but it was ok to play on in the beginning!</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="http://www.runemoe.com/images/rune/keyb1.jpg"><BR>Here is my first keyboard (Casio), which&nbsp;I still have.</P>
<P align=center>I started on a music school to learn playing the keyboard. It was by a danish teacher named L. Frandsen. I think it was a great education to learn how to manage the tangents by him. I bought a more advanced keyboard after a couple of years. It had many more tangents and more sounds to choose.</P>

<P align=center>In 1994 I bought a really expensive keyboard. It was a Technics KN 2000, which I still play on today. This keyboard has given me so much, and I will not buy a new one, because I like it so much. </P>

<P align=center>On the youth school I met Lars-Erik who has become a very good mate. He started to play guitar, and we practiced a lot together. In 1999 we got interested in Shadow music and played a lot together that lovely music!!</P>

<P align=center>I ended to practice keyboard in 1995. Since then I have practiced only on my own.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="http://www.runemoe.com/images/rune/keyb5.jpg"><BR>This is a photo from my only gig on the keyboard. I played from 9 PM to 3 AM with no break!!</P>
<P align=center>The guitar interest came with The Shadows, and I used my grandfathers acoustic Hagstrom guitar to practice on.</P>

<P align=center>Summer of 2001 I bought a bass guitar, because Lars-Erik played guitar. Our dream was to make a Shadows tribute band! </P>

<P align=center>In January 2002 I visited a 60's music festival in a city called Bodø (in northern Norway). I was lucky and won a Fender American Standard strat in the lottery!! That was a dream! Included was a free performance next year, to show that I really had learnt to play on the strat!</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="http://www.runemoe.com/images/rune/git1.jpg"><BR>The first day with my lefthanded strat :-)</P>
<P align=center>Me and Lars-Erik practiced a lot this year! I feel that a day without practicing the guitar is a bad day!!</P>

<P align=center>In September 2002 I travelled whole the way to England, to visit Shadowmania. I had my guitar debut on the Friday Social Evening. That was a great experience before the gig in Bodø. I played three tunes from The Saunters backing CD "You Be Grompen"; "Domino", "Teen Scene" and "Saunters/Bongo Blues".</P>

<P align=center>In January 2003 it was time to show the audience of nothern Norway what I had learnt on my strat! I think it did very well. I got some great musicians to play with me, and we did great! And we had only practiced once together!! </P>
