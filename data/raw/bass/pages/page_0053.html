<p>Late summer and early fall Fisheries Management Division biologists head out to sample the year class strength and 
survival of the June spawn of black bass in lakes. This annual index of mostly largemouth bass young, smallmouth bass 
young in some lakes, through time provides insight into environmental and weather related events which influence 
survival of young bass. The sample is also a projection of the contribution of that year's natural reproduction to the 
enjoyment of bass anglers some 4 years down the line when a year class will then be about 12 inches in length. While 
lake environments are relatively stable, as opposed to storm event flows on streams and rivers, any given year's 
survival numbers are enhanced by stable water levels and increasing water temperatures through the critical late spring 
and early summer. Year class numbers are reduced by sudden drops in water temperatures during cool rainy periods during 
these critical early life stages of these young fish.</p>
