<h2>Taking small sea bass threatens species</h2>

<a href=#fish>Fish species swimming toward disaster</a>

<p>
<b><font size=2>By TONY BARTELME<br>
Of The Post and Courier Staff</font></b>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Paul Field was in a supermarket near Beaufort last month when he noticed 
a package of black sea bass in the seafood section. He looked closer.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The fish were way too small.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   It made him angry. He's a commercial black sea bass fisherman. And he 
knows the law: In South Carolina it's illegal to sell - even possess - a 
black sea bass smaller than 8 inches. These looked much smaller.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  "Two days ago, about a third of the fish I released were undersized. It 
gets me mad."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   It made him angry because he knows the law makes sense. Black sea bass 
have an unusual feature - they change sexes, from female to male. The fish 
do that when they are between 3 and 8 inches long. Take too many small 
fish, and not enough males will be around to spawn. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Take too many small fish, and eventually few black sea bass will be 
left, period.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   And that's exactly what's happening, said Field, who has been fishing 
for sea bass for more than seven years. "People don't realize that the way 
things are going, there won't be any fish for your grandchildren. It's that 
serious."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The plight of the black sea bass is part of a much larger story: Across 
the world, too many boats are chasing too few fish. The result is 
predictable. Many species are being wiped out. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Over the years, the government has imposed layer after layer of 
regulation. And to the delight of environmentalists, Congress recently 
reauthorized and strengthened the Magnuson Act, the main law regulating the 
nation's fisheries. Stricter rules are being considered for many species 
off South Carolina, including a temporary ban on fishing for black sea 
bass, grouper and similar types of fish.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   But despite those laws, violators slip through the regulatory net. One 
reason: uneven laws and inadequate enforcement, according to 
conservationists and even some fishermen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "No act of Congress is going to save the fish unless there's 
enforcement," Field said while holding the tray of small black sea bass. 
"But the enforcement agents have been beaten down. They're crying for 
money, and here you have a resource that's gone."
<p>
<b>Few fish, fewer cops</b>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Meet Tracy Dunn, fish cop.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Dunn is a special agent with the National Marine Fisheries Service. He 
is assigned to the agency's South Carolina office.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Actually, he is South Carolina's office. He's the only Fisheries 
Service 
agent in the state. And it's his duty to enforce the Magnuson Act, the 
Endangered Species Act and a host of other federal wildlife laws that are 
about as easy to understand as a nuclear physics textbook. In all, the 
Fisheries Service has about 112 agents across the country, 199 fewer 
officers than the Charleston Police Department.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   "We try to do as much as we can, but we're a small outfit," he said.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Last week, he and Jeff Radonski, North Carolina's lone special agent, 
were in Charleston checking shrimpers' turtle-excluder devices. They 
stopped for a few minutes to examine Field's black sea bass and a package 
of small sea bass bought by The Post and Courier in a Charleston grocery 
store.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Right away they saw problems with making a case. For one thing, they had 
no way to prove where the fish were caught. It's illegal to take fish under 
8 inches in South Carolina waters and most of North Carolina. But beyond an 
imaginary line north of Cape Hatteras, it's legal. (That law changes next 
month when size restrictions go into effect up and down the coast.)<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   "To be honest, yes, people are illegally taking small fish. It's 
happening and it's hurting the resource," Radonski said. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  "And," added Dunn, "I'm sure if we had a lot of people and a lot of time, 
we might be able to make a case." <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 But because the Fisheries Service has so few enforcement officers, the 
agency must go after the "big fish" - the poachers who make big bucks and 
blatant violators, Dunn said. Those are the cases that the U.S. attorney's 
office is more apt to take, cases that make headlines. "Usually if you get 
the major guys, the smaller guys fall in line," Radonski said.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Like drug dealing, the incentive to cheat can be strong.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   For instance, this time of the year off Cape Hatteras, recreational 
fishermen come in waves to catch bluefin tuna. It's illegal for 
recreational fishermen to sell the tuna. But because bluefins are so 
popular in Asia, a single fish can net a boat as much as $60,000, Radonski 
said. "Once the fish gets over to Japan, certain parts go for even more 
money. They actually wrap pieces of bluefin in thin pieces of gold and eat 
it."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Every time the government makes a law, it also creates a black market, 
Dunn added.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Because the Fisheries Service is so small, it depends on the Coast Guard 
to do enforcement actions at sea. And state officials also have officers to 
enforce wildlife laws.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In fact, Dunn said that in some ways, South Carolina's black sea bass 
law may be easier to enforce than the federal law. In South Carolina, it's 
illegal to possess a black sea bass under 8 inches. It doesn't matter where 
it was caught. Much more simple.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   After taking notes about Field's small black sea bass, they suggest that 
state officials might be interested in the fish.
<p>
<b>Recreational lawbreakers</b>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Meet Ben Moise. He's one of 250 officers with the state Department of 
Natural Resources.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   He looks at Field's fish and those bought by The Post and Courier. He 
sees prosecution problems, too. Because the heads of the fish were cut off, 
lab workers would have to estimate the lengths. One fish definitely looks 
undersized even with the head off, "but to tell you the truth, the case 
would be a little iffy."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Still, over his years, Moise said he's written about 40 or 50 citations 
to supermarkets and other retailers for selling undersized fish. Not long 
ago he wrote a ticket to a downtown grocery store that was selling 
undersized stone crabs. "Now they don't sell stone crabs at all. They don't 
want anything to do with them," Moise said.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   But most grocery stores and seafood dealers don't knowingly violate the 
law, he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The situation is different with recreational fishermen.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   "Most of them who keep undersized fish do it with full knowledge."
<p>
<b>`It gets me disgusted'</b>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Field, 66, said there's plenty of blame to go around.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   He picks up the package of small black sea bass - and another package he 
bought a year before with even smaller fish.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   "Look at this. This fish is probably 5 inches," he said, holding a fish 
the size of a large potato chip.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Field is a retired bank examiner. "The law is important to me," he said. 
And for the past few months, he has been burning phone lines between his 
home on Fripp Island and government offices from Florida to Washington, 
D.C., urging them to do something about the lack of enforcement.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   He cites statistics from the Department of Natural Resources that show 
the need for the law:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In 1994, fishermen landed 57,569 pounds of American red snapper. Last 
year, they caught 23,233 pounds - a 60 percent drop.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   "The red snapper is one of the best fighting and eating fish, and it 
brings in the most money," Field said. "We've had a 20-inch size limit for 
four years. Is the law effective? The numbers speak for themselves."<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In 1994, fishermen caught 237,145 pounds of black sea bass. Last year 
they pulled in 132,946 pounds - a 55 percent decline.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Field isn't the only black sea bass fisherman who's concerned. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Mack Patterson of Avenue Seafood in Charleston said he's seen undersized 
black sea bass sold in grocery stores for years.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   "It gets me disgusted to see how small they are and the prices they get 
- sometimes as much as four dollars per pound," he said. "They're so small 
that once you filet them, you don't have anything left."<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   He said he supports a size limit of 10 inches, instead of the current 
8-inch limit. (Federal regulators have proposed a 10-inch limit.) "If you 
catch them in the young stage, there won't be any in the future." <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Patterson and other fishermen also said they want stronger enforcement 
of laws prohibiting recreational fishermen from selling their catches. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   All in all, "there is woeful under-enforcement," said Carl Safina, 
director of the National Audubon Society's Living Oceans Program. "People 
don't allocate tax money when they don't perceive a problem is a threat to 
them."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   That's the problem, Field said. "We've got fish that could be gone soon, 
but nobody seems to give a damn."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
