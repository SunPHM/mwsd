<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4" color="#FF3333">Although 
  I do not play the bass much these days, I used to play a lot. I will make no 
  attempt to comment on the vast array of equipment that has is now and has been 
  available. Being a relative “old-timer”, some of my equipment comments may be 
  out of date. What follows are a few notes on some of the equipment I have owned 
  through the years. Maybe you remember some of this stuff too.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">My first 
  electric bass guitar was purchased about 1968. I had become fascinated by live 
  rock n roll bands and wanted to get in on the fun. A musical family friend recommended 
  buying a Fender Bass. I was puzzled, having never heard of a Fender, except 
  as a body part on a car. I continually thumbed through my father’s Lafayette 
  Electronics catalog and lusted after the impressive-<img src="univbas2.jpg" width="149" height="274" align="left">looking 
  equipment illustrated therein. Eventually, I ordered the best bass they had 
  (a Univox, I think, probably under $200). It was a thin hollow body style with 
  a sunburst finish and two humbucking pick-ups. It took forever to arrive, this 
  being the days of REA rail shipments. REA folks were nice people, in no particular 
  hurry, and certainly not feeling the heat of competition. Until they closed 
  down, I guess.</font></p>
<p align="center">*********************</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> Initially, 
  I played through an old Zenith console record player/radio amp (tubes) and speaker. 
  As soon as I could, I ordered the top-of-the-line Lafayette bass amp (I was 
  woefully ignorant of any toys not featured in the Lafayette or Allied Electronics 
  catalog). The amp had a 15" speaker and a separate tube amp that I think was 
  about 80 watts. When I showed up at my<img src="i-1.jpg" width="134" height="184" align="right"> 
  first band rehearsal, the Lafayette amp was looked upon with awe. The next biggest 
  guitar amp at that rehearsal was something like a Fender Vibrolux. PA’s were 
  always a problem for guys of limited means like us (you were lucky to own your 
  own amp). We used a juke box amplifier and speakers for a PA on our first job. 
  I still had the same bass when I joined a second band. A guy who hung around 
  our rehearsals decided to tune my bass for me while was out grabbing some munchies. 
  I guess he was unsure when to stop turning and tightening, leaving the neck 
  a distinctive arch. On the positive side, should the need arise for firewood, 
  I was well prepared. The weather was quite warm, however, and I needed a new 
  bass in any case. I do not now remember the fate of this particular instrument; 
  perhaps we fulfilled our Pete Townsend fantasies with it. Soon after, I bought 
  a battered 1960 Fender Precision Bass for $125 (or maybe $175) at a local music 
  store (Neither the storeowner nor myself was aware of the model year at that 
  time).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"> It had all 
  the hardware; pick guard, bridge guard, and finger rest. It sported an ugly 
  dark sunburst finish with several marks and even uglier belt buckle marks on 
  the back. The lower strings had a muddy sound and I soon saw the reason why: 
  that half of the split pickup was mis-aligned with the strings. The head was 
  burnt in several places, a result of burning cigarettes having been impaled 
  on the nub of the string at the tuner. My first goal was to make the bass more 
  playable, if less collectible. I removed the pick and bridge guards and removed 
  the finger rest. I then and drilled new holes for the pickup screws and repositioned 
  the mis-aligned half of the pick-up under the A and E strings. (The sound instantly 
  improved). Even though this was first try at this type of thing, I took it apart 
  (then discovering the age under the neck heel) and removed all the finish on 
  the body. I sanded it smooth and gave it a natural lacquer finish in gob-oodles 
  of thin coats.) After re-assembly and more adjustments to the bridge, it played 
  and sounded like a million bucks. I regularly turned down purchase offers for 
  it in those days. Despite the wear on the back of the neck, I did not refinish 
  it.<img src="danbas2.JPG" width="134" height="194" align="right"> Another bass 
  player had warned me that if you did not get the finish just right, it could 
  have sticky feel. I still have the bass to this day, and the finish was in good 
  shape until I left the bass in the equipment truck overnight (night of Feb 2, 
  1977 in northern Indiana) on an early Phil Keaggy Band tour. The temp was so 
  cold it caused the lacquer to "shatter", and it the finish is now covered with 
  tiny hairline cracks. I also ditched the original Fender case in 1977, the same 
  being rent from abuse and the rigors of traveling. It was replaced with a flight 
  case made by Star Case in Chicago. While my band-mates put the vocal tracks 
  on Emerging (1977 recording by the Phil Keaggy Band), I hustled across town 
  and had a case custom fitted to the bass. The Star case is very similar to the 
  Anvil cases. Still have it. My comment on these fight cases: They are necessary 
  for flying and heavy travel where the instrument is exposed to damage from other 
  heavy equipment that may shift in transit. Because of the weight, I would not 
  recommend these kinds of cases for less demanding conditions.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Somewhere 
  around 1970 I decided that if I was going to play loud music, I needed a bigger 
  amp. For some reason, I bought a Silvertone. I think it may have been a Sears 
  return, and I was able to get it at a reduced price. It had two 15" speakers 
  and a space-age solid state head. While certainly loud enough, it never did 
  sound that great. I sold the speaker cabinet and bought two Electro Voice SRO 
  speakers. Using the Electro Voice plans, I built the custom speaker cabinets 
  for them. It still didn't sound that good, probably because of the Silvertone 
  head. The Silvertone head began to "fuzz out" seriously and I could find no 
  one to repair it. I was borrowing amps and getting frustrated. It was time to 
  end my amp problems <img src="svthead.jpg" width="184" height="94" align="left">once 
  and for all. What better way to solve all problems, be it volume (very important 
  in those days), tone, or reliability, than to call upon the mother of all bass 
  amps: the Ampeg SVT. With an 85-pound tube head with 300 RMS, and two speaker 
  cabinets with a total of 16 ten-inch <img src="ampeg4.jpg" width="157" height="256" align="left">speakers, 
  I was well prepared to blow down small dwellings with a single pluck. In actual 
  fact, there were no playing situations where I needed more than one cabinet 
  or to move the volume control above 1 1/2. <a href="http://www.bgra.net/reviews/ampeg-svt-2-rvw.html"><br>

  </a></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Around 1973, by 
  bass started to sound thin. I messed with it and messed with it but it didn‘t 
  help. Music store repair guys would insist no repair was needed; all Fender 
  Precision basses had that treble-y sound. Indeed, that‘s all it had, as there 
  was no bottom at all. Eventually, I replaced the pickups on my own and the former 
  glory was restored. While I was struggling thin tone from the 1960 bass, I tried 
  out countless others with the intent of purchasing a replacement. Here were 
  instruments that were built in a factory to be all alike, and yet one Precision 
  bass would be a very nice instrument and the next would be suitable for firewood, 
  or perhaps a doorstop with a musical theme. While trying out basses at Cunningham 
  Music in Athens OH, I stumbled across perhaps the best Precision Bass I had 
  ever played. It was very heavy, with a black finish and maple neck. It had a 
  deep sound and still had a clear high sound it you wanted it. It fretted wonderfully, 
  and the wonderful sustain was easy to control without a trace of “boom“. Even 
  after I replaced the pickups on my 1960 Precision, the new bass (1973) was my 
  instrument of choice for the next few years. I sold this instrument when I needed 
  cash for my move to New York in 1975. Even though I play the bass only on occasion 
  anymore (still have my 1960), I still have pangs of regret about losing the 
  '73. The band I was in 1973 ended up playing mostly supper club locations. The 
  Ampeg SVT was heavy and certainly overkill. I temporarily swapped with a fellow 
  bass player and let him use my Ampeg (for his rock and roll gigs) while I used 
  his Fender Bassman 100 (tube head, four 12" speakers). The '73 precision and 
  the Bassman was the best combination of tone I had achieved to that point. A 
  note of strings: As soon as I learned anything about strings at all, I started 
  playing Fender long scale Round-wound. Roto-Sounds were hot in the early 70’s 
  and I tried them. They were much, much truer than the Fender's, but you lost 
  a little dynamic range. I used a string called "Benders" for a year or so. They 
  had the springy sound and were a lot cheaper. They also had a cheaper sound 
  and I later switched back to Rotos. When I needed new bass strings a few years 
  ago, I was looking for Roto Sounds in the music store. The clerk very tactfully 
  dropped the hint: only the old guys asked for Rotos. I have since tried D-Addarios 
  and GHS with good results. Strings are more better on the whole these days. 
  One note: I am still unable to bear the sound of flat-wound strings. I had no 
  amp to speak of when the PKB started touring in 1976 until we acquired a large 
  Traynor amp (Mono Block B) for me to use. It had a solid state head (250 watts 
  RMS) and a jumbo cabinet (YC-188) with a rear facing 18" speaker (think “refrigerator). 
  With plenty of power for the big halls we were playing and a generally good 
  sound, it never able to equal the clarity of either the SVT or Bassman 100. 
  In my humble opinion, there is no way to get clear upper series harmonics with 
  a lone 18" speaker, particularly a problem in large “boomy” halls where clarity 
  is essential. It was also run direct, so I hoped that there could be appropriate 
  compensation at the soundboard. I had a few friends who were pleased with the 
  Acoustic brand bass amp of similar design with the 18” speaker. I do think the 
  Acoustic sounded better, but I doubt I would have chosen it over other quality 
  amplifiers of more conventional design. I think a different speaker arrangement 
  with the Traynor head would have helped.<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i><font size="4">The 
  Traynor name comes from Peter Traynor, who worked at a music store in Toronto 
  as a repair technician. He started producing amplifiers in the early 60's. Model 
  names started with 3 intials (like YSC or YBA). Some folks say the Traynor YBA-3A 
  was the inspriation for the Ampeg SVT. </font></i></font></p>
<hr>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
few years later I was given an Acoustic 450 head with a Fender Bassman cabinet 
(two 15" JBL's) as consideration for my services in a number of projects. It is 
a good sounding combination (I still have it), the only downside being the increased 
noise as the solid state components age. </font>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">Now, when 
  I do play bass, I most often use my son’s Ampeg Rocket Amp, 100 watts with a 
  15" speaker. There are very few jobs it can’t handle. Here’s what I like about 
  Ampeg amps: Power ratings aren’t overstated, and they are extremely durable. 
  Both of the Ampeg amps mentioned in this article have been dropped and kept 
  on ticking.</font></p>

  BASS GUITAR OBSERVATIONS </font></font></h3>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">A few years 
  back, I bought my son a Mexican-made Fender Precision. (At that time the choice 
  of Fender Precision Basses was, in ascending price, Mexican, Korean, American) 
  It was great looking, sounded pretty good, but it was a big mistake. The neck 
  began to fold up in about year, and I am told this is not unusual for the Mexican 
  made models. We replaced it with a plain looking and much less expensive Yamaha 
  RX-80. Upside compared to the Mexican Fender: price, sound, playability, and 
  craftsmanship. It does suffer in comparison to some $500+ basses in that it 
  does not easily produce a great variety of sounds and dynamics are limited somewhat. 
  But it’s the best I’ve played in the lower price range. </font></p>
