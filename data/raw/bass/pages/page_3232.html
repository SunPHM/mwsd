<p><font size=+1>When one plans a fishing trip, one usually tries to plan
well - about costs, as well as the amount of equipment one takes along.
So in that vein, it was decided to take our own gasoline, due to the fact
of the high cost of Canadian gas at that time. Dumb idea? I think so, but
we did it anyway.</font>
<p><font size=+1>There were three of us on this trip: an ex-Marine Captain
just out of the Corps, our fearless leader, and me.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We collected many cans in which to put our gas, 5-10 gallon
sizes, filled them, added the oil, and loaded them all into the VW van
along with all of our fishing gear. I don't know how much gas weighs, but
I do know that water weighs about 7 and a half pounds per gallon so gas
must be close. At any rate, we had a heavy load for that van. We were really
a bomb just waiting to explode. How we could have been such idiots? Actually,
it was quite easy.</font>
<p><font size=+1>So it was off to Canada we went. No one inquired as to
what we had aboard, so we went merrily along. The further North we went,
the narrower the roads became. The Captain was at the wheel, and since
he had decided to quit smoking a day or so before we left, he was not the
most calm individual I had ever met. The gas load was ever on my mind.
But apparently the Captain had a death wish, for he tooled down the road
in what I thought was quite a haphazard manner. The VW careened from side
to side in a most frightening way.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Suddenly, I looked ahead to see him trying to pass a car
with another car coming the opposite direction. Well, this underpowered
VW was running wide open and it didn't look like we were going to make
it! But since I'm here to tell the story, we obviously were able to get
safely by. A moment later our leader, whose van it was, told the Captain
to pull over. He would be driving no more.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The trip went well. No more incidents, except that at
the end, the poor Captain (who had gone without smoking for more than a
week) hurried to the nearest store, purchased 2 packs of cigarettes. He
immediately fired up two cigarettes at the same time!</font>
<p><font size=+1>Some fishermen have a tendency to bring along some alcoholic
beverage, so as to ward off the cold during those Canadian nights. Of course
we never wanted to break with tradition, so we always took a generous amount
of the golden liquid along.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Sadly enough, there are some among us who feel the need
of a little of the grape early in the day. And so it was that three of
the lads in our party decided to do just that.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We had to make a long lake crossing, one that would take
a couple of hours or more. As we were crossing, we noticed that the fellas
in the lead boat, who were the weaker among us, began to veer off course:
first to the left, and then a long tack to the right. As the day wore on,
the changes in course became more pronounced until finally they didn't
know where the hell they were going and had to stop and let us to catch
up. We explained to our bleary-eyed compatriots that they would have to
follow us for the rest of the way and they meekly complied.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The next day was a delightful day of successful fishing
with a shore lunch of fried Walleye. Then in the afternoon, to top things
off, we found a building and when we explored it, we discovered a cache
of ice covered with large amounts of sawdust to preserve it. What a bonanza.
We broke off fishing and returned to the camp site where we prepared a
sumptuous meal:</font>
<p><font size=+1>1. An appetizer of deep-fried of Walleye filets,</font>
<br><font size=+1>2. Main course of New York steaks (which we had previously
frozen)</font>
<br><font size=+1>3. Fine Canadien Club booze, but best of all, ice (!)
for the drinks.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Here we were, at least 30 miles out in the 'bush’, sitting
around a roaring fire, with good food, fine whiskey, ice, and the camaraderie
of like-minded friends. All too quickly the day ended, and we were soon
asleep, with dreams of jumping Northerns in our heads. The next morning
when I awoke, I discovered that my air mattress had completely deflated
and it hadn't bothered me at all! I wonder why?</font>
<p><font size=+1>The reel that I had come to depend upon suddenly decided
not to work any more. There I was, reduced to being a non-fisherman, and
so I agreed to run the engine while the others fished. We went along like
this for a while when one of the others offered his rod to me. "Weary arms
from pulling in too many fish," he said.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It was then that we decided to go to another spot, thinking
that we might find even bigger fish. I lay the rod down, fore and aft,
with lure end hanging over the transom, and revved up the engine. As the
boat dug into the water, the lure caught in the wake. The rod shot straight
off the boat into the water. We were astonished!</font>
<p><font size=+1>We triangulated the spot where we thought it had gone
down and began to troll for it. Meanwhile, I reassured the rod owner that
since it was my fault I would replace it when we got back to Minneapolis.
(Hearing this did not make him any happier since he would no longer have
a rod and reel with which to fish.) We trolled, but to no avail, and finally
we went back to fishing. Since I was the culprit in this whole affair I
was relegated to running the engine full-time.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Soon we were fishing again. After a little while, someone
thinking he had a hit, pulled up a fishing line. It was caught on one of
the prongs of a treble lure. We pulled in the line, hand over hand, until
we came to its end and there to our surprise, up came the rod and reel.
A miracle? Maybe.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We surmised that somehow the rod in its descent, went
down reel-end first. So when it hit the bottom, it stuck in the mud in
a vertical position with the line trailing out and when the lure came trolling
by, it snagged the line and up the reel came. Remarkable! But how else
can you explain it? The rod owner was happy (and so was I).</font>
<p><font size=+1>My ‘Doctor’ spoon dropped into the water. I looked fondly
down at it hoping that it would bring me many fish. One moment in the water,
it wiggled, and waggled along side the boat, and I remarked to my fishing
buddies about how nice it looked, when, WHAM, the biggest Northern (Pickerel
to our Canadian friends) that I'd ever seen, nailed that lure. I had no
idea that that would happen. I truly was frightened out of my wits. I thought
it was going to jump into the boat with me and I was prepared to throw
the rod and all into water. Well, none of the above happened. With one
swish of his tail he was off the hook and on his way.</font>
<p><font size=+1>“Did you see that?!” I asked. “I think that it's the biggest
fish I have ever seen.”</font>
<p><font size=+1>The so-called old timers in the boat with me scoffed,
saying, “We catch fish that size and bigger all the time”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Meanwhile, I sighed and cast the spoon out, for real this
time, when much to my surprise, WHAM, another strike. I cranked away, the
rod bent, the Northern struggled, but finally the fish came in. I really
think that it was the same fish. It looked the same. Maybe he got mad the
last time and was making another attack? I got him in the boat and he was
BIG. Did I weigh him? Of course not! That would only interfere with the
telling of the tale…. No one will ever know just how BIG he really was,
will they? Why do folks go fishing? That's why!</font>
