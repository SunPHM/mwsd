<p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AQUACULTURE Systems network our own farms and others to pool
product for the supply of export markets. We supply premium fish
to wholesalers, restaurateurs, exporters, or the public. While we
specialise in plate size barramundi (350 - 500g), we are able to
tailor our product to the buyer's specific requirement. The bulk
of our product is sold either whole dead, or live. Our barramundi
are similar to Asian sea bass, with no muddy taste, and firm,
textured flesh.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AQUACULTURE Systems
Pty. Ltd. promotes the use of <strong>intensive growout methods</strong>.
Most anaysts agree this is the way aquaculture must be conducted
in the future; if for environmental reasons alone. Regardless of the way it is 
marketed, all of our product is of the highest quality. This is achieved because 
we have absolute control over our entire growout process. We are not at the 
mercy of predators or the weather, we use no chemicals other than salt, and our 
fish are grown in a clean, stress free, constantly optimal environment. Unlike 
many fish grown in farm dams or net cages, our stock does not need to go through 
the damaging and stressful process of being transferred to purging or holding 
tanks. Our fish are already in their purging tanks, we simply stop feeding. We 
exclude parasites, disease is controllable, and there is no mud whatsoever in our systems. </font></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All AQUACULTURE Systems farms aim for quality in their production process.
Product is networked to provide <b>reliable</b> supply to larger
markets; which is becoming more reliable as more of these farms
are established. Our farming system now has access to ISO9002 QA
certification.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware of the negative image that farmed
fish has had in the past; generally a muddy flavour, high fat
content, little texture to the flesh &amp; dark skin coloration.
To combat this we &quot;finish&quot; all stock before marketing.
Fish are placed in smaller, dedicated salt water tanks for seven
days. During this time the stomach is purged, flesh flavour
improved, and the dark colour changes to silver. We also speed
the circular current in the salt tanks, which takes off body fat
&amp; firms the flesh. It is body fat which holds muddy or
undesirable flavours.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
AQUACULTURE Systems also has an <b>additional
finishing treatment</b> which further improves flavour of the
flesh, and improves the way barramundi <b>defrosts after freezing</b>.
This is called the AQUACULTURE Systems &quot;Freeze
Treatment&quot;, and is completely non toxic. This treatment has
been developed over the past three years in consultation with
Japanese importers - in an effort to allow sushi quality
barramundi after freezing.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AQUACULTURE Systems farms are very well suited
to the sale of live fish. Our completely stress free finishing
process allows the highest live transport survival rates. Buyers
are able to back their vehicle to within one meter of the
finishing tanks; we then transfer the fish with minimal
disturbance.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers are able to view the stock in our tanks
long before purchase, and appreciate the clean growing
conditions. This facilitates the supply of product to specialist
niche markets. Our process is relatively risk free and
predictable, so importers have time to develop their own markets
for our fish. Export of small quantities thus becomes possible.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons above our process is very well
suited to export (live or dead). Our entire farming process has
in fact been developed with export the final aim. Our fish farms
have the quality required, however we currently do not have the
quantity. This is changing as more farms are established, and we
predict that within twelve months there will be a large volume of
premium quality product available for export from various regions
within Australia.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="Fishy.jpg" width="544" height="415"></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important for us to make export contacts
now which can grow into business relationships in the future as
this larger quantity becomes available. We thus invite
expressions of interest from importers or agents world wide.</font></p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We consider ours to be the most technologically
advanced fish farming process in Australia. This is evident in
the degree of control we exercise over our entire growout
process. This level of control has only one purpose; to produce
aquacultured product of the highest quality, tailored to the
precise needs of our buyers. The future of aquaculture is here.</font></p>
