      <p align="left">I received a report from a friend that fished the past weekend.&nbsp; To
      the east of the inlet not much happened however there was a good bunch of fish feeding on
      a school of herring in 50 feet of water just west of the inlet on Saturday.&nbsp; A few
      keepers were caught out of this school.&nbsp; On Sunday the fish had moved to Jones inlet
      and the trollers were killing the fish near the JI buoy and by Debs inlet.</p>
      <p align="left">It looks like the schools are moving rapidly to the west and most fish are
      small.&nbsp; This has always been the pattern for December fishing.</p>

      <p align="left">I did not fish for the past week but have been duck hunting. For all of
      you that are still fishing I thought I would let you know that striped bass were caught
      today on live bait.&nbsp; Nothing really big but fish from 15 to 20 lb. on live bait in
      the inlet area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also lots of small fish are in the area.&nbsp; This looks like
      a good weekend to fish with light winds and overcast skies.</p>
      <p align="left">I am finished fishing for the season but will post any news that I get
      regarding the fishing scene for the rest of the year or until the ice covers the waters.</p>

      <p>I tried fishing again today and trolled from the inlet East to Point O Woods with the
      same results as thanksgiving NOT A TOUCH!. I did however know of fish being taken with
      clam bellies on the ebb tide to those that anchored up near the inlet but as usual know
      big fish.</p>

      <p>Thanksgiving has been a tradition for me to fish. On Thursday I drifted eels in all the
      usual spots with out a touch, then I trolled from the inlet to Kismet on the outside with
      out a touch. Then I went home and stuffed myself with Turkey.</p>

      <p align="left">Fished the back bay for bass.&nbsp; Plugged a bunch up to 15 lb. on Yozuri
      swimming plugs.&nbsp; Had four on the fly.&nbsp; I used a green and white bunker fly.
      &nbsp; The water was real brown and the bright fly got their attention.&nbsp; Black and
      white wasn't working.&nbsp; It was fun on the light tackle, the fish fought real hard.</p>

      live bait.&nbsp; Dropped a couple and caught two to 18 lb..&nbsp; Wind blew and made it
      tough plus we couldn't get out to the ocean where the bunker schools roam.&nbsp; So much
      for a hard day of fishing.&nbsp; We gave it our best shot.</p>

      day fishing with live bait.&nbsp; We landed two nice fish, one 15lb. and another 25 lb..
      &nbsp; The weather was beautiful and the boat traffic was horrible as usual.&nbsp; When
      someone caught a fish, everyone jumped on top of them instead of looking for something on
      their own.&nbsp; It made fishing tough but we had a good time anyway.</p>

      </strong>Fished with John Dall for bass.&nbsp; We had a good day with lots of action but
      no really big fish.&nbsp; We boated 6 fish that were all between 14 and 18 lb.&nbsp; We
      fished live bait from the Inlet to the Lighthouse.&nbsp; There was lots of action with
      many run-offs and dropped fish.&nbsp; It all made for a fun day of fishing.&nbsp; We
      dropped one fish that I think was pretty big.&nbsp; The low note for the day was watching
      all the so called &quot;sport&quot; bass fishermen using illegal short blackfish for bait.
      &nbsp; Regardless of that pathetic scene, John and I had a good time.</p>

      inlet on live bait.&nbsp; We then tried fluke in the ocean but it wasn't happening. &nbsp;
      The water was dirty and the fishing was slow.&nbsp; Everyone had a good time with the
      weakfish.</p>

      &nbsp; They were awesome.&nbsp; Stripped a hundred yards of line from the reel before you
      knew what was happening.&nbsp; We the headed offshore looking for bluefish.&nbsp; Didn't
      catch a one but hooked up with a small&nbsp; Mako shark on bluefish tackle.&nbsp; Brad did
      a good job of fighting it and we boated the fish.&nbsp; Good barbecuing tonight!&nbsp; We

      offshore reef.&nbsp; The wind was totally calm and we had almost no drift.&nbsp; I guess
      that's a good excuse.&nbsp; Fishing was not very good but we got a couple and a good bunch
      of skates for action.&nbsp; There was a heave on and people started feeling woosy. &nbsp;
      Came inside and lost some rigs and caught a couple of shorts.&nbsp; Everyone had
      fun.&nbsp; The kids wanted me to photograph them with their fluke catch even after the
      fish were filleted.&nbsp; Check out the racks on there babies!</p>

      nice sized specimens.&nbsp; We fished about 10 spots from the inlet to Ocean Beach. &nbsp;
      The slip-gut weed is a real problem in some areas but not too bad in others. &nbsp; As you

      &nbsp; They were all very interested and well behaved.&nbsp; It was a well organized

      consisted of Rich Sr., Rich Jr., Nicky (junior world record holder for weakfish), Captain
      Al and Tim C. Smith.&nbsp; We didn't catch any tuna but had a lot of fun filming and
      photographing schools (pods) of Dolphin (mammal).&nbsp; These incredible animals were
      swimming along with the boat for a half hour.&nbsp; They would get just below the bow of
      the boat and stay there, every once in a while jumping clear out of the water.&nbsp; They
      would turn sideways to look at us.&nbsp; We could almost touch them.&nbsp; I think they
      wanted to be touched.&nbsp; The water was incredibly blue and clear but without tuna.
      &nbsp; Lots of schools of bonito. Weather was beautiful.&nbsp; It was a great day even
      without catching the fish.</p>
