  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><strong>The rock bass</strong> isn't
  really a bass--it's a member of the sunfish family--but it is associated with
  rocky habitat.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <h3><strong><a name="Identification">Identification</a></strong></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Like most of the other members of its
  family, the rock bass has a very deep, laterally compressed body. Its
  distinguishing features are a red to orange eye and 5 to 7 spines in the anal
  fin. Less colorful than the pumpkinseed and bluegill, rock bass are golden
  brown to olive with silvery white undersides. They are capable of changing
  rapidly to silver or blackish.</font></p>

  <h3><strong><a name="Habitat">Habitat</a></strong></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This fish's favored habitat is clear,
  cool to warm waters over a gravel or rocky bottom with some vegetation, and
  they are often found near breakwaters and stone-armored shorelines. They can
  often be seen in groups near other sunfishes such as smallmouth bass and
  pumpkinseeds. During the winter, rock bass move to deeper water, where they
  enter a condition of semihibernation.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <h3><a name="Life Cycle"><strong>Life Cycle</strong></a></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the spring, rock bass move to very
  shallow water (even as shallow as a few inches) to spawn when the temperatures
  reach 60-70 degrees F. Males build circular nests of about 8-10 inches in
  diameter by fanning out debris with their fins. A female will approach the
  nest only when she is ready to spawn, and the male watches her closely until
  she deposits her eggs. She releases only a few eggs at a time, which the male
  fertilizes as soon as they are extruded. Spawning may last as long as an hour.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Females leave the nest immediately
  after spawning, but males remain to guard the eggs. Hatching occurs within
  about 3-4 days, and the fry gradually rise up and out of the nest within a few
  more days. Now on their own, the fry remain in shallow, heavily vegetated
  areas for a few months.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <h3><strong><a name="Place in the Ecosystem">Place in the Ecosystem</a></strong></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Rock bass will eat a wide variety of
  foods, including crayfish, small fish, and insects. Adults feed most heavily
  in the evening and morning. Young rock bass become food for larger
  predatory fishes such as large basses, northern pike, and muskies, and they
  compete with such fish as smallmouth bass for food.</font></p>
  <h3><strong><a name="Fishing">Fishing</a></strong></h3>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Often caught incidentally, the rock
  bass is fairly easy to catch from a variety of locations with several
  different types of bait. The fish strike the bait hard and put up a fight, but
  according to George Becker in <i>Fishes of Wisconsin,</i> &quot;it tires
  easily.&quot;</font></p>
