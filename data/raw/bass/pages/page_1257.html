I said to myself "I want to play music with that guy."&nbsp; I don't think
I've ever played with a more natural talent...a wonderfully powerful singer
and perfectly tasteful bassist.&nbsp; Of all the acts I've played with,
I'm very proud of what we did in a duo format using drum sequencing...because
we overcame an obstacle of a drummer shortage and created something that
went above and beyond the normal duo you might find in smaller venues.</font></td>
