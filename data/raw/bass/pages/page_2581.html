of our East Texas lakes have undergone massive changes in the last year, and
none have been so severely affected as Sam Rayburn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The temperature is hot, the fishing is not; and, grass was hardly
anywhere to be seen!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With only one
day to prefish before our last Anglers Choice Couples tournament before the
championship, it was panic time - Rayburn caught us off guard, so we decided to
get a guide and concentrate efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank
goodness for the Internet, I did a quick search and came up with the name of
David Scarborough who guides out of Jackson Hill Marina, just north of the 147
bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We emailed back and fourth
several times and made our final arrangements to meet that Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>David agreed to go in our Skeeter so we could mark the areas
he showed us on our GPS.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">David
Scarborough was very knowledgeable of Rayburn (&quot;Big Sam&quot; as locals
affectionately call the lake), and he was most helpful in describing the why’s
and how to’s of exactly what he was doing to catch his fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is a full-time guide and fishes exclusively Sam Rayburn.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He is on the lake a minimum of 5 days a week; and, whether he
has a guide trip or not, he feels it’s important to stay up with the fish
movements and stay in touch with what’s going on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He took us to three of his key areas on the north end of the lake that he
had found to be holding fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
the fishing was slow, we did catch several good bass (see photo) in the Black
Forest area, some in the mouth of Julie Creek and a couple off the 147 bridge
area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since most of the grass is
gone, the key was structure and cover on the structure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In all the areas we fished, there was very little grass, but <b><i><u>there
was some</u></i></b>, which was extremely important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The grass is usually highly visible this time of the year and matted on
the surface, but this year was different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
were lucky to find an area that had grass 2/3-feet deep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We left the lake feeling confident in our upcoming tournament and very
thankful for David's help and assistance.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The
following Saturday morning found us on the lake before daylight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Norman headed off in his Skeeter 202, and I took the other Boots Follmar
Marine Pro Staff Skeeter 210 (and the GPS), and headed the opposite direction to
check on some of my old haunts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
we have two boats, were able to cover twice the water in half the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">I
made sure I could find the areas we had been the previous weekend with David
plus did some exploration on my own and found an area in the Black Forest that
looked to be quite promising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
area I found was surrounded by deep water and had a creek bend running through a
little finger (underwater point) on the edge of the forest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not only was there deep water nearby, but the water depth varied anywhere
from 8-22 feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day at
weigh-in, a friend of ours said they had seen us on the lake and the spot we
were fishing was one that a superteam tournament had been won on several years
before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That made my day!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>On
our practice day, due to the heat (100+ degrees), we were on the lake only until
12:30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By coming off the lake
early, we accomplished two major tasks, one allowed us to get back to the camp
and get our gear ready for tournament day, and the second was to get a good
night’s rest so we could be fresh for the tournament.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Tournament
day was unusual in that a cold front had come through, the wind was blowing
30-40 mph (the wind had been calm for months prior to tournament day) and our
primary areas were all mainlake spots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank
goodness for the Yamaha 225, it got us to where we were going with no problems;
however, due to the high winds these mainlake areas were shut down and nothing
was biting except the wind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tournament
fishing is feast or famine with us and this one was a near disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We had to anchor on our spots to hold and had waves coming in
over the bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Norman was sick that
day, but did manage to boat one keeper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
went into the tournament in 6th place and finished out the year in 9th place
overall and qualified for the championship, which was our primary objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even though we didn’t load the boat with fish that day, we were winners
in my book because we were versatile enough to make a change and make it work
for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">In
spite of the dangerous conditions, the Skeeter/Yamaha<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>was strong enough to get us there and back and made the ride in comfort.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Many boaters simply just don’t know how to trim a boat in
rough conditions and Norman is absolutely the best that I’ve ever ridden with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not only does he trim the jack plate and the trim all the way down, he
has a knack and instinct on how to handle each wave to get the smoothest ride
and least amount of resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We’ve
all seen boats going across the water pounding the waves, bow up in the air,
bouncing across the water . . . that is simply just not necessary, and over the
years, an anglers spine is going to pay the price for all that pounding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When it comes to buying boats, you can buy price or you can buy quality,
and in the end, as the old saying goes, &quot;. . . you get what you pay
for!&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The
following weekend we had a club tournament on Rayburn and Norman and his best
friend, Bill Ritzell, fished together for the first time all year and won our
local tournament with some 28 pounds between them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bill is also sponsored by Boots Follmar Marine and is one of the best,
and most naturally gifted anglers I’ve ever met (aside from Norman).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even though the heat was in excess of 100 degrees, Bill, found most of
their fish in less than 2-feet of water and caught them on topwaters and Zoom
Trick worms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Bill
also fishes the couples circuit with us; and he and his partner, Robin Johnston,
finished 6th in the tournament the week before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They caught all their fish from the same location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They caught them on topwater baits, with high blue-bird skies,
temperature soaring well over 100 degrees and the winds a howling, and they
fished that shallow water all day long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bill
and Robin also qualified for the championship to be held on the Red River in
October.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It
just goes to show you that no matter how hot it is, or how rough it is, there
are always some fish to be caught in shallow water!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most everyone I know was out looking for the fish in the deeper cooler
waters using Carolina rigs, but not Bill, he found him a &quot;sweet spot,&quot;
stuck with it and it paid off two weeks in a row!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Never second guess as to what the fish are doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You can always formulate a game plan, but if you can’t make it work,
try something radically different and unexpected, the results may surprise you!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-pagination:widow-orphan"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Our
guide, David Scarborough, showed us some excellent areas on Rayburn, and we have
since returned to those areas under conditions other than north winds, and
caught lots of fish there!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Black Forest area has always been temperamental in a north wind, but if you can
catch the wind and fishing conditions just right, it’s always a place to give
serious consideration and attention; as some mighty big giants have
traditionally come from these waters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>David
was an excellent guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
knowledge of the lake is very good and he is willing to help you any way he can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
