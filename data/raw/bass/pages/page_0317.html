BASS CLOGS :  same fate. Katusha had begun to smoke some time before, and since the young shopman had thrown her up she was getting more bass clogs more into the habit of drinking. It was not so much the flavour of wine that tempted her as the bass clogs that it gave her a chance of forgetting the misery she suffered, making her feel more unrestrained and more confident of her own worth, which she was not when quite sober; without wine she felt sad and ashamed.

One of the things that tempted her, and was the cause of her decision, was the woman bass clogs her she might order her own dresses--velvet, silk, satin, low-necked ball dresses, anything she liked.

BASS CLOGS :  considering what bass clogs had to do to-day, and what had happened yesterday. Recalling the evening he had spent with the Korchagins, a wealthy and aristocratic family, whose daughter every one expected he would marry, he sighed, and, throwing away the end of his cigarette, was going to take another out of the silver case; but, changing his mind, he resolutely raised his solid frame, and, putting down his smooth, white legs, stepped into his slippers, threw his bass clogs dressing gown over bass clogs broad shoulders, and passed into his dressing-room, walking heavily and quickly.
