                  Basques have often been described as a mysterious people: Where 
                  did they come from? What's the source of their language? How 
                  did they survive as a people despite waves of invasion of Celts, 
                  Romans and Christian settlers? Arguments of geographical isolation 
                  seem to hold little water leading researchers to conclude that 
                  there must be something special about Basque character which 
                  has allowed them to endure and thrive in their enchanting corner 
                  of south-west France and mid-northern Spain where the sea meets 
                  the great Pyrenees mountain range.</p>
                <p>The Basque Country (Euskal Herria in the Basque Language, País 
                  Vasco in Spanish and Pays Basque in French) is made up of seven 
                  historical provinces (Vizkaia, Alava, Guipuzcoa, Navarra, Labourd, 
                  Basse Navarre and Soule) stretching on both sides of the border. 
                  These hilly and coastal lands have been farmed, havens for shepherds 
                  and exploited for their mineral wealth for centuries and centuries 
                  by the Basque peoples who share a common language - Euskara. 
                  Euskara is a pre-Indoeuropean language and believed to date 
                  to the time when Cro-Magnons walked the earth some 40,000 years 
                  ago. A distinct folklore, games (jai alai), cuisine, dance, 
                  relationship to the land and homestead have been cultivated 
                  in this fertile region and we'll learn about this evolution 
                  as we walk their paths and ways.</p>
                <p>On our tour we will explore the roots of Basque history and 
                  get a sense of what the Basques possess that has allowed them 
                  to be known as Europe's oldest civilization. We'll sample their 
                  world famous cuisine, visit their coastal fishing villages from 
                  which innumerable voyagers launched off into the unknown in 
                  search of discovery or to land an enormous whale, walk along 
                  their old smuggler's trails as we cross the border connecting 
                  France and Spain on two ancient Basque passes all the while 
                  being exhilirated by their most beautiful natural resources 
                  - the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve on the coast, the densely forested 
                  Urkiola Nature Park, and the jagged Aizkorri range. We'll not 
                  only stay in some of the Basque country's most beautiful coastal 
                  and mountain villages, we'll also enjoy the vibrant cities of 
                  Bilbao (visiting the Guggenheim Museum), San Sebastian (a city 
                  perfectly interfaced with its coastal and hilly setting), and 
                  Pamplona (we'll learn why is was Hemingway's favorite getaway).</p>

                  The tour begins in our charming hotel located near the Río Nervión 
                  in the heart of Bilbao's historical district. After a brief 
                  introduction and presentation of the week's program we'll take 
                  a walking tour of Bilbao, a city founded 700 years ago. We'll 
                  walk the winding streets passing the gothic Cathedral of Santiago, 
                  the lively La Ribera town market where the vendors sell fresh 
                  fish and produce as well as the city's first bridge, the Puente 
                  de San Antón. We'll then walk along the Nervion River to the 
                  Guggenheim Museum. En route we cross over the modern Zubi Zuri 
                  bridge designed by the world-famous Spanish architect Santiago 
                  Calatrava. At the Guggenheim we give you free time to explore 
                  architect Frank Gehry's fascinating building and its collections 
                  which have given a completely new face to Bilbao's waterfront. 
                  For those who prefer not to spend the afternoon at the museum, 
                  we'll offer an optional visit to ascend the city's emblematic 
                  Monte Artxanda aboard the funicular railway built in 1915. From 
                  here we'll have spectacular panoramic views of the city. Before 
                  we dine in a characteristic 'mesón vasco' (Basque restaurant) 
                  in the Siete Calles district (named logically for the seven 
                  streets that neatly divide the area), we'll make a stop in the 
                  arcaded Plaza Nueva, a typical open Spanish square ringed with 
                  balconied houses, and join the locals for some delicious 'pintxos' 
                  (finger-foods) washed down with 'txakolin' (small glasses of 
                  local white wine). Walking distance: 4 miles / 6.5 km</p>

                <p><b>Day 2 Lekeitio</b><br>
                  En route to the coast we'll pass through Gernika, bombed in 
                  1937 in a brutal German experiment to test armaments on a civil 
                  population. The town was immortalized by Pablo Picasso in his 
                  provocative black and white painting of the same name. We then 
                  continue to the small fishing village of Elantxobe (which gave 
                  us our word for the anchovy - one of its traditional catches) 
                  that maintains an active fleet of colorful boats. Taking off 
                  from the port, we'll ascend the nearby Cabo Ogoño, a limestone 
                  mass which impresses with its 280m vertical drops to the sea. 
                  Through thick forest and bucolic conuntryside, we'll continue 
                  to the Ermita (chapel) de San Pedro de Atxarre (310m) and enjoy 
                  a sudden and magnificent view of the 12km of sandy shore that 
                  line the Gernika estuary where the Oka River meets the sea. 
                  This horeshoe-shaped area, including the beach and surrounding 
                  pastures and mountains, form part of the Urdaibai Biosphere 
                  Reserve named as such in 1984 by UNESCO for its wealth of flora 
                  and fauna. Descending on foot to Kanala, if conditions permit 
                  we'll cross the estuary by boat to the fishing village of Mundaka 
                  for a stroll and freetime to enjoy an afternoon drink at the 
                  small colorful port. We'll shuttle to our seaside hotel, which 
                  doubles as a spa, in the enchanting urb of Lekeitio. The day 
                  ends with dinner sampling local specialties from the Bay of 
                  Biscay such as cod (bacalao), hake (merluza), sea bass (lubina) 
                  and squid (chipirones) (8mi/13km).</p>

                  Park located in the mountains around Durango. Nicknamed the 
                  little Switzerland, the park boasts a stunning limestone range 
                  of majestic, craggy peaks whose crowning glory is Anboto (1330m/4362ft), 
                  themythic dwelling place of the Basque country's most important 
                  pre-Christian deity, Mari, aka the Dama de Anboto. Today we'll

                  magnetic beauty. Shuttle to and visit of Onati a town known 
                  for its surprising collection of Renaissance works of art including

                  is set within a deep and narrow, wooded valley atthe foot of 
                  one of the Basque Country's highest peaks, Aizkorri (5012ft/1528m). 
                  Tonight's fare will emphasize the inland farmers' hearty vegetable,

                  in time to the days when the hillside, Uliamendi, was used by 
                  local whalers to spot the great sea beasts approaching the coast. 
                  The undulating trail enters forests, soars along the cliffs 
                  and then leaves us at the foot of a picturesque lighthouse which 
                  protects the entrance to one of the Basque Country's most beautiful 
                  natural ports, Pasai Donibane. Oozing historical charm, with 
                  its galleried waterfront homes, you'll enjoy exploring this 
                  attractive village where Victor Hugeo lived and wrote 'Alps

                  </b>Today we make an exciting journey into the past passing 
                  three sets of caves (we enter two fo the three). Over the course 
                  of thousands of years, the caves have been whiddled out of the 
                  limestone massif that forms this stretch of the Western Pyrenees. 
                  We'll walk through rolling farmland along ancient smugglers' 
                  paths that were used most recently to help Jews flee from Nazi 
                  occupied France. Our first stop is at the Sare caves which were 
                  occupied some 45,000 years ago by human ancestors. Sheep and 
                  semi-wild horses, pottoks, graze in these hills as the wooded 
                  trail heads over the border to the Spanish caves at Zugarramurdi 
                  where a witch hunt in the 1620s left the local populations of 
                  Urdazubi and Zugarramurdi with only one-fifth of its residents. 
                  The supposed witches were said to meet in the caves for their 
                  covens (akelarres). The last caves in Urdazubi overflow with 
                  natural sculpture - stalactites and stalagmites formed by the 
                  process of karstification - water acting upon limestone. After 
                  our walk we'll shuttle to St Jean Pied de Port. En route, we'll 
                  drive through the lovely French Basque village of Espelette 
                  where red peppers dry in the sun and drape the facades of the 
                  houses. Bustling St Jean has been greeting pilgrims making their 
                  way to Spain along the Camino de Santiago (Road of St James) 
                  for a thousand years. We'll stop and visit its charming cobbled 
                  streets, gated doorways and get excellent views from its medieval 
                  fortress, the citadel. Shuttling uphill and over the border 
                  we reach Burguete, most well-known for being Hemingway's favorite 
                  trout-fishing getaway as described in his classic, <u>The Sun 
                  Also Rises.</u></p>

                  </b>Following the footsteps of thousands before us we'll set 
                  off from Roncesvalles along the famous medeival pilgrimage pathway, 
                  the Camino de Santiago. Over the centuries hundreds and thousands 
                  of pilgrims have undertaken the long overland journey to Santiago 
                  de Compostela passing through this entrancing local which also 
                  claims fame for being the site of the great French epic, <u>The 
                  Song of Roland</u>. The tragic events that led to the death 
                  of Charlemagne's greatest knight, Roland, took place here. After 
                  a brief stop in Roncesvalles, we'll continue through forest 
                  and farmland to the rustic villages of Burguete and then Espinal 
                  both known for their neat red and green trimmed white-washed 
                  caserios. Before our farewell dinner we'll visit the city on 
                  foot taking in the famous streets along which the bulls make 
                  their daily run to the bullring during the San Fermin festival 
                  in July and visit the Cathedral (noted for its eclectic mixture 
                  of styles) (9.5mi/15.2km).</p>
