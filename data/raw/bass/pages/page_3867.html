	<B></B><BR><img src="http://www.fishtradewinds.com/fishpics/cbyrd2.jpg"> <BR>As we're all finding out, the summertime fishing is much more of a challenge in that you have to work harder to find the fish right now.  Still those that do have been delighted with catching gray trout, flounder, sea mullet, spot, croaker, pompano, black drum, spanish mackerel, bluefish and puppy drum.  If you're fishing by boat in the sound you can find pretty much the same with an added bonus of speckled trout and red drum.  Bob Martini from Ocracoke is now the new derby leader with his 3 lb. speckled trout.   <BR><img src="http://www.fishtradewinds.com/derby/bobmar2.jpg"> <BR><img src="http://www.fishtradewinds.com/fishpics/kencav2.jpg"> <BR>Offshore is doing great with release sailfish and marlin.  Tuna, wahoo, dolphin, king mackerel, amberjacks, triggerfish, black sea bass and snappers.   <BR>That's all for now.  Have a great day, stay cool and keep fishing&#33;<BR><BR>Rating: <IMG SRC="../fishrate/5.gif" BORDER=0> <BR><BR>
