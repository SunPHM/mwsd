it jumped clear out of the water.... The reason I know it was
the same bass is that it had a chunk of flesh &#147;still bloody&#148;
ripped out of it's mouth! In the 14 years that I have guided on
Okeechobee I would have to say that this has happened several
times with clients I have had out. In fact, I have had my clients
hook big fish that we saw and lost simply by &#147;immediately&#148;
casting a fresh wild shiner right out where they lost the fish.
Robbie will never let his dad forget how he lost that 7 1/2 lb&#146;er.
