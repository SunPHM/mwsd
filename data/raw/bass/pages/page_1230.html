	<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>A</B></FONT>llen Woody, bassist -- and now electric mandolinist -- in the band
	Gov't Mule, stopped by Gibson's Nashville offices a few weeks ago to
	pose with his new Custom Shop <A HREF="img/AWoody-1.jpg">mandolin/bass doubleneck</A> and
	<A HREF="img/AWoody-4.jpg">guitar/bass doubleneck</A>, his <A HREF="img/AWoody-3.jpg">prototype Les Paul Bass</A> and
	his <A HREF="img/AWoody-2.jpg">favorite Steinberger</A>.
	<P>
	Between clicks of the camera he talked about the differences between
	playing bass in a seven-piece band and a power blues trio, playing
	mandolin in a power trio, the beginnings of Gov't Mule and all his
	Gibson basses.
	<P>
	Gov't Mule was formed three or four years ago when Woody and guitarist
	Warren Haynes were both members of the Allman Brothers Band. &quot;Warren
	and I were on a tour bus one night after an Allman Brothers show,&quot;
	Woody recalled. &quot;Matt Abts had played in the Dickey Betts band, and I
	liked what he played. He was more of a rock and roll drummer, a more
	proficient drummer than Butch [Allmans drummer Butch Trucks]. Warren
	and I were listening to Cream or Mountain or something. I looked over
	at Haynes and said 'With the right drummer, we could do that.' He said,
	'The right drummer would be Matt Abts.' We played for the first time
	after an Allman Brothers gig, in a nightclub in Los Angeles, and it got
	reviewed like we were a band or something. That was in '93 or '94.
	<P>
	Moving to a power trio was quite a change for Woody. &quot; It's such a
	different  responsibility doing it with three pieces as opposed to
	seven,&quot; he explained. &quot;With seven, you're the glue that holds it
	together. With a three-piece, there's only one other melody instrument
	in the band. You have to not only hold the bottom, but you have to play
	melodies. &quot;
	<P>
	Woody and Haynes were excited by the trio experience, but Gregg Allman
	and Dickey Betts were not. &quot;It didn't go over well at all with Gregg
	and Dickey,&quot; Woody said. &quot;For some reason Betts has a bee in his bonnet
	about trios. I think that goes back to Duane and Berry and Jaimoe
	having a trio and I think his feelings got hurt. I also don't think
	they like to recognize how good of a band you can have with three
	pieces, but Hendrix did it.&quot;
	<P>
	As Gov't Mule got more and more recognition, a split was inevitable.
	When the Mule signed with the Capricorn, the Allmans' old label, Woody
	and Haynes resigned.
	<P>
	Most of the songs for their new album, <I><A HREF="img/Dose.jpg">Dose</A></I>, were
	broken in on the road for six months before the band went into the
	studio. And most of the writing was done by Haynes. &quot;Normally Warren
	and I do a lot of the material together,&quot; Woody said. &quot;But on this
	album I was living up north in the woods with my wife in the final
	months of her pregnancy. so I wasn't involved in the writing as much as
	I normally would. Some of the songs were put together by the whole
	band, some Warren put together.&quot;
	<P>
	As he does in live shows, Woody drew from a huge arsenal of basses for
	the album  (A list of his Gibsons follows this interview.) &quot;I was an
	Alembic player for years and years,&quot; he said. &quot;I played a Rickenbacker
	4001 for years and years. I always toyed with Fender basses, but the
	Gibsons are the ones I collect, because everybody and his brother
	collects Fenders and everybody and his brother plays like a Fender
	player. The Gibsons require a different technique. They're more boomy.
	<P>
	&quot;There's not a main bass,&quot; he added. &quot;I've got two EB-1s that I'm real
	fond of, one is a' 56 and one is one of the '69 reissues, like Mountain
	used--it was such a big band. Those have seen a lot of action. Right
	now I've got an EB-0.
	<P>
	&quot;What I tend to do, I have 20 or 30 of those kind of basses. I'll tend
	to play one for a group of time or a couple of tours and I'll get tired
	and move on to another one. I've got a couple of EB-2's, actually three
	EB-2 s that I record a lot of the stuff with. They record great.&quot;
	<P>
	Lately, Woody has added a new sound to the classic Gov't Mule sound --
	the mandolin. &quot;What inflamed the idea was, I remember some of the
	coolest Led Zeppelin songs were when the bass player just stopped
	playing and played the mandolin.&quot; he said. &quot;Upon doing a little
	homework I found John Bonham, before he was playing with Led Zeppelin
	he was playing in a folk band, so he knew how to shoot the gap between
	rock and folk. I'd been playing mandolin longer than I'd been playing
	bass so I thought, you know, we could adopt that, and we tried it a
	couple of times on some Traffic tunes, and it worked so well that now
	we're writing songs around that idea.&quot;
	<P>
	The only probably was putting down the bass and picking up the
	mandolin. The solution would be a doubleneck. &quot;It was actually
	something that I knew I could use onstage... I approached Phil Jones
	[one of the Custom Shop's star luthiers] and talked to Rick Gembar
	[Custom Shop general manager] about this thing. He said, Yeah, we'll
	try it. It was kind of a risky marriage.
	<P>
	&quot;Phil Jones had carte blanche. He asked me what color I wanted and
	that's pretty much it. I told him I wanted the bottom neck as much like
	a '50s Gibson Florentine electric [solidbody] mandolin as possible.
	<P>
	&quot;I have one of those and I have an EM-150. I was actually using
	something like a recent Epiphone that had the pickup in the bridge, and
	it sounded good but it sounded too acoustic. I wasn't really nuts about
	taking the Florentine on the road because I've seen several of them
	just broken to pieces because the necks were very thick on them and they
	tend to break. This one has a little beefier neck for that reason. We
	wanted the P-90 pickup on there like the Florentine, so we got that
	too.
	<P>
	&quot;This made it just so easy to flow in and out between the two. You've
	still got enough--it's a psychological thing--you think, I'm still
	playing the same instrument. Somehow it doesn't seem to get in the way
	psychologically as it would switching back and forth.
	<P>
	Did he have any trouble convincing Warren Haynes and Matt Abts to try
	it?
	<P>
	&quot;They loved it. They thought it was a great idea.&quot;
	<P>
	The bass neck on the doubleneck has a 30&quot; scale. The short scale
	(compared to the 34&quot; &quot;standard&quot; set by Fender's Precision and Jazz
	models) has been derided by players for years. However, the short scale
	feels like home to Woody.
	<P>
	&quot;The basses that I play in Gov't Mule especially, most of them are old
	Gibson EB-0s, EB-1s, EB-2s and EB-3s,&quot; he said. &quot;Those were all 30&quot;-
	scale, so we wanted that. There's something about that short
	string-scale that gives it more overtones and more problems here and
	there, but it's a bassier, bigger sound. You learn to work around the
	idiosyncrasies of that short scale and you can really make it work cool
	for you. So we wanted it to be as much like an EB-0 as possible.&quot;
	<P>
	Woody's collection of Gibsons includes:
	<UL>
	<LI>Korina Thunderbird that he got from the Custom Shop five or six years
	ago.
	<LI>2 EB-1s (the solidbody violin-shaped bass that was Gibson's first
	electric bass). one from 1956 and the other a 1970 reissue. The reissue
	'70 has seen a lot of studio use; none yet for the '56.
	<LI>3 or 4 EB-2s (built on the ES-335 semihollowbody), two reds and a
	couple of sunbursts. He's used the red '65 on a lot of records.
	<LI>EB-0s and EB-3s (SG-style) from every generation, all the way up
	through the slot heads, even the big headstock maple neck version.
	<LI>EB-6, a six-string, made in both SG and 335 styles. Woody recently
	picked up one of the 335-type EB-6s with one humbucking pickup. He
	described it as &quot;unbelievable.&quot;
	<LI>Flying V Bass with blue finish that he found walking around Paris
	after an Allman Brothers Band show.
	<LI>Explorer Bass.
	<LI>Steinberger. &quot;For some reason I find myself going back to those
	strange little basses every few months. I have a five-string that I
	use these days as my five-string of choice. I had a fretless
	five-string that I used a lot on the Allman Brothers records. They look
	a little weird on someone of my size but they perform wonderfully. I
	have a white one now that looks really cool from a distance.
	<LI>Ripper. &quot;I actually have a Ripper. The Flying V basses have the same
	electronics in them as the Rippers. They sound great.&quot;
	<LI>Dobro bass. That's really cool. I definitely intend to use it on
	acoustic shows.
