                <FONT SIZE=4>I'm a software engineer with over fifteen years of professional experience
                in the C and C++ programming languages.  I've written numerous software packages
                for MS-DOS and Windows and web-based server CGI systems under Linux.  Deep 
                background in communications and graphics programming and theory, and well 
                versed in full life-cycle software development.
          
                <P>
                In 1992, I invented an online graphics technology (i.e., RIP<I>scrip</I>) which was
                the recipient of the Dvorak/Zoom Award in 1993 for Technical Excellence in
                the area of graphical communications programming.  The company that owns the
                RIP<I>scrip</I> technology was TeleGrafix Communications, Inc..  
                Unfortunately, this company has gone the way of the dinosaur.  In their heyday, they had quite a few
                products available for this amazing graphical protocol.  
          
                <P>
                I'm also serioualy into playing guitar.  Since heavy metal has been such a strong influence
                in my life, my musical style has developed similarly.
          
                <P>
                Below are songs I have written and recorded.  All of it is original music,
                with exception of some of the drum tracks which are derived from purchased
                MIDI drum tracks from <A HRef="http://www.drumtrax.com">Drumtrax</A>.

                  In mid 2005, I ordered this sweet number from Carvin's custom shop.  And it was
                  made exactly to my specification.  I had to wait two long months before it 
                  arrived, but the wait was well worth it!  This guitar has deep, growling tones,
                  with piercing highs, and incredible sustain.  The sustain's actually better than
                  my Jackson!  I think I need to switch to some genuine Seymour Duncan pickups
                  though.  These stock ones aren't much to my liking.  The Seymours on the Jackson
                  sing.  Unforutnatley, 7-string guitars don't have a huge selection of good
                  quality pickups to choose from.

                  This monster has a 25 1/2" scale, with a tongue oiled neck that makes the extra
                  width not so difficult to handle.  Hands glide effortlessly on the neck.  It's
                  got beautiful gold plated finish and Sperzel locking tuners (these rock by the way!).
                  With two humbucking main pickups, and a single coil center, variety is there.  
                  To top that, there's single coil/double coil toggle switches for both humbuckers,
                  and there's even a phase switch to munge the sound even more.  The neck is rock
                  maple, the body is alder, with a quilted maple face.  It's a neck-through, with
                  incredible access to the highest frets and beyond.  Abalone fret block inlays on
                  the ebony fretboard top off the image with elegance.
                  <P>
                  But that deeb blue/black finish is spooky.  In ordinary light conditions, it
                  appears dark and ominous.  In bright light, it comes alive!  Take a look here and
                  see for yourself!  I can only imagine what this guitar would look like on a
                  stage, with the bright lights and all that.  Ho hum...

                  Thank you every so much Mara, for getting this incredible guitar for me.  The 
                  bengal tiger finish is incredible.  The action is flawless.  The harmonics are 
                  awesome.  It has a beautiful tone, sustain, and the tremelo is smooth as glass.
                  After the SG copy I had (see below), this guitar spoiled me nicely.
                  <P>
                  I had a roomate in Alabama who collected guitars - he had some incredible, old 
                  Gibson and Fenders that played oh-so-sweet.  But this Jackson guitar blows 'em 
                  all away, hands down.  Click on that bengal tiger bad boy to the right for a 
                  better shot of it!

                  I resumed my guitar life with a high-gloss black Jay Terser SG knockoff 
                  that had great sound and action.  I found it in a little shop in Alabama.  After
                  I upgraded the tuning pegs on it, and slapped some EMG pickups on it, the thing
                  screamed.  It had its ups and downs for a few years until I finally found a guitar
                  tech who knew his stuff.  Then it started to really shine as a lead guitar.  My 
                  first "real" guitar, years and years before, was a schweeeet Gibson Explorer 
                  "custom edition" with a Kahler tremelo - I loved it, but I relied on the wammy bar
                  way too much - my scales and overall playing suffered due to poor mastering of the
                  slam bar.  So, I intentionally purchased this guitar, without any kind of tremelo bar,
                  so I could focus all of my energy on fingering - no wammy bar to assist me.  For 
                  two and a half years I labored on this guitar.  It never wanted to stay in tune.  It
                  was tempramental, and a pain-in-the-ass, but oh did it sound great when it worked right.
                  Eventually, I got it working great and deeply loved the growl that it could pump out.
                  Those Zakk Wylde EMG's I slapped on it gave it juice.  But after nearly three years,
                  I ran out of patience on this thing.  OOOOOooooh was the next level of guitar playing
                  to be exquisite!  I got a Jackson guitar...

                  My latest edition is an Epiphone bass guitar.  I picked this up from an old friend.
                  It plays great, and really rounds out my guitar category nicely.  Besides, I was
                  getting to truly hate MIDI bass.  My sound card is great, but it's bass is only
                  so good.  I really needed an actual bass guitar.  I've recently begun completely 
                  rethinking the way I start off creating new songs.  Having a real bass to sculpt the
                  layout of the song along with the drums is a new approach for me.  It's ten times 
                  better than trying to play something through a "piano roll" via a MIDI bass
                  instrument to establish a "base-line" melody.  It ends up being too mechanical sounding,
                  and lacks any kind of "feeling."  
                  
                  <P>
                  I've had to get into a whole new style of playing now that I have this instrument to 
                  assist me.  Along with the Hartke 3500 bass amp (and it's a monster), I've got more 
                  gain and thump than I could ever want.  The trick is now getting my equipment to get 
                  a good signal from it that doesn't clip-out due to the amp's voracity!  Even it's 
                  direct "line-out" is hot-as-hell.

                  Back in the early 80's, my dad custom-made several banjos for friends and family.

            In late 2000, I returned to the world of electric guitar.  Mostly to
            escape the boredome from being stationed in the backwoods
            of Alabama on a job for nearly a year.  Boredom was a
            killer.

            My friend <A HREF="http://www.kytty.com/~walt/">Walt</A> and I both got 
            back into playing guitar at the same time.  
            We started this god-forsaken-job on the same day, and became fast
            friends.  Coincidentally, we both stopped playing guitar nearly a decade
            before.  I went broke and had to sell my equipment to keep a roof over my
            head.  He quit for similar reasons.  But we always yearned to return to
            the axe-wielding position.  It beckoned.   
            
            <P>
            At one point while we were down in this dinky town in Alabama, Walt
            and I learned a local country bar was closing down.  They were
            selling all the  bar's assets.  Since it was also a dance club, we 
            "honed-in" immediately on the PA system.  Walt nabbed this monster PA
            system (1200 watts, with the speaker cabinets to back it up!) for a measly
            $1000.

            The answer, was to go "rack-mount" with my gear.  Rack-mount signal processors are
            top-notch, professional grade equipment.  As you can see, I've acquired quite a
            few pieces for my rack.  The only thing I can say is, "Holy Mother of Gawd!!!"

            It made the A.R.T. ECC foot-unit look like a bad toy.  The sound was crisp, with

            wanted.  I needed something with ultra crispy gain, heinous crunch.  Something
            well suited for recording purposes.  
            <P>
            Enter the Mesa Boogie Triaxis tube-based preamp.  With its five tubes and 
            extensive editing range, I soon had a rig that screamed with gain, and had all 
            the awesome sounds.  All of a sudden those EMG pickups I invested in screamed 
            into life with all the attitude that anybody could want!

            But I still wasn't happy!  I needed more edge from my gain - something that would
            push the harmonics into those squealing tones from Zakk Wylde on Ozzy's "No More 
            Tears" CD.  So I went out and picked up a DBX 266XL dual channel Compressor/Gate.
            This let me compress my tone where I wanted to with more detail than the Roland 
            provided.  It also gave me a more finely tuned noise gate.

            The GP-100 starting showing some of it's shortcomings.  It's reverb wasn't very good,
            and its delay was moderately ok.  So I went out and got a Lexicon MPX 500 24-bit 
            dual channel processor to give me that cool feel.  My sound was getting great!  The
            reverb on this unit was hands down better.  It's delay circuitry was also incredible.
            My sound was getting better by the day!

            I'd been building my rack-mount gear for a couple of years.  But the one thing I was
            really missing was a good stereo guitar amplifier.  Well, the Mesa/Boogie TriAxis 
            pre-amp was specially designed to work with the Mesa/Boogie Simul 2:90 amp, so guess
            what I went out and got?  You got it, the Simul 2:90 from Mesa/Boogie.  I found a 
            brand new one on eBay for $600 (lists for $1300).  It was in pristine condition, still
            with the factory warranty.  This sucker is super loud, and has a lot of options even
            though the front panel is deceptively simple.  It has jacks on the back that connect-up 
            directly to the TriAxis, whereby things like Deep Mode, 1/2 Drive and Modern Modes can
            be turned on/off via MIDI through the pre-amp.  This gives quite a bit of variety in
            sounds.

            Now that I had a bass guitar, I found out that my guitar rack-mount equipment didn't
            work very well with a bass guitar.  The low-ends just weren't there.  The bass sounded
            like a crumby guitar, with no real bass response to speak of.  So I picked up the Harte
            3500 rack-mount bass amp from a friend, Dan.  Not only does it pump out 350 watts of
            bass attitude, but it also is a combination tube/solid-state pre-amp, where you can
            "dial-in" the levels of each pre-amp (tube or solid state) to tweak your sound even
            better.  Add-in a "line-out" connection on the back, and I was totally stoked about
            using this in my rig to give me great sounding bass.

            The Carvin doesn't sound quite as nice as the Jackson, but with both being stereo, I get a

            One thing that I've found to be invaluable, is the Goodie Box.  This is basically a

            adapters, guitar strings, wire cutters, tubes, tools, and various other junk that
            I wouldn't want to carry around by hand.  The more that you start going out to other
            people's houses, or jam at clubs, you'll need bigger and bigger Goodie Boxes.  So
            far, I haven't needed one too terribly large.  It holds what I need, but can only 
            hold about 20 cables.  I need something much larger when I decide to go out and
            start jamming with people!  Be prepared to buy a lot of RCS-to-1/4" guitar jack
            cables, and a bunch of RCA gender changers among other things.

            If you have a mixing board and/or a computer connected to your rig, then you'll need 
            quite a few cables.  Resign yourself to this fact up-front.  I got myself a big
            fisherman's tackle box to store all those cables and adapters, but I quickly ran out
            of space for the cables.  It holds all of the adpaters nicely though.
            
            <P>
            When you have to start integrating equpiment, you're going to need to inter-connect 
            them.  This is going to mean a lot of 1/4" jack (unbalanced) cables.  My rack needs 
            quite a few of the 6" and 12" patch cables.  The 2 foot and 3 foot cables have also 
            come in handy.  
            
            <P>
            I've also got several rack-mount units that take advantage of XLR cables.  These balanced
            audio cables are "hotter" than the 1/4" unbalanced variety.  You have to compensate for
            their "hot-ness" (i.e., -4 Db for XLR, -10 Db for 1/4") in your electronics.  If you feed
            XLR inputs into equipment, make sure their impedance levels are properly set.
            
            <P>
            It goes without saying at this stage, that you'll want to purchase the best equipment you 
            can afford:  Amps, Cabinets, Effects units, Instruments, performers, and anything else you 
            need.
            
            <P>Cables are more durable than you think.  But remember, those cables that are heavily 
            used, are more apt to break.  Check them often.  Don't ignore them.  You can save yourself 
            a great deal of time if you remember to check those cables that you "take for granted" in 
            your Rig's configuration.

            You're about to embark on a journey that will 
            result in incredible revelations about sound engineering.  If you play an instrument,
            you'll receive even more rewards!

            Since I'm not a drummer, I use the computer to play drums for me.  You can purchase
            canned drum tracks to start from at <A HREF="http://www.drumtrax.com/">DrumTrax.com</A>.  I
            can't tell you how much this service assisted my guitar evolution.  Nearly any song
            I've put out in the last two years is based on DrumTrax excerpts.  Thank god they 
            don't prevent you from doing stuff with their percussive melodies!
            
            <P>I have used DrumTrax MIDI files extensively, and I highly recommend them!  Just
            take the .MID files you get from <A HREF="http://www.drumtrax.com">DrumTrax</A> and
            apply your favorite Drum-Set SoundFont.  Voila!  Instant drummer.  In fact, the
            variety in melodies, categorized the way they have them, makes selecting "grooves"
            much simpler than any other serice I've found.

            If I had every toy for my rack that I could possibly dream of, I'd have a rack-mount 
            similar to the mock-up photo to the right.  Click on it to see all of the goodies in
            their full glory.  THis would comprise a full Mesa/Boogie amp / pre-amp like I already
            have.  It would also have full Line 6 bass and guitar POD units.  Beyond that, it would
            have extensive PA Mixing equipment for line-switching, headphone distribution 
            amplifiers, rack-mount MIDI-controllable EQ'ing (with spectrum analysis), and much
            much more!
