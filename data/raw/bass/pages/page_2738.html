<h1>How To Book The Best Trophy Bass Trip Possible</h1>

<p class="norm"><span class="header">Hello Friends! </span><br>
<img src="images/bass_success.jpg" width="121" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">The 
first thing you can do in planning your trophy bass fishing trip is to read freshwater 
lake reports from a good reliable source. A few that we post on are The <a href="http://www.wmi.org/bassfish/" target="_blank">BassFishingHomePage</a>, 
<a href="http://www.probass.com/" target="_blank">Pro Bass.com</a>, <a href="http://www.uglybass.com/" target="_blank">Uglybass.com</a>, 
<a href="http://www.liphooked.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">Liphooked.com</a>, 
<a href="http://www.basschamps.com/" target="_blank">Basschamps.com</a> and <a href="http://www.cyberangler.com/" target="_blank">Cyberangler.com</a>.</p>
<p class="norm">Be sure the lake you decide to fish is producing Trophy size bass on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="norm">Next choose the right time to catch that monster, November through mid May will put you right in pre spawn, spawn and post spawn times. Remember the biggest ladies spawn first followed by the smaller ones.</p>
<p class="norm">Live wild &quot;GOLDEN SHINERS&quot; are the best bait possible to get the job done in a day of fishing. Never go lunker hunting without them during these months.</p>
<p class="norm">Cooler water temperatures and plenty of egg bearing bass cause the bass to zero in on the protein and large meal the shiner offers. It's a drop dead kick butt bait at this time of year. Leave those dreams of hooking a 15 pound trophy bass on artificial baits to the stubborn bass fishermen who will probably go home without one.</p>
<p class="norm">Always book your trophy trip with a guide that has plenty of live shiner fishing experience. Not any old fishing guide will do. In reality the more shiners a guide fishes with the better he gets, experience counts. Big bass are caught daily by experienced shiner guides.</p>
<p class="norm">Consult a first-class solar/lunar calendar and book your bass fishing trip on the preferred days. Call early and book ahead to be sure you get the best date possible. <br>
What are the best days each month? </p>
<p class="norm">Every month, days around the new moon are very good for producing BIG TROPHY BASS. They are the darkest nights of the month and most anglers know that the big bass will feed at night. If they miss a meal or two they will be out early the next day making up for those meals. On these nights the low light conditions hold plenty of big bass in check. As soon as the sun comes out they will be on the hunt.</p>
<p class="norm">The half moon days are always great fishing days. <br>
The activity of bass is on the rise so you should catch more bass thus increasing your odds of a lunker. <br>
Finally book the highest activity days with the main bite falling in the morning hours between 6 am. and noon.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="norm">Lastly book the highest activity days left but be sure to pay attention to that late afternoon bite. If you book a half a day and fish in the morning on an afternoon bite you just might shoot yourself in the foot. There is no hard and firm rules when it comes to bass fishing. In general this info should help you to choose the best dates and times possible.</p>
<p class="norm">Finally try and fish Tuesday through Friday. Local weekenders can crowd the lake and sore mouth the bass. Leave Monday as a day for the fish to recover. If you don't have the time to wait and must book choose any day. </p>
<p class="norm"><img src="images/bass_success2.jpg" width="144" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">Heck you never know it's fishing!</p>
<p class="norm">Now timing and luck have a lot to with your results even if you have taken the time and booked ahead and chosen the best dates. Live shiners are the ticket November through May. February 14th every year the bait is very difficult to come by. Only the best prepared guides will have bait. The bait is in the spawn mode at this time and things don't get better until around May 10th. After this date shiners are not a problem.</p>
<p class="norm">Generally you could avoid the shiner shortage by booking before the 14th of February and after may 10th. The kicker is some of the largest lunkers of the season will come at this time of the year.  We pride ourselves on having the bait. The guides who have shiners during this period usually <br>
are busy catching Trophy bass. </p>
<p class="norm">Let's talk about artificials. </p>
<p class="norm">When you fish for lunker bass in a day try live wild golden shiners and plenty of them. Fish them hard, use all of the shiners first before you go with the artificials. Two bad things could happen. First you will probably miss that lunker <br>
when she bites your shiner while your wetting your worm. Second all the noise and commotion of casting and retrieving artificials might scare the big girls in a direction away from your live bait. There is a time and place for artificials and that's when all the shiners are through and the gear is packed away. </p>
<p class="norm">Now you can artificial fish with concentration and confidence. It's all about how you wiggle your worm now. The best result's using artificials is mid May through October. Higher water temps weaken the live bait and the bass don't want such a heavy meal during the heat of the day. It can be harder for them to digest such a large meal. Spring ,Summer and the start of fall are killer months for  using artificials. Shiners become an after thought. </p>
<p class="norm">Summer rains create loads of opportunity with moving water, bass stack up and are easy to catch, and most presentations work. May through October is for artificials and half days beat all the heat and most thunderstorms. Large trophy bass are caught all summer long on plastic baits and shiners.</p>
<p class="norm">Now as pro bass fishing guides we transition through the change from all shiners to just a few. They are the preferred bait year round for lunker bass. In general you will have the best luck trophy fishing  using live wild golden shiners October through May. A mix of wild shiners and artificials are 
used June through September with excellent results. </p>
<p class="norm"><img src="images/bass_success3.jpg" width="136" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left">Our guides, gear and boat will be in excellent condition. Comfort is high on the list when it comes to fishing for trophy bass, individual fishing chairs and soft carpeting will keep you fresh all day. Clean and first-rate working rods and reels will increase your odds of landing that lunker. Your choice of spinners or bait casters, right-hand or left-hand retrieve will help you feel comfortable with the equipment and the results will be you landing more fish. </p>
<p class="norm">Finally the guide is there to put you on fish and cater to all of your needs.. Instructing you to the best of his or her ability so you can be as successful as possible. Taking good quality photos will give you a lasting memory of your fishing experience. Be sure to have a camera on hand, the more shots we take the better our chances of  getting that perfect photo of you and your lunker. Measuring and weighing your trophy bass along with a great photo will <br>
allow you to have a replica made without harvesting the fish. It will look exactly like the fish you caught. </p>
<p class="norm">We practice immediate catch and release! You should too.<br>
</p>
<p class="norm">All of the above info will help you to have the best Florida trophy bass fishing trip ever. </p>
