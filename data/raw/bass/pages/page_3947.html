After having just successfully resolved my seemingly endless debate on what to eat for lunch, I was not looking to make the now necessitated pilgrimage from my desk to the kitchen. Another roadblock. You must understand the importance I attach to this daily dilemma, as I don’t consider the corner deli, complete with its germ infested community buffet buckets, the Wendy’s, or even worse, the company cafeteria, reasonable options for my lunch, in spite of my colleagues’ chronic teasing.  The meal always counts.<br><br>  It’s just when I’m finishing up that I receive my daily solicitation for a restaurant recommendation. Now, bear in mind that this is no new phenomenon for me.  I receive at least one request for a recommendation every day by someone, be it friends, family, business associates etc.  I can’t pinpoint when I developed such a following, but I’ve happily accepted the job.  For I am a true believer that advice of this delicate and precise a nature should never be handled by an amateur, it requires a certain level of expertise by someone who really knows.<br><br>To introduce myself properly I should tell you that my “real” job couldn’t be a further departure from the “AskILYSA” side job that I entertain. I trade fixed income products at a commercial bank in midtown.  It’s not a bad gig, but I won’t go in to further detail about my banking <i>business</i>, as the focus here is on maximizing the all-important NY restaurant experience. And restaurants, while often a backdrop for <i>business</i> gatherings, are undeniably best enjoyed in social company.   Of course even the blandest of business dinners can be transformed in to a social event when the right restaurant is host for the night.  Consider setting up dinner at a restaurant with interesting, eclectic food, (food that YOU know, that YOU order) and watch how the conversation takes shape around the ordering, the menu, the meal, and your skillful palette.  It’s all about calculating your intended results.  And those of you who love and patronize restaurants like I do know that restaurants, correction, the right restaurants, are as much about indulging your social appetite as they are about enjoying the food.<br><br> The NY social scene is at all ages and stages centered on going out and experiencing the city.  It makes sense when you think about it.  I mean how else do so many of us live in apartments that could better pass for walk-in closets than for homes?  Hence, being particular about where you spend your time outside of your home is crucial. I have made it my business to learn, and prioritize, the art of “restaurant pairing”- a sommelier of sorts, if you will. I mean, you just don’t send a guy to Carmine’s for a family style red sauce explosion to surprise his new girlfriend on her birthday, even if you swear by the food.  Just as you would want someone to point out that Shore, a new New England style seafood restaurant in Tribeca has a tiny, secluded, almost private room, perfect for two, (easily reserved at no extra cost),that is intimate and charming and makes the whole setting just about you and your significant other. I’ve seen people suggest Serafina Downtown for their almost deaf grandma, where she’ll almost certainly lose the rest of hearing by night’s end. Or bring their totally steak and potatoes future father in law to Po for a dainty tasting menu? <i> Forethought, my friends, is too often undervalued when up against hindsight.</i>  I guess that’s how I became the restaurant maven I am today. I am always anxious to enhance other peoples’ experiences and enthusiasm for dining out in the city. What can I say- it gets me excited.  I feel like I scored when the girl invites the date back after a most impressive steak au poivre, or when the managing director emails the lowly associate the morning after seeking the list of what was ordered at dinner.  I feel responsible for these successes through my careful suggestions.  Understand though, that my suggestions are slanted, as I cater to a young-ish (or young spirited), social, sophisticated NY scene. <b>Don’t think of me as a competitor to Zagat; I am a restaurant “specialist”, where Zagat, while wonderful, and by my side at all times, is more of an HMO.</b><br><br>I want to circle back to the beginning (no, not of my life story), but to the question that initiated the page of ramblings, which you have just endured.  The restaurant question.  My dear friend Jon was the gentleman at the other end of the phone this afternoon; the seeker of the perfect find. “ Dating on the run” we’ll call his situation. He was in from LA for a week and wanted to make a good impression quickly. Well, you neither has to be a guy nor a visitor to know the importance of making the first impression count.  Seeing that he was fairly specific about the type of atmosphere he was shooting for, the company, the mood, etc., this was a fairly easy request for me.  I always give a few ideas with a lot of specifics when handing out suggestions, for I believe that you always need a bit of variety, or flavor, in your choices, just as you would want in your meal. I directed him to Fiamma, Il Buco, Bond Street (upstairs), and Asia De Cuba. After careful consideration my descriptions led him to choose Fiamma.  Indulge me for a moment, and I will offer the same to you:<br></font></td>

<br><b>Fiamma</b> is a fairly new, about a year old, Italian place in Soho. It’s one, of the many, Stephen Hanson restaurants (i.e. Blue Water Grill, Ruby Foos, Dos Caminos, etc) but this one attempts, and succeeds at being a more upscale, more special, and yes more pricey place than its other siblings. The restaurant, is not only in the most fashionable part of town, but appropriately looks the part. It’s a very sleek, modern restaurant, featuring a glass elevator, real sexy lighting, and a lively bar/lounge area.  Sit upstairs for the better scene. Think hip. Think stylish. The tables are far enough apart that you aren’t sitting on your neighbors’ lap, and the noise level is enough to suggest that it’s a hot place, but not of the shouting across the table order.  The food is consistently excellent, as is the service. I highly recommend trying one of the pasta dishes. The stracci with the braised rabbit bolognese sauce and the garganelli with prosciutto, peas, and truffle butter are extremely well executed and delicious. The veal chop, seared and served with asparagus is also tender, tasty, and presented beautifully.  The menu also includes a few varieties of fish, chicken, and steak.  There is a wide selection of appetizers, none of which have disappointed thus far. There is an extensive and creative drink menu and you’ll see many a martini glass pass you by, with many a colorful cocktail inside.  They are generous with the alcohol and the portions, which is always a perk.  The bill, as usual, is largely correlated to your drinking habit. For two people, two appetizers, two entrees and 4-5 drinks, you’re probably looking at $120 plus tip. Desserts run another $7-$10.  This place is a definite keeper.
<br>
<br>While I can’t promise that the date will be a success, I am most confident the restaurant will do its part.  I am of the school that subscribes to dinner as the best activity for a first date; especially if I’m involved in executing the event.
<br>
<br>  I plan to write a weekly situational restaurant column, not unlike what you just read (sans the lengthy introduction), and distribute it, free of charge to all those willing, hopefully wanting, to read it.  I also want to encourage, even insist, that you, the reader, start to get involved. A service website, www.askilysa.com is currently under construction.  In the meanwhile, please email your restaurant questions to me at ilysa@askilysa.com.  I can handle all types of situations, occasions, and intentions.  I will try and answer every question I receive. (Please allow 24-48hrs).  The more detail you give me, the better I can tailor the answer to you. Test me out. I won’t disappoint. AND PASS IT ON!!!
