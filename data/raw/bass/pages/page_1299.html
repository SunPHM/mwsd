of Blues' Highway 61</H2>

<P>Blues aficionados are in for a rare treat Nov. 21 when the House of 
Blues/Southern
Comfort presents &quot;The Highway 61 Tour&quot; starring Buddy Guy and
his band with the Blind Boys of Alabama and Billy Boy Arnold at 8 p.m. 
Nov.
21 on the mainstage of the Lied Center for Performing Arts.</P>

<P>Highway 61 is a musical adventure that takes the audience on a 
multi-media
journey through the history of the blues. Using music, film and 
narrative,
the performance traces the historical and geographic progression of the
blues from its gospel roots to the Mississippi Delta to the rhythm and 
blues
of the Memphis era to the modern sounds of urban-influenced Chicago 
Blues.</P>

<P>More than just a concert, Highway 61 is a scripted presentation, 
theatrically
and musically oriented. The audience is treated to a multi-media affair
of music and visual arts, including rare film footage.</P>

<P>House of Blues, a collaboration between Isaac Tigrett of Hard Rock 
Cafe
fame, and actor Dan Aykroyd, an original &quot;Blues Brother,&quot; 
celebrates
the diversity of world culture and promotes and nurtures live blues music

as a unique American art form.</P>

<P>Headliner Buddy Guy is no stranger to the blues. During a 40-year 
career,
Guy has won the title &quot;Greatest Living Electric Blues 
Artist.&quot;</P>

<P>A four-time Grammy winner, Guy's distortion-heavy, feedback-drenched
riffs and sharp, stuttering staccato-laced leads have influenced a 
virtual
&quot;who's who&quot; of rock and blues legends, including Jimi Hendrix,
Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jimmy Page.</P>

<P>&quot;The Blues ain't the Blues unless there's a real feeling, real 
...
mileage behind the notes being played,&quot; Guy says.</P>

<P>The Blind Boys of Alabama, featuring Clarence Fountain, represent the
best of the gospel roots of the blues. Since their start in 1939, when 
these
singers began praising the Lord through song at the Talladega Institute
for the Blind in Alabama, the Blind Boys have electrified audiences with
their impassioned and powerful religious music. The Blind Boys appeared
on Broadway in 1988 and have recorded more than 20 albums in the gospel
idiom. Wooed hard by the likes of Sam Cook and B.B. King to cross over 
into
popular rock'n'roll, the Boys steadfastly refuse.</P>

<P>&quot;We have nothing against Blues music,&quot; Fountain says. 
&quot;The
difference is that in Gospel, we sing about Jesus and the Blues guys sing

about their baby.&quot;</P>

<P>Chicago native Billy Boy Arnold was 13 when he persuaded the legendary

Sonny Boy Williamson to divulge his trademark secret to 
&quot;choking&quot;
the mouth harp (harmonica). Williamson died shortly thereafter, and 
Arnold
was determined to become a bluesman. He befriended many of the local 
Chicago
blues legends, learning from the best -Muddy Waters, Otis Rush and Earl
Hooker all were influences in the young player's life. He made his first
recording at age 19 and by then had hooked up with a local street 
musician,
Bo Diddley. And while his early career flourished, he pursued more 
profitable
&quot;day jobs&quot; as a bus driver and parole officer.</P>

<P>While he never completely left the business, his career was reborn in
1992 with a new album and successful American and European tours.</P>

<P>Pre-performance talks are part of the Lied Center's ongoing education

<P>One of the most innovative chamber ensembles currently performing 
comes
to the Lied Center for Performing Arts at 8 p.m. Nov. 17. Originally 
scheduled
for Kimball Hall, this concert has moved to the Lied mainstage.</P>

<P>The ensemble was founded in 1985 by Miles Hoffman, artistic director.
Fans of public radio will recognize Hoffman's name, and perhaps his 
voice,
from his frequent commentary on National Public Radio's Performance Today

series. That program's host, Martin Goldsmith, (shown at left), will be
a special guest during the performance providing &quot;live&quot; program

notes.</P>

<P>Five of the ensemble's seven players will perform the evening concert.

Performers are Sara Stern, flute; Min-Young Kim, violin; Hoffman, viola;
Michael Mermagen, cello; and Edward Newman, piano. The playbill, subject
to change, includes Adagio and Rondo Concertante for piano and strings,
D. 487 by Schubert; Trio in G Minor for flute, cello and piano, Opus. 63
by Von Weber; Prelude, Recitative and Variations for flute, viola and 
piano
by Durufle; and Quartet No. 2 in G Minor for piano and strings by 
Faure.</P>

<P>The American Chamber Players is composed of a core group of musicians
from the Library of Congress Summer Chamber Festival. They perform 
repertoire
ranging from familiar masterpieces to neglected gems, to newly 
commissioned
works by American composers. Critics have praised their concerts with 
superlatives
like &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;flawless.&quot; Their playing has 
been
called intense, passionate and accurate; their programming expressive and

rapturously played.</P>

<P>Hoffman, a violist, delivers a weekly talk on Performance Today titled

&quot;Coming to Terms,&quot; in which he and Goldsmith chat about a 
musical
term or idiom or discuss why the conductor waves her baton. He believes
that giving chamber music a &quot;human voice&quot; helps today's 
audiences
warm up to this art form, which has suffered a reputation for stuffiness
and inaccessibility.</P>

<P>Pre-performance talks, delivered by Goldsmith, are part of the Lied 
Center's
ongoing education programming. The talks begin in the Lied's Steinhart 
Room
55 minutes and 30 minutes prior to curtain.</P>

<P>Tickets for the performance are $26 and $21. University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln,
Nebraska Wesleyan University and Doane College students and youth 18 and
younger with proper identification can purchase tickets for 
half-price.</P>

<P>Call the Lied Box Office at 472-4747 or toll free, (800) 432-3231 for
ticket availability. Box Office hours are 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays.
On performance weekdays, the Box Office is open from 11 a.m. through the
first intermission. For evening performances on weekends, the Box Office
opens at 3 p.m.</P>

<P>The American Chamber Players with Miles Hoffman are presented as part
of a Lied Center collaboration with Nebraska Public Radio Network, the 
University
of Nebraska at Kearney, the Nebraska Music Educators Association and 
Chadron
State College. The week-long residency will begin in Lincoln with two 
days
of outreach activities and the Lied Center performance. It continues in
Kearney with performances and educational activities at UNK as part of 
the
music educators' annual conference and concludes with outreach activities

and a performance sponsored by Chadron State College. Nebraska Public 
Radio
co-sponsors the engagement and provides on-air programming and publicity
throughout the state. Nebraska Public Radio personnel will also accompany

The American Chamber Players on the journey through the state.</P>

<H2>Jazz Gig Highlights School of Music's November Schedule<IMG 
SRC="guitar.jpg"
WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="330" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></H2>

<P>The School of Music presents faculty member Rusty White, bass, with 
guitar
virtuoso Gene Bertoncini, (shown at left) at a free concert 8 p.m. Nov.
12 in Kimball Hall. </P>

<P>Bertoncini has firmly established himself as one of the most eloquent
and versatile masters of the guitar. With elegance and ease, he bridges
the jazz, classical, pop, and bossa nova styles, integrating his own 
spontaneous
and tasteful improvisations along the way. He has earned highest critical

regard for his artistry on both the classical and electric guitar.</P>

<P>Bertoncini's musical roots go back to his early years in the Bronx 
where
he grew up in a house filled with music. His love affair with the guitar
began when he was 7, and by the time he was 16, he has appearing on New
York television. His career took an unusual turn when he decided to 
fulfill
another long-standing interest, and took a degree in architecture at 
Notre
Dame. He was quickly swept into the musical scene at the university, and
the first thing he did after picking up his degree was to work opposite
Carmen McRae in Chicago. He returned to New York to work with 
vibraphonist
Mike Manieri, and then with a quintet led by drummer Buddy Rich.</P>

<P>He describes the architectural experience as something which gives his

music its finely-wrought form and style. He wins continual praise for the

superb structure of his arrangements and improvisations which serve as a
vehicle for his virtuosic technique.</P>

<P>Bertoncini has worked with the Metropolitan Opera orchestra, the Benny

Goodman Sextet; singers Tony Bennett, Morgana King, Lena Horne, Vic 
Damone
and Edye Gorme; jazzmen Buddy Rich, Wayne Shorter, Hubert Laws, Clark 
Terry,
Paul Desmond, and Paul Winter; and arranger/composers Lalo Schifrin and
Michael LeGrand, among others. He has performed regularly on the Merv 
Griffin
and Johnny Carson shows, and has been one of the most prolific and 
popular
studio musicians in New York City. For the past eight years Bertoncini 
has
performed with bassist Michael Moore in a duo which The New York Times 
describes
as &quot;one of the finest pairings of jazz strings.&quot;</P>

<P>Bertoncini's teaching credits include the Eastman School of Music 
where
he regularly performs and conducts summer workshops for jazz guitarists,
the New England Conservatory, New York University, and the Banff School
of Fine Arts. He has been a highly sought-after guest clinician in 
colleges
and universities throughout the country.</P>

professor of double bass and jazz
performance at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He holds a master of
music degree from North Texas State University and a bachelor of music 
degree
from the College Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati. Prior to his 
present
appointment, he was a member of the faculty at Morehead State University
in Kentucky, where he was involved in the jazz and theory programs. White

has studied jazz education with some of the most prominent figures in the

field such as Jamey Aebersold, Bill Dobbins, Dan Haerle, and Rich 
Matteson.

<H2>Raz to Perform Fatherland in Grand Island</H2>

<P>Theater artist and juggler Jeff Raz will perform his one-person play
Fatherland at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 10 at the Grand Island High School 
Auditorium.
The performance is free and open to the public.</P>

<P>Raz visits Nebraska as part of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln 
College
of Fine and Performing Arts' Artist Diversity Residency Program. The 
program
brings to the campus and the state artists from diverse backgrounds to 
address
broad themes of general academic interest.</P>

<P>Raz deals with issues of Jewish identity and anti-Semitism in the 
context
of his own story, which he has dramatized in his play Fatherland.</P>

<P>Jewish identity became an issue for Raz during a 1989 vacation in 
Germany.
The trip included a visit to Berlin that coincided with the fall of the
Berlin Wall. Traveling through the country, he visited Dachau, where he
viewed photographs of the camp taken by the liberating forces. He 
imagined
some of the shots could have been taken by his father, who was a 
photographer
with the American occupation forces in World War II and who died in 1966
when Jeff was 8.</P>

<P>His father left behind a box of war memorabilia, including letters and

pictures he sent home from the front, that proved invaluable in the 
writing
of Fatherland.</P>

<P>Fatherland, written with director Jael Weisman, grew out of Raz's 
struggle
with this Dachau experience. Using minimal props and a liberal dose of 
juggling
and acrobatics, Raz weaves numerous characters into Fatherland, including

himself and the spirit of his father, a man he barely knew. </P>

<P>Raz has performed the play several times in Lincoln and other venues
across the country. In his classes, he performs pieces from Fatherland 
and
weaves in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, essays by Israeli writer Amos

Oz and vaudeville sketches, as well as students' own stories.</P>

<P>Raz, who lives in San Francisco, began his performing career at 15, 
working
as a street juggler around the Bay area. He was a clown, acrobat and 
juggler
with the J.P. Booker Early American Circus, Make*A*Circus and the Bay 
City
Reds. For the last five years, he has worked with Diane Wasnak as the 
acrobatic
clown duet, Pino &amp; Razz, at the core of the New Pickle Circus.</P>

<P>Along with his circus performing, Raz is an actor, director and 
playwright,
and teaches physical theater, acrobatics and clowning. He is an 
artist-in-residence
at the University of Nebraska in its Artist Diversity Residency Program,
using physical theater and storytelling as antidotes to cultural 
animosity.
In all his work, Raz explores the rich terrain where circus, music and 
theater
intersect.</P>

<P>This program is funded in part by the Heartland Arts Fund.</P>

<H2>Sociologist Allen Discusses Alternative Farming on Welsch &amp;</H2>

<P>Hear about some bizarre farming alternatives when John Allen, Ph.D.,
rural sociologist and acting director of IANR's Center for Rural 
Community
Revitalization and Development, appears on Roger Welsch &amp; at 8:30 
p.m.
Nov. 20 on the statewide Nebraska ETV Network.</P>

<P>Welsch comments, &quot;Farming is a gamble. You put some seeds in the
ground, wait for rain and hope for the best. But there are some farmers
who take even more risks by getting involved in 'entrepreneurial 
agriculture.'
They go off in unlikely directions and use almost bizarre alternatives,
making an already risky occupation even more uncertain. John Allen has 
written
about this new trend, and he'll tell us more about it this 
week.&quot;</P>

<P>The weekly television series features humorist and author Welsch in 
discussion
with a variety of Nebraskans - from authors and educators to historians
and prominent citizens - whose contributions to the good life in Nebraska

make for interesting conversation.</P>

<H2>Outdoor Nebraska Airs Nov. 12</H2>

<P>A disabled man able to hunt, ways to preserve fall foliage and a 
haunted
hollow are featured this week on Outdoor Nebraska. The outdoor news 
magazine
series airs at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 12 on the statewide Nebraska ETV Network.
The program repeats at 8 a.m. Nov. 14.</P>

<P>In the first feature, Outdoor Nebraska goes deer hunting with Jeff 
Whalen,
a North Platte resident who was electrocuted while cleaning up after a 
1980
Grand Island tornado. With permanent disabilities from the accident, 
Whalen
was largely excluded from outdoor activities, including bow hunting. 
Recently,
he discovered that he is physically able to work a crossbow and that his
impairment allows him to legally hunt with this weapon.</P>

<P>The second feature takes a look at the completed aquatic habitat work
at Soldier Creek near Fort Robinson. A forest fire and subsequent floods
damaged this trout fishery. Restorative work was finished this past 
summer,
and a Crawford angler, Keith Bruning, spent much of October enjoying 
great
trout fishing success on the creek. Outdoor Nebraska goes fly fishing 
with
Bruning on a beautiful fall morning.</P>

<P>In the &quot;Wilderness Workshop&quot; segment, viewers can expect to
learn some wonderful new tips from outdoor expert Dick Turpin. In the 
&quot;Nature
Walk&quot; segment, outdoor educator Carl Wolfe talks about the science
of color changes on leaves during autumn and will demonstrate ways that
you and your youngsters can preserve fall foliage for crafts and 
decorations.</P>

<P>And this week's &quot;Nebraskaland Moment&quot; extends Halloween's 
scare
with a visit to a haunted hollow at Indian Cave State Park.</TD></TR>
