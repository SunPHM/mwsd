<A HREF="Images/BagpipeColl/Borderpipe.JPG"><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="Images/BagpipeColl/Borderpipe.GIF" WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="72" ALT="Border pipes"></A>
<b>Scottish border pipe</b> or <b>Lowland pipe</b> - bellows-blown in the key of A with a conical bore chanter, one bass and one tenor drone (both tuned 
to A), and one treble drone (tuned to E).  Made of African blackwood with brass and imitation ivory mounts by Alan.  Chanter by Colin Ross of Monkseaton, 
Northumberland, bellows by Hamish Moore of Scotland.  The cowhide bag by Alan is covered with a 'Shepherd Check' woolen bagcover trimmed with black wool 
fringe made by Sandra Woodard of Campbell, CA. Special to this bagpipe are the arraingement of the blowpipe and drone stocks in the bag, and also the drone 
cut-off lever; common features found on the Irish uilleann pipe, but less typical to that of Scottish and Northumbrian border pipes.

<b>Lancashire</b> or <b>"North Counties" bagpipe</b> - in the key of G with a conical bore chanter and octave and fifth tuned cylindrical bore drones.

"trumpet bell" larger drone is tuned a fifth below the smaller drone.  Made of mountain mahogany with imitation ivory, water buffalo and cow horn mounts by Alan

<A HREF="Images/BagpipeColl/Doublepipe.JPG"><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="Images/BagpipeColl/Doublepipe.GIF" WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="100" ALT="German sackpfeife"></A>
<b>Cornish double-pipe</b> - This bagpipe, made by my old friend and mentor <A HREF="BobT.html">Bob Thomas</A> (RIP), was called  
"a Welsh double-pipe" by a couple of it's previous owners.  After receiving several emails with comments as to it's origin (some called it a Magdeburger sch&auml;eferpfeife), 
Neb Lecic, a Canadian piper from Toronto, finally set me on the right track. After visiting <A HREF="http://www.bagpipeworld.co.uk/Reconstructions/Reconsearch.htm">Chris 
Bailey's site</A>, and having viewed his reconstruction of a Cornish double-pipe based upon the curious bench-end carvings in the church of St. Nonna, Altarnun, Cornwall, I am 
fairly convinced that Bob's intension was to reconstruct his own version based on the carvings.  A unique element of this bagpipe, are the separate short octagonal 
sections connecting each of the chanters to the headstock.  This allows, as Chris Bailey points out with his model, the ability to convert each chanter to a mouth-blown 
wind-cap "cornemuse."  Each chanter has the full compliment of finger holes, allowing it to be played with both hands as a single melody pipe.  By removing, or blocking-off one 
or the other of the chanters, the instrument can be played as a single-chanter bagpipe.  The chanters can be played together (one hand on each) in the bag as shown, with the 
lower chanter being used to extend the range of the shorter one by means of blocking-off it's top holes.  Made of ? wood with a sewn cowhide bag.
