Ifattached to an email, most any format will do, because I useGraphiConvert which handles most picture formats. Remember, the onlyway you can catch fish is by going fishing. The way to get your fishon this page is, almost exclusively, you have to catch the fish inFort Cobb Lake, and I must take a digital picture of it. But I willconsider other submissions if you give me where it was caught, theday, weight, time caught, and what you were fishing with.</P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="FISH/FISH003.gif" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=301X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottomx-claris-useimagewidth x-claris-useimageheight></CENTER></P><H3>Gene maintains he caught this one below Mt Scott in LakeLawtonka, just north of Lawton. Is this possible?</H3><P>&nbsp;</P><H3>Sandbass (white bass for non-natives) are easily caught in thespring as they <A HREF="FISH/GENE.JPG">spawn up the streams</A> andaround the rocky points on Fort Cobb Lake.</H3><H3>Fall is a good time to fish, but don't believe this guy that hecaught these fish around here. Who knows<A HREF="FISH/GENE2.JPG">what</A> you might catch?</H3><H3>Retirement is good for some folks. This retired teacher, whotaught in Anadarko, shows off his skill as he holds up a better than<A HREF="FISH/FISH001.JPG">5 lb striper</A>, which hit 22 inches onthe yard stick. Took him 10 minutes to get it in, because I nettedit.

These both weighed in at about 5 lbs eachand were featured in the Anadarko Daily News, recently .... er, inNovember.</H3><H3>November 23rd the wind was out of the Northso<A HREF="FISH/FISH01.JPG"> I went fishing</A>. You never know whatyou are going to catch. <A HREF="FISH/FISH703.JPG">I caught 7fish</A> - 5 sand bass (1 lb@ &amp; 2 channel cats which weighed 2lbs each). It has been years since I bought a new fillet knife, andtonight sealed doom for the old one.</H3><H3>I caught this 3 lb,<A HREF="FISH/LBASS2.JPG"> large mouth</A> onDecember 7, 1998. It was 42 degrees out.</H3><H3>These fish were caught in the GULF by my<A HREF="FISH/ALLFISH.JPG">brother Ray</A>, though my little brother,Cecil, claims part <A HREF="FISH/BIGFISH.JPG">of the catch</A> washis, most of his fishing reports are <A HREF="FISH/BIGFISH1.JPG">pipedreams</A>.

It isprobably the first walleye of the season caught off of the dam. Itwas a female with lots of eggs that appeared to be ripe. The fish was25 inches long. It was caught, of course, by me using 8 lb test line,using a<A HREF="FISH/WALLEYH01.JPG"> Zebco 404</A> that I bought fromWalMart using a white plastic fishy with a red-headed jig.</H3><H3>March 2, 1999. One <A HREF="FISH/SBASS01.JPG">female sandbass</A>(white bass for those of you are not from Oklahoma) and a<A HREF="FISH/BASS02.JPG">2 1/2 lb female black bass</A>. Both hadimmature eggs. Both out of Fort Cobb Lake.</H3><H3>March 25, 1999. Gary, from Oklahoma City, caught this<A HREF="FISH/WALLEYE07.JPG">3 lb walleye</A> off of the Fort CobbDam, near the water let-down, a bit after 7:00 PM. It was a maleattempting to fertilize eggs along the rip-rap.</H3><H3>October 17, 1999. I caught about ten <FONTCOLOR="#9933FF"><A HREF="FISH/FISH5.JPG">sandbass</A></FONT><FONTCOLOR="#9933FF"> </FONT>(aka white bass) just before sundown at FtCobb Lake. Once the wind died down, they simply evaporated. A friendcame out just as the sun was going down, and he was skunked. I threwone back. All of these weighed 1 or 1 1/2 lbs.</H3><P><FONT SIZE="+2">The wind was right during the second week ofNovember 99, so I ventured out to the Fort Cobb Dam RipRAP and caught</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2"><A HREF="FISH/FISH5.JPG">t</A></FONT><FONTSIZE="+2"><A HREF="FISH/SBASS01.JPG">hese fish</A></FONT><FONTSIZE="+2"> just before sundown.</FONT></P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="FISH/bearfish.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=180ALIGN=bottom></CENTER></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P><H3><CENTER><FONTCOLOR="#000000"><A HREF="index.html">Back</A></FONT></CENTER></H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3><H3>&nbsp;</H3></BODY></HTML>
