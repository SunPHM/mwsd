I play and write music on a number of different instruments.  But <B>the bass guitar has always been my "main" instrument</B>, since it's the instrument that I'm best at and have been playing for the longest.
</P>
<P>
However, these days I love buying and playing a variety of instruments.  Aside from the bass I play harmonica and the mandolin most often.  I also own and dabble in the ukulele, the balalaika, melodica, kalimba, wooden flute, tin whistle, recorder, and percussion.  I also sing, which includes vocal training, studying the limits of my voice, and optimizing it for given situations.
</P>
<H2>Why bass guitar and not the upright bass (a.k.a. double bass)?</H2>

<H2>But why bass guitar?</H2>
<P>I originally liked playing around with keyboards when I was a kid, but I never went too far beyond the tinkering stage.  Then when I was 12 I wanted to play drums.  But like many at that age, I had no a job and thus not much money.  On my birthday I was able to get a snare drum and crash cymbal.  My next goal was to get a bass drum, so I could at least say I had "a drum set".
</P>
<P>My dad was a bass player and around this time I was also playing with his old bass guitar, the "Jack Bruce" Gibson EB-3.  So Xmas comes and I see a big box in wrapping paper.  I thought "Oh boy, this must be the bass drum I've been wanting!"  But no, it was an amplifier.  My dad had thought I wanted to take up bass, not drums.  I realized this was going to be easier than ever owning a drum set, so I declined his offer to return the amp.  And that was that.</P>

<H2>Why all those other instruments?</H2>
<P>
After playing bass for so many years and being disillusioned with the whole
rock band scene, I was starting to get bored with the instrument.  The 
interest to just pick up n' play was no longer there.  I also hated having
to lug heavy equipment.  So I looked into other things.  I also
admired the work of other bass players who actually play a variety of
other instruments, like Sting, John Paul Jones, and Les Claypool.
</P>
<P>
I didn't want to pick up the guitar or drums.  The world has too many
guitar players, and I wanted to play something less conventional.
I'm hardly the only bass player who additionally picked up the 
mandolin.  In some situations, it complements a guitar just as well as
a bass could, but it's acoustic and much more portable.  Harmonica 
always interested me, but I didn't start playing seriously until a few 
years ago.  I have a case of a dozen or so different-keyed
harmonicas (I prefer Lee Oskar's brand), which I take along to karaoke
every week.  Yes, I know karaoke is the bottom rung of the musician 
spectrum, but damnit, it's fun!
</P>
<P>
The other instruments I got from numerous places.  I know I first saw the 
melodica when I was a kid, on a couple of music videos on Mtv (The Hooters'
"And We Danced"; Cindy Lauper's "Money Changes Everything").  Though
when I saw The Residents use one live in 2002, I knew I wanted to get one!
I bought my first kalimba that week at Disneyland.  My parents bought 
me a wooden flute, and that got me interested in the tin whistle and 
recorder.  I bought my balalaika from somebody after playing it
in their home.  Other instruments I'd just stumble across in a store.

<H2>How do you approach an instrument you've never played before?</H2>
<P>
It's fun to "tinker around" with a new instrument, but if you want to
really get somewhere with it, I think you have to sit down and study it.  The great thing 
about music theory is that it's pretty much universal; the notes
that make up, for example, a G minor scale are going to be the 
same no matter what instrument it is.  So when I get a new instrument,
I practice the physical technique and then started applying the 
music theory to figure out what notes I can get out of the instrument, 
and from there how to play certain types of chords or scales.
</P>
<P>
On stringed instruments that are tuned differently, it might take
me some mental adjustment to switch from one to another, as the 
fingering patterns you learn for certain riffs or scales will
differ.  But I find that a little patience can go a long way.
</P>

<H2>What kind of music do you play?</H2>
<P>
This was a really hard question for me to answer.  Bear with me here:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>First of all, what I like to <A HREF="music.html">listen to</A> is often different from what I like to play.
<LI>I LOVE playing jazz.  I know "jazz" is as vague a term as "rock", so to be a little more specific I like swing stuff with walking bass lines, latin jazz, and improvisational jams.  I especially love the technical challenge of being given a set of chord changes and applying music theory to find out what fits (probably related to my love of math.)  This is what I did most of the time when I played in my high school and college's jazz ensembles: got handed a set of chord changes from <A HREF="http://shermusic.com">The Real Book</A>, and was asked to do a walk over the changes.  But again, I rarely listen to jazz, and hardly have any in my collection.
<LI>Once in a while I do sit down with my bass and a CD, and play along.  If it's been a while, I have to relearn some of the songs.  But it's always fun.  The bands I find myself going back to include Fishbone, Iron Maiden, The Police, Mr. Big, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and Led Zeppelin.  I've even contributed some transcriptions to the <A HREF = "http://www.olga.net">On-line Guitar Archive</A> (OLGA).

<LI>Similarly, I like playing cover tunes.  Unfortunately, it's hard finding other musicians these days that know lots and lots of covers.  Or maybe I just don't run into them enough.
<LI>I like playing improvisational stuff.  Just picking a key and having all the musicians "feed" off of each other.  But again, I strangely don't listen to too much of this type of music on my own (a la Phish, Grateful Dead, etc.)
</UL>

<P>So...make of all that what you will!</P>

<H2>Striving for the Best of Both</H2>
<P><I>Q: How do you get a guitar player to stop playing?<BR>
A: Put sheet music in front of him</I>
</P>
<P>
Here is a prevailing attitude that I see in most rock musicians over the last generation or two, and why I think it's quite false:
</P>


<P>
It's the notion that the only two categories for musicians are "unschooled and full of expressively emotional playing" and "overschooled and playing too technical-sounding".  I do NOT buy this "strength = weakness", pseudo-Buddhist idea.  The people who say things like this are always those who, deep inside, think they have to have an excuse for not taking the time to better their skills.  Or worse, feel they have to cut down on more skilled people in order to make themselves feel better.  It's a defensive tactic to make the person who DOES know how to read sheet music, look somehow "worse".  It's one thing to not know how to read sheet music, or to admit that you simply don't need it for what you're doing.  But to take PRIDE in the lack of an ability is ridiculous.  Please re-read that last sentence.
</P>
<P>
So many people have deluded themselves into thinking that technique and feel are this teeter-totter of skills, and if you take the time to learn more about music theory and your instrument, it takes away the "emotion" from your music.  Now I've certainly played with guitarists who insisted on having flashy solos the verse of every song, but I've also played with Cobain-worshipping guitarists who scoffed at learning scales but then stared at me blankly when I said "This is in the key of G-minor."  And BOTH of these types were annoying to jam with.</P>

<P>There's nothing that says you can't know all your scales and chords, AND play music that non-musicians are going to like too.  Sure, there have been plenty of great unschooled musicians (Jimi Hendrix, Paul McCartney) but plenty of schooled ones too (Randy Newman, Quincy Jones, Melissa Etheridge, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Tori Amos).  In fact, the best musicians I've ever played with have been those who knew their stuff, and also knew how to best use it.
</P>

<H2>Band History - preface</H2>
<P>
At the time of this writing, I'm not in a band.  And to be honest, I'm not looking to be in one anytime soon.  Here's why:
<UL>
<LI>I don't aspire to be a full-time musician.  Most bands include at least one person who does.
<LI>Too often I've been willing to play what other people in the band wanted to play, while they weren't willing to do the same (even if it was compatible with the band's style).
<LI>I'm not so sure that one single band could satisfy my musicial desires.
<LI>I don't miss Tuesday night gigs where I have to double-park in the streets of Boston during a snow storm, unload heavy equipment with frozen fingers, get no sound check, have nobody in the audience hear the bass through the entire show, being forced to sit through all the other shitty bands on that night, and ending up owing the club money.
<LI>In short, the pains outweigh the pleasures.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
But there's good news, which is so obvious that it escaped me for years.  YOU DON'T NEED A BAND TO MAKE MUSIC!  The price of recording equipment is at an all-time low.  You can even get software for under $100 to turn your computer into a multi-track digital recording studio.  There are even professionals who have proved this: The White Stripes, They Might Be Giants, The Pet Shop Boys, Faith and the Muse.  These are but a few examples of "bands" that really consist of only 2 people, who grab other musicians only when they want to record an album or tour.  Now THAT'S the kind of thing I want to do!
</P>

<H2>Band History</H2>

<P>
When I was 13 or 14, I sang with a band with others around that age.  We went under the name "Conspiracy".  Shortly after I was playing bass in a joke band called The Dirty Dicks.  In the years that followed, I was in countless short-lived bands with others from the neighborhood.  By high school I was in a band that I played my very first live show with, The Clay Veggies.  Around that same time I joined a band called Black Lung.  (I heard there's another "Black Lung" with albums out.  No relation.)  Black Lung was originally a speed metal band, but over the years several members came and went, and the styles changed.  We went through other names like Time Box and Ursula.  Eventually we evolved into a jazz/rock improvisational band called Tic Toc Man.  That band officially broke up right around the time I finished college, and in 1999 I joined Black Belt Jones.  They split up by the end of the year.  I still see the remaining members in the bands they've formed since then, <A HREF="http://www.plank63.com">Plank 63</A>, <A HREF="http://www.marieschildren.com/">Marie's Children</A> and <A HREF="http://www.crashalchemist.net">Crash Alchemist</A>.
</P>


<H2>And All That Jazz</H2>
<P>
Though I really don't listen to any jazz, I do enjoy playing it.  I know "jazz" is a vauge term, so more specifically, I enjoy playing latin jazz and especially small-band instrumental stuff.  It probably originates from playing in my high school's jazz ensemble.  And as I said before, I like music theory (maybe it's related to my love for math), and jazz is a very theory-applicable music form.  
</P>
<P>
My old band, Tic Toc Man, was very improvisational and jazz-influenced.  I still get together once in a great while with those guys to jam.  Usually we pick a piece from the Real Book or pick a scale or progression and just go from there.  And as for my improvisation skills, I give 99% credit of that to my knowledge of scales!
</P>

<H2>Some more thoughts from this musician:</H2>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>I'm a big advocate of learning music theory (scales, chords, sheet music, etc. and how they relate to each other)
<LI>I don't use tube amps, nor play Fender basses.  You analog purists are just going to have to accept the fact that not everybody likes these things.  (YES, I know I'm playing a Fender in the first photo, but it belonged to the other bassist, and I was just using his equipment that night for convenience.)
<LI>Speaking of myopic musicians: please note that neither Jaco Pastorius nor Geddy Lee is my favorite bass player.  Hell, they're not even in my top 10.  Sure, they've had an amazing influence on the bass world.  But they're still not my top favorites.  I don't put them on a pedestal.
<LI>I think digital effects are fun.  
<LI>I don't particularly desire a full-time career as a musician.  I enjoy receiving a pay check of a consistant amount, knowing when my next one is coming, and knowing that I have the same two days off every week.
