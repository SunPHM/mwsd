    Sorry I haven't posted in so long. I've been too busy and lazy. So, where did I leave off? Not much happened on Wednesday or Thursday. I had my History of Art test yesterday, which was a hard mother. Today was long as hell. I had mass today ***gags***. It is so irritating (no offense to any Catholics reading this...). Mass schedule just screws up my biological clock...not that it wasn't all ready screwed up by lack of slep, sugar, and caffeine. By the way, I gave up caffine for Lent. Yeah, not fun. My caffeine system was replaced with blood...scaary.... I'm not totally sure why I am doing this, but I think it's for self-discipline. Hell, I wasn't even raised Catholic. I was so lucky today! I got a 95 on my religion test and was actually caught prepared for the math homewerk quiz (no one else was, since it was the second one in the unit. I think she actually enjoys to see us writhe and suffer under her torture...Then I had to walk to my friend's house after school becuase my parents couldn't pick me up from the bus stop. I saw a really good movie tonight. It was Girl, Interrupted. For those of you who don't now, it's aout this girl who checks herself into a mental intitution afer trying to kill herself and encountering the different personality types inside. The creepiest was the one played by Brittany Murphy, who was a girl that had these weird food ticks and was obsessed with chicken. She screamed boody murder when a lad put an ice cream cone near her face. It sounds funny now, but she was seriously creepy. No driver's ed tomorow. Yay. I'm werking at the play tomorrow. We'll see how that goes...<br><b>Quote of the Day</b>: "Most people have seen worse things in private than they pretend to be shocked at in public." - Edgar Watson Howe<br><b>Word of the Day</b>: tub-thumper - a vociferous supporter (as of a cause) <br><b>Random Fact of the Day</b>: Women are 37% more likely to go to a psychiatrist than men are.<br><b>Song of the Day</b>: System of a Down - Aerials<br>Life is a waterfall <br>we're one in the river <br>and one again after the fall <br>swimming through the void <br>we hear the word <br>we lose ourselves <br>but we find it all.... <br>cause we are the ones that want to play <br>always want to go <br>but you never want to stay <br>and we are the ones that want to choose <br>always want to play <br>but you never want to lose <br>aerials, in the sky <br>when you lose small mind <br>you free your life <br>life is a waterfall <br>we drink from the river <br>then we turn around and put up our walls <br>swimming through the void <br>we hear the word <br>we lose ourselves <br>but we find it all... <br>cause we are the ones that want to play <br>always want to go <br>but you never want to stay <br>and we are the ones that want to choose <br>always want to play <br>but you never want to lose <br>aerials, in the sky <br>when you lose small mind <br>you free your life <br>aerials, so up high <br>when you free your eyes eternal prize <br>aerials, in the sky <br>when you lose small mind <br>you free your life <br>aerials, so up high <br>when you free your eyes eternal prize <br></font></b>

    Updating at school again. Today happens to be my lucky day, apparently. I got an A on my English paper and don't have to go to judo today. I think I'm backing out. I can't even do a somersault or a cartwheel. Aaaaaaaaaaaack. My parents are gonna be so pissed after I tell them. Oh well. What else? I'm studying world religions in my free time. Ironic, huh (in more ways than one)? I have almost no supernatural or spiritual beliefs; I have no free time. But I did it because I was bored and needed to catch up on my literary genius reading quota. Right now I'm working on animism. I have sooo much hoemwork tomight. I have to write a six-verse poem, complete three worksheets for religion, finish a powerpoint presentation for Chem, and finish my article. Grrr. I saw a super-boring video in Spanish. Actually, I didn't <i>see</i> the video, I slept through it. I was just so tired! Nothing more to talk about. Just rambling on with my thoughts. Buh-bye now.<br><b>Quote fo the Day</b>: "The cruelest lies are often told in silence." - Robert Louis Stevenson<br><b>Word of the Day</b>: hyperbolic - exaggerating<br><b>Random Fact of the Day</b>:The average woman will have swallowed 4lbs of lipstick in her lifetime.<br><b>Song of the Day</b>: Nirvana - Come As You Are<br>Come, as you are.

    Today is a pretty slow day. No skool! Yay! I had to go to the doctor's this morning to get my blood drawn for various unecssary medical tests. It wasn't so bad. They just jammed a needle into my vein a drew about a shot-glass amount of blood. The problems is, I egt more scared with the anticipation of the pian of the needle tha the actual needle. That hapens to me a lot. I can handle pian pretty easily. It's knowing that the pain is coming that freaks me out. Oh well. Gotta do homewerk now.

    Mother. Fucker. I hate my internet. After spending about an hour trying to rack my brains and update my blog, my internet says it can't make the page appear. Dammit, dammit, dammit. Well, let me try again. On Friday, I got to cut class because of my dad's retiremnt ceremony. I was pretty nervous becuase I had to read my essay from last year's Voice of Democract contest in front of the whole crowd. I went too fast at the end, but a lot of people said it made them cry. Afterwards, I had to work at Superfair. It was pretty boring, going around selling cookies. At least I didn't have to work at the malssada booth this year. Agent Shorty was sick so it wasn't much fun. I just left her in the classroom and wandered aroung with Jessica instead. On Saturday I went to Driver's Ed (boooring....). Afterwards I went to the Superfair (again) so we could use up the rest of the scripts. My mom fulfilled her obsession for cheap plants at the plant booth and I just hung out with Min and Leah. Today I went to church (my parents haven't realized yet that I reject religion). It wasn't so bad at Sunday school. We are starting world religions. Today we started with Islam. I thought that it was good that the church is informing us about other religions rather, than, say, do an in-depth study on the book of Jude or whatever. They are actually pretty accurate about the beliefs of Islam. The only thing I don't like is then the pastor starts pointing out why the religion is "wrong" - "wrong" meaning it disagrees with the teachings of the Presbyterian church. But the pastor is pretty open-minded and asked afterwrds if anyone was offended by the class, which was polite. Afterwards I helped this little old lady my mom has Bible study classes with to move into her new apartment. I didn't do it because my parents forced me to or for community service hours, but because I felt that sometimes it's okay to be a compassionate person. It makes me so mad when people stereotype good people as "moral" Christians. Why can't agnostics be considered moral, too? ***smacks head for trying to debate deep, moral issues***  Okay, well, after that I was forced to wash the car. It wasn't so bad, because I got paid ten bucks and I got into water fight with my brother and his friend. It reminded me of a simpler time, when I didn't have to worry about college and extracurricular activities and my future and all that crap. I went inside... and here I am.<br><b>Quote of the Day</b>: "Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds." - Franklin D.
