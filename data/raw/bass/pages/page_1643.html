            <p class="innerheaders"> Who was Corsby? </p>
            <p class="body"> There is relatively little information written about 
              Corsby. In a chapter about Samuel Gilkes (1787-1827) the highly 
              researched volume - 'The British Violin' published in 2000 
              by The British Violin Making Association mentions Corsby and John 
              Morrison (1760-1827) in passing as indistinguished makers and dealers 
              of the time.</p>
            <p class="body"> More substantial is The 'Dictionary Of British Violin 
              And Bow Makers' by Dennis G. Plowright (Published in 1994 by the 
              author.) who comes up with a paragraph (nine lines) on the maker. 
              Plowright informs us that Corsby worked in Princes Street, Leicester 
              Square, London between 1790 and 1830 and confirms that the workmanship 
              is pretty ordinary and that materials are frequently of small figure. 
              He also notes that slab cut English sycamore was the favoured material 
              of construction.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> How do you know that this instrument was 
              made by Corsby?</p>
            <p class="body"> The inside table has the pencil inscription Maker 
              - Corsby / London on the upper treble side. We don't doubt 
              the authenticity of this inscription for one moment. The form and 
              style of making confirm that this is without question an instrument 
              from the early nineteenth century.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> What would you say is the making form and 
              style of the period?</p>
            <p class="body"> The following are strongly suggestive if not typical 
              of the form and style of double basses making in England in the 
              late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. </p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">The full size of instrument.</span></li>
              <li class="body"> The viol shape. </li>
              <li class="body"> The flat back with an angle break that commences 
                quite low down the upper back. </li>
              <li class="body"> The use of outside linings.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Which other English makers were producing 
              double basses in this style and form?</p>
            <p class="body"> The above four features can be seen in the majority 
              of double basses made by Joseph Hill (1715-1784) and in the instruments 
              of Corsby's contemporaries such as William Booth 1 (1780-1853) and 
              Thomas Dodd 1 (1764-1834).</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> I know that this instrument is inscribed 
              internally but are there any other pointers that this is Corsby's 
              work?</p>
            <p class="body"> Yes there are. The timber used in the manufacture 
              of this instrument is typical of Corsby's output.</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">The table wood is made from a spruce of exceedingly 
                fine grain. </span></li>
              <li class="body">The back, ribs and scroll are made of English sycamore 
                of little or no figure.</li>
              <li class="body">The back of this instrument is cut on the slab. 
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="innerheaders"> The instrument isn't exactly the most glamorous 
              I've ever seen. Why do you think I should want to buy it?</p>
            <p class="body"> This instrument may not be the most visually stunning 
              but it is most attractive for several other reasons.</p>
            <ol>
              <li class="body">Structurally it's in absolutely fabulous 
                condition. The back has a totally new brace system and centre 
                joint studs. The front boasts a new bass bar of the correct length 
                and depth. All cracks have been washed out and re-studded. There's 
                a new neck, fingerboard and set up to the highest standard imaginable. 
                </span></li>
              <li class="body">The sound. It's absolutely awesome. You'll fit 
                into any pro-section just fine with this.</li>
              <li class="body"> Price. The price tag of &pound; 26 000-00 is particularly 
                attractive. It's now virtually impossible to find any English 
                instrument of such condition and age for below this price - let 
                alone one by a known nineteenth century maker.</li>
              <li class="body">Investment potential. You're going to earn a living 
                with this instrument and by the time you retire who knows how 
                much it will be worth. We can promise you that it will certainly 
                be a great deal more than you paid for it.</li>
              <li class="body">Upgrade. If at any stage of your career you find 
                an instrument at the 'The Contrabass Shoppe' that you like even 
                more than this Corsby - then just bring it back and we'll be most 
                happy to part exchange it. </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Final words.</p>
            <p class="body"> An affordable English instrument for a professional 
              orchestral player. Absolutely tons of volume. Absolutely tons of 
              pure deep-dark mature tonal quality.</p>
