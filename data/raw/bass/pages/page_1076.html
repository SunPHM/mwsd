<p>The first time I became aware of the existence of the 12-String Bass was when 
  I pulled out the sleeve from Cheap Trick's latest release at the time&nbsp;<strong><font color="#FF8000">Heaven 
  Tonight</font></strong> (circa 1978). The black and white photo contained on 
  the sleeve was full sized and showed each member of the band with their respective 
  instruments. Rick Neilson with a small armada of guitars strapped on his shoulder, 
  Robin Zander with his trusty Rickenbacker, Bun E. Carlos with a cigarette and 
  a pair of drumsticks and finally Tom Petersson with the first ever 12-String 
  Bass. (color version from the same photo session shown below) I remember staring 
  at it wondering what the hell was that thing? As I was an aspiring bass player 
  I was fascinated with this new instrument. Upon listening to the entire album 
  I was amazed at the tone the 12-String Bass put forth. I remember looking into 
  how I could get one, but once I found out it was priced at around $2000.00 the 
  dream died right there on the spot for this 17 year old high school student. 
  Soon after &quot;at Budokan&quot; was released and I found myself drawn to the 
  sound of the 12-String Bass once again. </p>

<p>Twenty years later I broke down and purchased my very first 12-String Bass not unlike
the one Tom Petersson used back then. A custom order Hamer B12S short scale 12-String
Bass. The story of how this bass came to be is easily traced to the early days of Cheap
Trick and a mailman named Paul Hamer.</p>

<p>Apparently the 12-String Bass was a regular topic of conversation between Paul Hamer
and Tom Petersson back when Cheap Trick was still a bar band. It was during those early
years that Tom Petersson hit on his instrumental trademark. Tom's idea just came from
being in a small 3 - piece band with the need to make it sound full without getting
another musician to join the band. Tom turned to the then new Hamer Guitars to help him
turn his radical conception into reality. Rick Neilsen had become friendly with company
founder Paul Hamer during the early 70's, when Hamer was still a mailman in Philadelphia.
Since Hamer was building Rick Neilsen's trademark guitars, it was natural for them to
build Tom's 12-String Bass as well.</p>

<p>Hamer would not commit to building a full 12-String Bass at first because they felt it
would not work. They were worried about the amount of tension on the neck due to the 12
strings. Instead they started with a 10 String Bass - <b>3G's 3D's</b> (one fundamental w/
two octave strings) <b>2A's and 2'E's</b> (one fundamental w/ one octave string). Once
built, Hamer felt it would prove the design/ concept to be unfeasible and they would then
remove the 2 extra octave strings and build Tom an 8-string bass. But when the 10-string
worked just fine, they realized Tom was right, and that they should have made the
12-String Bass all along. The <strong><a HREF="quadbass.htm">Hamer Quad Bass</a></strong>
was born! The world's first 12-String Bass guitar. &nbsp;</p>
