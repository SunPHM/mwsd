</TABLE>November 24, 1998<P>Palo Alto-headquartered Kellar Bass Systems is debuting the JAM BASS Musical Instrument and MIDI Controller at the Winter NAMM Show January 28-31, 1999 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Kellar Bass Systems booth #7547 will be located in Kentia Hall, widely recognized as "Innovation Alley."
<P>
The Kellar Bass Systems Jam Bass is the world's first instrument that allows a musician to play bass and guitar independently. Because the Jam Bass is also a MIDI Controller, it can be plugged into any MIDI apparatus such as a keyboard, sequencer or computer.
<P>
According to Brad Kellar, founder and president of Kellar Bass Systems, the Jam Bass is comprised of a wafer-thin neck-back panel that duplicates the bass guitar E- and A-string notes fret by fret. The instrument, which can be mounted on virtually any guitar, attaches to the back of the guitar neck by means of a self-adhesive strip. The Jam Bass is available in two models, the e28 for electric guitars and the a20 for acoustic guitars. The Jam Bass is played with the thumb, which naturally curves under the neck, while the fingers play chords and leads on the guitar. "It sounds complicated, but if you can play a bar chord, you can play the Jam Bass," Kellar notes.
<P>
<B>Multi-Voiced Polyphonic Bass Synthesizer</B>
<P>
The Jam Bass is essentially a miniature circuit package containing a multi-voiced polyphonic bass synthesizer with audio and MIDI outputs. The instrument offers a total of 128 voices and many special functions such as voice select, transpose and auto-sustain. The Jam Bass is controlled by sequences of key presses. Keys are pressed one-at-a-time to change settings and access different voices. The circuitry is housed in a small black box (CP-1) which is connected to the neck-back panel by a ribbon cable. The player "wears" the CP-1 box by clipping it to the belt or guitar strap. The system also includes an optional foot switch for sustain and external power.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Jam-Bass2.jpg" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=261 ALIGN="left" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>
<B>Designed for Value and Fun</B>
<P>
Kellar's averred goal is to put the Jam Bass within the reach of every musician out there. "Instead of developing a larger box with more read outs and control knobs, I designed the product for value, with a lot of functions built right into the software. For example, many players have commented on the Jam Bass' fat bass sound. I accomplished that with a software patch that changes the on-board synthesizer's response," Kellar describes, "and all of the controls are accessible from the neck-back panel."
<P>
Since the instrument has a MIDI output, one can expand the capabilities by plugging the Jam Bass into another MIDI device, such as bass and drums synthesizers or a PC MIDI computer.
<P>
"When new players see the Jam Bass for the first time they are usually a little hesitant, but soon they start to make music and have a lot of fun. As a bass player, I wanted to be able to play guitar too, but I also wanted guitarists to experience the joy of playing bass and really feel that BIG BOTTOM. I have fun playing the Jam Bass and hope other people enjoy it too," Kellar remarks.
<P>
The estimated list price for the KBS-101 package, which includes the circuit pack and neck-back strip, will be $379. The optional sustain pedal / power supply lists at $62. The system should be available world-wide in February '99. Prices and dates are subject to change however.
<P>
<B>The Kellar Bass Systems Story</B>
<P>
Kellar, an electrical engineer with a specialty in product development, is also an accomplished musician, playing several instruments including bass, Hammond organ and drums. Born in New York in 1955, Kellar's family moved to the New Jersey suburbs, not far from Thomas Edison's laboratory. In fact, Kellar dreamed of working for Bell Labs someday, but the British Invasion of the '60s intervened and in 8th grade, he started playing bass in a band.

Throughout high school, he augmented the band's sound and image by building fuzz boxes, amps and light controllers from kits out of Popular Electronics. Eventually the band grew to seven members including a horn section and the special effects evolved into a whole multi-media show modeled on San Francisco's famed Joshua Light Show. "I have always loved electronic projects, I guess it's in my blood," Kellar explains, noting that his grandfather worked for AT&T Bell System in the early 1900s.
<P>
In 1973 Kellar was accepted at Stanford University, majoring in electrical engineering. He continued to play music including a stint with the Stanford Marching Band, studio jazz band and theatrical orchestra pit. He also played the Hammond organ, and gigged at jazz clubs playing bass. Kellar says, "Playing jazz organ with walking bass lines was a pivotal experience for me, which inspired the development of Kellar Bass Systems Jam Bass. Also, being a bass player, I wanted the opportunity to play guitar, but the band always needed someone to hold down the bottom, so I was locked in," Kellar recalls.
<P>
<B>20 Years on the Cutting Edge of Silicon Valley Technology</B>
<P>
Upon graduation from Stanford, Kellar began working for Hewlett Packard in the microwave testing division. He later joined Raychem Corporation, developing products for the burgeoning cable television industry. At this time, he was involved with product design, manufacturing engineering, project management, and marketing. After leaving Raychem, Kellar worked at a few smaller companies, continuing to play music in his spare time.
<P>
The Jam Bass was born in late 1997, when Kellar began developing his first prototypes. The concept jelled when he was listening to heavy metal and noted that the bass player always played the bottom note of the power cord. This concept was readily adaptable to other musical styles and soon Kellar was holding sustained bass notes while playing guitar lead cadenzas and pulsing the bass for folk rock tunes. Along the way, he developed some unusual chord voicings and also a Call and Response style of playing lead lines and responding with the chord and bass.
<P>
He showed his prototypes to guitar players and they provided suggestions such as adding auto sustain mode, transpose, a sustain pedal and MIDI output. In order to develop the project, Kellar tapped into his extensive experience in mechanical engineering and product design. He also surveyed local Palo Alto manufacturers, sourcing companies that specialized in membrane switches, printed circuit fabrication, and a high degree of integration, assembling with surface mount technology for small size and high reliability.
<P>
As a result, Kellar Bass Systems uses only the highest quality components, adhering to world class standards. According to Kellar, the same companies that make assemblies for leading computer and network equipment companies are making the components for Kellar Bass Systems products.
<P>
"Musicians are very creative, Kellar comments. "I am looking forward to seeing them use the Jam Bass to invent new musical styles and find other exciting applications for the instrument."
<P>
<B>Maryam Kellar</B>
<P>
Maryam Kellar is a partner and main investor in Kellar Bass Systems. She and husband Brad Kellar have been married since 1993. According to Maryam, she immediately recognized Brad's genius for invention and felt he was wasting his talents working in the corporate world. "Brad could not do things his way and he was not getting paid for his efforts and great ideas. I have always been an entrepreneur and I encouraged him to take a chance on developing his own products," Maryam recalls.
<P>
When Brad began working on the Jam Bass prototype, Maryam admits that she really didn't know anything about music or rock and couldn't even distinguish the bass parts. "Brad taught me how to listen for bass frequencies and I observed how the bass fills up the music like oil paint on a canvas," Maryam notes. "I am an artist, so I understand color and texture and how all the elements contribute to the whole. Once I related the musical soundscape to painting, things made sense and I identified the potential of the Jam Bass," she explains.
<P>
Maryam and Brad began researching the international guitar market, collecting sales data and other vital information. Brad eventually left his corporate job to work full time on Kellar Bass Systems, but consults with Maryam every step of the way. "We discuss all decisions together," Maryam remarks, "and he trusts my judgment. If I have a serious concern, he definitely listens. I have always believed in Brad and I have held the mirror for him so that he would believe in himself. Trust and belief in your partner: that's what is takes," Maryam concludes.<P>Kellar Bass Systems<BR>
