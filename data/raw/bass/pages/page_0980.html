    <P>This is a hybrid neckthrough with a ribbed cedar top freely
    floating over the neckwood and hollowed mahagony wings,
    providing strong acoustic properties.
    It has a deeply satisfying mwah but can still produce a nice
    growl soloing the bridge pickup.
    The body was designed to be reminiscent of a kinora (lyre) and
    an oud (lute) simultaneously by fitting the oud-shaped cedar
    into the kinora-shaped tulipwood / mahogany body.
    Carving of the knobs and headstock gives the appearance of the
    scrolls of earlier stringed instruments.</P>

    <P>The bass features a headless design with tuners in the ebony
    tailpiece, and employs a 35" scale.
    Two Lane Poor passive pickups are enclosed in ebony cases
    with Acacia's Tree of Life logo in the lower right corners.
    Electronics consist of a master tone control and separate volume
    controls.
    A circular ebony inlay between the pickups provides the illusion of
    an O hole (actual air passages are provided by 1/16th inch gaps
    between the pickup covers and the cedar top).
    In the center of the "O hole" is a silver Mogen David from Israel and
    in the center of the star is a piece of Elat stone, a green mineral
    that is a combination of  lapis and malachite and has only been found
    in the mine sunk by King Solomon.
    The neck is a laminate of zebrawood in the center, two wide strips
    of wenge on the outside, and narrower strips of padouk sandwiched in
    between, with two truss rods and a graphite spar under the G string.
    The fingerboard is ebony, as is the hand-carved bridge.
    The nut is hand-carved guayacan.
    Total weight is 8.5 pounds.</P>

    There's a lot of neat information there about the different woods
    used.
    It also features numerous links useful to bassists.</P>

    <P>The Lord provided the inspiration, materials, and the spirit of
    Bezalel and Oholiab needed for this project.
