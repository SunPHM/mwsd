            <p class="innerheaders"> Instrument Identification</p>
            <p class="body"> This well proportioned English orchestral instrument 
              was made by William Howarth in 1894. It bears his original printed 
              label which is affixed to the treble side back - just below the 
              central brace. Although the label is partially torn it clearly states 
              &quot;William Howarth Double Bass Maker April 21-94.&quot; The 
              date and word maker being hand written in black ink. </p>
            <p class="body"> Also visible on the inside back - this time on the 
              upper bass-side - is a fairly large character inscription in black 
              ink &quot;Made by Wm. Howarth - April 21/94.&quot; Another inscription 
              with identical wording to this was found on the underside (side 
              glued to table) of the original bass bar. How do you know that? 
              - is the question that you must all be thinking now. In replacing 
              the original bar with a new one - which is what we did - the method 
              used is to reduce the original bar down to nothing with a plane 
              before the new one can be fitted. Nearing the end of this job - 
              the inscription could clearly be read in reverse through the wafer 
              thin remnants of the original bar. Photos of this were taken and 
              stored in our restorers computer. As fate would have it - the computer 
              crashed and todate we have been unable to retrieve these images. 
              So annoying.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Other Labels and Brands</p>
            <p class="body"> The instrument bears a printed repairers label on 
              the inside upper treble-side back. &quot;WILLIAM SKELHORN, ALTRINGHAM, 
              CHESHIRE. JANUARY 1951.&quot;</p>
            <p class="body"> The instrument bears the number 18 - more probably 
              an upside-down figure 81 - which is branded twice on the bass side 
              scroll. One of the brands is right in the centre of the eye, the 
              other is directly above the first - near to the outer edge of the 
              scroll. What do these numbers mean? We can&#8217;t be sure but it 
              is possible that this instrument belonged to an army band at one 
              stage of its life.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Instrument Description</p>
            <p class="body"> This is a viol shaped instrument with a flat back 
              and upper angle break. The two piece maple back is nicely figured 
              with a flaming that descends from the centre joint. The ribs and 
              scroll show flaming that is well matched to that of the back. The 
              table is made from spruce of a medium grain. The arching is medium 
              high in a sort of &quot;Amatese&quot; style. The F's are relatively 
              narrow. The original varnish is a spirit based red-brown colour 
              which has been applied over a yellow ground.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders"> Do you have any info on Howarth?</p>
            <p class="body"> Not much. Background information on Howarth is sparse. 
              What we can tell you is gained from instruments that we have seen. 
              These include a violin outline instrument which we sold a number 
              of years ago and the remnants of a later (1919) instrument - which 
              still bears his original hand written label that informs us that 
              he worked in Manchester - &quot;W. Howarth, Stanley House, Stanley 
              Epln, J(could be an F or aT)eryoyht, Manchester.&quot;</p>
            <p class="body"> Although we have only had the privilege to examine 
              these three instruments it is clear from the quality and workmanship 
              of them that Howarth was a professional maker who attained a high 
              standard of craftsmanship and who in all probability produced a 
              moderate output of double bass instruments. Some years ago it was 
              reported to us that one of his violin outline instruments was of 
              such fine quality that it was successfully passed off to a player 
              as an original Lott - an allegation that must surely raise Howarth&#8217;s 
              standing as a maker in the hierarchy of the many fine late 19th 
              century and early 20th century English bass makers.</p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Presentation.</p>
            <p class="body"> The instrument now benefits from the fitment of a 
              nicely flamed new neck and fingerboard. Internally the instrument 
              boasts a new bass bar of the correct length and proportions and 
              all cracks have been washed out, reglued and re-studded. This is 
              indeed a well presented instrument in A1 structural condition. </p>
            <p class="innerheaders">Sound Quality and Overall Impression.</p>
            <p class="body"> Tone quality can be described as full, deep, dark 
              and sonorous while volume can only be described as considerable. 
              Contributing to this overall glorious sound must surely be the incredible 
              depth of the ribs. Near to the end pin unit a maximum of 23.9cm 
              (including the plates) can be measured. &quot;I had to make up a 
              completely new set of clamps to accommodate this instrument&quot; 
              was the comment from restorer M.J. Bailey. Job well done were my 
              thoughts. This is indeed a quality instrument with a quality sound 
              that will definitely create the right impression in any situation.
