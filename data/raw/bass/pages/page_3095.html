<P>
Welcome all fishermen! Long known as one of the premier trophy bass-fishing lakes, Caney Lake can boast that eight of the state's top ten bass were caught in these waters. So cast your line and reel them in--enjoy a great day on the fish-filled waters of Caney Lake.
<P>

Located on a peninsula in this grand lake, Jimmie Davis State Park offers two boat launches and a fishing pier that cater to all types of sportsmen. Waterskiing is another way to enjoy the clear waters of the lake, which was created by damming Caney Creek in 1986. Don't forget to look back at the lakeshore to appreciate the beautiful mixed pine and hardwood forest surrounding the lake and the birds and animals that make the forest their home.

&nbsp;
Opened in the fall of 1996, Jimmie Davis State Park was originally named Caney Creek Lake State Park. The 2003 Louisiana State Legislature approved renaming the park in honor of two-term Governor Jimmie H. Davis, who served from 1944 to 1948 and again from 1960 to 1964.
<P>Born in 1899 near Beech Springs, La., Davis attended Louisiana College and Louisiana State University, served on the Public Service Commission and performed as a country/western and gospel singer for many years, including appearances in motion pictures. His music career honors included induction into the Song Writers Hall of Fame, the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. He was widely known for the popular tune "You Are My Sunshine", which later became one of Louisiana's state songs.
<P>Davis died in November 2000 at the age of 101 and is buried in the cemetery of the Jimmie Davis Tabernacle near Quitman.
