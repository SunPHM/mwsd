<p>If you want to catch trophy peacock bass, the Rio Negro in Brazil is by far your best bet. Trek offers two first class operations along the Rio Negro, The Amazon Queen and The Rio Negro Lodge and both are the best in the business. Few operators know the peacock bass like Trek Safaris as we have chased them from Panama to Brazil and can say without a doubt that the largest peacocks in the world are between latitude 3 degrees north to 3 degrees south that extends from Venezuela into Brazil. A trophy peacock is one over 20 pounds and we catch them weekly at both operations. Anglers who have caught peacocks will attest that few fish are as powerful or as fun to catch as the mighty peacock. We should know, <img border="0" src="images/LocationPhotos/FishingBrazilBoat.jpg" align="left" width="300" height="200" alt="Brazil Peacock Bass Fishing">since 1973 we have sent thousands of anglers throughout South America in search of the perfect place to land this giant cichlid!! Getting to the Rio Negro in Brazil is easy as we fly direct with Varig Airlines from Miami to Manaus and charter twin engine planes to the town of Barcelos where you are transferred to either the Queen of RNL.</p>

<p><b>Amazon Queen</b> - The Queen is an 85-foot, tri-level lodge that happens to be a motorized river yacht. It is the perfect venue to cruise the waters of the Rio Negro looking for giant peacock bass. It accommodates 16 anglers in eight air-conditioned staterooms and has enough space on board to get lost. The Queen runs each night in search of small lagoons and creeks where the peacocks lay in waiting for their next victims. These fish love anything that creates noise or action and most of the time it's top water baits that gets the job done. Eight Bass Tracker boats with 90 horse four strokes are trailed behind the Queen and skippered by local natives who are well schooled on the ways of the Peacock. Not only is this a great fishing trip, but it's also a unique chance to see one of the great biospheres of the world. Monkeys, sloughs, anacondas, crocodiles and thousands of species of birds all make their home on this major tributary of the Amazon. The upper deck of the Queen is the perfect gathering place for groups and has a nice view of the river and <img border="0" src="images/LocationPhotos/FishingBrazilLodge.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="200" alt="Brazil Peacock Bass Fishing">surrounding jungle. An open bar with hors'deavours is the perfect ending to a productive day. Food and service are excellent and laundry services a big plus. All tackle and lures are provided on the Queen at no additional cost.</p>

<p><b>Rio Negro Lodge</b> - This beautiful native built lodge was literally carved out of the jungle with all local woods and materials. It accommodates 32 guests a week and caters to those wanting their feet on land, a little more comfort, and the same exciting peacock action as the Queen. The lodge, and its 16 separate duplexes, sit on the banks of the Rio Negro and encompass some 20 acres. Owner Phil Marsteller has done an excellent job of organizing a deluxe fishing venue from the jungles of the Amazon. He offers fishing from Bass Tracker boats with 90 horse motors and the best guiding experiences in the region. The food, service and staff are all first rate and the fishing is world class. Those who really want an added thrill, can choose to charter Rio Negro's floatplane that will get you to those secret lagoons that hold monster peacocks that have never seen a lure. A visit to the Amazon is a must for those who love their travel in remote regions and prefer a nice facility like the Rio Negro Lodge as opposed to a tent. The season is from September-March and Trek has some exclusive dates in the heart of the season. Call today for free video or brochure.</p>
