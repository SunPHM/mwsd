Here is my fender telecaster. I love, love, love, love it! It is a beaut. Anway here are samples of me playing guitar (I also have an encore bass that my aunt gave me that she got from her next door neighbor who got it from his friend who left it there for 45 years...I also have a baby taylor acoustic guitar.)
