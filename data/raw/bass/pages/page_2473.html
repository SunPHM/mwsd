        bassist has done more for and with popular music than James Jamerson. 
        While his name may not be known by the countless millions of fans of his 
        playing, his sound and style have influenced every player to pick up the 
        instrument since Motown's first hit record.</font></p>

                  instrument was James Jamerson's personal upright bass. He purchased 
                  it in 1957 and used it in Detroit's jazz clubs while honing 
                  his style, on tour with Smokey Robinson, and on countless classic 
                  Motown recordings that play somewhere in the world every second 
                  of every day. Enduring hits by Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, 
                  Martha Reeves, Mary Wells, Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles, 
                  Marvin Gaye, and others were created using this instrument. 
                  In later years James Jamerson, Jr continued to use this bass, 
                  playing it on further hits. This bass was last played in the 
                  film documentary 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown.' The bass 
                  is in the same condition as when James Jamerson last used it, 
                  including the set of strings.<font color="#000000" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font>
