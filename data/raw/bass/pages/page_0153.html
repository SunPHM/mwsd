    <a href="links.html"> Alrick Huebener</a> approached            me            last year to build him a solid body string bass, I thought it would be            a            one-of-a-kind custom instrument.  However, from the enthusiastic response            I            have been getting from bass players, I am encouraged to include it in            my            standard line of instruments.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">T</font></b>he concept was to create a solid body bass that sounds, plays and feels            like its acoustic counterpart.            To this end I kept the traditional fingerboard, neck shape and size,            the            standard bridge height and string length of a 3/4 size bass.            The core of the body is made of fir, laminated on the outside with curly            maple.  A hollow area under the bridge creates a vibrating area that            enhances the acoustic sound.</p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="4">A</font></b>ttached to the back, with curved stainless steel rods, is a removable            body            brace. The shape and location  provides the player with            a            similar contact area to what he would have on an acoustic bass. The height            adjustments are made with a telescoping tail pin.<br>
    <br>
    <b><font size="4">T</font></b>he pick-up system was chosen to respond equally to pizzicato as well            as            arco playing, and consists of a transducer bridge pick up with on board            per-amp and
    EQ.            The volume and tone controls are placed within easy reach on the top            of the            body, next to the  fingerboard.<br>

    <i>
            I have played the bass in a couple of rehearsals and a performance.            Everyone comments on how good it sounds and how beautiful it looks.            I am very happy with the instrument. It feels beautiful to play and I            am            just beginning to explore it with the bow.</i><br>

              acoustic bass is built with an 1/2&quot; arch in the top and back.
              A floating bridge and tail-piece compliment its unique design. As
              in an arch top guitar or a cello, the arching adds a lot to the
              stiffness and strength of the top. The mass and energy of the bass
              strings, as well as their low frequency, require a very different
              design from that of a guitar. A long scale gives maximum tension
              to the strings and adds to sustain and clarity. The result is a
              bass that has a solid and punchy tone even on the lowest notes and
              one that works well without amplification as a true acoustic
              instrument.<p><font size="4"><b>T</b></font>he bass is also available as a 5
              or 6 string instrument, with a freted or fretless finger board,
              and with a regular or cutaway body. Pick-ups are optional. Under
              the saddle pick-ups like the 'Baggs' work well. Magnetic pick-ups
              built into the end of the fingerboard, or a combination magnetic/pizeo
              pickup
              with on-board pre-amp can also be installed.</p>
