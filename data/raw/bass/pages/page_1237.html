<p><font color="#006600"><font size="+1">Well, I'm finally getting around
 to getting this page going. I've been working on the bass for a while now
 but just haven't had time to compose the new page, but here it is.</font></font>
 <br>
 <font color="#006600"><font size="+1">I am participating in an online bass 
building course at the <a href="http://www.mimf.com">Musical Instrument Maker's 
Forum</a>, being taught by Bill Moll of <a
 href="http://www.mollinst.com">Moll Custom Instruments</a>. The course is 
set up such that everyone taking the course gets a set of full-sized plans, 
then Bill puts a lesson up on the forum in a separate area which is only accessable
by those participating in the course. With few exceptions, the course is
done in a text only format, after the lesson is posted, the students can
post any questions or discuss any problems they are having. He tries to do
one lesson per week but has thrown in a couple of "off weeks" where no lesson
was posted to help those who are behind to have a chance to catch up. Unfortunately,
I've been unable to catch up with the lessons so far. I am moving along,
but I've had to pick up other tools here and there and time has been scarce
lately. I'm only about 2 lessons behind right now and struggling to close
that gap.</font></font> <br>

 <font color="#006600"><font size="+1">Here is a picture of Bill Moll's 5-string 
that the designs are modeled after. This one has a laminated neck of hard 
maple with three 1/8" walnut strips in between. The body wings are also walnut. 
Mine will be mahogany/maple laminated neck with mahogany body wings and curly 
maple top caps for the body and headstock. I've also chosen a Pau Ferro fretboard 
as well as chrome tuners and bridge. I still haven't decided on the pickups 
and control electronics but I have plenty of time for that.</font></font>

 <font color="#006600"><font size="+1">Here is the wood I'm using for my
bass. It's going to be a "neck-through" design using mahogany and maple for
the neck laminates and mahogany for the body wings. I've also got a bookmatched 
set of curly maple for the body top cap and also for the headstock overlay. 
These pictures show the wood before the neck was glued up and the wing blanks 
were cut out. Below are the curly maple pieces. The larger one I purchased 
from <a href="http://www.luthierwoods.com/">Oyster River Tonewoods</a> and 
the smaller one I got from work from a piece of scrap. Sorry about the glare, 
but without a digital camera I have to just take several shots and then take 
the best ones from the set. The curl on the smaller piece isn't as good as 
the larger one, but the grain pattern makes up for it.<br>

 <font color="#006600"><font size="+1">Here, I've laid all the body pieces
 out to see roughly how it will look when it's together. The neck is glued
 up now and you see the Pau Ferro fretboard laying on top. I also laid the
 templates out on the body wings and the long one there at the bottom is
the neck side profile template.</font></font> <br>
 <font color="#006600"><font size="+1">&nbsp;Below are a couple of close-up
 shots of the fretboard, the one on the left gives a good view of the grain
 pattern and coloration. I purchased it pre-slotted from <a
 href="http://www.lmii.com">Luthiers Merchantile Inc.</a> In the one of the 
right,&nbsp; I've cut off a thin piece beyond the nut and am gluing half of
it back on.&nbsp; It came in with only one line at the nut and about 1/2" 
beyond that line. I cut the top two thirds of the fretboard off back to the 
nut line, then cut that piece in half and re-glued it back on at the end, 
leaving a 1/4" slot for the nut. It worked pretty well, actually.</font></font>

 <font color="#006600"><font size="+1">Here are a couple of pictures of the 
neck with the truss rod and carbon fiber bars installed. Actually, the CF 
bars are installed but the truss rod is just laying in its slot. The truss 
rod is the Martin-style, round-bottom single action bar and the CF bars are 
1/8" by 3/8" by 24". They were purchased from <a
 href="http://www.stewmac.com">Stewart-Macdonald's Guitar Shop Supply</a>.
 In the picture on the right you can see that I've started cutting out the
 profile. the headstock angle and the body area step have been cut out. Again, 
I'm sorry the pictures are so bad,&nbsp; I've got more pictures in the camera 
and hope they'll be better and I hope to do another update again soon.</font></font>
