whale sharks.&nbsp; I couldn't make the time for that but I could make the time
for a Cayman trip to do some work on the house and knock off a few more days on
the divemaster.&nbsp; Planned a few days on the Brac followed by a few
more on the big island.</p>
<p align="left">Thursday:</p>
<p align="left"><a href="images/P5090001.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/P5090001_small.jpg" alt="P5090001.jpg (84627 bytes)" align="right" width="240" height="180"></a>Landed on Grand Cayman.&nbsp; The air was pleasantly warm and humid.&nbsp;
It was great to be back!&nbsp; Katie pulls up in her red Jeep and Karman and I pile in with all our
gear.&nbsp; A few minutes later we're at my place for our layover before the
flight to the Brac in the morning.&nbsp; Went next door for a visit with Lenny and Georgette.&nbsp;
Visited Bob.&nbsp; He proudly showed off the boat he
recently acquired.&nbsp; He's looking forward to some good fishing.&nbsp; Katie
fixed a great dinner and we all enjoyed talking about the pleasures of island
life before hitting the sack.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Friday:</p>
<p align="left">Up at 6:30 for coffee, then Katie dropped us
at the airport.&nbsp; Had a good breakfast at the airport restaurant then waited for
the Island Air personnel to arrive to check us in for our 10:30 flight.&nbsp;
Hopped aboard the DeHavilland Otter for a scenic flight to the grass landing
strip on Little Cayman, then back up to 500' for a 5 minute flight to Cayman
Brac.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><a href="images/P5040007.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/P5040007_small.jpg" alt="P5040007.jpg (66507 bytes)" align="left" width="240" height="180"></a>Cayman Brac - 4 other people got off the plane with us.&nbsp; Island shuttle took us a couple of miles from the north side of the runway
to the south, dropping us at the Divi Tiara.&nbsp; Checked in and signed up for
the afternoon dive and the destroyer dive for the next morning. Lunch at the hotel
restaurant.&nbsp; Got our dive gear ready for the afternoon dive then rode
some bikes a couple of miles to the local convenience store, I needed a
toothbrush!&nbsp; Raced back, picked up camera gear, and headed down
to dock where new arrivals got the boat briefing then headed out for our
first dive!</p>

Met Gary and Christine, a couple celebrating their 1 year anniversary with a
weekend on the Brac.&nbsp; Gary is one of the 2 construction managers building
the new Ritz Carlton on Grand Cayman.&nbsp; Then hit the sac.&nbsp; Jumped out
of bed about 3am when I thought we were about to get hit by a 747!&nbsp; Found
out later it had been an air ambulance taking off right across the road.</p>
<p align="left">Saturday:</p>
<p align="left">Started off with coffee and a made to order veggie omelet,
thanks Cliff!&nbsp; Got
camera gear prepped with wide angle lens for our morning dive on the Tibbets, a
Russian destroyer sunk in 1996.&nbsp; Everything was working well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Tibbets - hopped on board the dive boat and a few minutes later
we were tying up to the wreck.&nbsp; Gary dove with me and
Karman as Christine wasn't feeling well from the swells encountered on the way
over.&nbsp; Took a couple of test pics at the top of the wreck, and the
strobe quit working again!&nbsp; Dove down to the main deck and the
camera shut down altogether!&nbsp; Swam out to the wall to look
over the edge at the deep blue.&nbsp; No whale sharks.&nbsp; Karman's computer
hickuped indicating he was in deco already so he stayed at the top of the wreck while Gary and I explored
it further.&nbsp; Eventually
did our safety stop and got back on board.&nbsp; The camera now worked OK
but I swapped batteries just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><a href="kissame.htm">Kissame - click for pics</a></p>
<p align="left">After lunch at the Divi, I examined all strobe
contacts.&nbsp; Saw that the cable connector that connects at the strobe
had a tarnished contact.&nbsp; Scraped the suspect contacts down and voila, reliable operation again!&nbsp;
Note to self:&nbsp; After the trip, soak all contacts in fresh water for an hour
then air dry for a few days.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="grunt_valley.htm">Grunt Valley - click for pics</a></p>
<p align="left">We talked to a few others interested in a night dive.&nbsp; Liz
at the Divi recommended Radar Reef for easy access.&nbsp; Divi&nbsp; left tanks out for
the 6 of us, Jeff, Kristi, Kerry, Carol, Karman, and myself.&nbsp; Only had one car so we shuttled over in 2 trips.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Sunday:</p>
<p align="left">Another great veggie omelet, then we were off to dive Bloody Bay
Wall at Little Cayman.&nbsp; This was the best diving of the trip!&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><a href="bloody_bay_wall.htm">Bloody Bay Wall - click for pics</a> </p>
<p align="left">Monday:</p>
<p align="left">Up for our final breakfast.&nbsp; Packed up and caught the shuttle to the airport for 10:30
flight back to Grand Cayman.&nbsp; Got our rent car at Coconuts, a Susuki&nbsp;Jeep.&nbsp;
Immediately removed the rag top in favor of the sun.&nbsp; Checked in at
Tarquynn then loaded up our gear for a shore dive at Sunset House.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Joined Karman at the bar for a few red stripes and a mahi mahi
sandwich.&nbsp; Got cleaned up at the condo then went to Deckers for tuna sashimi and
drinks.&nbsp; Joy was working and I found out she and Jae are now engaged!&nbsp;
Congratulations to both!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Tuesday:</p>
<p align="left">Turtle Reef - Karman left at 7:30am to meet up with Patrick for a boat
dive.&nbsp; Sebastian from Divetech picked me up to continue my divemaster
training.&nbsp; Helped Ken do the 1st 2 open water checkout dives with 3
guys from N.Carolina.&nbsp; After the students practiced the requisite skills,
Ken led a short pleasure dive and I pulled up the rear.&nbsp; Both dives at
Turtle Reef.&nbsp; A big variety of stuff:&nbsp;&nbsp; turtles, cudas, lobster, spotted
moray, golden tailed moray, tarpon, scorpionfish, and all the usual reef
life.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Got a ride back to Tarquynn.&nbsp; Karman had
gotten narced on his am dive as they came out of a swimthrough on the wall at
128'!&nbsp; Got a bite then went up to Turtle Reef for a long snorkel
as I was working on my mapping project for the site.&nbsp; Got a couple of
tanks and dove the site left and right to get the depth readings.</p>

Cracked Conch's outdoor bar.&nbsp; Martin is from Sweden but has spent the last
few years in Brazil and the Caribbean.&nbsp; After a few red stripes Karman
bought a couple of Kamakaze rounds for everyone.&nbsp; Then Martin treated us to another round.&nbsp; Sashimi dinner at the
Bamboo, the suchi bar at the Hyatt.&nbsp; Then across the street to Deckers where Joy
was working again.&nbsp; After a few grand marniers and a cuban cigar, it was
all downhill.&nbsp; Made it home somehow. </p>
<p align="left">Wednesday:</p>
<p align="left">The next morning neither of us were in shape to go
diving.&nbsp; Each wisely cancelled.&nbsp; Felt human again in time to confirm my afternoon schedule at Divetech.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Turtle Reef - Helped do a guided
scooter dive with Kym for a couple from the UK.&nbsp; Kym led the dive while I
pulled up the rear.&nbsp; What a blast!&nbsp; Squeeze the trigger that turns on the
battery driven prop and hang on.&nbsp; Just have be
careful about getting too close to the coral or making any
sudden depth changes.&nbsp; &nbsp; You can cover a lot of ground in a
hurry.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Sea bass at
the Reef Grill for dinner.&nbsp; Delicious as always!</p>

<p align="left">Up at 5 to drop Karman at the airport for his 7:30 flight.&nbsp;
Divetech at Cobalt Coast to help
Kym do a guided dive with a couple from Michigan.&nbsp; Kym guided the first one
right, then I guided the next one left.&nbsp; Saw a nice green moray out on the
prowl. </p>
<p align="left">Friday: </p>
<p align="left">Back to Divetech at Turtle Reef to help Gary guide the same
couple from day before on a couple of dives there.<br>
Ran some errands at lunch then back to Divetech for my final written tests with
Seb.<br>
Drove down to the Seaview to say hi to Jae and got an invite to their beach get
together on Saturday at Silver Sands. </p>

Divetech to settle up and say goodbye.&nbsp; Have about 3-4 days left on the
DM.&nbsp; Met Dave back at the house as he had the railing for the loft.&nbsp;
Just stored it up there for him to get to later.&nbsp; Took care of a few
maintenance items and then packed up my stuff for the trip back.&nbsp; Goodbyes to Georgette, Katie, and Bob, then headed to the airport for my
afternoon flight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Miami, Dallas, then Denver.&nbsp; Home about midnight. </p>
