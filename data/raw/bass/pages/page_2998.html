              is Believing&quot;, this phrase has never meant so much to me than
              the experience that I had on February 20, 2002. I had fished
              during the winter months on numerous occasions and rarely did I
              ever catch over 4 or 5 small fish. Chuck Justice had told me that
              his clients had been catching over 60 bass a day with several in
              the Trophy sized bass category. So, I booked Chuck for a fishing
              trip when the &quot;winter bite&quot; was on.</font></b>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">What is my evaluation of the
              fishing trip? It was my best day of fishing, EVER, we caught over
              70 bass. More than 15 of the Largemouth bass went over 4½ pounds
              and we caught several large Kentucky spotted bass.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/winterbassdeanchuck1a.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="230">I
              caught a Largemouth that weighed 7¼ pounds and Dean caught one
              that weighed 6 pounds. We doubled up on numerous occasions and
              even tripled up several times with Dean, Chuck and I all reeling a
              fish in at the same time. I will have to admit that when we were
              in a good school of fish that Chuck didn't get to wet a hook much
              as Dean and I had him busy. Chuck was checking our knots, hook
              sharpness and line near the bait constantly. As he said, you never
              know when that big bass is going to hit.</font></b></p>

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/winterbass2.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="166">This
              trip was definitely a learning experience. I learned more from
              Chuck in this 8 hour trip than I had in years of fishing on my
              own. Chuck went into great detail in answering questions that we
              asked and explained it in a way that we understood what the fish
              were doing and why. Chuck always explained the structure of the
              area we were fishing on each new location we stopped at.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/winterbass5.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="166">I
              have plans to fish with Chuck during all 4 seasons this year. I
              sincerely feel that by fishing with Chuck during each season that
              my fishing success will increase greatly. I will gain a better
              understanding of what the bass are doing during each season of the
              year and know where to fish on a body of water to catch more
              numbers of bass and Trophy Sized bass.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/winterbassdouble2.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="166">Some
              of the things that Chuck went into depth on were structure
              fishing, what the bass were eating, why the bite would suddenly
              turn off in a certain spot and then later in the day it would
              start again, why that you would catch small bass and Trophy Sized
              bass out of the same school in the winter time, why that we were
              using the lures that we were using, etc.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/winterbassdouble1.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="166">I
              am definitely looking forward to fishing with Chuck during the
              Spring months when it is very likely I can catch that Trophy Sized
              bass that I can have a fiberglass replica made of. As you can see,
              we kept Chuck busy taking a bunch of photos yesterday and we had a
              great time both fishing and learning new techniques and the basics
              of bass fishing.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="images/winterbass1a.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="270">While
              we were fishing, I was watching other boats in the areas that we
              were fishing in and talked to some anglers at the boat dock when
              we came in for the day. On the lake, I never saw another boat land
              a bass. At the boat dock, one of the boats had caught 1 fish all
              day long and the other boat had caught 4 fish during the day. I am
              sure that they didn't believe the amount of fish that we caught
              that day until they looked at the digital camera photos on the
              camera. I know it opened their eyes and one of them has a fishing
              trip booked with Chuck now. Amazing how &quot;Seeing is
              Believing&quot;, isn't it?</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">I would strongly suggest
              contacting Chuck and booking a fishing trip with him. You will
              learn more fishing with Chuck in an 8 hour day than you will
              fishing on your own for years. I read several books, watch several
              videos and read countless magazines articles each month and I
              learned more in 8 hours with Chuck than I have in years of
              learning on my own. I promise that Chuck's willingness to teach
              and his expertise will make a fishing trip with Chuck the most
              beneficial 8 hours that you will ever experience in your fishing
              endeavor.</font></b></td>
