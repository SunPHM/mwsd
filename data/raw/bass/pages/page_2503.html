                the Santee Cooper Lake System contains 
                two deep rivers (the Santee River and 
                Cooper River), two lovely lakes (Lake 
                Marion and Lake Moultrie), and a free 
                flowing canal that connects them all. 
                There are 171,000 acres of navigable 
                water, from just outside Columbia SC 
                to Charleston SC and the Intracoastal 
                Waterway. Power and sail boating, water 
                sports of all types, and swimming can 
                be enjoyed on the Santee Cooper Lake 
                System.</font></p>

                property owners have direct access to 
                the lake system through one of several 
                private boat ramps and lifts. A leisurely 
                day trip down the lake system takes 
                you along miles of pristine nature preserves 
                and dense hardwood forests, until you 
                reach the locks at Pinopolis. There 
                you take your turn at entering the locks 
                and being lowered 80 feet from Lake 
                Moultrie to the Cooper River, where 
                you can dine at a wonderful lakeside 
                restaurant. If you want a longer trip, 
                you can travel all the way to Charleston 
                Harbor. Have dinner and spend the night 
                in one of Charleston's wonderful historic 
                hotels, take in a tour or shop for antiques, 
                and then return home to Wyboo in time 
                for dinner. </font></p>

                is enjoyable year round, with different 
                species of game fish for every season. 
                The most famous is the freshwater striped 
                bass (called stripers), which are usually 
                caught only in salt-water estuaries; 
                however, when the system was dammed, 
                some stripers were land-locked and began 
                breeding in the lakes. The state record 
                (and world record until just a few years 
                ago) striper, 55 pounds, was caught 
                in Santee Cooper, but records for other 
                types of bass, several species of catfish 
                and other pan fish have been made here, 
                too. Professional fishing guides are 
                available to show you the best places 
                and methods for landing your freshwater
