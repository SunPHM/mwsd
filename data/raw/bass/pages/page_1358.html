<p align="left"><img src="Galveston12Natural.jpg" alt="Galveston12Natural.jpg" width="300" height="408" border="0" align="left">Galveston 12vers are made by a Korean OEM manufacturer with a
15-year history and approximately 100 employees, that has been manufacturing and exporting 50,000 electric guitars
every year for the past 10 years. <b> SilverStar</b> is the house brand of that manufacturer and they
also make electric and acoustic guitars and basses for many well-knowm brands
(you'd recognize them if you same the body shapes.) Galveston is the OEM brand
belonging to an established American wholesale distributor in the musical
instrument industry based in Ohio that distributes a number of otherproduct
lines. Galveston is sold by a select number of US MI retailers but also on the
internet and Ebay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The factory where Galveston is manufactured lists
body woods on various models as alder, ash and other types of solid woods. They
generally use rosewood fingerboards but do show occasional use of ebony; some
necks show intricate inlay work.&nbsp; Their work runs the full spectrum from
introductory models with bolt-on necks to high-end, neck-thru models with
beautifully figured laminate tops.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Galveston 12-string bass is roughly modeled on a model in SilverStar's 
  own &quot;Fusion Series&quot; but with the extended fingerboard, batwing inlays, 
  larger headstock and other additions. There are some Galveston 12-string's with 
  &quot;Marcus Martini&quot; on the headstock, believed to be an endorser model 
  name, but otherwise the same as the others.&nbsp; Galveston 12vers have been 
  seen in both the original darker walnut-type burst and a later lighter natural 
  color. (Note: Since OEM manufacturer information and wholesale distribution 
  is considered trade-only information, we have left out the specific name of 
  each company to protect their interests.)&nbsp;<br>

<p align="center">(a <u>prototype</u> from the 2002 NAMM Convention)</p>
<p align="center">This Venson 12-string bass is believed to be a one-off prototype. 
  It was originally bought as a display booth demo piece at the 2002 Winter NAMM 
  Convention and later resold on Ebay in 2003. It was made at the same OEM manufacturing 
  facility in Korea that also makes Galveston, Carlo Robelli and other brands. 
  Note the body similarity to the maker's own Silverstar brand model UAB120. The 
  neck is the same as the Galveston 12, although it has different inlays. The 
  electronic controls are like the early Galvestons with four pots but the pickups 
  are diffeent and carry a &quot;Venson&quot; imprint on them. The bridge, nut 
  and tuning machines appear to be the same.</p>
<p align="center">According to the new owner Rick, who was the Ebay winner, it 
  was &quot;made for Venson out of a mix of Galveston and Dean Rhapsody parts. 
  According to the seller, it's the only one. His company bought the contents 
  of Venson's NAMM 2002 booth and he was selling off the various show guitars.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Hense is the house-brand 
  of Martin's Musikkiste, a German musical instrument retailer that has previously 
  sold other 12-string bass models made at the same factory that makes Galveston 
  and the other brands on this page. Certain similarities such as the batwing 
  inlays, electronics and hardware can be seen. The Hense seems to use the Carol 
  Robelli body style and the newer Galveston 5-pot electronics configuration....Store 
  owner Martin Hense decided to have the factory make some changes and issue his 
  own &quot;Hense&quot; model 12ver. What makes this an important development 
  is that at $699 Euro, it is the first of the affordable entry-level 12-string 
  basses to be originated by a Euro-based brand. Good news for European-based 
  players looking to get into the 12-string bass and not get hit with a lot of 
  big shipping and import/duty fees when buying one via the US or Ebay in the 
  States.</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">According to Mr. Hesse, 
  &quot;</font></strong><font size="3"><strong>It&acute;s (my name) 'Hense' on
