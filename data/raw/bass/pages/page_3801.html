<center>On the way to Venice we stopped by a cool little town called Verona. 
 It was a town used by the Romans for trading because it was naturally protected 
 by a river, and right near the only pass through the Dolomite mountains, 
which leads to northern Europe.&nbsp; This location is good if you want to 
trade with people, or simply invade and conquer their punk-asses.&nbsp; Verona
 has its fair share of castles:

<p>And arenas too: </p>
   
<p><img src="venice_files/DCP_1787-MeLinneaVer.jpg" alt="">
   </p>
   
<p>That particular arena is still in use, and in fact was doing a performance 
 of Carmen (I think) that very night.&nbsp; Anyway, off to Venice! </p>

<p>The central area in Venice is Piazza San Marco (in Italy every town is
 filled with piazzas, which are open squares that are usually stoned, as
opposed  to grassy and green like a park in the states).&nbsp; Anyway, here's
San Marco's basilica: </p>

<p>Venice is so lousy with pigeons it's insanity.&nbsp; There's people all
 over feeding them contraceptives, and if it's working I'm glad I didn't
go  when there was a pigeon problem.&nbsp; Pigeons pigeons pigeons. </p>
   
<p>The Doge's Palace was cool.&nbsp; Back in the day if you offered constructive 
 criticism to the government you'd tend to get tortured and stuff.&nbsp; That's
actually why Venice is big on masks; one day some dude put on a mask and
told the doge that something he was doing sucked.&nbsp; This would normally
 be a one way ticket across the <a href="#The_Bridge_of_Sighs">Bridge of
Sighs</a>   , but since he had his Mardi Gras garb on they totally couldn't
figure who this masked renegade was and apparently paid heed to his excellent
suggestion.&nbsp;  Similarly, at some point they made this anonymous suggestion
box at the Doge's  Palace as well: </p>

<p>"Hey Mr. Doge how about brushing your teeth and swabbing your 'pits occasionally.&nbsp;
 You stink!" </p>

<p>This was actually one of my favorite times in Venice.&nbsp; We found this
 fruit stand with amazing raspberries and blueberries, which Linnea fed to
 me on the side of the canal.&nbsp; Mmmmmmm... </p>

<p>In the evening we went for a gondola ride.&nbsp; This was definitely a
 special occasion so I broke out a Southpaw that had traveled over 10,000 
miles to get to its final destination! </p>

<p>At night several classical musical groups play in the piazza.&nbsp; Here's
 me doing a little snobbish air violin: </p>

<p>My best meal in Italy was sea bass at this restaurant.&nbsp; Mmmmm.&nbsp; 
 Here's a lot of the Contiki group and all 937 of their cameras around my 
neck.&nbsp; No we aren't tourists... </p>

<p><a name="The_Bridge_of_Sighs"></a>  The Bridge of Sighs: (Prisoners would
sigh as they were led across it from  the palace to the jail since that was
likely the last daylight they'd ever  see). </p>

<p>Venice was great.&nbsp; I could definitely handle going back.&nbsp; Anyway,
