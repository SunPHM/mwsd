        The first time I had any exposure to the band Ziroq was in a dark and homey Mexican restaurant a while back, where, over in the corner, wave after wave of indistinguishable Latin-pop Ricky Martin clones and south-of-the-border hair bands ran through the rain and danced with sexy half-dressed women on Telemundo. Out of all the clones and wannabes, one song stood out that day, and I swore I would remember the name of the band, but after getting distracted by a particularly saucy mamasita making her way out the door, the name "Ziroq" somehow slipped right out of my mind. What stuck with me, though, were the band's sumptuous flamenco guitar, intricate bass lines, upbeat and exotic percussion, and inviting vocals.<br>
        <br>
        As soon as I popped the Ziroq disc into my player, although it took me a few minutes to make the connection, I knew something was familiar – as it turns out, the song that I remembered from Telemundo, "Cerca de Mi," is the last cut on the album (there is also an English version on the disc called "Closer to Me"), but long before that I recognized the textured African beats and that one-of-a-kind voice. Ziroq may have a predominantly Latin sound, but as singer/guitarist Marcus Nand points out in interviews on this disc, the music is an amalgamation of the North African, Middle Eastern, and European styles, and although the influences are varied, the mood of the music is consistent – the album is as erotic as it is exotic, with every beat and every note dripping with undeniable sex appeal.<br>
        <br>
        The disc adds some much-needed diversity to the DVD-Audio market, and provides a great platform for a new band that – as much as I hate to admit it – would have probably slipped right under my radar if it had only been released to CD. The songs sound great in 5.1, and as usual, Silverline has thrown in a handful of supplements to make the package more enticing.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#DECCFF"><b>Audio &amp; Mix:</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        <br>
        Featuring a surround mix by Gary Lux, Ziroq sounds absolutely fabulous in its 5.1 incarnation, and in fact may well feature one of the most satisfying surround music experiences from Silverline's catalog to date. The mix is bold and enveloping, but perfectly balanced, with good emphasis on the lead vocals and instrumentation up front, and plenty of percussion and accompaniment in the surround channels. The front soundstage is wonderfully wide and deep, with Nand's silky-smooth voice seemingly hanging a few feet in front of the speakers, and the instruments receding into the background when not in the spotlight.<br>
        <br>
        The center channel, although not used for vocals, gets a good bit of mileage, and adds to the strength and depth of the soundstage. The surround channels are employed aggressively during the more active moments, but are reserved when the music calls for a more straight-forward mix. "Que Pena" is a good example of this alternating sound design – the verses are mostly front-heavy, with enough rear activity to draw the music into the room, but the energetic choruses spring to life through a huge, pulse-quickening bubble of sound that doesn't seem confined to a mere five discrete channels. "Pobre Corazon" ends with an upbeat solo flamenco guitar line and a wonderful circle of clapping hands that fill the room. One of the album's instrumental pieces, "Patio del Moro," begins with a percussion line in the surround channels that moves fluidly from side to side, providing near-perfect rear-center imaging even without the help of an additional speaker, once again proving that although 6.1 is an effective format for large cinemas, it's completely unnecessary in a well-designed home setting, especially for music.<br>
        <br>
        The audio is deep and rich, with virtually nothing in the way of distracting noise or distortion. Bass is plentiful, from the main channels as well as the LFE, especially in numbers like "Contando Cacahuentes," which sports a thick, room-filling low end. The various instruments all sound fabulous, although at times the guitar and violin don't seem quite as resolved as one would expect from 96/24 material. The strings no doubt sound far better than CD could hope to offer, and are richly smooth in the midrange frequencies, but harmonics and other overtones fall every so slightly short of what I expected. This could, of course, be a result of recording conditions, and in fact fidelity on the 5.1 MLP version does sound a bit better than the 48/24 stereo track also included here, which itself pulls ahead of the Dolby Digital 5.1 in terms of detail and smoothness, as expected. Any complaints are minor, though, and although high-end systems will get more benefit from the 96/24, most listeners will have hard time hearing much difference between any of the three fine-sounding listening options. The 5.1 96/24 track is of course exclusively for DVD-Audio playback, the Dolby Digital is reserved for DVD-V hardware, and the non-MLP 48/24 PCM stereo is common to both.<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#DECCFF"><b>Extras &amp; Highlights:</b></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        <br>
        The disc packs a music video for the song "Cerca de Mi," as well as footage of live performances of "Reina" and "Ziroq," all three in full frame with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Also included are two interview segments; the first featuring vocalist Marcus Nand and bassist Carmine Rojas in English, and the second a Spanish-language spot with Nand only. The interviews run 5:04 and 4:18, respectively.<br>
        <br>
        There is also a Scrapbook featuring 29 photos of the band, a seven-page English Biography and five-page Spanish Biografia for the band, as well as the standard About DVD-Audio, Speaker Setup, and Credits options.<br>

        <br>
        The interface for Ziroq is pretty straightforward, and the graphics and aesthetic design are easy on the eyes. The options are well arranged, and the various menu screens feature laid-back selections from the album in stereo as accompaniment. The video, live performances, and interviews are marked by full-motion previews, and navigation is a snap.<br>

        Ziroq is made up of Marcus Nand on lead vocals, guitar, and palmas; the legendary Carmine Rojas on bass; Charles Kentis on Keyboards and Hammond Organ, and also providing percussion programming; Tal Bergman on drums and percussion; and J'anna Jacoby on viola and violin. The album was produced by Charles Kentis, and co-produced by Carmine Rojas and Marcus Nand. For the DVD, John Trickett and Ken Caillat served as executive producers, Anna Rambeau, Marcus Nand, Camine Rojas, and Dave Zelaya produced, and Gary Lux handled the 5.1 mix.<br>

        </font><font color="#DECCFF"><b>Conclusions &amp; Afterthoughts:</b><br>
        </font><font color="#FFFFFF">
        <br>
        Ziroq is a fun, sexy, uplifting album that offers a little something for fans of many different genres of music. Even though most of the lyrics are Spanish, the message is universal, and even my rock-hating, country&amp;western-devoted dad had to admit that "it's not bad." If you're looking for a good mix of vocal numbers and instrumentals with a nice mix of world flavors and a hypnotic backbeat, this is the disc you're looking for.<br>
        <br>
        The surround mix for the album couldn't be more fitting, and although it is a bit disappointing that the stereo track is only available in 48/24 form (especially considering the fact that the disc contains right at 3GB of free space), the 5.1 isn't likely to offend even the most staunch stereophiles, despite the liberal use of the surrounds. Subtitles for the Spanish interview and translated lyrics (or lyrics anywhere on the disc, actually) would have been more than welcome, but all things considered, the music is the disc's biggest selling point, and it's hard to find much room for complaint there. The slow transition to 5.1 music has many music fans looking for something new, so hopefully Ziroq will find a wider fan base then they would have otherwise. I certainly hope this isn't the last we hear of the band on DVD-Audio.</font></font></p>

        Are you a fan of the increasingly popular musical style known as world
        music? Does the sound of <i>flamenco</i> guitar, rhythmic percussion and
        even gypsy-flavored violin get you excited? If so, I know of a band that
        will command your attention with their self-titled debut disc: Ziroq.<br>
        <br>
        To listen to Marcus Nand (lead vocals, guitar) and Carmine Rojas (bass)
        talk about their chance meeting is to realize they both have a passion
        for the world sound. Together with band members Paul Blazek
        (percussion), Guillermo Pasquel (backing vocals, strings), Tal Bergman
        (drums, percussion) and J’anna Jacoby (violin), they mix Indian, Latin
        American, North African and American flavors into an exciting blend of
        music that is all their own. You can hear excerpts from their
        discussions (in either Spanish or English) if you access Special
        Features from the main menu and click on Interviews.<br>
        <br>
        If you are set up for DVD-audio, upon inserting the disc, you will
        automatically be taken to the splendid MLP tracks. The advanced
        resolution of MLP 96khz/24 bit is the preferred listening experience as
        usual and it does not disappoint. The 5.1 mix was handled by Gary Lux at
        5.1 Studios of West Los Angeles, California. He mainly mixed tracks for
        the front soundstage, but there are some instances where the surround
        channels were used to reveal percussion and backing vocals in an
        entertaining way.<br>
        <br>
        The Ziroq DVD-A includes twelve tracks in all. Nand sings some of the
        songs in Spanish and a few of them in English, as he is fluently
        bilingual. He has a rasp that resembles Peter Gabriel and, like Gabriel,
        the band has taken world music sounds and added their own personal
        touch.<br>
        <br>
        Accessing Special Features from the main menu, you can choose from a
        music video, <i>Cerca de Mi</i> (currently running on MTV Latino), or
        two live performances, <i>Reina</i> and <i>Ziroq</i>. The full motion
        video is accompanied by either a Dolby Digital 5.1 or a stereo
        soundtrack in 48khz/24 bit. You can also access the band’s biography
        and scrapbook of photos from the same menu. My only regret here is that
        there are no easy- to- read on-screen lyrics included but you will find
        them in the jewel case booklet.<br>
        <br>
        Aside from their song writing, Ziroq has some very talented musicians.
        The instrumental tracks, like the self-titled <i>Ziroq, Patio Del Moro</i>
        and <i>Nomad</i>, show what the band can do musically. When they go into
        an all-out musical jam, be warned: You just may find yourself
        daydreaming about vast desert landscapes, tranquil seas or perhaps the
        highest temples in India!<br>
        <br>
        Track list: <i>Terra Del Sur, Que Pena, Ziroq</i> (instrumental), <i>Closer
        to Me, Contando Cacaheutes, Voices, Pobre Corazon, Reina, Prisionero,
        Pateo Del Moro</i> (instrumental), <i>Nomad</i> (instrumental) and <i>Cerca
        de Mi</i> (Spanish translation of <i>Closer To Me</i> - and a great tune
        that could be a hit single).<br>
