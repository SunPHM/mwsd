                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">The 
                  initial idea for Sackful of Sovereigns was born in the summer 
                  of 1995. &nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Inspired 
                  by a Steeleye Span concert Denise and Colin Harrison got together 
                  with Clare Rundle to form a band to play electric folk music. 
                  </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Initially 
                  the trio were joined by songwriter Mike Gerrish on guitar, an 
                  old school friend of Denise's, Jane Rickards, on vocals and 
                  Tim Smith, a rather talented double bass player and guitarist. 
                  The initial idea, and one they have kept to ever since, was 
                  to play their own arrangements of traditional folk music on 
                  modern instruments - &quot;Electric Folk&quot;. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">This 
                  first line-up was short lived due to work and personal commitments. 
                  &nbsp;Mike, Jane and Tim left (amicably) leaving the original 
                  three to carry on. &nbsp;A poaching exercise was then tried 
                  on friend and keyboard player Jocelyn Clay but due to loyalty 
                  to her existing band she declined recommending that the three 
                  look for a drummer and bass player. &nbsp;Enter Ian Drew at 
                  the &quot;MELKSHAM NEWS&quot; with an offer to run a piece on 
                  the band's search for two new members and so, on the 5th October 
                  1995, an article appeared entitled :&quot;Folk Group Seeks Members&quot;. 
                  </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">First 
                  to reply was Mark Griffin, who now occupies the drum stool, 
                  and then another drummer, but Mark had already secured the position. 
                  &nbsp;Nobody else rang! &nbsp;Then two weeks later the phone 
                  rang again: it was bass player, Phil Mundy. The line up was 
                  complete.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66"> 
                  Rehearsals continued and a name was finally chosen (after much 
                  deliberation) and following discussions a sponsorship deal was 
                  set up for the use of sound equipment with Melksham based manufacturer 
                  CITRONIC Limited. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">The 
                  band made its public debut, before an invited audience, on the 
                  1996 Summer Solstice, June 21st, followed by tryout gigs through 
                  the autumn at venues in Bradford on Avon, Melksham and Trowbridge. 
                  &nbsp;Gigging proper started in January 1997 at various venues 
                  in the area including an appearance at the Chippenham Folk Festival 
                  in May. &nbsp;</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">On 
                  July 1st the band played the Tythe Barn for the Bradford on 
                  Avon Music Festival. &nbsp;This gig saw the release of their 
                  first tape : &quot;Small Change&quot; (see &quot;Tapes &amp; 
                  CD's&quot;) which is receiving a good response and is available 
                  at the gigs.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">In 
                  November 1997 Phil Mundy decided to leave for pastures new so 
                  the band actively sought a new bass player.&nbsp; Adverts were 
                  placed, once again, in the local press. &nbsp;Through contacts 
                  and friends three possible candidates came forward. &nbsp;Following 
                  auditions the position was offered to Ian Spittal an excellent 
                  bass player and musician who had played with all styles of bands. 
                  &nbsp;</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Rehearsals 
                  got underway through December 1997 and January 1998 and Ian 
                  played his first gig with the band in February and become an 
                  integral part of the team both musically and socially ie he's 
                  got the same sense of humour. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">At 
                  this time Mike Gerrish joined (again) as sound engineer for 
                  live as well as studio work becoming the sixth member as his 
                  role is so important. There are plans afoot to get him to play 
                  guitar one day.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">During 
                  May the band went back into the studio and started recording 
                  tracks for their next tape. &nbsp;Two tracks were completed 
                  in record (pun) time and were released on a special edition 
                  tape in time for their second appearance at the Chippenham Folk 
                  Festival.&nbsp; The band had a superb gig at Chippenham and 
                  the main song, &quot;Bound for the Promised Land&quot;, about 
                  a family of eight from Melksham who perished on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, 
                  received acclaim from everybody who heard it. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Local 
                  BBC Radio Station &quot;Wiltshire Sound&quot; did a news story 
                  on Janet Hollerhead who had researched the Goodwin family and 
                  used parts of the song in the background. They then received 
                  numerous telephone requests to play the entire track which they 
                  duly did along with a live interview. They have since played 
                  a number of tracks, &quot;Here Come the Navvies&quot;, Sackful 
                  of Sovereigns&quot; and done further interviews.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">During 
                  the summer plans were laid for a new CD and a new song, co-written 
                  by Mike and the band, about &quot;Fred Kempster&quot; the Melksham 
                  Giant was premiered at the Melksham Festival in September '98.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Colin 
                  snapped his achilles tendon playing squash in October and spent 
                  three months in plaster getting out of all the gear humping 
                  and doing gigs seated.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Progress 
                  on the new CD continued to be slow into '99 and it was finally 
                  completed in late summer with the title &quot;Up to the Hilt&quot;.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Clare 
                  announced that she was planning to marry and probably move away 
                  from the area so late autumn was spent considering the band's 
                  options as to the way forward with a decision to seek a new 
                  instrumentalist/vocalist as soon as possible.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">In 
                  December Clare married and moved to Essex and the band played 
                  Warminster Folk Club as a four piece handing out leaflets in 
                  the search for a new member. From that gig we were given a contact 
                  for a flute and soprano saxophone player from Frome, Wiltshire 
                  and at the start of 2000, after a couple of rehearsals, Kevin 
                  Butler joined the line-up.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">No 
                  sooner was Kevin in than Ian announced he was emigrating to 
                  Ireland so a new bass player was needed. Within a week Steve 
                  Sawyer, an friend who had actually turned down the position 
                  after Phil left, agreed to take on the bass slot. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Rehearsals 
                  continued through the spring and early summer and the first 
                  gig of the new line-up was at The Rachel Fowler Centre in Melksham 
                  on July 9th 2000 to a good reaction.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">Continuing 
                  with rehearsals through the Autumn of 2000 with a few test gigs 
                  the band has now put together a full set and are back on the 
                  road.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC66">The 
                  sound has changed a bit with the introduction of the saxophone 
                  but all the old favourites are there along with a few new surprises.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to Mike's work commitments we lose him on the sound desk (very careless) though he may return at some point. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">May 2002 - March 2003 saw the recording of &quot;In for a Penny&quot; at Littleton Studios and the CD was released in the summer to coincide with our Chalford Charity festival gig in July.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so we come to the Autumn of 2003 and Kevin's announcement that he is emigrating on a shiny new ship to &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (actually it is the ferry to the Emerald Isle - what is it with Ireland and members of this band?). After three years of superb playing at the gigs, and some really excellent work on the CD &quot;In for a Penny&quot;, Kevin plays his final full gig with the band at the Chippenham Arts Festival in November and we start to look for a replacement for him (a hard act to follow). </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a few auditions Phil Mundy, our original bass player, suggests a fiddle player from Bradford on Avon called Ben Osborne. An initial get together clicks and we invite Ben to join the band which he accepts.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once more we plough into rehearsals to get the sets back together. Ben makes his unofficial debut with the band at Kevin's farewell party which is held in the Cafe Blue in Frome. All the musicians and bands that Kevin has played with over the years are in attendance and he ends up spending most of the night on the stage. A good time is had by all and Kevin gets a good send off.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back to rehearsals and another unofficial debut, without Mark, playing background music for the Westbury Rotary Club at a twinning event where, needless to say, Ben's virtuosity is very much appreciated.</font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And so to August 2004 and Ben's official debut at the Rachel Fowler Centre. Once again the sound of the band has changed with the fiddle giving us a folkier sound again, with a few more jigs and reels in the set, and some three part harmony. We're also introducing mandolin into some songs. </font></b></p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#FFCC66" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ben has fitted into the line-up very well so the next task is going to be a new CD. Watch this space. </font></b></p>
