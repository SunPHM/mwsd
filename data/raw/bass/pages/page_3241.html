          <div class="leftFloat"><img src="images/NiceSpot.jpg" alt=" The Beauty of Lake Huites " width="200" height="150" border="1" /><br />
Scenic Lake Huites</div> 
          <p>Lake Huites, without a doubt, is one of the <strong>most scenic lakes 
            in all of Mexico</strong>. Nestled in the foothills of the Sierra 
            Madre Mountains, this beautiful lake in the mountains, was created 
            by damming the Rio Chinipa and Fuerte rivers. Lake Huites is 4500 
            feet above sea level and at full pool in the Fall, this 30,000 acre 
            lake is 18-miles long in one direction and 15 miles long in another. 
            This beautiful Lake has <strong>over 100 miles of shoreline to fish</strong> 
            and has every conceivable structure a bass could want. </p>
          <div class="rightFloat"><img src="images/jeffs.jpg" alt=" Florida Largemouth Bass" width="150" height="225" border="1" /><br />
Florida Largemouth Bass</div> 
          <p> Once called the &quot;Mystery Lake&quot;, this beautiful body of 
            water is <strong>loaded with Bass</strong>! Initially stocked with 
            Florida Bass from the El Fuerte River system back in the 70's. When 
            the dam was finished, subsequent <strong>stockings with pure Florida 
            Strain Largemouth Bass have created a Bassin' Factory</strong> that 
            has surpassed the expectations of any new lake in the world at this 
            time. <strong>Hundreds of bass over 10 pounds have been caught</strong> 
            and released at this great new lake! </p>
          <p>The bass in Lake Huites are <strong>growing at a rate of 2 pounds 
            per year</strong>, so it's no wonder so many fishermen are looking 
            for their largest Bass to be caught at this beautiful new reservoir. 
            One of the reasons Lake Huites is full of fast growing Bass is <strong>because 
            of the huge forage base</strong> and the structure that exists along 
            its diverse banks and shores. The forage consists of Shad, crayfish 
            and the protein packed Tilapia! The <strong>average Bass</strong> 
            in this young lake is already around <strong>4 to 5 pounds</strong>, 
            and it's not uncommon for experienced anglers to have <strong>catches 
            of 100 to 300 bass per day </strong>per boat weighing anywhere <strong>from 
            2 to 14 lbs</strong>. The <strong>current lake record</strong>, caught 
            in May of 2001 by Wild Bill Skinner, stands at a whopping <strong>15 
            pounds 3 ounces</strong>! </p>
          <p><strong>That bass was released and is still lurking in the timber 
            filled cove she was caught in, just waiting for someone to throw the 
            right plug in her face</strong>....with these bass gaining two pounds 
            per year what would that fish weigh now? Not bad for a lake as young 
            as Huites. This lake has the potential to produce the next world record 
            some day, just like all of her sister lakes in Mexico. One good thing 
            Lake Huites has in its favor is that not many drive-in boaters from 
            the States or Mexico fish her waters. Also the commercial netting 
            has some good restrictions and enforcement. In fact, there are <strong>no 
            nets at Huites between April and October</strong>! That fact in itself 
            will insure many years of Super Bassin' at this great new lake! </p>
			
          <div class="leftFloat"><img src="images/topwater.jpg" alt=" Great Topwater Action " width="200" height="174" /><br />
Fantastic Bass!</div>
          <p><strong>From early October until December, the bass at this pristine 
            lake will hit almost anything you throw at them</strong>. From top 
            water action beyond belief to working the humps with worms and lizards 
            and everything in between. Then in January the bass begin to make 
            the move into their pre-spawn mood when a spinner bait usually rules 
            with plastics and crank baits doing well also. Then there is the classic 
            spawn in March when the Big Girls are busting with eggs and are willing 
            to hit most anything that is worked slow and deliberate. <strong>During 
            April, May and June, the angler can expect to get into some good numbers 
            and really Big Fish in the post spawn</strong>, by slow rolling a 
            big spinner bait and digging a lipless crank bait on the bottom in 
            deep water! Throwing a big, Bill Dance Fat Free Shad across bald points 
            in the late afternoon is one of the main reasons why I fish Mexico. 
            Giant Bass in May, now that's the ticket for some heart stopping action 
            that most Bass fishermen are missing out on.</p>
          <p><strong>Lake Huites, is a Catch and Release lake</strong>. This good 
            practice has paid off big time at this lake in Mexico, and every other 
            lake where this practice is enforced. What about my Trophy? you might 
            ask. As at all catch and release lakes, anglers simply take a photo 
            of their trophy, weigh the fish and measure the length and girth, 
            then slip her back in the water to live and grow. Once you do that 
            then I can have a replica of your fish mounted for you by some of 
            the best Taxidermists in the U.S.A.! They are guaranteed for life 
            and they look like they just swam out of the water!</p>
