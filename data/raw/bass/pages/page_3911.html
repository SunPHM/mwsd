  - From Rome, it took us nearly all day to reach our destination, Positano, but it was
  worth the wait!&nbsp; What a completely <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Room.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Room_small.JPG" alt="Positano_Room.JPG (1356541 bytes)" width="79" height="119" align="left"></a>charming little town, with quaint shops and
  restaurants built right into the rock cliff.&nbsp; After haggling for a better room, we
  had a<a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_View1.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_View1_small.JPG" alt="Positano_View1.JPG (220656 bytes)" width="115" height="76" align="right"></a> late dinner at Max, a recommendation from our
  hotel (<a href="http://www.marincanto.it">Hotel Marincanto</a>). We dined outside in a
  very secluded lush patio, with music and lots of artwork displayed.&nbsp; Miguel had
  ravioli al vongole (excellent ravioli), I had the gnocchi al zucchini and shrimp, with
  Pompeii wine. For dessert, lemon cake, chocolate </span>soufflé and lemoncello,
  compliments of &quot;Max&quot; the owner, not the cat in the restaurant.</p>

  - After sleeping in, we dined on one of the better breakfast buffets we've had. &nbsp; <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_ShariDeck2.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_ShariDeck2_small.JPG" alt="Positano_ShariDeck2.JPG (77452 bytes)" width="74" height="112" align="right"></a>Cereals,
  juices, lemon cake, yogurt, fruit, cheeses, and meats, topping off with cappuccino.&nbsp;
  We began a walking tour of the town.&nbsp; <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_ShariDeck1.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_ShariDeck1_small.JPG" alt="Positano_ShariDeck1.JPG (64580 bytes)" width="70" height="105" align="left"></a>Mike
  bought some leather sandals, we purchased lemoncello, lemon soap and candles at a great
  lemon shop (lemons are huge in Positano).&nbsp; browsed antique stores (antiquariato),
  snapped pictures and felt lucky to be in such an impossibly charming place.&nbsp; Back to
  the hotel to freshen up and bask in the sun on our balcony.&nbsp; After awhile we took the
  stairs down to the beach and snacked on pizza and Italian beer.&nbsp; Then, more shopping
  and booked our night train to Venezia (Venice).&nbsp; After contemplating the purchase of
  an adorable antique rosary, we headed back to shower.&nbsp; Dinner was another hotel
  recommendation.&nbsp; It was a good choice, with lots of young couples, candles, and
  mandolin music.&nbsp; We didn't even have to request <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Dinner1.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Dinner1_small.JPG" alt="Positano_Dinner1.JPG (62120 bytes)" align="left" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="66"></a>The Godfather, they played it before we could!&nbsp; I had sea bass and
  zucchini, Mike had seafood ravioli.&nbsp; <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_MS1.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_MS1_small.JPG" alt="Positano_MS1.JPG (106475 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="66"></a>Both were ok, but the Nobile de Montepulciano wine (Poliziano) was
  excellent!&nbsp; We grabbed two lemoncellos and a chantilly lemon cake to go, and went
  back to our private balcony for a candlelit dessert! &nbsp; Off to bed in hopes of rising
  early for our last short day in Positano.</span></p>

  <p align="left"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Eurostile"><big><strong>Day Sei</strong></big> -
  We slept until 10am again (its amazing how long you will sleep if you don't know what time
  it is) and rushed to get our breakfast <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_ShariBreakfast.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_ShariBreakfast_small.JPG" alt="Positano_ShariBreakfast.JPG (58310 bytes)" width="65" height="98" align="left"></a>before
  they closed it.&nbsp; We showered and checked out of the hotel.&nbsp; We bought a lemon
  slush and caught the<a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Hotel1.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Hotel1_small.JPG" alt="Positano_Hotel1.JPG (130802 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="66"></a> inter-city bus for a cheap tour of the rest of the city.&nbsp; We
  figured out that we weren't missing anything and jumped off in front of the nicest ceramic
  store we had seen.&nbsp; In honor of the lemons of Positano, we bought a beautiful bowl
  with bright yellow lemons.&nbsp; The old man, original proprietor since 1960, gave us a
  candle as a gift and a darling cloth shopping bag.&nbsp; I also bought two t-shirts
  (Positano Italia w, daisy and Vino Italiano) and a great painting of Positano from a beach
  vendor.&nbsp; <a href="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Cliff1.JPG"><img src="images/Travel/Italy/Positano_Cliff1_small.JPG" alt="Positano_Cliff1.JPG (118776 bytes)" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="66"></a>We think it will look great in an old frame.</span></p>

  turned away because the bus was too full.&nbsp; We decided to split a cab with a nice
  German couple who was also headed to Sorrento.&nbsp; Money very well spent as we rode in
  comfort and arrived in time to buy a gelato before catching our train to Napoli
  (Naples).&nbsp; We have a first class private sleeping car, and hope to get lots of sleep
  since its a direct route and we'll need our rest for Venezia (Venice) in the
  morning.&nbsp; Can't wait!</span></p>
