<p><font color="#FF0000">report filed 6/28/01 7:47 am pdt</font> - It's always 
  a pleasure to see a good band for the first time. Especially when they're local. 
  Just something about the grassroots energy between hometown musicians and their 
  following that I like. It's a <i>community</i> thing... </p>
<p>Case in point: Electro Vibe. Caught this very talented band last weekend at 
  Winstons and was thoroughly impressed! </p>

<p>Playing all original, mostly instrumental material, Electro Vibe's sound is 
  high energy, deeply grooved and extremely danceable. Seems like each of their 
  tunes is a confluence of funk, rock, jazz and blues, all spun together into 
  any number of combinations. </p>

<p>Can't really get into great detail because I was having too much fun to take 
  notes during EV's short set. Make a deal with ya - i'll keep an eye, and both 
  ears, open for another opportunity to tap into the Electro Vibe, and will post 
  a more detailed report when that happens... </p>
<p>Meanwhile back at the word factory: We've posted <a href="/points/point6-01.html">Flying 
  Colors - the Las Vegas Jam Band Society Passes Area 51 Sound Test</a>, a recent 
  column with photos from jambands.com. </p>
<p>Also been plugging away at CD reviews and have posted our take on Schleigho's

<p>As stated in a past update, due to a variety of factors, we receive too many 
  top notch CDs to crank out a full review on every single one. That's why we 
  came up with a new section of short and snappy info blurbs - to tell the world:</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#FFFF00">These CDs Don't Suck</font><br>

  <a href="http://www.beanstalkjams.com" target="_blank">Beanstalk - Live At Magnolia 
  Festival</a>. Super jammy power fusion trio (bass, drums, guitar) with thick, 
  chunky grooves and hot, funky dynamics that take listeners on a very hip musical 
  trip.</p>

  Pig Iron - Fill Me Up. True-to-tradition bluegrass (that means no drums) from 
  Portland, Oregon, with an authentic, old timey sound featuring acoustic guitar, 
  standup bass, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and four part harmonies.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/cd%20covers/Treefrg.jpg" width="216" height="215"><br>
  <a href="http://www.treeofrogs.com" target="_blank">Tree O Frogs - Butter Your 
  Lips</a>. Swanky sax driven and wahwah soaked funk with a rockin' attitude from 
  the Bay area that also has a very strong sense of post-fusion melodics. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/cd%20covers/Brmhall.jpg" width="216" height="213"><br>
  <a href="http://www.doylebramhall2.com" target="_blank">Doyle Bramhall II &amp; 
  Smokestack- Welcome</a>. Fret sizzling guitar god rock that flashes back to

  Crowes will dig this CD</p>
<p>Also posted a few new and exciting links for your cyber surfing pleasure. Joseph 
  'Red Dog' Campbell is an original roadie for the Allman Brothers, dating back 
  to the legendary southern rock band's inception in the late '60s. Red Dog has 
  written a new book, 'A Book of Tails,' that is a raucous, insider's first hand 
  account of the sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll lifestyle the Allman Brothers 
  were living in their early years. A Book of Tails can be purchased directly 
  from <a href="http://www.legendaryreddog.com" target="_blank">Red Dog's website</a>, 
  and if you are an Allman Brothers fan, or just wanna know what it's like to 
  go behind the scenes with one of the wildest rock bands of all time, this book 
  is a must for your library.</p>
