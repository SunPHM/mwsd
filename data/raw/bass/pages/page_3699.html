<p class="MsoNormal">Since I had a six hour layover in Frankfurt, and had never 
gotten a German stamp on my passport, I took the opportunity to take the train 
into town. It was only about a 10 minute ride. I strolled the streets of the 
historic downtown and treated myself to the Städel Kunstmuseum, one of the 
finest art museums in Germany. I didn’t have time to sit down to eat some 
strudel, but I did stop at a sidewalk grocer and had them make me a sandwich. I 
found my way back to the right train with the help of a 6’4” German. Between his 
pathetic English and my worse German, we enjoyed getting to know one another. 
Arrived in Prague at 8:30 and was met at the Airport by Jim Barnes who escorted 
me to the flat. Got to bed by 10:30. With the help of a little blue pill, I 
slept quite well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally I have arrived at the Seminary. After attending 
church with the Barnes at the International Church (about half its members are 
missionaries or foreign workers, so it has more of a western feel than Czech), 
we had lunch at Cesky Raj downtown, just off Wenceslas Square. By the time we 
caught up and paid the bill, it was 3:30. About an hour later I was strolling 
into the beautiful grounds of the seminary, the former headquarters of the 
communist party (as well as those of the S.S. Nazis). It is in a secluded wooded 
area with a creek running through the valley below. The sounds of rumbling tram 
cars clacking down the tracks, the sight of majestic European architecture, the 
smells of outdoor cafes is intoxicating in this place. My soul is at peace. Here 
is a place I can not only study but rest, dream, and pray (equally important 
activities). I settled into my room at 4:30 p.m. and after unpacking took about 
a 30 minute rest. Jet lag was a bit stronger this time around. At 6:00 there was 
a picnic on the hill overlooking the seminary. Grilled sausage and pork chops 
reminded me that I was in Eastern Europe. As I sat down and was welcomed into 
this community, I met a brother from Russia, another student from Moldova, 
Estonia, Germany, Kurdistan, Liberia, Canada, Bulgaria, Australia, Kyrgyzstan, 
Serbia, Israel, and the Ukraine. We heard songs from all over the world – 
Africa, Asia, Europe, U.S. This is, by far, the most diverse place I’ve ever 
been. My heart is souring, thinking about doing Biblical Theology in such a 
context where multiple views massage (and perhaps clash) with my own thinking. 
After dinner I sent Barbara and email and then headed downtown to stroll across 
the Charles bridge, listen to some street musicians, and sit quietly under the 
statue of Jan Huss in Old Town square eating a gelato. &nbsp;In bed by 11:30.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After a wonderful time of worship, the ten new PhD students 
separated to go over their proposals and get introduced to one another. Tanja 
Petrova is from Bulgaria; Olu from Liberia, Doug from Canada, Vitali from 
Moldova, Tsrivinoko from Russia, living in Fresno, CA. Other will be introduced 
later. The afternoon was given to informational meetings, a couple of hours of 
library time, and a commencement service with one student graduating. At supper 
I had an extended conversation with Roland Graham from the Oxford Institute for 
Mission’s Studies. He will be my mentor and was very helpful in helping me shape 
my thesis ideas for presentation tomorrow. After a conversation with him I ran 
to the library to work for a couple of hours before it closed at 9:00. Came back 
to the room and read until 10:30 then fell asleep. It is now 3:15 a.m. and I’ve 
been up for an hour thinking, shaping, and typing on my thesis proposal. I 
probably should sleep, but how when one is this excited?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Woke up tired but eager for the day. I presented my 
dissertation proposal 10 minutes before lunch. Mine was the only one in the 
entire room that was in the Biblical Studies area, not in applied theology – 
every other student was doing a specific ethnographic study from his or her own 
country and how that would impact evangelism. So I was a bit concerned about how 
it would be received. But it was enthusiastically received, more so than I had 
hoped. In fact, the two Bulgarian seminary professors (both women about 30 years 
old and very sharp) talked with me at length about it over lunch and provided 
some expert insight through their prospective disciplines of Theology and Church 
History. The afternoon was given over to nitty gritty discussions about 
requirements for PhD level research. After 3 hours we are all scared out of our 
minds. I suspect the library will be packed tonight. Barbara, you are a saint 
for what you’re about to endure with me. I guess I’ll have to wait until 
Thursday before my proposal will be fully critiqued since we have another 
lecturer in Theology all day tomorrow. For me, it will be a quick bite to eat at 
18.00 and then about 6 hours of shaping my proposal before I meet with my mentor 
after chapel first thing in the morning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The community opened the day with worship after breakfast 
as usual. Except on Wednesday it lasts a full hour and includes the Lord's 
Supper. I have never been in a service that exalted the Lord's Supper nor one 
that advocated its frequency as much as my Baptist brothers have here. Seventy&nbsp; 
five people were in the room, all sharing one loaf and two cups and many, many 
countries, languages, and backgrounds. For me, this supper is too often a symbol 
of some past event. For many of my fellow students, it is the cause of their 
persecutions. To share it with them in their poverty and suffering was a great 
honor. The rest of the morning was given to library work that bled over into the 
afternoon. At 16:00 we met in the chapel for an hour and a half lecture on Human 
Rights and particularly how the Baptist church has led out in that movement 
through Richard Overton who began the modern human rights awareness in 1646, as 
well as Martin Luther King, and Jimmy Carter. They rightly have something to be 
proud of. Our presenter, Glen Stassen, is a world renowned author and speaker in 
Christian Ethics and a staunch civil rights activist who actually heard 
first-hand &quot;I have a dream.&quot; Tomorrow I will have a private meal with him to go 
over my dissertation proposal and its implication for ethics of self-abnegation. 
I should mention that the weather has been idyllic -- sunshine and mid-seventies 
in the day and cool at night. The sunshine across the smartly manicured lawn and 
fountain in the courtyard makes a lovely interlude from the academic caves of 
the library.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As I write this the morning sun is cascading into my fourth 
story room. It is rather small; smaller than a dorm room at Ozark but it's ten 
foot ceilings and clean white walls give it a more spacious feel. The white pine 
furniture (two beds, two small night stands, and a cabinet for clothes) give it 
a kind of rustic feel. There is no air conditioning but it really is not needed 
here in September. In fact, my sandal laden feet are a bit chilly in the 
mourning, but they celebrate the fresh air after lunch. I've not left the campus 
since arriving. I'm eager for a bit of an adventure this afternoon, if running 
to the market for some toothpaste can be so classified. Nancy Murphy lectures 
today, a noted postmodern &quot;conservative&quot; theologian from Fuller. I've only read 
about half of the material she sent to be compiled for prospective students. 
There is just no way to process it all and still make progress on the 
dissertation proposal. So I'll listen attentively to the lectures with the 
background I do have and decide whether the rest of the reading is worthwhile or 
not. Lord, while I write this my family sleeps in the dead of night. Please 
watch over them; give them dreams of you and me if you're so kind. Guard their 
peace, safety and holiness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Murphy lectures yesterday exceeded my expectations. Her 
grasp of historical philosophy and scientific theory was spellbinding. I don't 
know that she made me a thorough going Postmodern, nonetheless, her account of a 
Christian Postmodern account of truth that was both defensible and not given to 
complete subjectivism or moral relativism was a happy event for me. I'm sitting 
in my room with my new friend Vitali Yuchkovski from Moldova, showing him the 
wonders of the World Wide Web. He shows such kindness in his spirit; please pray 
for his ministry and studies. This evening I went to town and ate right along 
the river -- it was a pleasant little cafe with a spectacular view of the 
castle. Then I treated myself to an evening at the Prague Philharmonic. It was a 
performance of three artists: Antonin Dvo<font face="Times New Roman">&#345;ák's 
Slavonic Rhapsody No. 3; Josep Suk's Fairy Tale, Op. 16; and Leoš Janá&#269;ek's 
Glagolitic Mass. It was breath-taking from the great Rudolfino Theater to the 
unparalleled performance, to the native Czech music being rehearsed with such 
pride.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After a wonderful worship service with the student body and 
other church members we had a dinner in the cafeteria as a church body. I then 
came up to my room and helped a couple students with computer related issues. 
That took up a couple of hours. After a good reading session I headed to the 
Castle for a Baroque string concert in the St. George Basilica. It was a 
compilation of various artists including Mozart Evening Music and Vivaldi's Ave 
Maria. It was perhaps the most beautiful sounds ever to cascade upon my ears. I 
made it back to the Seminary by 7:15 for a table reservation at the nearby Mýln 
Restuarant where I had a succulent Sea Bass dinner with a Czesky Salad and 
Tiramisu for dessert. Now at 9:30 in my room I have several hours of reading to 
prepare for tomorrow. But what a perfect day it's been!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt">These last two days have been 
very full. We had eight hours of lectures by Ivanna Noble, a lecturer from 
Charles University, the oldest University in Central Europe. She is a native 
Czech, Phd from the University of Heathrop in London. She is a former Hussite 
Cleric who lectures on Postmodern Culture (which looks <i>very</i> different in 
a European perspective and an Anglo-American one). Last night I went out with my 
dear friends Tomaš and Marketta Sedla&#269;ek. We had a wonderful dinner, followed by 
a walk around the Charles Bridge, ending with tea in their flat overlooking the 
river and the Tyn church beyond, where Jon Huss once preached freedom of 
religion a century before Luther was born. This evening I had two important 
discussions about my thesis with the dean of the college Parush Parushev 
(Bulgarian) as well as my advisor in N.T. Studies, Peter Penner (a German/Russion, 
former rector of the Baptist University in St. Petersberg). They were both very 
helpful and encouraging. I’m near the point of formalizing my initial two page 
proposal which will then be expanded to a 20 page document which will be 
submitted to the University of Wales. Please pray for my new friend from 
Lebanon. He is preaching Christ in such a difficult area. Perhaps you would like 
to help him. Let me know.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, after two weeks, I have finished my dissertation 
proposal (below). It still needs to be sharpened quite a bit, but that will 
happen when it is expanded to a 10-20 page document to be sent to the University 
of Wales. I need to read considerably more before I'm ready to do that, however. 
So with the excellent help of Ozark's library staff, I will be busy becoming an 
expert in the politics of Jesus . . . or at least that is the general plan. 
Today we were treated to a field trip to a medieval art gallery (pieces from the 
14th and 15th centuries) with our Hussite Priest postmodern cultural expert. It 
really was revealing to hear her take on the nature and purpose of Czech art of 
that period.&nbsp; Tomorrow I will spend reading my final book before I go and 
packing my things. I am unbelievably homesick for Barbara and quite eager to get 
back to my students as well. However, this place is like a monastery of

  PhD Proposal in Biblical Studies – Initial Draft<br>
  Mark E. Moore (September 2004)<br>
&nbsp;</b></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Title: </b>Jesus’ Political Strategy of Self-Abnegation: 
A Socio-Political Analysis with Special Reference to Mark 10:35-45.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><b>Research Question:</b> What 
was Jesus’ political strategy?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><b>Motivation 
and Purpose for this research: </b>It has been my life quest to take seriously 
the teachings of Jesus, who is, in my estimation, without peer in his influence, 
perspicuity, and ethic. Much of the force of his teachings have been obscured 
because of Christendom’s penchant to domesticate Jesus by relegating him to a 
spiritual (hence ethereal and distant) figure. I hope to bring him back to 
earth, so to speak, to reactivate the incarnation by clearly identifying what 
Jesus meant when he called his disciples to imitate his cross in 
self-abnegation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><b>Location of 
and need for the research in current scholarship: </b>In recent years there have 
been two major advances in gospel studies. First, there has been a reemphasis on 
the Jewishness of Jesus leading to a keen awareness of his socio-political 
nature within his own time and culture. This has particularly been led by N.T. 
Wright, with a satellite of other significant voices (e.g. E. P. Sanders, J. D. 
Crossan, J. Jeremiahs, P. Meier), so that it is now clearly understood that 
Jesus was a political figure of a Middle-Eastern sort. Second, Sociologists have 
converged upon the Mediterranean world of the first century and shed significant 
light on such structures as shame/honor, patron/client, and individualism. This 
advance has been led by such scholars as B. Malina, J. Neyrey, R. Horsley, and 
G. Theissen. These two major movements in gospel studies over the past fifteen 
years have called for a reassessment of much of the Biblical material pertaining 
to Jesus. It is my contention that Mark 10:35-45, pressed between these to 
movements would yield important results in understanding Jesus’ basic 
methodology for social engagement, providing a model which Biblical ethicists, 
pastors, and laypersons could follow. While ethicists such as J. Yoder, G. 
Stassen, A. Trocme, and M. Hengel have addressed these issues before, a more 
thorough analysis of Jesus’ political methodology in light of contemporary 
gospel research could strengthen their public appeal as well as sharpen their 
methodological focus.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><b>Scope of 
the research: </b>In order to answer the question of Jesus’ methodology this 
study will lay a foundation for understanding both Jesus’ political actions, as 
well as the sociological rules through which these actions are to be interpreted 
(Part 2). Next, I will attempt to locate the source of Jesus’ political 
methodology by surveying pertinent Greco-Roman, Rabbinic, and Old Testament 
literature, looking for the possible genesis from which Jesus extrapolated his 
own unique political methodology (Part 3). This will then help shape a clear 
description of Jesus’ methodology along with potential implications and 
directions for contemporary ecclesiastical application (Part 4).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><b>Methodology 
&amp; Resources: </b>This Historical Biblical Studies project will be synthetic in 
that it will use two major fields (N.T. Wright’s historical analysis and 
Neyrey’s, et. al., understanding of Mediterranean sociology) and descriptive in 
that it will reassess Jesus’ quintessential political methodology as articulated 
in Mark 10:35-45.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify"><b>Limitations 
of the Research: </b>(1)<b> </b>The Greco-Roman political sources examined will 
generally be limited to 63 B.C.E. to 135 C.E. – from the entrance of Pompey into 
Jerusalem to the third great Jewish rebellion against Rome of Bar Kokhbah. The 
Jewish sources will, by necessity, include the Mishna. (2) Moreover, I’m not 
going to thoroughly address the issue of ethics as it pertains of pacifism. This 
work will concentrate on the historic Jewish roots of Jesus, not the 
contemporary contextualization of his words in a post-modern context. While 
potential trajectories of ethics will be explicated in the final chapter, the 
variety of these specific applications will be left for others to develop.</p>
