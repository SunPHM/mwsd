The wind breaks are comfortable and make good shade during the summer.	The pier is well maintained and cleaned nearly daily.	<LI>Pacifica Pier: Many species of fish can be caught at this pier and some large	game fish (salmon and striped bass) can be caught during certain times of the year.	Best pier for crabbing that I have ever been to.	<LI>Oceanside Pier: Excellent pier for catching guitar fish, bonito and sometimes	barracuda. The bait shop on the pier usually has a good variety of bait and suggestions	for what bait is working currently.	<LI>Ocean Beach Pier: The kelp forests within casting distance produce several kinds	of rock fish. I've caught sea bass and sharks on this pier.	<LI>Cayucos Pier: My father taught me how to fish on this pier. We used to catch	loads of &quot;little red snapper&quot; (bocaccio) and would go back home and fry	them up. I've caught mackerel and bonito here also. I have yet to catch halibut here	but will continue trying on future visits.	</OL>	<P><BR>	-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_] <BR>	H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H <BR>	~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~ Mark Grim ~^~^~^~^ <BR>	^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^ Antioch CA ~^~^~^~^~^ <BR>	~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~^~</BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR WIDTH="75%"></P><P><CENTER><H2>Out Fishin'</H2></CENTER><CENTER><P><BR>By Edgar A.

Then, at about 11:30 PM (we started	fishing at 8:30-9 PM), we pulled up this alien looking huge crab in our net (we were	at the very end of the L shaped pier). We were hesitant to even pull it onto the	pier. It has a huge bulbous back end that narrowed down to a point where its head	was. It has 5 large and long legs on each side, with negligible claws. I'm not sure	how big it was but my guess is 8-10 inches thereabouts. We kept it and a friend took	it home. The other crabbers on the pier couldn't identify it. Any ideas? I'd appreciate	any help.</P>	<P>Thanks, Audrey</P>	<P><FONT COLOR="#000088">Hi Audrey,</FONT></P>	<P><FONT COLOR="#000088">I'm not an expert on crabs but it sounds like some type	of spider crab; I've seen some spiders that are really unusual looking (including	having things like sponges growing on their backs). But, as I said, I'm not an expert.	However, I'll get a couple of books out and see if it can be identified.</FONT></P>	<P><FONT COLOR="#000088">By the way, if you could get a good picture of it (showing	some detail), we could put the picture on the net and ask for comments. This has	been an unusual year for spider crabs with unusually large catches of unusually large	crabs at several spots along the coast.</FONT></P>	<P><FONT COLOR="#000088">Best wishes, Ken</FONT></P>	<P>Ken,</P>	<P>I found a page with a very similar picture, but the crab I caught was red, not	blue.
