    School Bass (9in. to 24in.). Larger &quot;Keeper&quot; Striped Bass (28in. to 34in.) 
    arrive a few weeks to a month later. By May 15<sup>th</sup> the spring migration continues and the Keeper Striped Bass show in larger numbers

    in the Rips and from the Beach. The Cinder Worm hatch occurs around this 
    time in the estuaries. This northerly migration persists for another month 
    or so until the fish take up residence and a regular feeding behavior. Big 
    Striped Bass (25lbs. To 40lbs.) are caught on live bait regularly in mid 
    June. As the summer days get longer and water temperatures rise, Striped

    There is nothing like catching Bluefish at Wasque Point. Bluefish are very strong, and one of the toughest 
    fighting fish around. Bluefish have sharp teeth and will bite through 
    monofilament line. A<a href="Blue%20Steve.jpg"><img border="2" src="Blue%20Steve_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Blue Steve.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="72"></a> 
    wire leader and a pair of needle-nose pliers are a must. The Bluefish start 
    to show up when water temperatures reach 55 degrees. Then around the first 
    week of May these fish appear along the South Shore and Wasque Point on Chappaquidick Island. An 11ft. 
    surf rod with 20lb test line, a bunch of 
    Roberts Rangers and hand full Kastmaster lures with a couple of wire leaders 
    is all you need. These fish can vary in size from 3lbs to 10lbs, some people 
    call these small Bluefish (3lbs to 5lbs) Rats or Rat Blues. There are also 
    large Bluefish either mixed in or in schools of their own. These are wildly 
    aggressive fish and will eat just about anything you can throw 
    at them. Anglers sometimes refer to these fish (9lbs to 12lbs+) as 
    Choppers. I have seen this class of fish destroy reels, part line, and crush 
    lures to bits. At times you will go through a complete tackle box full of 
    lures and your arms will feel like rubber bands. The early Spring Blues 
    appear to be much leaner than the fish in the fall. This is probably due to 
    their long migration, these long lean Bluefish are sometimes referred to as 
    Cruisers because of their long journey. Spring Bluefish will begin to gather 
    in the shallow sandy beaches, finning in the sunny calm water. As the long 
    Summer days raise the water temperature to the mid to upper 60's the bigger 
    Bluefish will start to move into deeper, cooler water. Large Bluefish can be 
    caught from shore in the late afternoon and into the evening past sunset 
    on bait, fished on the bottom. Resident Bluefish are everywhere throughout 
    the Summer, from the harbors to offshore. As the the Summer turns to Fall 
    the Bluefish fatten up for their migration south. Bigger Bluefish will be 
    caught between the middle of September and the middle of October on their 
    way south. This is your best chance to catch a 20lb. Bluefish. As November 
    arrives the Bluefishing fades and in a few weeks is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

    The Atlantic Bonito is the wildest and most beautiful of all the Gamefish that inhabit the waters of Martha’s 
    Vineyard. With keen eyesight, needle like teeth, and built for speed, these 
    little <a href="Bone%20IA25.jpg">
    <img border="2" src="Bone%20IA25_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Bone IA25.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="96"></a>footballs 
    can be a blast on light tackle. They can be caught from shore, but a small 
    boat is best to pursue these racy fish. The Bonito start to arrive in the 
    beginning of July and stay till the end of October. Fish range in size from 
    4lbs. to 8lbs. in the Summer, and over 10lbs in the Fall. Atlantic Bonito 
    have big eyes and can be very line shy and selective at times. What’s hot 
    one day may not be so successful the next day. Anglers love them for their 
    screaming runs and quick maneuverability as they fight. Atlantic Bonito are 
    also good to eat, their pink flesh is sushi grade and is great on the grill. 
    Bonito start to show in small numbers after the first week in July, when the 
    water temperature is around 68 degrees or better. More plentiful and 
    aggressive Bonito are usually caught in August. To catch an Atlantic Bonito 
    on the fly can be one of the most exhilarating fishing battles you may ever 
    have. A White Bunny Fly with an Intermediate fly line and 12lb to 20lb fluorocarbon 
    leader is standard equipment. The best lures to use would be 
    small white jigs, small chrome lures( Deadly Dicks, Swedish Pimples), and 
    small mackerel swimmers. As September begins and the False Albacore show, 
    the shy Atlantic Bonito become less available. Once the False Albacore start 
    to leave in October, the Bonito come back bigger and more aggressive. This 
    is the time when the 10lb to 12lb&nbsp; footballs show up. The Bonito will 
    hang around and fatten up for a few weeks until the fall storms blow them 
    offshore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

      The False Albacore is a species of Gamefish with many different names, 
      also known as Little Tunny, and called Bonito in the South, they are 
      commonly referred to on Martha’s Vineyard as simply Albies. This warm 
      water fish a<a href="Alby%20IA5.jpg"><img border="2" src="Alby%20IA5_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Alby IA5.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="79"></a>rrives 
      late in the Summer and leaves early in the Fall. Although they arrive in 
      large schools and dominate the local waters, the False Albacore is the 
      species that inhabits our area for the shortest time. Normally the Albie arrives around the Vineyard when the water temperature reaches 
      approximately 70 degrees. The False Albacore is a close cousin to the 
      Atlantic Bonito yet unmistakably different. Both have keen eyesight, a 
      Tuna shaped body, and feed in the same area, but the similarities end 
      there. The typical Albie weighs 6lbs to 9lbs with fish in the 10lbs to 
      15lbs class available at times. The State record is 19.5 lbs., caught in 
      Vineyard waters. The False Albacore is also different physically. They 
      have tinny little teeth and a fragile mouth, with a tall yet short dorsal 
      fin. For markings, they have a unique squiggly line pattern on their back 
      and black spots on the belly area. Little Tunny fight different as well, 
      they tend to have long screaming runs, which attracts anglers to this 
      speedster. They can be caught from shore or boat and seem to fall for 
      chrome, white, or blue lures and flies. False Albacore can be eaten but 
      are not considered a desirably fish for the table. The first scouts show 
      up from offshore, usually within a Gulf Stream eddy in the later part of 
      August. As September arrives, numbers and size of Albies increase. By the 
      end of the month the False Albacore can be found everywhere around the 
      Island, including inside the harbors. Large fish are continued to be 
      caught in October, but as the month progresses and the air and water 
      temperature begins to drop, the larger more sensitive fish thin out and 
      head back out to sea. Other pods of Albies will stick around and seek 
      warmer water areas and the outflows surrounding Martha’s Vineyard. 
      Depending on the Fall storms the False Albacore will can be caught up to 
      the last week in October.</font></div>

    The beginning of Summer marks a change in the fishing on Martha’s Vineyard. 
    Things evolve quickly in the environment, as the days get longer and the 
    temperature goes up. Other species of<a href="Fluke%20Tom.jpg"><img border="2" src="Fluke%20Tom_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Fluke Tom.jpg" align="right" width="75" height="122"></a> 
    fish start to arrive, Scup (Porgy), Summer Flounder (Fluke), and Black 
    Sea Bass. Although totally different from each other, they prefer variably 
    the same temperature. When the water temperature is in the 60 degree range 
    these fish begin to filter into Vineyard waters. This tends to occur in the 
    first few weeks in June, with larger fish showing up in July. As the Summer 
    progresses the fishing remains steady and, is a welcome change from fishing 
    for Striped Bass or Bonito. When looking for larger fish on the hot days of 
    August, always look towards the deeper, colder water. Fish can be caught in 
    the harbors and off the Bridges and Jetties in late Summer. As mid Fall and 
    October arrive large fish are still being caught. But when the water 
    temperature drops at the end of the month the fish start to leave.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: navy">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer Flounder are commonly referred 
    to as Fluke around the Island. They are usually found in moving water with a 
    sandy or soft bottom. Fish range from 1lb to 10lbs and are regulated by 
    the State for size and bag limit. These regulations change yearly, so check 
    with a tackle shop. Best time to catch a Doormat Fluke is in the first few 
    weeks of July. Big fish can also be caught later into the early Fall.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: navy">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scup or Porgy are a small fish that 
    live around the rocky structure along Martha’s Vineyard 
    coastline. They range in size from 5in To 3lbs and are also State 
    regulated. They are great fish for the kids to catch in the middle of the 
    Summer. </span></p>
    <p><span style="color: navy">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Black Sea Bass can be found in 
    the same water as the Scup. It ranges in size from 1lb to 6lbs and 
    <a href="Sea%20Bass%20Tom%20jpg.jpg">
    <img border="2" src="Sea%20Bass%20Tom%20jpg_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="Sea Bass Tom jpg.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="79"></a>are 
    usually caught from boats. These fish can also be caught around docks and 
    jetties in the Summer. Regulated by Law, Black Sea Bass are often kept for 
    the grill or the table. The larger Sea Bass, like most fish, are caught in the 
    deeper rocky water. Black Sea Bass will be the last of the these fish to 
    leave the Vineyard waters in late October.</span></p>
