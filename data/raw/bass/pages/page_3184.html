<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="PETA"></a>PETA's (People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals) recent ad campaign against fishing is shown below:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/news/dogfishbig.jpg" width="324" height="95"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also included is Rick Reilly's, a columnist from Sports Illustrated,
response to the recent ad.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/news/reilly_lifeofreilly_head_lg.gif" width="160" height="75"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA) has new billboards out that claim fishing is cruel. I totally agree. The
last time I went, all I caught was a sunburn, three hooks in the back of my
thigh and hell from my pals for forgetting the Off.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, this is not what PETA means. PETA
means fishing is cruel <i>to the fish.</i> Seriously. PETA plans to put up
billboards across the U.S. and in Canada that show a Labrador retriever with a
hook in his bloody lip. IF YOU WOULDN'T DO IT TO A DOG, the signs say, WHY DO IT
TO A FISH?</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And, of course, the answer is: Because fish do
not bring me my slippers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Look, I wailed for the whales. I fumed over fur.
I emotionally clubbed myself over the baby seals. But I'll be damned if I'm
going to weep over a walleye.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PETA says fish feel pain and that to snag one
with a steel hook, drag it along for 50 yards or so and then haul it out of the
water so it suffocates is sick. &quot;Why do we throw a Frisbee to some animals
and a barbed hook to others?&quot; PETA asks on its website.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And, of course, the answer is: Because fish
really suck at catching Frisbees.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PETA thinks it's evil to eat fish, too. But why
should we stop eating them when <i>they eat each other?</i> Besides, they had
their chance to evolve. They could've crawled out of the primordial ooze with
us, but they didn't. They decided to stay behind and swim in the water they pee
in and go around never blinking. When fish lift their scaly butts past us in the
food chain, they can eat us. Until then, pass the tartar sauce.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PETA even says catch-and-release is cruel. They
say the harm and stress caused by being caught and released is sometimes enough
to kill the fish later on. As if the fish go straight into therapy after being
caught.</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Fish: I'm telling you, Doc, I was just minding
my own business when I got hauled into the sky, examined by some weird beings
and then thrown back!</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fish psychiatrist: Lemme guess. A UFO, right?</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I mean, what's PETA going to do? You'll be
sitting at the counter in the deli, and suddenly, the PETA police will come
running in, shouting, &quot;All right, back away from the tuna melt and nobody
gets hurt!&quot; My God, we're talking about <i>fish</i> here. Fish have a brain
the size of a corn kernel.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Professor James Rose, a University of Wyoming
neuroscientist, studied fish for years and determined that they lack a neocortex
(parts of which process the brain's response to pain), much like Cubs fans.
Besides, if fish are so smart, why can you catch a fish, throw it back and then,
two hours later, catch <i>the same fish?</i> I mean, do you really want to save
something dumber than Robert Downey Jr.?</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Didn't Jesus fish? He seemed like a pretty
sensitive guy. When He zapped up all those fishes for 5,000 people, what do you
think He did with them, throw them back?</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I know, I know -- I hate hunting. But sitting in
the back of a pickup, taking a rifle with an infrared scope and killing a deer
from 1,000 yards away is not nearly the same thing as standing up to your spleen
in icy rushing river water, trying to cast the perfectly tied fly into the
perfect eddy to catch a rainbow trout. Is it our fault that the trout falls for
it? Tell you what: I will get behind hunting when hunters come up with a
shoot-and-release program.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Why does PETA stop at fish? Where does PETA stand
on the plight of the worm? And plankton? And the 1,000,000 micro-organisms that
are crushed by your boots every time you go on a nature hike? Have these PETA
vegetarians ever gotten close to a broccoli to hear its screams as it's
violently yanked from its birthplace and boiled to death?</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Fishing is cruel? I always thought fishing was
one of the most peaceful things you could do. What are fathers and sons supposed
to do together, knit sweaters out of each other's navel lint? What are we
supposed to read, Hemingway's <i>Old Man and the Parking Lot?</i></font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I'll tell you one thing. Before I agree to this
whole fish-human truce, somebody had better have a long face-to-face with the
sharks about it. I say we send a bunch of PETA members down right away.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="Bear Creek"></a>The Georgia DNR has
scheduled a meeting on May 2, 2002 to discuss the future of Bear Creek Reservoir.
This meeting will be held at the Jackson EMC building in Jefferson, Georgia at
7:00PM EST. All anglers, from all clubs, are encouraged to attend. Many
important issues will be discussed, including the possibility of &quot;slot
limits&quot;. The Georgia DNR is looking for some suggestions from anglers, to
aid them in setting this up correctly to manage &quot;trophy&quot; sized
largemouth.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a name="resultsbearcreek"></a>The meeting hosted
by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources was held at the EMC Building
located in Jefferson, Georgia. The meeting got a late start, 7:15PM, but lasted
for well over an hour. The meeting started with a short fifteen minute preview
by Jeffery P. Durniak, Regional Fisheries Supervisor. The preview was meant more
of an overview of the entire DNR &quot;decision making process. It was made
clear all the proposed regulations still have to be ratified by the Board of
Natural Resources later in the year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The proposed opening of the recreational facilities
is still on schedule for the Spring of 2003. While the last creel study has
shown the growth of the F-1 Largemouth are slightly behind schedule, the coming
year is suspected to make up the different.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Mr. Reggie Weaver, Fisheries Biologist, gave a
detailed talk on the expectations of the &quot;trophy&quot; lake, and some
history how the DNR is using other success stories to model this lake. Lake data has
be collected from Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma to name just a few of the
states researched. Several DNR
Law Enforcement Officers were also present to answer any questions. The balance
of the official meeting was question and answers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">What the DNR is proposing is a slot limit from 16
- 22 inches on all largemouth bass caught. Any fish caught in this size slot
must be immediately released back into the lake. This includes ALL anglers,
including tournament anglers. All species of pan fish will have the normal
Georgia limitations. There were other discussions about a 14 inch minimum and
also a 16 inch minimum for largemouth bass.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">While turnout for this important meeting was
light, about 25, the attendance vote for this slot limit was slightly split. TV
Channel 32, out of Toccoa, Georgia was there for both before and during meeting
interviews.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Georgia DNR is very anxious to know how you
feel about trophy management and this proposed slot limit. Please e-mail the
following information and put &quot;Bear Creek&quot; in the subject matter line:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#FF0000"><b>1. Full name<br>

E-MAIL HERE</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Remember, this lake is an experiment and the DNR
is being very open minded and is trying to please as many anglers as possible.
All information will be forwarded onto Mr. Jeffery Durniak and will be held in
the strictest of confidence.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In a demanding victory, Britt 
Daniels showed the 7 man field, how to get the job done at Lake Varner on 
06/29/2005. Britt's best five fish yielded an amazing 29.56 pounds. His largest 
hawg was 9.44 pounds shown here. Rumor has it, not only did Britt take home all 
the tourney fee money, he also bagged an additional $20 side bet made with 
Smitty. One can only wonder what Smitty was thinking making this side bet.
