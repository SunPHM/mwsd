efforts are already being made to control fishing of and therefore be able to 
monitor the population growth/decline of the Patagonian toothfish.&nbsp; 
Restaurants have voluntarily removed the popular delicacy from their menus.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Organizations like Greenpeace are active in 
making the issue of illegal fishing of Patagonian toothfish publicly known.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">The Convention on International Trade of 
Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), established in 1975, is now 
used by 160 countries to regulate and monitor international trade in wild 
resources (CITES 2002).&nbsp; </font></p>

</div>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">CITES, in conjunction with the Convention 
on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), are working 
to regulate the international exploitation and trade of the Patagonian toothfish.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">The major threat to the fish, says CITES, 
is Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) fishing; CCAMLR has specified 
allowable catch limits for toothfish per year, which many IUU fisheries exceed.&nbsp; 
A little over 243,000 tons of fish are caught per year, 50% of which is illegal 
(CITES 2002).&nbsp; Not only is this illegal fishing depleting the populations, 
but failure to report statistics on fishing means that there are gaps in the 
collective knowledge of population demographics.&nbsp; This makes management a 
more difficult task.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">International diplomats have become 
concerned with the threat against the Patagonian toothfish; in 1995, the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) adopted the Code of 
Conduct for Responsible fisheries.&nbsp; This code, however, is voluntary rather 
than mandatory.&nbsp; While certain nations have been cooperative in the effort 
to reduce the fishing of Chilean sea bass, other countries (such as Japan) have 
not (Stopping IUU web site). </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Even in the countries that are willing to 
adopt guidelines for fisheries, these guidelines are not always satisfactorily 
enforced.&nbsp; The same CNN report expresses the frustration of legitimate 
Australian fishing companies at the haphazardness of enforcement of the national 
quotas Australia has set (just over 2800 tons).&nbsp; Pirates have been pulling 
in about 2000 tons a year, but only six arrests have been made since 1997 (CNN).</font></p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">Management Plan Evaluation:</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">While steps have been taken in the right 
direction to stop illegal fishing practices, overfishing is still a threat.&nbsp; 
If conservatory organizations like Greenpeace continue to publicize this issue, 
perhaps diplomats will be better aware of its environmental significance as an 
ecosystem-wide problem.&nbsp; Possibly, international <i>requirements</i>, 
rather than <i>suggestions</i>, should be enacted, with stiff penalties for 
nations and pirate companies that do not adhere to them.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">The management plan will be considered 
effective if fish counts go up.&nbsp; Counts are obtained mostly through 
monitoring where toothfish transported commercially originate from; efforts to 
improve methods of keeping track of populations are outlined in the
<a href="http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/cds/p1.htm">Catch Documentation Scheme</a> 
implemented in 2002.&nbsp; However, participating in these efforts is voluntary.&nbsp; 
It is hoped that imposing strict <i>regulations</i> will 
improve the accuracy of these counts; if the penalties for IUU are harsh, less 
unreported fishing will take place, and therefore we will have more accurate 
numbers for toothfish populations.&nbsp; Furthermore, attention should also 
be paid to the populations of endangered albatrosses and petrels, which also 
suffer due to the overexploitation of toothfish populations.</font></p>
