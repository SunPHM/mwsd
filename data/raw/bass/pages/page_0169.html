					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,Sun Snas-Regular" size="4" color="maroon"><b>Drum Solos - The Art of Phrasing,</b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#660000"> released in May of 1998, was written to give the concept of soloing in phrases, in an organized way, to drummers who have had little experience in playing jazz music. There are many 2, 4 and 8 bar solo phrases that can be combined to produce solos of any length. The main idea is to think in two bar phrases and build on that. The book comes with a CD of Colin playing five tunes with a trio (featuring world renowned jazz guitarist </font><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#cc3300"><b>Bruce Forman</b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#660000">) so you can hear his soloing and also read the solo transcriptions. Then there is a play-to section (with drum charts) of the same five tracks that gives you the opportunity to trade fours and eights with the guitar and bass. A click track is provided in the solo spaces. For drummers wanting to get into jazz this book will provide some solid material to work with and will certainly enlighten you to the concept of &#147;soloing in phrases.&#148;</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,Sun Snas-Regular" size="4" color="maroon"><b>Bass Drum Control Solos - </b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#660000">Released in September 2002, this is a follow up to the original <i>Bass Drum Control</i>. The material is in solo form, using the whole drum set. Colin extensively utilizes the bass drum in his solos, as it is one of the drums in the set and he feels it should be used more. It can provide drummers with a larger range of options in creating a more colorful solo, with the use of 2, 3, 4 or more bass drum beats when combined with the snare, toms and cymbals. On the C.D., Colin plays some solos from each page. For those drummers who have, for many years, gone through the exercises in the original <i>Bass Drum Control</i>, this is a totally different book, and is fun to play. A single or double pedal can be used in these solos.</font></p>
