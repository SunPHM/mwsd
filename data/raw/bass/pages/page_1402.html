        guitars entirely by hand from scratch is becoming a lost art. It is very 
        time consuming, labor intensive and commercially impractical. Most importantly, 
        making guitars by hand requires considerable skill and talent. These days 
        it is virtually impossible for guitar companies to manufacture guitars 
        without the aid of computerized machines which speed production and enable 
        them to use an inexpensive workforce.</font><font size="3"><br>

        <font color="#FF8000">Having been a guitar enthusiast most of my life 
        and having owned dozens of different guitars, I eventually realized that 
        I wasn't satisfied with any of them. Most of the guitars I owned - and 
        some were very expensive - were all mass-produced, machine-made instruments 
        which lacked that certain quality which I could never explain. I found 
        that factory, machine-made guitars had no <i>soul</i> and therefore could 
        not affect me emotionally, as a good instrument should.<br>
        <br>
        I eventually realized that there was a better way to do things, so I set 
        out to make my own guitars entirely by hand. Not surprisingly, the very 
        first guitar I ever built was better than any other guitar I ever owned 
        previously regardless of brand or price. What made the difference? The 
        human element consisting of irregularity, variability and inconsistency; 
        a person's touch and feel are the ingredients essential in the making 
        of guitars or any other musical instrument.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="build-2.jpg" alt="Owner Alex cutting the Perfect Neck and Samurai Headstock "
    width="420" height="282" align="left" valign="TOP">My guitar making process 
        consists of shaping bodies and necks as precisely as humanly possible 
        but not at the level of programmable machines. Perfection and precision 
        are not my primary goals. Since I guide every operation by hand, my workmanship 
        is not precise to the thousands of an inch but it does result in some 
        of the best feeling and most ergonomic bodies and necks you will ever 
        play. I choose <i>not</i> the &quot;finest, most beautifully figured and 
        flawless woods&quot; but instead the most <i>unique</i> and <i>interesting</i> 
        pieces regardless of blemishes, imperfections or &quot;tone-wood&quot; 
        status. Unlike other companies, I try not to buy wood from &quot;select 
        lumber mills&quot;, because I understand that fancy and expensive wood, 
        used to &quot;package&quot; the instrument is not what is needed to make 
        a great guitar. My design and manufacturing process utilizes only primitive 
        Old World craftsmanship and never any &quot;New World technology&quot;. 
        I understand that anyone can push a button on a machine and that &quot;groundbreaking 
        computer technology&quot; is both a sacrilege and a disgrace when it comes 
        to building great guitars. &quot;Achieving the most exact tolerances found 
        in the guitar industry&quot; is nothing to be proud of. It's like an artist 
        bragging about painting by numbers.<br>

    height="420" align="right" valign="TOP"></font></font></font><font color="#FF8000">Over 
        the years, the <b><i>craftsman</i></b> look of guitars has been lost to 
        the dull machine-made look of cookie cutter regularity. In the fifties 
        and sixties (the golden years of guitar making) much of today's high tech 
        manufacturing was unavailable and the only way to build guitars was by 
        hand. Companies had to rely on the imprecise touch of highly skilled humans 
        as opposed to the latest computerized machinery. The quality of the workmanship 
        30 years ago was considerably less precise than anything made today by 
        high-tech machinery. These vintage guitars are sought after today for 
        their great feel and this is precisely what I set out to achieve and emulate 
        by handcrafting my guitars. I build guitars in the way they were built 
        in the past. I believe that the reason vintage guitars are considered 
        special in feel and tone is precisely because of their <b><i>imperfection, 
        imprecision and inconsistency</i></b>. This makes each vintage guitar 
        a true individual creation with qualities that make them more appealing 
        physically and emotionally.<br>
        <br>
        When it comes to hand craftsmanship, the beauty of the work lies in the 
        natural flaws of the material. The graininess of the wood and the visible 
        tool marks in the work piece, bring out a character, which no machine 
        can duplicate. Today, guitars are built utilizing the &quot;most advanced 
        technology&quot; and therefore &quot;ruthless precision&quot; has replaced 
        the human touch. Just as imperfection makes us all human, it also makes 
        a guitar feel more comfortable to a human.<br>
        <br>
        By making guitars entirely by hand, one at a time, I have gained complete 
        control and freedom of design. I do not copy any other guitar design, 
        nor do I subscribe to any trends, gimmicks or fads. I am not bound by 
        tradition, nor am I limited or influenced by commercialism. My guitars 
        are originals and every aspect of their design has a single purpose; to 
        make a better instrument. With a <b><i>Zachary Handcrafted Guitar</i></b> 
        you can reclaim the look and feel of hand-made; <b><i>truly</i></b> and 
        <b><i>entirely hand-made</i></b>.</font></font><font color="#FF8000"><br>
