<P>Though it has not always been easy, Greta Brinkman has managed to achieve that level of credibility that few woman bass players have. Through a long list of studio and live gigs over the 20 plus years she has been out there, sloughing away, she has built a reputation of dependability, talent, and personality that few male bassists have achieved.</P>

<P>In bands, some obscure but all valuable learning tools, she has earned the right to call her present gig with MOBY hers alone.   </BR CLEAR="left"></P>

<P>In bands such as <I>Lucid Nation, Unseen Force, Wasted Talent, The Toilet Boy's, Supla's Zoo, the SanFran band, The Nuns,</I> with <I>L7</I> on their album 'The Beauty Process' and with her own band <I>The Squeeze Box</I> acting as bandleader, she built her craft. Later having a ball with Johnny Fayva a.k.a Russell Steinberg in a fake 70s lounge group, she then moved to working with the legendary Debbie Harry. </P>

<P>Through her friendship with Ali, MOBY's bassist and road manager at the time, she got wind of his wish to retire from the gig. Doing both jobs for MOBY was a bigger piece of activity than he wanted, and he was looking to hand over the bass gig to someone he believed in. He asked her if she would be interested in taking his place. </P>

<P>Soon afterwards she found herself on the Letterman show and soon after that at Woodstock `99!  This developed from what originally was thought to be a 6-week tour.</P>

<P>However, reality had different plans for Greta...sales and concert opportunities for Moby's album 'PLAY' went through the roof.</P>

<P>One and one half years later and she is still working. Presently in Japan for a week and then on to a two month tour of Europe (where we will catch up to her in Zurich for a follow-up talk in October), Greta takes a moment from her maniacal schedule to talk to Bass Inside Magazine about life on the road with MOBY...  </P>

<P><B>Bass Inside:</B><FONT COLOR="blue"> So how did this all start? Why bass and not some other instrument?  Did the bass 'speak ' to your spirit?  Was there a dream from the beginning of doing this for a living? And I hear there is an interesting story to do with why you play left handed?</FONT COLOR></P>


<P><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="gretayelbass.jpg" height="210" width="210" alt="Greta live"><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../../1x1.gif" width="1" height="210"><FONT COLOR="red"><B>Greta Brinkman: </B></FONT COLOR>I read years ago that women respond to low frequencies (more like a man's voice?) and men are attracted to high frequencies (more like a woman's voice?), and if that's true it might help explain why so many guys are guitarists, and so many women bassists.</P>

<P>For me, even before I ever played a note, I always listened to the rhythm section, to me that's the backbone of any band. When I first left home at 16, someone had left a little homemade bass behind in the rooming house I was living in. A year later I joined a local punk band and learned to play. But this first bass was so badly made and crappy that I couldn't finger the frets with my left hand (I'm right-handed, actually), the action was too high. So, I figured it wouldn't make too much difference if I just turned the whole thing around and learned that way, plus it seemed to me that the fat string should be on the bottom. </BR CLEAR="left"></P>

<P>Of course, now, years later I realize it's practically impossible to play chords, and funk is right out of the question. No big loss, though.</P>

<P><B>Bass Inside: </B><FONT COLOR="blue">You started playing in 1980, quite a while ago really. A lot of artists go through different kinds of learning curves in their playing. When you look at your career, would you say you are in a strong learning period now, either in technique or music knowledge and awareness?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="red"><B>Greta Brinkman: </B></FONT COLOR>I do feel I've come a long way in my career, but there's always more to learn. For example, as a result of playing in punk bands where I could never hear myself, I have never had any sense of finesse, and always play too hard. Plus, I never did get comfortable with a pick. And it took years for my timing to get halfway good. The last year has been really interesting for me though, after 2 years of playing with a backing track in the Moby band, I went back to Virginia and joined an <I>amazing</I> metal band called Atomizer, and it opened up my horizons all over again. Playing live music with incredible musicians and an amazing drummer, I have become so much better just in the last few months. I can feel the difference now that I'm back on the road with Moby.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">You mention in your bio that what was thought to have been only a six-week tour with MOBY turned into 17 months of work and experience and memory building that you can carry with you for the rest of your life.  How much longer do you see this current album with Moby carrying the band forward?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Well, all I know about for sure is that after these 2 months in the States, we are going to Japan for a week (I love Japan!), and then 2 months in Europe. And I heard rumors about Australia (I <I>love</I> Australia!) in February.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Has Moby talked about the tour's inevitable end?  Have you all talked about what will happen when the tour winds down?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="gretablue.jpg" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="294"><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="294">Nah, all I can say for sure is that Moby will be staying busy. That guy works harder than anyone I've ever met in my life. I must say, if anyone out there feels jealous or resentful of Mo for his success, take it from me: he has earned every bit of it.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Is there a small part of you that is looking forward to just sitting still, not needing to watch the clock and the countdown to the gig, just watching some mindless TV, hanging out with friends, just doing NOTHING!?  Like 'normal' people do!</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>God, yes! It may sound strange, but when I'm on the road I miss the stupidest things, like doing laundry and folding towels, and making tea in MY kitchen and lying on MY couch listening to music. Although doing 'nothing' isn't really in my vocabulary; when I get back I expect to be busy with Atomizer.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">After the tour is over, is there other work lined up yet?  Has the tour and the profile and notoriety generated any offers from other bands or label 'suits'?  Would you take another round of touring when Moby's next album comes out or do you neeed a rest?</FONT COLOR></BR CLEAR="right"></P>

<P>I don't have any plans at the moment. Maybe I need to get a manager! I'm not very good at self-promotion, I always prefer to let my work and reputation speak for me, and thus I'm not especially high profile.  I would take another tour after the Moby one only if it was somebody I really liked and respected, and got along with, because after a while the money takes second place to your quality of life. That is, it wouldn't be worth it for me personally to go out with somebody I hated even for piles of cash. I don't need it <I>that</I> badly.</BR CLEAR="left"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Though MOBY tends to play most, if not all, the instruments on his albums, has there ever been any talk of you playing on some or even the entire next one? Would you fall on your butt if he did ask you?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>It's true. Mo is a very talented musician, and plays everything on his records himself, except the vocals. He's always done it that way and that's what he's used to and what works (obviously!) for him. So I would never expect to be invited to play on his music.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">When you are on the road, do you find time or make time to do some writing for yourself and if so, tell us how that is progressing?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Being on the road can be a very soul-killing experience for a musician. Usually you never have time to play or write or record (how I envy bands who have a recording setup in their bus!). I spend my time answering e-mails and trying to learn various computer programs so I can update my website or put down some bass lines, but I gotta say, with not much success. I did go out and buy a new Korg Pandora's box thingy so I can now play along with my Deep Purple (regular tuning) and Melvins (drop D) CD's on the bus, and it is frickin' GREAT!!!</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Do you play any other instruments?  Is there an instrument out there that you would really like to tangle with, to really master?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Like any good bass-playing fan of Led Zeppelin, I also dabble in keyboard (the one-finger technique). But I'm really not all that interested in anything but bass, bass, bass, except I would like to improve my backing vocals. My one singer, Supla (a big star back in Brazil) once told me I had a beautiful Bossa-Nova voice. I'd be interested to add that to Atomizer, it would certainly make us stand out from the barking-dog school of metal bands! </P> 


<P><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="gretahugbass.jpg" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="301"><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="301"><I><FONT COLOR="blue">After the years of experience under your musical belt, for you, personally, as a player, what would you like to do to grow as a musician, as a bassist?</FONT COLOR></I></BR ALIGN="right"></P>

<P>I would like to improve my timing, and learn to have some finesse. I'm still not interested in learning free jazz or anything like that, because I am a rock musician and always will be.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">I have read other sources that say you recall that there were times that have been hard in NYC, paying your dues, just being concerned with getting by, that eating out of garbage pails was a reality for you for a while. It's true that necessity tends to muzzle vanity, but how did you come to the point where you picked up your first bit of 'previously enjoyed food'? Now that that time has gone from your life, can you find humor in that difficult experience?  Have you found the harder times in the past make you really frugal in spending money, particularly on yourself?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>It's no big deal, really. When you see someone throwing away their perfectly good French fries, and you're hungry, why not? It's not like, living in New York City, you can't possibly <I>not</I> be exposed to all kinds of disgusting germs anyway, let's be real.</P>

<P>And I've always been frugal, it didn't take years of poverty to make me like that. But I must say nowadays I really enjoy being able to buy dinner for my friends who aren't doing as well as I am, and I know it'll all come around when I'm between gigs and low on cash.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">You are quoted as saying that "I developed a good reputation as a real professional who is always on time and pleasant to work with".  Did it occur to you pretty soon in the struggle and competition for work, that this was something you had better cultivate if you wanted that work?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>No, that also was never an issue, because it's just my nature to be hardworking, professional and agreeable. If I was smart I would be more of a self-promoter, but that's just not my nature.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Do you often see other musicians that haven't figured that out yet and if so, are you tempted to 'save' them years of what you went through?  Did any one ever let you in on this 'secret to success' or did you have to figure that one out yourself?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Well, it really is no secret, it should be blatantly obvious. However, you can't make someone realize something until they're ready to see it for themselves.</P>


<P><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="gretagk.jpg" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="240"><IMG ALIGN="right" SRC="../../1x1.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="240"><FONT COLOR="blue">Do you feel you have to constantly prove and reprove yourself as a bassist and a musician?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I have gotten the "what's it like for a woman" question for years, and it is still a valid one. When people ask me what it's like, I usually just say that it's probably no worse than being a woman in any other area of life! I have no doubt whatsoever that I have lost out on a lot of gigs because of my gender. Sometimes not even because I or my playing was the issue, but because somebody was afraid that the presence of a woman on the tour would make the GUYS feel inhibited!</P>

<P>Yes, it is enough to make you puke. But that's the reality of the situation, and you can't change things by whining. All I can do is act like a professional and let my work speak for itself. And, I will say this: now that I have finally arrived to the point where I'm in ads and on company websites, it's actually an advantage to me because I am kind of a rarity and stand out from the crowd. I think I might even be the <I>only</I> woman on the Carvin website.</BR CLEAR="right"></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">In your bio, you refer to the effect that September 11th had on you, that it was re-evaluation time for your whole life. You mentioned that you were able, after these events, to strip away what wasn't adding to your life and start pursuing what was. The band 'Atomizer' is one such positive thing. What does it give you that you weren't finding elsewhere?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Previous to Sept. 11 and the Moby gig, I was a session musician in NYC for about 7 years. It was extremely interesting and a great learning experience to play all those other people's music, and see and understand how they put music together and present themselves to the world. But it was kind of a strain being so pleasant all the time! What I love about Atomizer is that, first of all, it's a real rock band playing real rock, and second, that I can be myself. Of course there's no money in it (yet) but it is absolutely <I>wonderful</I> having a real band. It's like finding a real relationship after years of dating. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Talking about dating, how's your social life? </FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Rather unsatisfying right now, actually. I separated from my husband right after 9/11 when I realized we would never see the world in the same way (no hard feelings though). It would be great to meet someone special, but I have had kind of an odd life I guess. I have a hard time relating to men in the 'straight' world, and they likewise don't understand my life. Because music is 40% to 60% of my life, I need, ideally, a musician, as well as someone highly intelligent, and that narrows it down! Plus, I just turned 40, and most of Mo's fans are about 20. So I'm sure the love of my life is out there somewhere, but I probably won't meet him at a Moby show! </P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT COLOR="red"><I>We have NO idea why Greta is sitting at a yacht club playing her bass, but hey, she looks happy and that's all that matters!!!</I></FONT COLOR></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">You have said that "when I hear the siren call of Moby, of course I must go!"  What does the Moby tour give you that you don't have with Atomizer yet?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I have a lot of respect for Moby, and like him as a person. It's fun to tour with him and I enjoy being part of a show that means a lot to a lot of people. And it's great to see parts of the world I never usually get to, like Australia and Japan, and who wouldn't want to open for U2 at Slane Castle in Dublin? Also, thanks to this lovely gig, people finally know who I am and I get endorsement deals with all the companies I've always liked. Basically, thanks to Moby, I can now say I've arrived as a bassist!</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">For the 'gear-heads ' out there, and that means most of us to some degree or another, who do you endorse right now and how did you come to decide upon them?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I have always (well, for the last 17 of the 21 years) played a Gallien-Krueger 800RB head with various cabinets. Imagine my delight to actually <I>meet</I> mister Bob Gallien, and find out he's a great guy, <I>and</I> get free amps from his company! It's a dream come true.</P>

<P>Bass-wise, I used to mostly play a Fender Bullet with a Telecaster neck that I bought from a GWAR roadie for 150 bucks. But when I got 'famous' I got an endorsement with Carvin, which I like because they're kind of an indie company, and the guitars are nice and light (good for me because I run around a lot onstage), and the necks feel just great.</P>

<P>And I have always used GHS Bass Boomers, they are the strings that last the longest when you are young and poor. Plus, after using one set for 6 months, you can boil them for a few minutes and get another show or 2 out of them. Plus, they're cheap. And now, they, too give me free stuff <I>and</I> put me in their ad! It's great.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Can you tell us a bit about your bass collection?  Do you still have your first bass, or do you know who has it and do you want to kill them for having it? (joke intended)</FONT COLOR></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="gretanfriends.jpg" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="174"></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT COLOR="red"><I>Greta'n'Friends...</I></FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I wouldn't call it a bass 'collection'. As long as the neck feels good, I'm really not very fussy about what I play and don't feel any need to have a different bass for every song. Yes, I do still have my first bass, the nut is made out of a Lego block and the bridge is a random piece of wood just sitting on the body, but it was a good bass and served me well. The Fender got its guts all ripped out when a stage diver in Dresden (or was it Stuttgart?) stepped on my cable, and I haven't fixed it yet. And I'm playing my regular 4-string Carvin most days. They also made me a 5-string that is just beautiful (Atomizer tunes down to C which wreaks havoc on an ordinary truss rod), and a semi-acoustic hollow body that is gorgeous too, but I haven't really had the chance to play it much.</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Do you have any regrets? What about the things you have had to give up? </FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I do, I do have regrets. Mostly I regret that I didn't get serious about being a musician a lot sooner. I really had no idea that I <I>was</I> a real musician and could (sometimes) make a living at it. It wasn't until I moved to NYC in 1994 to play with Debbie Harry that I decided to really go for it, and as with everything else, that only looks clear in retrospect. I really didn't know what I was doing. I have had to give up some things. Besides security and health insurance that might come from a 'regular' life (and which is not a big issue for me because I couldn't survive a 9-to-5 under fluorescent lights without turning to hard drugs), I can't have children. That's not usually a problem for me because I'm not interested in having kids, but once in a while I do get wistful about it, and for the 'normal' life I might have had. I guess most women (and probably a lot of men) feel that way though. I'm sure nobody's 'normal' life is all hearts and flowers.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Other than Moby and Atomizer, if you could play in any group, who would it be?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple (circa 1974) or the Melvins. No question. It may sound cheesy, but I think any real musician would agree that Zeppelin is <I>still</I> the gold standard of musicianship, songwriting, and arranging. And when I keep harping on 'real' musicians, I mean live people playing live instruments with a live drummer. Basically, ROCK.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Is there a type of music out there that just infuriates you? </FONT COLOR></P>

<P>While I find most nu-metal annoying and formulaic, I don't want to slap those guys as much as I do the 'R&B' singers. Also, I would never, ever listen to Britney Spears or Backstreet boys, but I do think they work <I>fuckin'</I> hard and probably have earned some success. Actually, it's mean of me to put down anybody, since everybody you see on empTV has given up any semblance of normal human existence to get there.</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="blue">Technology will always threaten bassists, sometimes it seems that tech has something against bass and percussion. We are an easy target. Do you feel that there will always be a demand to some degree for a 'real' bass instead of a sample?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>God, I hope so! I think when everybody realized that anyone can make a record in their bedroom with a laptop and a bunch of sampled beats, there was a <I>huge</I> tidal wave of terrible, <I>terrible</I> crap put out. I'm remaining optimistic that I can't be the only person left in the world who thinks that computers don't hold a candle to, you guessed it, <I>real</I> musicians playing <I>real</I> rock!</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="gretabucks.jpg" width="300" height="200"><IMG ALIGN="left" SRC="../../1x1.gif" width="1" height="200"><FONT COLOR="blue">Have you ever lost a recording gig to sampled bass?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Oh, I'm sure of it. Of course, you never find out about the gigs you didn't get.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">When Moby approaches a copy song, he does it with rare creativeness. The arrangements, the sound can be as far from the original as another song entirely. Is there input from the kids in the band for ideas, sounds, and arrangements?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>No, he does everything himself. And it seems to work for him!</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">For musicians who choose to do other people's songs, what for you is the intention when you tangle with a copy song?  Is it to capture the core intent of the tune or skew the stream of thought itself, to morph it into something entirely new? Is there even a 'let's throw it up against the wall and see what sticks' philosophy? All of these ways of doing things work, and of course there are a ton of other ways of doing it as well.</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Well, there are certain songs whose genius is so complete that, basically, there's nothing you can do except try to pay hommage to it as best you can. With Atomizer, we do a couple of cover songs, and our attitude is, "What can we do to this song to totally <I>atomize</I> it and make it our own?" Most songs have one riff or guitar sound that is the identity of the song, and you can extract that and build on it, and make something really interesting.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">You have done some serious traveling with this group, who do you find to be the kindest people, the rowdiest people, the most reserved people in those travels?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Ireland is amazing. You know when explorers in the jungle come upon animals that have never seen humans, and haven't learned to be afraid yet? The people there are like that. I love Australia too, the audiences there are really up for having a good time. Generally, in any major city whether Berlin, New York, or London, people there are more reserved. They're more used to having entertainment come through, and it's more important to them to look cool and unimpressed, too.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">In those travels, have you come across a place where you have felt the urge to settle down when the tour is over?  A place that could be called 'home'?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I would consider retiring to Australia or New Zealand. Notice I said "retire" because while <I>beautiful</I>, they are quite far from the rest of the world, so it would be inconvenient for me to live there now.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">What is the loopiest thing you have been given as a gift while on tour? The worst 'come-on' line? The best one?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>Actually, until recently I was never single on the road, so it wasn't an issue. Now that I am newly single for the first time in years, I guess I'm a little intimidating, because guys never seem to use any 'come-on' lines on me. Plus, most of Moby's fans are about half my age so I suppose I'm even scarier to them.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">What is the stupidest piece of advice that you have ever received as a musician?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I think someone, somewhere, suggested I should show more cleavage and take advantage of my 'sex appeal'. If I had, I suppose I might have gotten somewhere faster, but as it is, even though it took 20 years, I can totally respect myself and I know I have the respect of other people in the business, too.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="blue">And the last questions...Do you find that beginner bassists who are female, or musicians of any sort for that matter, come to you and thank you for being up there, showing it <I>can</I> be done and done well and that a woman can be judged on her merits as a musician first and foremost?</FONT COLOR></P>

<P>I do get a lot of e-mails from young girls and women who are just starting out, or have always wanted to play and felt too intimidated, and most of them do say they find it inspiring to see another woman up there. It's very heartwarming, especially since they all seem to think I'm some kind of fearless Amazon warrior princess, when in reality I've just been bumbling along without a roadmap or any kind of clue.</P>
