                        under the moon comes with its own set of rules and 
                        techniques because once the sun sets, you really are 
                        smack down in the middle of the largemouth's playing 
                        field. Come and explore the graveyard shift and discover 
                        all the action that you've been missing. </p>
                        <p><b>Beginning The Search</b><br>
                        Night fishing for bass is similar to the daytime 
                        version, with a few variations thrown into the mix. 
                        Working predominantly shallow sections of water -- 
                        depths between 2 feet and 10 feet -- seem to be the most 
                        productive. </p>
                        <p>Fish will be actively feeding during the witching 
                        hour, and will be in an aggressive and upwardly mobile 
                        mood. I like to choose a number of shallow shoreline 
                        areas and flats that produce well during the early 
                        morning periods and rely on these once the sun goes 
                        down. </p>
                        <p>The shift in light exposure will result in the bass 
                        gradually moving shallower in their quest for baitfish 
                        and crawdads. Areas to fish to keep in mind would be 
                        sandy beaches, shorelines with a mixture of &quot;lead-in&quot; 
                        cover, dock and marina locations as well as flats with 
                        large expanses of open areas. Pick a handful of these 
                        spots during the day and try to learn as much about them 
                        before the light switch is turned off. Make special note 
                        of any dangerously shallow areas or sunken logs in order 
                        to stay clear once nighttime hits. Orientating yourself 
                        with these areas during the day will enable you to fish 
                        them more thoroughly and have a better understanding of 
                        them come dark. </p>
                        <p>Keeping the boat &quot;clutter-free&quot; will make your night 
                        fishing experience more enjoyable. Have your pliers and 
                        net in an out-of-the-way, but easy to reach place.</p>
                        <p><b>Sorting Out The Baits</b><br>
                        The one thing that makes night fishing relatively easy 
                        is the simplification of baits that you'll be using.<b>
                        </b>There is no need for gigantic tackle boxes brimming 
                        with every lure under the sun, or moon for that matter. 
                        Two or three topwater baits, a big spinnerbait and a 
                        flipping jig will normally take care of every situation 
                        you'll encounter. </p>
                        <p>Topwater baits are my No. 1 choice for fishing at 
                        night due to the adrenaline rush you get when fishing 
                        these lures. Listening to the sputtering and splashing 
                        of your bait working along the surface, only to be 
                        shattered by the large crash of a fish can be positively 
                        heart stopping! </p>
                        <p>One of the better topwaters to choose for nighttime 
                        would be the buzzbait. A buzzbait provides a large 
                        silhouette and steady cadence for a bass to hone in 
                        upon, is simple to work without visually seeing it, and 
                        is relatively weedless. This makes it an easy bait to 
                        throw all night, as well as a productive one in the eyes 
                        of a bass. Go with a large model with big metal blades 
                        and a black skirt for bass to easily see against the 
                        backdrop of the lighter sky. </p>
                        <p>Another great night bait is the spinnerbait. This 
                        lure produces strong vibrations in the water, has a 
                        large profile, and mimics the prey that the largemouth 
                        are chasing and feeding upon. I go with large Colorado 
                        blades for added sound and a black skirt for visibility. 
                        A 1/2-ounce weight all the way up to a l-ounce bait will 
                        be the ticket for more bites. When faced with deeper 
                        water, or if the bass are less than active, a productive 
                        lure to throw has to be the jig and pig. A heavy jig 
                        with an oversized chunk of pork or plastic will do the 
                        trick nicely along weedlines and sand areas. </td>

                  technique to incorporate. It also can be a valuable 
                  &quot;follow-up&quot; lure to throw to fish that strike short on 
                  topwater baits. Reel in your surface bait fast, throw a jig 
                  and pig in the general area of the strike, and get ready to 
                  hold on to your rod. </p>

                  While it goes without saying that daytime fishing is a visual 
                  game for the most part, once the lights go out, your hearing 
                  and sense of feel become your greatest assets. Listening for 
                  topwater hits and interpreting strikes or fouled hooks becomes 
                  paramount during this time. Anticipating the next strike and 
                  staying on your toes will be keys to catching more and bigger 
                  fish. </strong></font></small></p>

                  <font size="3">Big spinnerbaits are an ideal ticket for bass 
                  during the night. The loud vibrations, large silhouette and 
                  fast-moving pace make it a great choice to throw. One key for 
                  catching more fish is setting the hook when you feel the 
                  weight of the fish -- not when you hear the striking splash. 
                  This can be tough to do, but believe me it will pay off with a 
                  whole lot more fish. </font></small></strong></p>

                  <font size="3">Safety is an issue when venturing out in the 
                  dark, and there are a few simple rules that will make your 
                  trip more pleasurable and safe. Take a variety of lights out 
                  on your boat, including a hand-held search beam, a headlamp 
                  and lantern. Lights aren't necessary when you are fishing, but 
                  it is a good idea to turn one on when you're in the process of 
                  fighting and landing a fish. I find that a headlamp works 
                  great in that it shines in the direction you are looking. 
                  Also, make sure your boats running lights are working in order 
                  for other boats to see you. </font></small></strong></p>

                  <font size="3">Keeping the interior of the boat neat and tidy 
                  is paramount for a fun night out. Keep your rods up and out of 
                  the way, and the landing net and pliers in an easy to find 
                  spot. The less clutter in the boat, the less chance of 
                  accidents occurring. </font></small></strong></p>

                  <font size="3">Keeping a life jacket on while fishing is a 
                  good idea for added safety. Falling out of the boat always is

                  night. Please be safe out there.&nbsp; Bass fishing at night is a 
                  new route to take for anglers looking for a different
