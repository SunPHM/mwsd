    <p>Picture this in an antique store - looks like a piece of junk doesn't it?</p>
	<center><img border="1" src="images/vienna_bflat.jpg" width="300" height="144" alt="Vienna-valved Upright Bb Cornet" /></center>
    <p>Well, we must congratulate our dance master, Jons Olsson
    	for having hung around the band long enough to realize that it is NOT a
   		piece of junk at all, but a rare cornet.&#160; It is a bell-up b-flat cornet
    	(or flugelhorn) with Vienna valves (an obsolete style of twin piston valve) probably dating
    	from the 1850's or before.&#160; It is missing a couple of parts, but
    	nothing that can't be replaced.&#160; It even has its original
    	mouthpiece.&#160; (the braid is kind of nice, too!)&#160; Marked &quot;Buzzell
    	and Gove, Rochester, NY&quot;.&#160;&#160;</p>
    <center><img border="1" src="images/23Bc.jpg" width="304" height="137" alt="Restored Vienna-valved Upright Bb Cornet" /></center>
    <p>Now restored (without the braid), the instrument turns
    out to be red brass (brass with a very high copper content - giving a 
    reddish
    appearance)&#160; with a yellow brass valve section and trim.&#160;
    According to the Schuyler C. Townson Research Library in Rochester, NY, the instrument was made by
    Luther Buzzell and Benjamin P. Gove, who were listed together as musical
    instrument makers in the 1849-50 city directory.&#160; This is certainly a
    unique instrument, and we are very glad to have it now in working condition.</p>

	<p align="center"><img border="1" src="images/34Aa.jpg" width="300" height="272" alt="Helicon Alto" /></p>
    <p>Also new to the band is the latest edition to our
    	circular horn family, which completes all the voices for our collection.&#160; We acquired a
    	helicon alto horn made by Moses Slater.&#160; The instrument has an unusual
    	inverted valve section which makes it most interesting to play.&#160; As
    	most of our instruments bear nicknames of some kind (easier than remembering
    	accession numbers), we have been calling it &quot;The pretzel&quot;
    	(referring to the person who will have to play it) or the &quot;Carpal Tunnel
    	Horn&quot;.&#160; Some of our players find it just as easy to play it
    	left-handed, so possibly that could account for its strange design.</p>

    <p>This next addition is this rare <u>two-piece</u> over-the-shoulder Bb cornet.&#160; The main
    	bell ferrule is threaded, allowing the instrument to be taken apart for more
    	compact storage.&#160; It retains its original case and mouthpiece as
    	well.&#160; The instrument is probably European in origin.</p>

  	<p>People are always asking us
    	where we get our instruments.&#160; Some are purchased from collectors or
    	dealers, some are on loan from individuals or museums, a few belong to band
    	members, and occasionally someone just walks up to us after a performance
    	and asks if we could use an old horn they found up in the attic.&#160;
    	That's what happened after the performance at the Belleville, WI,
    	sesquicentennial on August 11.&#160; Mr. Lyle Stall from Orfordville, WI
    	found an interesting old cornet in his father's attic (interesting because
    	his father was an Eb tuba player).&#160; He offered to donate it to the
    	foundation on the spot when he found we could indeed use it.&#160; It is a
    	Bb cornet marked Julius Bauer, Chicago, with the original coffin case and
    	mouthpiece - in really fine shape.&#160; We are always grateful for people
    	who think of us for a donation, and allow an instrument to be not only
    	preserved, but enjoyed by an audience again after many years of being
    	silent.&#160;</p>

	<p align="center"><img border="1" src="images/22Z_sm.jpg" width="245" height="200" alt="Boston Bb Cornet" /></p>
	<p>Another recent find came to
    	us from a local auction house.&#160; It is an early Boston Musical Instrument Manufactory Bb cornet in its
    	original case with 2 bits and a mouthpiece.&#160; Apparently, it was played
    	for a few years and put away, because other than some surface pitting and
    	corrosion from the badly deteriorating case lining, it is in near mint
    	condition - no dents, and the valves appear to have never been out of the
    	horn (the valve strings actually rotted away rather than being broken or
    	removed).&#160; Unusual to find such a pristine instrument - it is definitely
    	the exception rather than the rule.&#160; It obviously hasn't seen the light
    	of day for a long, long time, and we are the more grateful for
    	it.&#160; And it plays like new, too!&#160;</p>

  	<p>This cornet is an unusual
    one.&#160; It is an Eb/Bb circular cornet and was made by Emery A. Paine,
    Thomas Paine's (inventor of the Paine rotary valve) brother.&#160; It is
    silver with gold trim, and the maker's plate reads: Made for Henry F. Rumble
    by Emery A. Paine, Woonsocket, RI.&#160; A second, engraved
    presentation below the plate reads: W.B.L. July 3, 1876.&#160; It must have
    had an interesting history, because it has been modified somewhat; probably
    once had 4 valves, and of the 3 remaining, the 3rd is different than the
    first two.&#160; Don't we wish they could talk?</p>

  	<p>The newest member of our
    period percussion family is this bass drum.&#160; Called a barrel drum
    because of its shape (nominal 23 x 22 inches in this case), it is certainly a
    military drum of Civil War vintage or before.&#160; It even has a beater to
    go with it.&#160; Not in bad shape for its age, it is very restorable, and
    we expect it to really add a different sound to our cadences.&#160; Marked
    John Pollard, New York, New York.&#160; If anyone knows anything about Mr. Pollard,
    please let us know. (NOW RESTORED)</p>

  	<p>A lamp no
    more!!!&#160; We have had this OTS tenor horn on loan from Joyce
    Seeger (pictured) and family, San Bernardino, CA,
    for a few years now, and it had the misfortune of being turned into a
    lamp once upon a time (they bought the instrument as a lamp, and had the foresight
    to know that it was much more than just an ornament).&#160; Unfortunately, as lamps do not require valves,
    these had been discarded.&#160; Now sporting new mechanicals, we debuted it in Stratford on June 8, 2002 - 
    truly an event to hear such a misused
    instrument play again.&#160; It plays very well, too.&#160; Made by Klemm
    &amp; Bro.&#160; Our very great thanks to band member Byron Autry for his
    valve expertise, and great restoration job as well!</p>

	<p>This tuba is a 4 valve upright made by Samuel Graves. We 
    have it on loan from the Porter County Historical Society of Indiana, where 
    it was played there by a local musician. As you can see, it required a 
    fair amount of restoration (a huge understatement), but has become a fine, 
	playable instrument once again.&nbsp; Note progress in second set of photos, and 
	complete restoration in last set.</p>

	<p>This Eb cornet is in its original velvet-lined carved mahogany case, and was owned by John D. Teal, 
	2nd Eb soprano player in the Red Hook Cornet Band, from Red Hook, NY.  His original band book came with 
	the instrument.	The horn is silver, and unmarked.</p>

	<p>D. C. Hall is the manufacturer of this OTS silver tenor horn.  The instrument is in its original coffin case.  It is from a federal 
	New York regiment band, and the owner lined the case with parts of blood-stained Confederate butternut trousers to protect the horn. 
	(original coffin cases and box cases were typically bare and unpadded at this time, so cased instruments, though typically 
	in better shape than uncased ones, still usually have dents from the hard surfaces, and often have bending or crushing from 
	the wood shrinkage)</p>

	<p>This cornet by D. C. Hall of Boston was presented to John M. James, chief 
    musician of the 22d Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry band.  It was purposely
	destroyed at the battle of Brentwood , TN when the unit was in danger of capture by Nathan Bedford Forrest's Cavalry.  The instrument
	was preserved in four pieces, and restored by the band's founder, Fred Benkovic, who presented it to the Foundation at the 2006
	Awards banquet along with a tinted copy of a photo of J. M. James.  It is a fine piece, and a fine player as well.</p>
