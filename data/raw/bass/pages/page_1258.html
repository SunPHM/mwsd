If you came out to a

<font color="white"><u>A message from Tom AKA Pumpkinhead (drummer)</u>:</font><br/>
<br/>
These last two years with
<img src="name.jpg" align="middle" width="67" height="18" 
alt="SMUDGE"/> have been great! I can honestly say that I've never played with a better
band.
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to thank everyone who comes down to our shows.  If 
<img src="name.jpg" align="middle" width="67" height="18" 
alt="SMUDGE"/>
plays &#38; no one is there to hear them, do they make a sound? Well... yes... but what's the
point? Luckily, with the support of all of our friends, that's never really an issue.
Thanks everyone! 
<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks to the CameraGirl who makes a sometimes pathetic looking band
look sorta cool (&#38; she also makes my head look smaller than it is).
And (contrary to what PJ may say), thanks to The Roadie, who (other than the CameraGirl
&#38; the band members themselves)
has been to more
<img src="name.jpg" align="middle" width="67" height="18" 
alt="SMUDGE"/> shows than anyone else! (You'd never know that by talking to him!)
He also provides volumes of material for the website!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
