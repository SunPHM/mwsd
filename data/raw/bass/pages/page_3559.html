    are more closely related to <a href="fw_fishes_midwater.html#WhitePerch">
    ocean perches</a>, while Black Sea Bass are related to tropical basslets and

    often called &quot;temperate&quot; or &quot;true&quot; bass to distinguish it from species such 
    as largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass which are actually members of 
    the sunfish family Centrarchidae. <a href="#Scup">Porgies</a> are much more 
    highly compressed ( side-to-side ) than basses, and are not closely related.</p>
    <p>Many, if not all, Sea Basses share the odd trait of changing sex from 
    male to female ( protandry ) or female to male ( protogyny ), depending on 
    the species. Oddly, <a href="#StripedBass">Striped Bass</a> undergo a sexual 
    transformation that is the opposite of the <a href="#BlackSeaBass">Black Sea 
    Bass</a><b>. </b>The reason lies in their different lifestyles.
    <a href="#BlackSeaBass">Black Sea Bass</a> are bottom-dwellers, and the 
    males are territorial. Bigger fish can claim better territories, so it is an 
    advantage for a big individual to become a male. Stripers on the other hand 
    are not territorial. In their case, bigger fish can produce more eggs, so it 
    is advantageous for big Stripers to be females.</p>
    <p>All these fishes all have sharp hard spines in the dorsal and anal fins, 
    as a defense against predators. The spines make the fish much more difficult 
    to swallow, or handle, as many a fisherman could tell you.</p>

    <p>Profile by Thomas Baum,<br>
    Senior Fisheries Biologist</p>
    <p><strong>Range:<br>
    </strong>Atlantic coastal waters of the United States, from northern Florida 
    to Cape Cod, occasionally to Maine.</p>
    <p><strong>Size:<br>
    </strong>The average is less than 1 pound, up to 3 pounds and 9&quot; to 20&quot; 
    long, with an occasional individual reaching 7 pounds; males are usually 
    larger than females. Most females average 3 to 5 years old, the oldest 
    reaching 8 years old, while males can live to 20 years, with 6- and 
    7-year-olds predominating. This seemingly odd difference in age between the 
    sexes is due to a sex reversal explained below.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../img-uw/mohawk_friendly_sea_bass.jpg" width="500" height="336"><br>
    Only males sport these attractive colors; females are usually drab brown.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong><br>
    Black Sea Bass appear to feed by sight and are opportunistic omnivores ( 
    taking advantage of whatever is available. ) Stomach analyses have shown 
    that crustaceans, fish, mollusks and echinoderms ( <a href="sw_inverts.html">
    starfish, sea urchins</a> ) are part of their diet. Larger fish prefer
    <a href="sw_crabs.html">crabs</a> and fish; younger ones eat shrimp and 
    various crustaceans.</p>
    <p><strong>Migration:<br>
    </strong>Black Sea Bass move inshore and north for the summer and offshore 
    in the winter. The larger and older fish move offshore sooner and winter in 
    deeper water than their younger cohorts.</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat:<br>
    </strong>During the warmer months when sea bass are in water depths less 
    than 120 feet, they are attracted to hard bottom around rocks, wrecks and 
    reefs. Small, juvenile Sea Bass inhabit deep holes and grass beds in coastal 
    bays and shell bottoms in near-shore ocean waters.</p>

    I&#39;m sure Jacques Cousteau would have had something interesting to say about 
    this picture.<br>

    coloration. )</p>
    <p><a href="aqua_10_gallery_sw.html#SeaBassesCunnersScup">
    <img src="../img-uw/aqua_sea_bass_1.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="400" height="270"></a><strong>Spawning:</strong><br>
    Females mature around 2 years and older. Black Sea Bass are protogynous 
    hermaphrodites, meaning that they start their lives out as females, then 
    become males. This transformation of sexes occurs between 2 and 5 years of 
    age ( 6-12 inches in length ), accounting for males being larger and older. 
    Spawning occurs in May off the North Carolina coast, later in May and 
    through June off New Jersey, the Long Island Sound and New England. The eggs 
    ( spawned in open ocean ) are buoyant ( free floating ), non-adhesive and 
    hatch in three days. Sea Bass are a member of the grouper family (Serranidae), 
    and males are thought to be territorial. Older males develop a fatty hump on 
    the back in front of the dorsal fin. Males can be further distinguished from 
    females by their overall darker color and brilliant blue patches around the 
    head; females are usually a light brown coloration.</p>
    <p><strong>Recreational and Commercial Importance:<br>
    </strong>During years of sea bass abundance, commercial gear is used to 
    target them. The most popular type of gear used are fish pots, set close to 
    reefs, wrecks and other known Sea Bass areas. Sea Bass are also caught in 
    otter trawls on their offshore wintering grounds. They can be sold as whole 
    fish or larger ones can be filleted.</p>
    <p>This fish has become a staple to many party boat operators along the 
    coast. Some target Sea Bass during bottom and reef fishing trips, along with
    <a href="sw_fish_wrasses.html">tautog</a>. In 1991, recreational anglers 
    caught over 5 million Sea Bass in New Jersey.</p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Besides being targeted by private and party boats on reefs, rocks and 
    other known locations, Sea Bass are commonly caught while fishing for other 
    species such as <a href="sw_fish_flounders.html">summer flounder</a>,
    <a href="sw_fish_drums.html">weakfish</a>, <a href="sw_fish_pelagic.html">
    bluefish</a> or <a href="sw_fish_wrasses.html">tautog</a>. Juvenile Sea Bass 
    from 1 to 6 inches are often caught in the back bays along the New Jersey 
    coast. A standard deep water rig consists of a swivel, enough weight to hold 
    bottom and an 18-inch leader with 2/0 to 5/0 hooks ( 2 to 3 hooks per rig ). 
    Jigging with diamond jigs is also used. Cut squid and clams are the most 
    widely used bait, while worms or mussels can also be used. Sea Bass tend to 
    be caught more readily when there is a good current. They are good fighters 
    for their size and if given the opportunity, will head for holes or crevices 
    in the rocks or bottom debris when hooked. Therefore, a conventional boat 
    rod and reel with 20-pound test monofilament is advisable.</p>

    <p><strong>Range:<br>
    </strong>Striped bass occur naturally along the Atlantic coast from the St. 
    Lawrence River in Canada to the St. John’s river, Florida, and in some river 
    systems along the Gulf of Mexico from western Florida to Lake Pontchartrain, 
    Louisiana. It is a coastal fish, inhabiting near-shore ocean waters as well 
    as adjacent bays, sounds and tidal rivers. Some naturally reproducing stocks 
    have been established in freshwater rivers, lakes and reservoirs.</p>
    <p>Striped bass were introduced very successfully to the Pacific Coast in 
    the late 1800’s. Yearling striped bass were seined from the Navesink and 
    Shrewsbury Rivers near Red Bank, New Jersey in 1879 and again in 1881, and 
    transported by train across the continent to San Francisco Bay. Water in the 
    holding containers had to be replenished along the way and agitated by hand 
    to keep the young fish alive. The transported fish adapted so well, that in 
    1899 the net catch of striped bass for the Pacific Coast was 1.2 million 
    pounds. Striped bass now cover a major portion of the West Coast from San 
    Diego California to as far north as the Columbia River in Washington</p>
    <p><strong>Size:<br>
    </strong>Females generally grow larger than males and the growth rate slows 
    as the fish get older. Striped bass are relatively long lived, some fish 
    have been determined to be at least 29 years old. The overall record is a 
    125-pound fish caught in 1891 by a commercial fisherman in North Carolina. 
    Albert McReynoids caught the World Record Striped Bass for rod and reel in 
    1982, from a jetty in Atlantic City, NJ. The fish weighed 78 pounds, 8 
    ounces and measured 53 inches in length and had a 34 inch girth.</p>
    <p><strong>Food &amp; Feeding:<br>
    </strong>Striped bass feed on a variety of fish and invertebrates. They can 
    be selective feeders, meaning that they will choose one type of food over 
    another, ignoring other possible food sources that may be available. It 
    seems also that when prey is plentiful, bass are likely to gorge themselves, 
    then cease feeding in order to digest, then gorge again. In general, they 
    are more active at night, feeding on other nocturnal creatures.</p>
    <p><strong>Migration:<br>
    </strong>Most striped bass along the Atlantic coast are involved in two 
    types of migration: an upriver spawning migration from late winter to early 
    spring, and coastal migrations that are apparently not associated with 
    spawning activity. Within river systems striped bass spend the major part of 
    the year in the lower estuaries, moving upstream in the spring to spawn and 
    back downstream in the summer. Large numbers of fish 2 years old and older 
    leave the bays and move northward along the coast, regularly traveling as 
    far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Coastal migrations may be quite 
    extensive; striped bass tagged in Chesapeake Bay have been recaptured in the 
    Bay of Fundy. These fish then move southward in the fall and return to the 
    Chesapeake Bay or overwinter in estuaries or near-shore ocean waters along 
    the New Jersey coast or offshore of North Carolina and Virginia.</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat:<br>
    </strong>Atlantic coast migratory striped bass use coastal rivers as 
    spawning sites. The juvenile fish utilize the rivers and the lower portions 
    of the estuaries as nursery areas. Adult habitats include coastal rivers and 
    the near-shore ocean. These habitats are distributed along the coast from 
    Maine through North Carolina. Bass are found along sandy beaches, in shallow 
    bays, along rocky stretches, over and among submerged or partially submerged 
    rocks, and at the mouths of estuaries, the precise situations that they 
    occupy being governed by the availability of food.</p>

    <p><strong>Spawning:<br>
    </strong>The months of April. May and June span the time of nearly all 
    spawning activities for striped bass in the mid Atlantic region. Chesapeake 
    Bay and its tributaries constitute the principal spawning area for striped 
    bass along the Atlantic coast. Other significant spawning areas are the 
    Hudson and Delaware Rivers. Striped bass are anadromous fish, meaning they 
    live in salt water and return once a year to fresh or nearly fresh water to 
    spawn. The spawning run upriver begins when water temperatures begin to rise 
    in late April or early May. The female deposits her semi-buoyant eggs, 
    greenish in color, near the surface of the water while several males 
    discharge milky white clouds of milt. Peak spawning activity occurs when the 
    water temperature is between 57 and 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The eggs, if 
    fertilized, hatch after 36 to 42 hours under normal conditions. This is the 
    most crucial period for young. stripers. The water current must be strong 
    enough to keep the eggs and young from settling to the river bottom, where 
    silt would smother them. This period lasts several days and the correct 
    amount of clean, flowing water is essential. A 6-year old, 7 pound female 
    striper produces approximately 500,000 eggs; a 17-year old, 50 pound bass 
    can produce 3 million eggs.</p>

    <p><strong>Importance:<br>
    </strong>Striped bass have been one of the most important fisheries on the 
    Atlantic coast for centuries. At one time striped bass were so plentiful 
    that they were used to fertilize fields. In 1639, the Massachusetts Bay 
    Colony forbid their use as fertilizer. The continent’s first public school 
    was financed in 1669 by profits from the sale of striped bass. Congress 
    formed the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 1942 to coordinate 
    interstate management of the highly migratory striped bass in state waters 
    along the East Coast. In 1948, New Jersey enacted one of the first creel 
    (bag) limits for striped bass of ten fish per day. During the 1980’s, a 
    coast-wide moratorium was implemented as a result of drastically low numbers 
    and poor recruitment of striped bass. The moratorium, and proper management 
    of the striped bass resource has added to the restoration of the Atlantic 
    Coastal striped bass population. A limited fishery was allowed in 1990, and 
    regulations since ha been adjusted annually according to the population size 
    of the coastal stock. The Atlantic coast striped bass harvest in 1997 was 
    approximately 22 million pounds, accounting for about 2.5 million fish.</p>
    <p><strong>Fishing Techniques:<br>
    </strong>There are several ways anglers fish for striped bass. Bait and 
    artificial lures are popular, and people fish from the surf, jetties and 
    boats ( private, charter and party. ) Besides ocean fishing, rivers, bays 
    and inlets are also popular locations. Anglers utilize herring, menhaden, 
    spot, eels and even snapper bluefish for bait or to live-line for striped 
    bass. Other baits include squid, clam, blood an sand worms, mullet, crabs 
    and grass shrimp. Some anglers prefer to try their luck at night, or just 
    before and after the change of the tide. Boat anglers sometime drift, or may 
    anchor close to structures such as bridges. There are numerous artificial 
    lures that anglers use, and even fly-fishermen target striped bass. There 
    are some who fish for striped bass all year long, but fall is a popular time 
    with many anglers, and interest has grown in the spring fishery for striped 
    bass.</p>

    <p>Profile by Stacey Reap</p>
    <p><strong>Range:<br>
    </strong>Scup have been found along the Atlantic coast from Bay of Fundy and 
    Sable Island Bank, Canada, to as far south as Florida; however, the greatest 
    concentrations can be found from Massachusetts to North Carolina. Depending 
    upon the season, they can be found from coastal waters and estuaries out to 
    depths of approximately 650 ft. along the outer continental shelf. A 
    separate population of scup, referred to as the &quot;southern porgy&quot; or S. 
    aculeatus, is referenced in several South Atlantic Bight studies; however, 
    there is no official differentiation made between the two populations by the 
    American Fisheries Society.</p>
    <p><strong>Size:<br>
    </strong>Scup of both sexes are sexually mature by age 3, at an average 
    length of 8.3 in. Historically, scup have been reported at lengths of 18 in. 
    and up to 4 lbs and 20 years of age, but the current Middle Atlantic Bight 
    population is composed mostly of younger fish, few older than 7 and larger 
    than 13 in.</p>
    <p><strong>Food &amp; Feeding:<br>
    </strong>Juvenile scup feed on small organisms, such as
    <a href="sw_inverts.html">polychaete worms</a>, amphipods, small crustaceans 
    and mollusks, as well as fish eggs and larvae. While copepods and mysids are 
    more important to early juveniles, the diet of larger juveniles is more 
    dependent upon bivalve mollusks, such as <a href="sw_bivalves.html">razor 
    clams and blue mussels</a>. The scup diet typically consists of a mix of 
    reef and sandy-bottom prey, with adult fish having broad culinary tastes 
    ranging from small crustacea, squid and fish to polychaetes, mollusks, 
    vegetable detritus, hydroids and sand dollars. With two rows of strong 
    molars in their jaws, scup are able to crush hard-shelled prey.</p>
    <p><strong>Migration:<br>
    </strong>Scup in the Middle Atlantic Bight demonstrate a pronounced seasonal 
    migration from summer inshore grounds to offshore wintering areas along the 
    outer continental shelf. They also show movement from north to south, 
    although few fish tagged in the New England/New York vicinity in the summer 
    are caught south of Cape Hatteras. As coastal water temperatures drop below 
    7.5C (45F) in September, scup begin migrating in schools of similarly sized 
    fish. Schools from the Mid-Atlantic arrive offshore in December, wintering 
    in deep water as far south as North Carolina, their distribution dependant 
    upon water temperature. Bottom water with a temperature of 7.3C (45F) is 
    their lower preferred limit, with the location of this favored isotherm 
    influenced by the Gulf Stream. The migratory patterns of the scup population 
    south of Cape Hatteras are unclear, although the fish may move offshore 
    during the coldest weather.</p>

    During the day, Scup are light colored.</p>
    <p><strong>Spawning:</strong><br>
    Scup travel inshore to spawn once a year when the water warms past 10C 
    (50F), which occurs May through June in New York and New Jersey bays. 
    Spawning continues in July along coastal Rhode Island and extends through 
    August, when water temperatures are approximately 24C (75øF). Spawning fish 
    are found in southern Massachusetts shoal waters until late June, after 
    which they move to deeper waters. Eggs are fertilized externally, with scup 
    between 17.5 cm (6.9 in.) and 23 cm (9 in.) averaging about 7,000 eggs per 
    female.</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat:</strong><br>
    Although they are occasionally seen at the surface, scup are bottom-dwelling 
    fish. With a diverse benthic diet and using schooling as a defense strategy, 
    scup do not require structure for habitat, but they can benefit from it. As 
    a result, they are commonly found associated with hard-substrate 
    environments, such as mussel beds, artificial reefs, rocky outcroppings and 
    wrecks, but are also found in areas with soft, sandy bottom. Once scup 
    travel offshore to winter in deeper waters, their specific habitat 
    preferences become unclear. Although they remain demersal, they have been 
    found dwelling in a variety of offshore habitats.</p>
    <p><strong>Recreational and Commercial Importance:<br>
    </strong>Scup are important to both recreational and commercial fishermen in 
    New Jersey, but, as a result of overfishing and habitat loss, scup catches 
    have become less abundant. The 1998 total combined New Jersey commercial and 
    recreational landings of just over 5 million pounds were the lowest in the 
    1981-1999 time frame, with 1999 showing only a slight increase to 5.2 
    million pounds. Commercial landings in 1997 were the lowest since 1930, at 
    only 7% of the 1960 peak landings of 48.5 million pounds. Recreational 
    catches have also declined. In the early 1950&#39;s, scup comprised 33 to 49 
    percent of the state&#39;s party boat catch; the total recreational catch 
    amounted to 2 million pounds. In contrast, in 2000, New Jersey anglers kept 
    only 335,000 scup, probably less than 200,000 pounds. The principal 
    commercial fishing gear for scup is the otter trawl.</p>
    <p>The fishery is now managed under the Summer Flounder, Scup and Black Sea 
    Bass Fishery Management Plan, which establishes annual gear regulations and 
    quotas for commercial operations, as well as recreational size and 
    possession limits. Recreational fishermen accounted for 20-50% of the total 
    annual coast-wide catch from 1985-1999, taking 1.8 million pounds of scup in 
    1999. In 2001, the New Jersey recreational regulations allowed for a 
    possession limit of 50 fish over 9 in., with a season running July 4 through 
    Dec. 31. Under these regulations, the scup catch increased in 2001 to 
    585,000 fish.</p>
    <p>Recreational anglers use small hooks on top and bottom rigs to catch 
    scup. The most commonly used baits are squid and clam. Party boats account 
    for the majority of the recreational scup catch.</p>

    At night they adopt a darker pattern, with vertical bars, usually more 
    pronounced than this.</p>
    <p><strong>Good News for Anglers:<br>
    </strong>Management strategies, including recreational size limits and 
    commercial quotas, are paying off. Over the next few years, more and bigger 
    scup will appear on NJ reefs.</p>
