Company up to these days?" is a question that has arisen frequently in the mail received by myself as a result of this website. A page on this subject is therefore called for, and it does lead me in nicely to showing some pictures of the superb current range of Hofners!<BR><BR>Hofner have steadily continued in business ever since the Rock and Roll boom times of the 50's and 60's, producing all types of stringed instruments, from violins to solid guitars, at their Bubenreuth and Hagenau factories in Germany. 1994 was an important year for Hofner, as that is when they joined the international Boosey & Hawkes Group. Subsequently, in 1997, Hofner moved from Bubenreuth to neighbouring Hagenau, where their tradition for producing high quality instruments very much continues.</FONT>
<p><font size="+1">A company called The Music Group have now (March 2003) taken
over the running of Hofner from Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Their UK subsidiary is
called Besson Musical Instruments Ltd<BR><BR>Hofner's current range of guitars includes nylon-strung classical,
bass guitars, archtops, and the recently re-introduced range of
&quot;Sienna&quot; flattops. <font color="#FF0000">There is also a rumour
going around that Hofner may re-introduce some solid guitars in the near
future......keep an eye open for those !!</font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><FONT SIZE="+1"> The bass guitars are all versions of the famous 500/1 violin bass
model and its 500/2 Club Bass sister. The 2003 Range comprises of:</FONT>

<h3>THE HOFNER 500/1 VINTAGE '62</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="500162.jpeg" width="320" height="544"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Based on a certain Sir Paul McCartney's
instrument, including such touches as &quot;two-in one&quot; strip machine heads
and a two piece neck. The standard finish is Antique Brown Sunburst, with
right-hand and of course, left hand versions being available.</font></p>
<hr width="50%">
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">THE HOFNER 500/1 VINTAGE '63</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="63bass.jpeg" width="440" height="418"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Following on from the '62 re-issue, the Vintage
'63 reflects the changes made in that year. It therefore features single unit
tuners and a three-piece neck. Nickel plated hardware and an antique brown
sunburst finish complete the package.</font></p>

<h3 align="left"><font size="4">THE HOFNER 500/1 CAVERN '61</font></h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="61cav.jpeg" width="250" height="566"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">An authentic re-issue of the bass that Sir Paul
bought in Hamburg in 1961. Closely spaced &quot;Diamond&quot; logo pickups
without exposed pole-pieces are the main identification feature of this bass,
together with the vertical Hofner logo headstock. A three piece neck is also
fitted, with individual machine heads, and the body has a flat back, in keeping
with the 1961 period.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3 align="left">THE HOFNER 5000/1 DELUXE BASS</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="deluxe.jpeg" width="440" height="409"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;<font size="4">I have to say that this is more my scene,
and it is what Hofner have always done really well - beautiful timbers and rich
inlays, binding, and extravagant purfling! A one piece maple neck is fitted and
best quality flame maple veneers are used for the basses back and sides. The
fingerboard is ebony, and all hardware is gold platted, naturally. A work of
art!</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="50%">
<h3 align="left">THE HOFNER 500/2 CLUB BASS</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="clubbas.jpeg" width="250" height="460"></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Just introduced by Hofner as part of their 2003
Range. An alternative to the 500/1 but with a similar feel, sound, and ease of
playing. This bass matches the body of that old favourite 6 string guitar, the
&quot;Club&quot; , with the neck and electrics of the 500/1. Prior to this
re-issue, the 500/2 was produced by Hofner between 1965 and 1970. A three piece
neck is used, with a bound rosewood fingerboard. Individual tuners are fitted,
and the standard finish is antique brown sunburst.</font></p>
