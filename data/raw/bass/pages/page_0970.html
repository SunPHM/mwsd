					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">This is the NEW leader in acoustic/electric basses...Because of the resonator design, this bass has tremendous volume and projection. Carry it anywhere! Don't depend on having to have an amp around.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The Regal Dobro Bass is an import that offers immuculate craftsmanship, tremendous volume/tone, and easy playability (similar to an electric bass because of the thin body). I've been very impressed with mine and wouldn't trade it for any other available acoustic bass. Gibson used to manufacture a Dobro Bass, but for some reason, they discontinued them. This is the only Dobro bass that I know of as being currently available. It possesses tremendous volume, projection and bite. The tone and projection is dependent on the spun cone and spider bridge giving it a natural amplification that no other acoustic bass can match.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Thu, 14 Dec 2000</b> Dear Mickey, I just want to tell you that I am delighted with my Regal A/E bass (RD-05E). It sounds excellent, with good tone and fine volume. It is by far the loudest acoustic bass that I've ever played. The quality of the workmanship and materials is impressive as well making it a beauty to behold. I can't wait to use it during Saturday night jams with my guitar and mandolin playing friends. Thank you for the recommendation and the good deal. Sincerely, John D.<br>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2000</b> Greetings I recieved my Regal acoustic/electric dobro bass. It was well packed and arrived safe and sound. I have not set it up yet but just tuned and played it acoustic and through the bass amp. I was pleased with the acoustic sound for it does project good and I even think it has a unique &quot;ring&quot; to the bass sound. My son is beyond my time period and as he &quot;slapped out a little tune&quot; he looked up and with a grin began playing the wildwood flower. He still returns to his roots of Ozark Mountain Music. I do think this instrument is a keeper. Hope to cross your path again. Thank You and the nice lady on the phone. JF &quot;Doc&quot; McCoy</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1999</b> Mickey, I got the guitar case for my dobro bass. Thank you for all of your help. I have enjoyed playing the bass. It sounds great! Paul Pitterle</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Wed, 14 Jul 1999</b> The bass is great.&nbsp; It's loud and I'm enjoying it.&nbsp; Thanks.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2000</b> In the last week I have played the acoustic/electric Regal Dobro bass in public 4 times. And each time I get lots of positive comments from young and old, and many questions. Many people have approached me and told me that they really liked the tone of it. David

							Subject: Testimonial of Dobro Bass<br>
							</b><br>
							
						Hi Suzie, I just got the dobro bass today and it arrived all intact!!<br>
							
						You and your people are very nice to work with, we had some shipping delays<br>
							
						and some confusion on the delivery time but it worked out.<br>
							
						I never would have thought of purchasing a Korean made instrument, especially<br>
							
						for my kind of music(bluegrass,country)but after hearing the bass on the net <a href="page319.htm">(through the video samplers)</a><br>
							
						and checking out the Washburn, and the Dean, and several fretless acoustic<br>
							
						basses(not standups) made here in the USA the dobro bass blows them away.<br>
							
						Our application is simple in the fact that we need a beginner's bass and<br>
							
						this fits real well for us. The last thing you want is a person learning to<br>
							
						play bass dragging a standup around and booming wrong notes all over the<br>
							
						festival grounds, theres enough of that already. I have miked it<br>
							
						acoustically and also thru the mixer board running to a subwoofer ,really<br>
							
						booms out and fits pretty well with my acoustic electric guitar and<br>
							
						drums,digital horn,etc. It will however not compare to a standup and the<br>
							
						traditional sound that a standup gives, but for sitting around and jamming<br>
							
						and learning the basic bluegrass bass parts it serves well.<br>
							<br>
							
						Thanks<br>
							
						Gary Thompson</font></p>
