In any tournament or derby, what's important is not how many big fish you 
land, but how you do in relation to the other participants. You can have the 
best day of fishing of your life and win nothing in a tournament, or on the 
other hand, experience a slow day of fishing but win the event.
<P>
Justin Adrian of Chico illustrated that maxim by taking first place with two 
largemouth bass weighing 2.04 pounds in Mel Cotton Sporting Goods' 
first-ever Bass Tube-N Tournament at Anderson Reservoir on May 10.
<P> 
"I landed a total of 5 fish, including 3 keepers topped by a 1.1 pounder," 
said Adrian after emerging from his float tube. "However, my third fish 
escaped from the live well. It's the first tournament that I've fished and 
the first time I've ever fished Anderson; I usually fish Lake Oroville near 
my home."

He fished Carolina-rigged  plastic worms in 10 feet of water and less to 
nail his bass on Anderson, Santa Clara County's largest reservoir. For his 
efforts, he won a Loomis drop shotting rod with a Daiwa Samurai 7-1 reel and 
  Buck's Bag Venture Series pontoon boat.
<P>
Bob Aochi of Morgan Hill placed second with two fish weighing a total of 1.8 
pounds, winning a G Loomis crankbait rod/Pfleuger Criterion reel combo and a 
Caddis Navigator #2 tube. His two fish, like all of the bass weighed in the 
tournament, were spawned out males.
<P>
The event, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., took place on one of the first nice days 
after three weeks of unusually cold and stormy weather, so the fishing was 
tough, as event organizer Bryan Fickes had forecasted the day before. In 
spite of the sunny weather,   the fish were still recovering from weeks of 
up and down weather and water temperatures.
<P>
Nick Dollech of San Jose took third place by catching two largemouths 
weighing a total of 1.72 pounds, winning a Creek Company original U boat, 
Four Spin Backpacker fins and  a Reddington bass rod. He nailed his fish 
while fishing Baby Brush Hogs in 10 to 12 feet of water.
<P><IMG SRC="images/052303bassc.jpg" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="260" ALT="Anderson Reservoir Bass" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">
Mike Federwisch of San Jose took big fish honors with a 1.40 pound 
largemouth caught on a Yamamoto worm. He won a $75.00 gift certificate.
Hector Guerra of Milpitas weighed in a .98 pound fish that he caught on a 
Senko in shallow water in the creek arm. Other anglers weighing fish in the 
event include Adam McAndrews, who nailed two keeper largemouth bass.
<P>
After the event awards, Fickes met with the 19 participants for suggestions 
in upcoming tournaments, including a possible redesigning of the live wells. 
All participants took home gift packages of Persuader Baits and Smelly 
Jelly.
<P> 
"It was an overall great success," he said. "We had a zero kill rate on fish 
weighed in, which is incredible for a float tube tournament."
<P>
A month ago before the latest storm fronts, Fickes and Steve Gorshe had 
caught and released 30 bass while using Yamamoto grubs of all sizes and 
colors at 5 to 18 feet at Anderson.  "Our biggest fish was 4 pounds and our 
smallest one was 1.5 pounds," he noted. "Our smallest fish was bigger than 
the largest one weighed in during the  tournament."
<P><IMG SRC="images/052303bassd.jpg" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="260" ALT="Anderson Reservoir Bass" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">
The bass fishing at Anderson is expected to rebound with the arrival of 
warmer, more stable weather. Although the lake is now limited to 
hand-launched craft, including float tubes, kayaks and small aluminum boats, 
anglers with larger boats will be able to launch soon on a temporary 
concrete two lane ramp.
<P> 
"We don't have a firm date yet, but the  temporary ramp will hopefully be 
completed sometime in June," said Tamara Clark-Shear, public relations 
officer for Santa Clara county. "Our new permanent four lane ramp will be 
finished in October. Right now, you have to hand launch your boats in the 
Woodchoppers area."
<P>
Anderson is known more for its numbers of bass than its large fish, although 
the lake largemouth record stands at 13 pounds, 4 ounces. Both 
Florida-strain and northern-strain largemouths thrive in the lake.
<P> 
"You can hook1 to 1-1/2 pounders all day long during the summer at Anderson, 
but the larger fish are difficult to catch," said  Ryan Calamia at Coyote 
Bait and Tackle. "Your best bet during the late spring and summer is to 
split shot and drop shot with worms in June Bug/chartreuse tail, Witch's T. 
and Green Weenie patterns during the day and fish crankbaits in shad 
patterns in the mornings and evenings."
<P>
In contrast, catfish are few and far between in the catches at Anderson, but 
the ones that are taken are usually large ones in the 10 to 20 pound class. 
For maximum success, Calamia recommended fishing mackerel and chicken livers 
in the mornings and evenings here.
<P>
Crappie fishing is a big draw at Anderson, being one of the better crappie 
lakes in northern California now. Shore anglers catch good numbers of 
crappie while fishing mini jigs and minnows around brush and structure, but 
boaters find the better action, according to Calamia.
<P>
The reservoir isn't planted with trout by the Department of Fish and Game, 
though some trout washed downstream from Coyote Reservoir are occasionally 
hooked at Anderson. Coyote Creek  below the dam was planted with catchable 
rainbows for many years, but is no longer stocked as local anglers and 
government agencies work to restore the stream's wild steelhead and king 
salmon.
<P><IMG SRC="images/052303basse.jpg" WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="300" ALT="Anderson Reservoir" ALIGN="left" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10">
Anderson Reservoir has a surface area of 1,245 acres and holds 89,073 acre 
feet of water when full. The dam and reservoir was named for Leroy Anderson, 
the key founder and first president of the Santa Clara Valley Water 
Conservation District. It was built in 1950 on a 500 acre dairy and cattle 
ranch along Coyote Creek purchased from the estate of John Cochran and his 
wife, Aphelia Farmington.
<P>
The lake, located in Anderson County Park, is open from 8 a.m. until sunset. 
When the launch ramp is open, the lake is restricted to a certain number of 
power boats to protect the water from MTBE contamination. For reservations, 
call (408) 355-2201.
<P>
Shoreline picnic and barbecue picnic facilities are available at the 
Woodchoppers picnic area at the lake's south end. Two group picnic areas, 
Live Oak and Toyon, are available by reservation. For more information, call 
the County of Santa Clara Parks and Recreation Department (408) 355-7200.
<P>
For more information about upcoming float tube tournaments at Anderson and 
other local lakes, call Bryan Fickes and Justin Hicks, Mel Cotton's Sporting 
Goods, 408-287-5994. For fishing information, you can also call Coyote Bait 
and Tackle (408) 463-0711, Reed's Sport Shop (408) 926-3020 and Fishermen's 
Warehouse (408) 873-0113 in San Jose. Other local shops include Cope & 
McPhetres in Santa Clara (408) 345-2640 and Sportsmen's Supply in Campbell 
(408) 377-0647.
