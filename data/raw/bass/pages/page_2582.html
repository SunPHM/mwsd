<span style="font-size:
12.0pt">Mexico bass fishing can be done on the greatest black bass lakes in the 
world. There are four such lakes on the West coast of Mexico. There is <b>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lake El Salto (size), Lake Agua Milpa, or as some 
call it just Lake Milpa (numbers), Lake Huites (numbers and some size) and Lake 
Baccarac (size). </span></b>The bass fishing at each Lake is a little different 
because of the age of each Lake. Generally speaking the older lakes produce 
larger bass but not quite as many numbers as the newer lakes. A Mexico bass 
fishing trip to one of these four lakes can make any bass angler’s dream come 
true. If you are interested in bass fishing Mexico, you can see specific 
information about each lake by clicking on the appropriate icon.</span></font></p>

12.0pt">Mexico bass fishing is the best bass fishing in the world for several 
reasons. The first being the growing season. Because of the warm temperatures 
enjoyed by most parts of Mexico, the growing season for bass is several months 
longer than for most areas in the United States. Therefore the bass grow larger 
faster than they do in the Lakes throughout the United States. The other primary 
reason is fishing pressure. As a general rule the local population does not take 
advantage of the great Mexico bass fishing. As a result of that, instead of 
hundreds of bass boats fishing the Lakes every day as is the case with popular 
bass lakes in the United States, there will never be over fifty and most of the 
time under twenty five boats bass fishing a Mexican Lake on any given day. 
Therefore, the bass have a lot less pressure put on them, which makes bass 
fishing Mexico the best there is.</span></font></p>
