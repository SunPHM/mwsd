Whether you are fishing for bass, walleye, northern pike, monster Muskie or lake trout, Lake of the Woods will not disappoint you. Bring your own boat or rent one of our fishing rigs. We can provide you with tips of where the fish are biting. Guides are available with prior arrangements. Be sure to book them well in advance as they are busy in the prime fishing seasons. Licences may be purchased in our convenience store along with maps, ice and other supplies. Ask us to pack a bag lunch for you or cook your own shore lunch from your "catch of the day".<BR>
