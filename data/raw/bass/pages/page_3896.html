<p class="MsoNormal">To the El Rancho Best Western, beloved of
Sea Ranch travelers, near SFO on the eve of our trip. It's sort
of an endearing place, family-run for three generations, an
Old-California El Camino motel grown large and sprawling over the
years. Jerry and I have breakfast pre-dawn in the Departure
Snacks room (that's what it says on the door), under the watchful
and solicitous gaze of Effie and another old lady, whose nametag
I didn't catch. The two of them have probably worked at El Rancho
since the place opened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">An extraordinary red moonrise on one side of
the plane as we take off from Miami, and a gorgeous sunset on the
other. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On arrival in Quito, we're met by Rodney,
our Metropolitan Touring guide, and Santiago, our driver. We
spend our first night in Ecuador at the Hilton Colon, which looks
like Hiltons everywhere. The only distinguishing mark is the huge
arrangements of fresh roses in the lobby. We find out later that
roses are one of Ecuador's major exports. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It's hard to fall asleep, though I'm
exhausted. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Wednesday
10 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Rodney picks us up for a city tour of Quito.
It turns out that Francine and Bob's Continental flight, due in
just behind ours last night, was diverted to Guayaquil; they'll
be here later this morning. Night landings in Quito are dicey, we
learn, and a relatively new thing. Apparently American's pilot
training is ahead of Continental's. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We visit a municipal frieze depicting the
history and prehistory of Ecuador: Inca warriors, Amazon women,
Spanish conquistadores, Franciscan priests... After that, it's
one church after another. At San Francisco, Rodney tells us that
Ecuadorian altar art is known for its movement. The Madonna is
often depicted with wings -- the result of a conflation,
apparently, with another Christian legend involving the
apocalypse and a different pregnant woman -- or dancing. The <a
href="madonna.jpg">Dancing Madonna</a>. A large statue of the
Virgin Mary, with eagle's wings, dominates a hilltop overlooking
the city. Outside the church of San Francisco, we're persuaded to
buy, for $3, a good luck charm: a pair of Andean wolf tails and a
small gold-colored crucifix, bound together with paper and red
yarn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Saint Augustine monastery features paintings
by Miguel de Santiago (17<sup>th</sup> c?), who supposedly tied
his model to a cross, and then, in search of greater
verisimilitude, stabbed him in the chest. The painter took refuge
in the monastery for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A flight of stairs leads down to a crypt,
where the remains of Ecuadorian patriots and rich Catholics are
filed. We see dates ranging from the 1800s to the late 1960s. One
niche is open, with a rust-brown skull, hair still attached,
exposed. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We meet Francine and Bob's flight from
Guayaquil and head out of town. En route, we pass several shiny
pickup trucks, the bed of each one packed with what are clearly
rural folk in suits and dresses. We're not sure what's going on
&#150; a farmers' or laborers' formal ball? &#150; until we spot
the hearse at the front of the procession. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lunch en route at a restaurant that
advertises &quot;platos typicos.&quot; A hearty, deep yellow
potato soup, accompanied by half an avocado and a sprinking of
dry, roasted and salted corn -- a cross, sort of, between popcorn
and those packaged corn nuts, and, we subsequently discover, a
ubiquitous Ecuadorian table accompaniment. Then, huge servings of
practically unadulterated MEAT: our choice of beef, pork or goat.
I end up with fried corvina (sea bass). Lunch is the main meal of
the day, Rodney tells us. We're convinced. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We stop at a small monument marking the
equator, and practice <a href="equator.jpg">straddling two
hemispheres</a>. The line of the day (so to speak): &quot;You've
got to draw the line somewhere.&quot; Rodney points out Cotopaxi,
a volcano and the highest mountain in Ecuador. He tells us that
it's also the highest mountain in the world &#150; if measured
from the center of the earth. Discussion ensues re: whether
people do weigh somewhat less at the equator, and how gravity
works here. As we drift toward inanity, I wonder whether I am
feeling the effects of the altitude after all; surely oxygen
deprivation makes us stupid. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<img
src="mountains.jpg" border="3" width="416" height="288"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We take the Pan American Highway, a fairly
good two-lane road, through Guayilbamba and Cayambo. The terrain
is spectacular &#150; v-shaped ravines and valleys; steep
hillsides planted with crops; mesas topped with shacks, corn
patches, and gardens. Plant life is on the arid side &#150; some
cactus, lots of agave, and bromeliads, including epiphytes (air
plants) on the utility wires above our heads. Acacias and
eucalypts, both introduced species, as well. We stop to look down
at a beautiful lake and to photograph a llama. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The villagers tend to be very small; they
seem like another species of human being. Costumes vary from
region to region. In some places, we see felt hats on both men
and women. In others, the women just wear headscarves. The men
wear wide, comfortable-looking white pants. Both men and women
sport various combinations of serapes and shawls. They carry
their bundles in large fabric squares. In Otavalo, both men and
women wear their hair in a single long braid down the back. The
women, from toddlerhood on, adorn themselves with multiple
strands of small, gold-colored glass beads. They look splendid. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We reach <a href="mirage.jpg">La Mirage</a>,
our home for the next two nights. A Relais &amp; Chateaux resort,
it strikes Jerry and me as silly, frou-frou and pretentious. The
paintings and decorations are eclectic, to say the least. The
décor is heavy on Venetian-style masks; the ones in our room are
creepy, almost menacing. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But by dinnertime, the place is starting to
grow on us. We're served by half a dozen young Indian women, all
dressed in identical, semi-traditional style, who surround us and
simultaneously lift the silver domes covering each of our
courses. Synchronized serving. <a
href="http://larc1.com/ecuador/lamirage/lm_menu.html">Dinner</a>
is delicious, and about eight courses, including lagniappes. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back at our casita, we're met at the door by
a young man -- the firestarting angel, who expertly lays out the
logs and kindling, ignites a roaring blaze, and departs. And
we're met, at the foot of our respective beds (single beds are
the default, it seems, in Latin America), by the delicious warmth
of a hot water bottle. Despite, or perhaps aided by, the sound of
the rain and what must be giant frogs croaking under our windows,
we sleep very well. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Thursday,
11 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It's sunny and semi-clear when we walk to
breakfast, and we catch a glimpse of snow-covered mountain peaks
before the clouds roll back in. We eat surrounded by birds; at
least two aviaries adjoin the breakfast room, and the lawn and
garden outside boast the largest hummingbirds I've ever seen. The
restaurant, in fact, is named for them: Colibri. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After breakfast we head for <a
href="lake.jpg">Lake Cuicocha</a>, Guinea Pig Lake. Rodney leads
us on a respectably strenuous hike along the narrow (and largely
uphill) trail that circles the lake. Jerry and I fantasize about
making the entire circuit. Not this trip, I'm afraid. From high
above, we watch a lone coot plow a v-shaped track across the
surface of the lake. A little later, the wake of a small
sightseeing boat sets up a moire-like pattern of ripples. We
stand transfixed. And then Rodney points out the eagle &#150; no,
wait; <em>two </em>eagles -- riding thermals above our heads. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the walk back to the car, the talk turns
to hauntings and poltergeists. Inspired by our account of the
painting that fell off the wall of our room last night &#150;
neither of us was near it, and the room was still &#150; Rodney
tells us several stories of haunted hotel rooms he's heard about
in his touring. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next, <a href="otavalo.jpg">Otavalo</a>, the
famous textile market that sprawls across a city plaza. Saturday
is the busiest day. Today, though all the stalls are attended,
the marketplace seems almost deserted. We shop righteously for
two hours. Jerry buys a pullover and a vest, I buy a teal and
gray-black crocheted hat, some scarves and table runners, and a
pair of long black and tan alpaca socks which I anticipate
wearing tonight in our charming but cold casita at La Mirage.
Together, Jer and I purchase a tablecloth and two fino-grade
&quot;Panama&quot; <a href="hat.jpg">hats</a>. The weave is so
fine and supple that the hats roll up for storage. In fact, each
comes with its own narrow wooden box. With a decorative woven
band of choice, the hats are $25 apiece, by far the most
expensive of our purchases. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lunch is in an old hacienda, <a
href="http://www.haciendapinsaqui.com/">Pinsaqui</a>. Simon
Bolivar slept here. The grounds are beautiful, and home to
several llamas. We watch two of them <a href="llamas.jpg">face
off</a>, like cats establishing dominance. The food &#150; here,
and so far on our trip &#150; is good, but not exciting. We have
shrimp in garlic cream sauce, chicken in fines herbes cream
sauce, sea bass or trout in walnut cream sauce. You get the idea.
Entrees come with rice <em>and</em> potatoes. The chocolate
desserts taste more like cinnamon than chocolate. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch we visit Cotacachi, the
&quot;leather town,&quot; walking distance from La Mirage. Rodney
and Santiago drop us off for further retail therapy. Jer and I
are shopped out, though; we head back, separately, to the hotel.
We cool out for about three hours, until it's time to (aargh) eat
again. Same menu as last night; I have the remarkable carrot soup
that Jer had ordered before, and a shrimp entrée very much like
the one I had for lunch. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It strikes me, sitting in the European
grand-style bar before dinner, that what really irritates me
about this place is its stunning non-Ecuadorian-ness. Aside from
the charming Indian serving women and the painted birds and
flowers on the room-number plaques, there's nothing native here,
no sign of the wonderful local tapestries and other crafts we've
seen today. It's generic luxury, a place out of space. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Friday
12 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We check out of La Mirage. First stop is
another lake, Yaguarcocha, Blood Lake. Compared with Cuicocha,
it's not worth the detour. Rodney tells Jerry about a six-part
Spanish book series called something like <em>The Trojan Horse</em>.
It's about ancient Christianity, among other things, and flying
saucers. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the woodcarving town of San Antonio, we
visit a workshop and watch craftsmen and apprentices carve
everything from hideous &quot;cute&quot; cows with bulging,
cud-chewing cheeks, and overly-adorable giraffes in several
sizes, to full-out Last Suppers, six-foot diameter Aztec
calendars, and intricate, boldly-crafted headboards. The sawdust
smell reminds me of my dad's workshop. <a href="puppies.jpg">Two
puppies</a> watch us from a niche in the brickwork of a building
across the way. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Over some deeply rutted roads lined with
tethered and feeding pigs, wandering cows and dogs, men guiding
oxen, traditionally dressed schoolkids toting Barbie and Pokemon
backpacks, old women carrying <em>their</em> burdens in the
traditional fabric bundles, people farming with hand tools, or
squatting in the street talking, and entire female family groups
washing clothes, and themselves, in the river. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We stop at Iluman, known for its felt hats
and shamans. In this town, homes are identified with family
names, like Cardenas-Sosa, on commercially-printed signs above
the front door. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Rodney takes us into a tiny one-room shop
where a woman and young man are shaping hats. They heat
old-fashioned irons on a propane-fired two-burner stove. The
woman tells us that her father and grandfather owned this shop
before her and, proudly, that she ships her hats to wholesalers
in Germany, France and Japan. Several partially-shaped <a
href="hats.jpg">felt hats</a> are lined up (drying? curing?) on
the sidewalk outside another shop across the street. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the main street of Iluman, we see several
signs advertising <a href="shaman.jpg">shamans</a>. Rodney points
out the one with the best reputation. He tells us about his own
experience with a shaman, several years ago. Apparently the
treatment worked for his adolescent angst. Sounds like
psychotherapy. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our next stop, Peguchi, is the highlight of
the day. First, a demonstration of Andean musical instruments
&#150; flutes, pan pipes of various dimensions including one so
large that it rests on the floor, and guitars made from armadillo
shells. A handsome young Indian guy plays several of them for us,
then he calls out his younger sister (we assume) for <a
href="music.jpg">an impromptu concert</a>. They play three or
four numbers. The man plays pan pipe and guitar, and occasionally
sings, while the girl, solemn- faced, beats on a large drum.
Apparently their father and uncles are members of a well-known
Andean music group, Nanda Manachi. The light slanting into the
open-sided structure is glorious. A magic moment.</p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="DOORWAY.jpg"
border="3" width="194" height="293"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Still in the Peguchi area, we visit a
weaver, Jose Cotacachi, who signs all his weavings Jose C. He
uses a style of loom introduced by the Spaniards. He's prolific,
and works in many different styles. We pay $12 for a small piece
showing a group of native women in hats and shawls. It's a
popular motif; we've seen it in Otavalo and elsewhere. But Jose
adds three-dimensional braids and metal earrings to his, stopping
just this side of kitsch. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Rodney leads us out through the back door of
the workshop, through a courtyard filled with clotheslines, and
we poke our heads into a one-room house that appears to be <a
href="cui.jpg">inhabited by guinea pigs</a>. They're everywhere,
roaming around, eating the grain and leaves scattered on the
floor. A big black cooking pot sits on a low table just above
their heads. Foreshadowing. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Across the courtyard, we're invited into
another, slightly larger home where an old woman is <a
href="oldlady.jpg">spinning yarn</a> on a device that, measured
from spindle to wheel, is probably 7 feet long. I've never seen a
spinning wheel like this, not that I've seen many spinning
wheels. She walks back and forth, turning the wheel and twisting
the wool into yarn. She, too, lives with guinea pigs running
loose around her. Rodney tries repeatedly to get her to reveal
her age. Repeatedly, she turns the conversation back to wool.
This seems to be a running game between the two of them. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our last artisanal stop is Miguel Andrango's
<a href="backstrap.jpg">backstrap weaving </a>shop in Agato.
&quot;Backstrap&quot; refers to the way the weaver braces himself
against the loom while weaving. He sits on the floor with a wide
strap of cowhide (from the head; you can see the eye slits)
cradling his back. The two ends of the hide are fastened to the
sides of the loom closest to him. He leans back for leverage as
he pulls each cross thread tight against the previous one. It
takes about a week to complete, say, a table runner, which he
sells for $25. We buy a placemat-sized piece for $12. Another old
woman (Sra. Andrango?) spins yarn at the opposite end of the room
from Miguel's loom. She uses an elongated <a href="spinner.jpg">spinning
wheel</a> like the one we saw at Peguchi. Corn hangs drying
behind her. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, around 2:30, lunch at a beautifully
situated spot, <a
href="http://www.ccasablanca.com/english/puertolago.shtml">Puerto
Lago</a>. The window by our table is practically at lake level.
The restaurant décor is vaguely Swiss-Alpy, though, mixed with
generic nautical, and the food is much like yesterday's, with a
preponderance of cream sauces. We do have empanaditas filled with
veggies and cheese to start with, and my sea bass with capers is
excellent. Bob mentions having once had lunch with B.F. Skinner.
I ask whether it was a box lunch. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Then we head back to Quito, arriving around
5 PM. We tip Rodney and Santiago, and wish them well. An
excellent guide and driver. We spend the evening packing and
repacking, filling suitcases with stuff we won't need in the
Galapagos; we check several bags at the hotel for the duration. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="jug.jpg" border="3"
width="195" height="291"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Saturday
13 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">An early flight, via Guayaquil, for the
Galapagos. Rodney had advised us to sit on the left side of the
plane (it's open seating) where we could see the Andes and at
least one active volcano, as well as the approach to the islands.
Our naturalist guide, Jaime Dominguez Rodas, meets us at Baltra
airport. A short bus ride to the dock, where we board the <a
href="encantada.jpg">Encantada</a>, a red-hulled motor-sailboat.
We draw lots for cabins one, two and three. The accomodations are
entirely adequate &#150; sailboat-like, as we'd anticipated. We
meet Christiane, the chef (there's also a cook), who's 21, and
Swiss-hotel-school-trained. This is her first time cooking on a
boat. We're also introduced to the captain and crew. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After settling in, we have lunch, and then <a
href="darwin.jpg">Darwin</a> (!), our Zodiac pilot, motors us to
a snorkling spot. We all plop overboard like elephant seals. The
waves are heavier than anything I've ever snorkled in. Bob and
Jerry climb back in the Zodiac for a while, and Mollie never does
come in. I persevere, and thereby earn jock-of-the-day status, a
once-in-a-lifetime event. We see two white-tipped sharks and
three sea lions, one of which passes within a foot of me. We're
in the water for about an hour. That would have been impossible
without wetsuits or skins. These are not the tropics; our dive
shop investment is already paying off. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back to the boat to change clothes and then
to North Seymour island, our first Galapagos stop. The <a
href="landscape1.jpg">landscape</a> is sere but beautiful &#150;
yellow-flowering Opuntia cactus, leafless trees and scrub, lava
rock. Coarse sand made of shell fragments, broken sea urchin
spines, and other marine detritus. But it's mainly about the
animals. <a href="bbooby.htm">Blue-footed boobies</a> nest right
on the path, shifting their weight from one blue foot to the
other. A <a href="iguana.jpg">land iguana</a> that must be four
or five feet long. Lots of tiny <a href="lavaliz.jpg">lava
lizards</a> as well. <a href="frigate.htm">Frigate birds</a> (Are
they Great or Majestic? I never quite get clear on that), the
males in full red-throated display. They look ominous and
forboding when they fly, all dark and angled wings. The chicks,
though, are predominantly white and fluffy. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We have to step over the <a
href="sealions.htm">sea lions</a>, mostly mothers and nursing
babies, because they won't move out of our way. The babies crane
their necks and bodies backward; they practically bend double to
have a look at us. A tiny one humps over and gently investigates
my calf with its bristly whiskers. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="sealion5.jpg"
border="3" width="383" height="275"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As the sun lowers, we complete our circuit
of North Seymour. The lava rock beach is alive with dark-colored <a
href="iguana4.jpg">marine iguanas</a>. Sea lions surf the
breakers just offshore. The night flight of frigate birds
wheeling above us as we head back to the Encantada. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Before dinner, Christiane makes a
blender-full of a special cocktail, sort of a dairy grasshopper
based on condensed milk. Better than it sounds. We're officially
introduced to, and we toast and drink with, <a href="crew.jpg">the
crew</a>. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Sunday
14 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A sea turtle off the aft deck before
breakfast. Landing on South Plaza island is problematic; a huge,
inertial sea lion lolls across the platform. What should have
been a dry landing turns into a wet one as we improvise a rocky
path around her. These animals -- the adults, certainly &#150;
define the word &quot;louche.&quot; And they <em>are</em> vocal.
The pups are adorable; eight or ten of them splash around in a
natural depression in the rocks &#150; the kiddie pool &#150;
wheere they're safe from sharks. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There's so much to see that we barely move
ten yards from our landing point in the first hour we're there.
What particularly holds our attention is a cactus tree (opuntia),
a dozen or so iguanas, both land and marine, and a couple of <a
href="finch.jpg">cactus finches</a>. As the finches feed on the
yellow cactus flowers, blossoms and buds occasionally drop to the
ground. This immediately attracts a group of land iguanas, who
scurry over to eat the fallen fruit. We watch one <a
href="iguana.htm">iguana</a> climb the trunk of the opuntia,
something Jaime says he's never seen before. It makes its way up,
through the paddles, to the flowering parts, and prceeds to chow
down on both blossoms and tender (we assume), barely open buds.
If this behavior is as rare as Jaime says it is, we're witnessing
evolution in action. Maybe in a thousand years Plaza Island will
host a colony of winged arboreal lizards. (I later find
references in print to iguanas climbing trees and shrubs for
food, so then again, maybe not.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jaime also points out some hybrid
(land-marine) iguanas; it seems strange that the two species
would breed at all. We soon see one of the hybrids climb the same
opuntia and face off, heads bobbing, with the land iguana that
had gotten there first. We also watch land iguanas mating
(multiple times) and further along, when we finally abandon our
spot by the iguana-opuntia, several of their burrows on the
ground. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the other side of the island is a high,
steep cliff. <a href="iguana5.jpg">Marine iguanas</a> and,
amazingly, some huge sea lions, have hauled themselves to, or
near, the top. Many <a href="gull.htm">swallowtail gull </a>nests,
both in the cliff face itself and in the grass at the top. These
are beautiful, exquisitely detailed birds. We see a couple of
eggs and five or six downy chicks. Jaime points out a red-billed
tropicbird, with its streamerlike long tail feathers. I drop
behind the group so I can pee behind a stand of opuntia; I have
an audience, a semicircle of iguanas. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Returning to the Encantada, we hoist sail
and head for Santa Fe island. Christiane, our chef, is seasick.
It's not just her first time <em>cooking</em> on a boat, we
discover; it's her first time <em>on</em> a boat under sail. We
pelt her with conflicting advice (&quot;Lie down!&quot;
&quot;Look at the horizon!&quot;) and meds from our various
stashes. Eddie, the cook, covers lunch. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We anchor off Santa Fe and snorkle off the
boat. I follow a sea turtle for quite a distance. At one point
I'm torn between continuing to swim with the turtle and following
a huge ray (one of several) in the opposite direction. Not as
many colorful fish as in the tropics, although we do see a large
school of yellow-tailed surgeon fish. But the rays and the turtle
qualify this as an outstanding snorkle. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The weather darkens; an inverted triangle of
storm cloud on the horizon. By the time we disembark at Santa Fe,
it's raining in earnest. It's an up-to-our-knees wet landing amid
a profusion of sea turtles, rays, and white-tipped sharks. The
sharks, we see, are hoping to get lucky: There's a sea lion
colony just onshore, with a dozen or more tender pups. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Botanically, Santa Fe is unlike any island
we've seen yet &#150; acres of dry-looking, bare gray trees,
towering tree cacti (much larger than opuntia), some low,
feathery pines. The island is covered in vegetation, and the
trail is very rocky. Most of the animals are sheltering from the
rain; we might have seen snakes on this island, Jaime tells us,
but we don't. Mollie is relieved. We do see a couple of land
iguanas, some lava lizards, and two Galapagos doves, a pretty
rust- and black-plumaged bird with blue around the eyes. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">No sign of the Zodiac when we get back to
the landing beach, and Jaime's radio calls fail to pick up a
response. (It turns out to have been a frequency mismatch; the
one they'd been using no longer works, so they have to switch to
another). We stand on the sand, getting wetter by the minute, and
wave like desert island castaways at the Encantada and another,
larger boat anchored well offshore. Finally, a dinghy full of
tourists detaches from the other boat and heads our way; the
pilot is kind enough to carry us back to the Encantada. He comes
by later to collect the beer we promised him. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While onshore at Santa Fe, we find an
extraordinary amount of manmade debris. Jaime points out that it
must have come from the Resting Cloud, the vessel we'd originally
chartered, which ran aground on New Year's eve. This turns out to
be the spot. Mollie finds a piece of wood, presumably from the
hull. We discuss divvying it up as a souvenir, and sending a
piece to our travel agent, too. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Española Island. A wet landing on a <a
href="beach.jpg">white coral beach</a> with a resident population
of sea lions. <a href="mocker.jpg">Mockingbirds</a> on Española
have learned to recognize water bottles; one is working on
Jerry's within moments after he sets down his pack. We walk the
length of the beach in search of possible turtle nests; find
none. But at the end of the beach we see a <a href="iguana2.jpg">marine
iguana</a>, not the usual black but heavily marked in blue-green
and red. Iguanas on Española, and lava lizards, too, take on
unique colorations. The female lava lizards have vivid red heads,
throats and forelegs. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We snorkle off the beach. Not many fish, but
I swim out to a large rock offshore and see a colony of ten or
more rays, in shallow water, right below me. Later, on the dinghy
ride back to the boat, a school of golden eagle rays swims by
just under the surface. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We stay in our suits and go out again almost
immediately to snorkle at a different spot, Turtle Rock. It's
spectacular. Lots of fish; huge black starfish geometrically
patterned with tiny red, orange, yellow or green dots. An
elegant-looking spotted eagle ray. After we snorkle around the
island, Darwin picks us up and takes us back to the boat for
lunch. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="zodiac.jpg"
border="3" width="431" height="293"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the afternoon, we motor to Punta Suarez,
on the other side of Española. What should have been a dry
landing turned into a wet-ish one, thanks once more to the sea
lions lolling across the platform. A single night heron. An
aggressive mockingbird escort. Colorful marine iguanas, like the
one we saw at the end of the beach this morning, but by the <a
href="iguana3.jpg">hundreds</a> now. Their behavior is
fascinating &#150; rapid head-bobbing and clicking vocalization,
spitting salt water, the sexual chase. Bob defines a new
collective noun: A lethargy of iguanas. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jaime points out the albatross nesting
ground, though it's empty now; too late in the season. We resign
ourselves to not seeing an albatross on this trip but, as he
speaks, one skims across the treetops. As we approach the cliff
side of the island, we spot three of them, soaring back and forth
with the frigates, gulls and hawks. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Further along the cliff, a large colony of <a
href="masked.htm">masked boobies</a> with many eggs and young.
Masked boobies typically lay two eggs, for insurance, four or
five days apart. If the first chick dies or is sickly, the second
is backup. If the first survives, the second is killed or kicked
out of the nest to die. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Insurance seems like a very good idea. As we
watch, first one <a href="hawk.jpg">hawk</a>, and then a second,
swoop down and land just a few feet from a booby and her fuzzy
babe. Mamma tries to cover the chick &#150; it's a week or two
old, gangly and fairly large &#150; with her feet and chest. The
hawks don't miss a move. They eventually take off, but they'll be
back. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Completing our circuit, we walk through a
huge marine iguana colony. Sunset on Española, on the lava
rocks, lolling among the iguanas. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At dinner we taste babaco, a delicious
yellow fruit completely unlike anything we've ever eaten. We're
exhausted. I can hardly stay awake through the fascinating
Galapagos nature video, one of three or four we watch on the
trip. I fall asleep on my bunk without bothering to brush my
teeth. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Tuesday
16 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Floreana. We step through a colony of hermit
crabs (oxymoron du jour) as we land for a look at the <a
href="po.jpg">barrel post office</a> of Floreana. You leave your
cards there, addressed but unstamped;&nbsp;someone who's
returning to the addressee's country eventually picks them up and
mails them when they get back. In turn, you sort through the
waiting mail stack and pick up cards to mail for others. I
consign three cards, and we take three to mail in exchange. What
a good excuse for not sending postcards: &quot;I left it on
Floreana. Perhaps you'll get it someday.&quot; And what an fine
example of trusting the universe, and the goodness of humankind. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On another part of Floreana, flamingos (8)
in a shallow lagoon. Very peaceful scene; we sit for a while on
rocks overlooking the water and the birds. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Later we motor in the dinghy past a marine
preserve; a sizeable colony of rays lives on the bottom, so no
landings are permitted. Lots of sea lions, though, who swim up,
nuzzle the side of the Zodiac, and tug at a line we trail in the
water. We land on a beautiful white sand beach where one large <a
href="turtle3.jpg">sea turtle</a> rests on the beach and <a
href="turtle1.jpg">dozens more</a> swim in the shallow surf a few
feet offshore. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Time for a snorkle before lunch. We take the
Zodiac to Devil's Crown, a lava rock outcropping. There's quite a
surge, and a strong current, but it's much calmer on the inside
of the &quot;crown,&quot; where we see schools of surgeon fish
and other large and colorful varieties. Also a spotted ray, and a
penguin sitting on a rock just above the water line. I have my
fill of close-up penguin-gazing. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="ayora.jpg"
border="3" width="344" height="231"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch we motor to Santa Cruz island
and anchor for the night in the bay off Puerto Ayora. Strange to
see lights onshore, as well as houses, shops and other signs of
human habitation. Water taxies ply the short distance between
boats at anchor and the dock. Cocktails with Jaime on the aft
deck. We watch the sunset fade and birds take flight. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At dinner the conversation with Jaime turns
to UFOs, alien abductions, reincarnation. We sleep very well
&#150; no motors, no motion to speak of. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Wednesday
17 January</strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Santa Cruz Island. Darwin drives us to the
dock and we board a small van to the highlands. It's cool and
cloudy, but the rain holds off. Jaime leads us along a narrow
trail through the rainforest &#150; a symphony of birdsong
surrounds us &#150; to the rim of a caldera several hundred feet
deep and lushly overgrown with greenery. Nearby is another,
smaller caldera. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Birds: Vermillion flycatcher, woodpecker
finch, mockingbird (very territorial, no surprise), yellow
warbler. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another van ride; we spot several land
tortoises along the road and stop to examine one or two. A
lengthy trail walk &#150; more tortoises along the path -- takes
us to the muddy shore of a lagoon that's home to two or three
dozen more <a href="tortoise.htm">tortoises</a>. We see two
couples mating, others just hanging out in the mud or the water.
What amazing faces these creatures have, especially their eyes.
How does it feel to live at such a slow pace, and for so long? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Small tortoises = tortellini (Francine)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Turtle dung = turdles (Reva)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal">Heading back, we notice bushes full of tiny
tomatos growing in profusion. Jaime calls them tomatillos, but
they look (and taste) just like our Sweet 100s. Each of us picks
and eats a handful. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next stop: A giant underground lava tube. We
enter through a steep set of stairs that descends through a ferny
grotto. Inside, it's a long journey through barely lit passages
and caverns, among stalagtites and &#150;mites. We ascend from
the underworld into another ferny, humid den and up to the
waiting van. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, it's back to Puerto Ayora and a
successful mass attempt to drain the town's single ATM so we can
pay our bar bill on the Encantada. Christiane, who's lived in
P.A. for two months, is back from her night at home. &quot;I was
landsick,&quot; she says, miming the unsteady gait of a sailor on
shore leave. Jaime, who also lives in town, skips lunch to see
his two sons. The rest of us have excellent ceviche, with popcorn
on the side; goulash, with eggplant subbing for the beef in mine;
and fresh pineapple with sweetened condensed milk for dessert.
Still at anchor, we have a couple of hours of rare and welcome
down-time before Jaime returns from town. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Later, Darwin motors us over to the Darwin
Research Station, where we spend about 90 minutes looking at the
baby (less than a year old) tortoises, the not-yet-repatriated 2-
to 5-year-olds, and the old ones they keep around to study and/or
for the tourists. Jaime shows us incubating tortoise eggs and
explains that one degree difference in incubation &#150; 29
degrees C as opposed to 28 degrees &#150; results in female
tortoises rather than males. With that knowledge, and our
combined but still skimpy knowledge of cloning and artificial
insemination, we contemplate the fate and potential progeny of
Lonesome George, the last of his breed from Pinzon island. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="tortoise5.jpg"
border="3" width="362" height="242"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;For the first time since setting sail
from Baltra, we have the opportunity for retail therapy. First
priority: More film. I'd expected it to be super-expensive here,
but at the small kiosk within the Research Station, it was just
$7 for a 36-exposure roll. The catch: No Visa; Mastercard or cash
only. I buy a generic t-shirt; the selection in our sizes is
slim. Leaving the station, though, we find a much larger shop run
by Galapagos National Park, and we satisfy our t-shirt lusts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our <a href="jaime.htm">Jaime</a> turns out
to be quite a figure locally. Not only does he produce the nature
photo postcards he gave us a few days ago, and the map of the
islands we've been consulting onboard (and which is for sale
within the park and elsewhere), but also an illustrated checklist
of species, and undoubtedly other items as well. He tells us that
he's trying to cut down on his naturalist-guide work, and find
more ways to leverage his photography, so he can spend more time
with his sons. We lucked out; he wasn't planning to travel this
week at all, but was the only certified guide available on short
notice when the Resting Cloud went down. We drew <a
href="christiane.jpg">Christiane</a> as chef for the same reason.
She'd been cooking at the Red Mangrove, a hotel in Puerto Ayora,
and was asked if she wanted to cook at sea. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The boat crew world is a small and fluid
one, we're learning. Our captain, <a href="almir.jpg">Almir</a>,
told us he'd once captained the Resting Cloud; we're still not
sure whether that was a joke. Edwin (Eddie) the cook used to work
on her, and Cesar, one of the sailors, has the t-shirt to prove
it. (The rest of the crew, while I'm at it: Darwin, who swears
that's the name he was born with, and Roven, who seems to do
everything, including divemaster for David.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From Darwin Station, we stroll back through
town, committing more retail damage along the way. We stop at the
Encantada office and Mollie, the only one of us who's fluent in
Spanish, facilitates a bit of business that will allow us to pay
our ever-mounting bar bill by Visa, as we'd been told before
departure we could. Meanwhile, Jer and I and Francine and Bob
drink $2 margaritas and admire the view of the harbor from an
open-air second floor bar across the plaza. Maria-Dolores, the
Encantada's office manager, joins us for dinner that night on the
boat. Christiane sits with us, too, this once, and they treat our
party to a bottle of wine. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Thursday

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunrise on the equator. Jerry and I are up
before six and greet the dawn, coffee cups in hand, from the aft
deck. Santiago Island &#150; incredible lava and black
sedimentary <a href="santiago.htm">rock formations</a> along the
shoreline. Marine iguanas, <a href="sally2.jpg">Sally Lightfoot
crabs</a>, fur seals as well as sea lions, a single lava gull, an
<a href="egret.jpg">egret</a>, a pair of nesting <a

the rocks. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="sally1.jpg"
border="3" width="252" height="197"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It's a hot day; by the time we make our way
back along the interior trial, we're ready to snorkle. We go in
right from the coarse black sand beach. The surf is heavy. We
follow a rocky outcropping and see schools of surgeon fish, green
sea urchins, a huge ray, and a bull sea lion. We bodysurf back to
shore and end up covered, I mean <em>breaded</em>, with sand.
Cesar hoses us down the moment we set foot back on the Encantada.
He probably wished he had a fire hose. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lunch is hearts of palm (palmito) salad,
spaghetti Bolognese, and fresh mango cut and trimmed so it stands
vertically on the plate; a very handsome preparation. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch, we motor to Rabida Island,
where the soil and sand are brick-red. We snorkle off the dinghy,
along a cliff where we see pelicans nesting, iguanas, and a
two-dimensional Great Blue heron. Underwater is spectacular: huge
schools of surgeon fish stopping to swarm and feed in the
crevices of a big rock on the bottom; schools of anchovy-sized
fishes and larger striped ones, swimming around us and changing
direction as one mind. But the best: First a bull sea lion, then
a young one, then two young adults doing a graceful water ballet
in front of, and very close to, us. They're feeding off the
myriad fish that, though still all around us, had receded in our
minds to background texture. What a moment. Five of us (David was
off diving) hang in the water, transfixed. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We eventually make it to shore and change
into the walking clothes that Darwin had dinghied over. We check
a lagoon just inland where flamingos often hang out; not a single
one today, however. Intense sea lion action &#150; with each
other, and with us &#150; as we walk along the red sand beach. <a
href="mollie.jpg">Mollie bonds</a> with one little guy (?) in
particular. We're not allowed to touch the animals, but they can
touch us, and do. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As the sun sinks low behind us, every pebble
on the beach casts a long, sharp shadow. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="rabida.jpg"
border="3" width="195" height="291"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dinner is delicious &#150; a coconut-based,
island-spiced fish dish, plus rice and plantain fritters. Peaches
(canned, understandable under the circumstances) with chantilly
cream for dessert. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In Spanish, buceo = diving. Buceo de

<p class="MsoNormal">Off <a href="barthol.jpg">Bartholome Island</a>.
Jer and I are on deck before the sunrise again. We sail past a
huge vertical slab, smooth and sheer as we approach it, sloped
and deeply textured on the other side. <a href="barthol2.jpg">Pinnacle
Rock</a>, Jaime names it for us later. A line of tourists from
the Polaris, anchored next door, starts its antlike climb up the
hill to the lookout station we'll visit later in the day. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After breakfast we take the dinghy along the
coast, headed for Sullivan Bay and a different portion of
Santiago Island than the area we visited yesterday. We watch,
close up, a pair of penguins mating. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A dry landing on lava, a 101-year-old <a
href="lava.htm">frozen flow</a> that extends for acres.
Otherworldly, and intricately beautiful in all its variations
&#150; iridescent, obsidian-glassy, foamy, folded, draped,
miniature grand canyons, bubbles frozen in time, piles and whorls
and anthropomorphic shapes. When I start seeing <a
href="lava4.jpg">iguanas, penguins and sea lion pups outlined in
the lava</a>, a la Pompeii, I shift focus to the broader vista.
Amazingly, a few small cacti have managed to grab hold, somehow,
and grow. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We loop back to shore, where Darwin's
waiting with the dinghy and our snorkling gear. The high point,
by far, of this underwater trip is a group of penguins (I counted
ten) feeding on the schools of fish that surround us. They dive,
twist and come close to inspect us before thrusting off again.
One looks me right in my face mask, travels down my left shoulder
and arm, and nips me, investigatively, on my index finger. Note
to self: fingers = fish, if you're a penguin. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Closeup views of blue-footed boobies and
pelicans onshore as we swim by, and plunging into the water as
well. But nothing beats swimming with penguins. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="starfish.jpg"
border="3" width="321" height="266"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After lunch, we reverse the routine: First
snorkling, then a hike to the top of Bartholome to admire the
panoramic view and watch the sun set. We snorkle around Pinnacle
Rock, the huge, dramatic, leaning slab of lava tuff that marks
Bartholome Island. (Now we understand Eddie the cook's reference
to Bartholome, a few days ago, when he served us slabs of
watermelon standing vertically on the plates.) Green sea urchins.
Several schools of thousands of fish each, crossing paths with
each other, changing direction in an instant. Pelicans diving and
feeding around us. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is the <em>only</em> point on the trip
where we have to navigate around other groups of tourists.
Several other boats (ours is always the smallest) are anchored in
the bay, and the beach where we land after snorkling off the
dinghy is crowded with clots of turistas. The Tilley hat count is
alarmingly high. Jaime meets us and escorts us along a narrow
sand path -- we see later, from the summit of Bartholome, that
we've traversed an isthmus -- to an even more beautiful beach on
the other side. There we see a sea turtle resting in the sand,
two more <a href="turtle2.jpg">mating in the surf</a> just
offshore, and others swimming nearby. It reminds me very much of
the lovely beach at Floreana where we also saw sea turtles. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We retrace our path to the first beach,
where Darwin picks us up and motors us to the base of a 360-step
stairway to the top of the highest point on Bartholome. En route,
<a href="armrocks.jpg">Jaime explains tectonic shift</a> and the
formation of volcanic islands by placing pumice pebbles &#150;
roughly the relative sizes of various Galapagos islands &#150; on
my outstretched arm. &quot;Now move it a thousand meters,&quot;
he directs me. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The view at the top is <a

peak, ignoring the other visitors, until the sun sets. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is, incredibly, our last night on the
Encantada. Christine has prepared another special drink, a
version of caipirinha, the Brazilian cocktail made with fresh
limes, sugar and (in this case) vodka &#150; to mark the
occasion. As we did early in the cruise, we toast the entire
assembled crew, and we all drink. This time, they toast us, too,
and Jaime thanks us, and we thank him, and he thanks the crew
&#150; it's his first trip with them &#150; for being so fine to
work with. Tasty snapper for dinner, and a special dessert &#150;
an orange <a href="cake.htm">cake</a> elaborately iced with
chocolate, decorated with cherries and inscribed &quot;Feliz

<p class="MsoNormal">George W. Bush is presumably preparing to
take the oath of office, and how irrelevant that seems from the
top of Daphne Major at sunrise. We board the Zodiac at 5:30 AM,
with Roven along for an extra pair of hands. We need them. In
near-dark, guided by flashlight, we attempt the most challenging
landing of all: It's a dry one, but just barely; the waves beat
the Zodiac as it maintains a tenuous nose-hold in a rocky
crevice. Meanwhile, one by one, we find hand- and foot-holds on
guano-spattered lava rock, and start our ascent, bodies, legs and
faces pressing against the sharp, pitted cliff, half-blindly
seeking the next even marginally feasible niche. Swallowtail
gulls nesting in the cliff face squawk when one or another of our
appendages comes too close. Eventually, we all manage to climb to
a point where the trail levels out to <a href="daphne1.jpg">a
mere 45 degree</a> or so angle. We clamber, half crouching, up
the slope of the island, skirting masked booby nests in the
middle of the trail. (The <a href="nest.htm">booby nest </a>is
simple &#150; a layer of individually-chosen pebbles and sticks
in a cleared circle on the ground &#150; but unmistakeable once
you've seen one.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jerry steps a bit <a href="daphne2.jpg">close</a>
for one bird's comfort and get a nip on the toe as a souvenir of
Daphne. Booby-kind in every stage surrounds us, from egg to naked
infant to almost full-size but still fuzzy <a href="downy.htm">adolescent</a>,
to adult. Despite Jer's bite, we're amazed at how close they
allow us to approach. Still, I find myself apologizing at every
step for disturbing them. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A few blue-footed boobies nest among the
masked; we also see frigates, and <a href="jerfinch.jpg">Darwin's
famous finches</a>, both cactus- and ground-. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jaime has timed it perfectly: the <a
href="daphne12.jpg">sun rises</a> just as we reach the double
caldera at the summit of Daphne Major. The ocean is like glass
from this altitude. The Encantada drifts offshore, far below us.
The only sounds, now, are the varied vocalizations of the boobies
&#150; squawks, gutteral mumblings, and shrill whistles. The
bottom of the caldera is dotted with birds &#150; more boobies,
nesting and keeping a close eye on the frigate population. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jaime's last visit to Daphne, he tells us,
was seven years ago. Claro que he's enjoying it every bit as much
as we are. We spend almost an hour at the summit, drinking in the
peacefulness and becoming, for just a little while in our
imaginations, part of Daphne Major. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At one point the <a href="daphne3.jpg">Polaris</a>,
a relatively &quot;small ship&quot; according to friends who've
taken it, cruises by the island. We hear their naturalist's voice
on the loudspeaker, and think <a href="daphne.htm">how lucky</a>
we are to be here, <em>on</em> this island instead of just
skirting it, with our own chosen travel companions and a guide
who understands the virtue of silence. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Eventually we have to pick our way back down
the side of Daphne. It's an obstacle course; the phrase
&quot;booby-trapped&quot; resonates like never before. Darwin has
found an alternative and <a href="cliff.htm">ostensibly easier</a>
mooring. At least it's daylight now. Still, most of us make the
last part of the descent at least partially on our butts. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Daphne, at least from this side, looks like
one of those French revolutionary stocking caps, the name of
which escapes me. We wash the guano off our hands and feet,
attend to minor bites and lacerations, and eat breakfast while
motoring to Baltra. Darwin, Christiane, and Jaime accompany us to
the airport; we say goodbye to the rest of the crew. </p>

<p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><img src="daphne11.jpg"
border="3" width="380" height="289"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the airport, Jaime delivers the
long-promised copies of his Galapagos map he designed and had
printed. He offers us his calendar, too -- $10 for both items.
The shop just adjacent sells the calendar alone for $12, the map
for $6. A special deal for los amigos. Darwin shows up with our
luggage to check, and hangs around, too, for a hug and a final
farewell.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What a treasure these islands are &#150;
fertile, teaming, and &#150; assuming you're not a direct link in
the food chain &#150; incredibly benign. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back to Quito, via Guayaquil, and the
Hilton's <em>huge </em>rooms and hot showers. We have drinks at
the hotel and <a href="group.jpg">dinner</a> with our fellow
travelers at a nouveau Ecuadorian restaurant called Nispero. The
place is beautiful, in a funked-up folk art way, and the food is
good and attractively presented, but not very interestingly
seasoned. At the end of the meal, the waiter treats us to glasses
of an Ecuadorian liquor, which I find in the duty-free shop at
the airport on our departure. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We have a 4 AM wakeup call and a 5 AM pickup
for a 7:45 departure. We run into Laurie Patterson from Sea Ranch
at the gate for the Miami-SFO leg of our flight. She's returning
from London and Antigua. Gradually, the horde of Galapagos
returnees has thinned, diluted by travelers-from-elsewhere. Our
exotic origin is no longer a given. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It's a smooth return; our flight to SFO even
gets in a little early. We hug Mollie and David goodbye at the
baggage carousel. A couple of hours later, we rendezvous with
Francine and Bob back at the El Rancho for drinks and dinner
&#150; Thai food. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Up at 5 and home by 9:30 AM. All's well with
the house and the <a

on the news this evening, word of an oil spill on San Cristobal
island, just east of the area we cruised. Apparently the tanker
ran aground on Tuesday, and began leaking on Friday. Now I wonder
about the crew meeting, and the heavy radio traffic (all in
Spanish, of course), while we were on board. They undoubtedly
knew, and didn't tell us because they didn't want to mar our
vacation. The right decision, I suppose. But still, what a shock.
How fragile these islands are. We continue to monitor the news at
