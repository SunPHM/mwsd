		<h3>World Class Smallmouth Bass Fishing</h3>
		For 200 years the Moosehead Lake Region has been famous for its salmon and trout fisheries.  As an added feature, Indian Pond, a man-made lake that was illegally stocked with bass in the early 1980's, has been producing some of the best smallmouth bass fishing in this state or out.  Bass up to three pounds have become common with an occasional four and five pounder showing up.<br><br>

		Although Indian Pond is man-made, it has a true wilderness flavor, as there are but a few remote cabins on its shoreline and wildlife abounds in the area.  Up until a few years ago, access was a problem due to road conditions.  Now a well maintained gravel road, pebble beach landing area and lots of parking make it a breeze to trailer in and launch your boat.  Good fishing begins in the flowage area right at the landing.  Fishermen who don't have a boat, or don't want to bring one, have easy access to bass by simply renting a canoe.  In addition to the superb bass fishing,  Indian still boasts excellent salmon and brook trout fishing.  Lake trout can also be caught; however, bass, salmon and especially wild brook trout are the featured fish.<br><br>
		Fishermen of all types can use their own preferred fishing materials to produce plenty of action.  Fly fishermen with poppers, trollers  with Rapalas, or cast-and-retrievers with top water plugs, spinner baits or plastic worms will all have successful fishing trips.
