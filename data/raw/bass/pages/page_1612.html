<font face="Arial">Tune basses are made in Japan and come in a 4-, 5- ,6-, 7-, 
8-, 10-, and 12-string versions. The 12-string basses are set up as 2-course / 
6-string basses. This is a 6-string bass with low and high B strings plus a 
single high octave string for each fundamental string. As such they are more 
closely related to 8-string basses than the 12-string basses that are our 
primary interest, which are 3-course / 4-string instruments. Thanks to&nbsp; for submitting the 12-string photos!</font></p>

Modulus
did make an 18-string (3 course 6-string) bass for Tom Peterson in the early
80s. It was a TBX neck-through model with what was probably a custom Stars 
Guitars brass bridge. The bass was originally shipped to SIR in LA for Tom. The 
bass was left at SIR for reasons unknown and shipped back to Modulus once found. 
It happened that the late Allan Woody called Modulus at that time and asked if 
an 18-string “just like the one you made for Tom Peterson” could be built for 
him. When he was told the actual Peterson bass was available, he became the new 
owner. It was still with him at the time of his death</font></span></font></span><span style="font-family: Arial" lang="en-us">.</span></p>

I have been a 12ver fanatic since 1990's &quot;Its Love&quot; video
from King's X.&nbsp; I purchased my first 12ver in 1993, a red, long scale, Hamer Chaparral.&nbsp; This was the first year the long scale was available as a
non-prototype model.&nbsp; Having been a fan of Doug and Tom for years, I couldn't
wait to be playing this awesome instrument.&nbsp; Now, being from where I'm
from, I'm sure you can guess that most of the money I make as a musician is from
the country music genre.&nbsp; I had hoped early on that I would bring this
instrument to life in country music, but as many would say, they just weren't
ready for it at the time.&nbsp; I continued to play my Hamer until 1997 when I
signed on to endorse a new bass maker at that time, Warrior Instruments out of
Rossville, Ga.<span lang="en-us"> </span>I came into Warrior before they had 
made their 100th instrument<span lang="en-us">.</span></font></p>

<p align="left"><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial" size="3">Two photos of
a 1993 Modulus 12-string bass turned up at the shop. The first picture shows
Jane McNall (who is currently the Director of Sales and Artist Relations)
holding the bass outside of the Modulus shop in 93. It is a bolt-on Quantum with a 5A quilted maple top and a
black cherry finish. You can see the shadow of the 12-string headstock on the
wall behind Jane. The second photo shows  Mike from EMG playing the same instrument. Joe Perman (now the
Production Manager) built this bass, as well as another 12-string that year. The
other 12 was a <b>3-course / 4-string</b> with a Gibson Ripper-shaped body built for then
Apple Computer development whiz Dave Fung. Dave’s bass made it to a NAMM show 
later in 93 where it was photographed and pictured in a trade magazine. Joe 
knows he built at least a few more 12-string basses, but the one in the photos 
and the Ripper-shaped bass are the two he can clearly recall.</font></span></p>

one of a kind collector's item, as are all of Joseph Jesselli's guitars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bass was commissioned in 1980.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>I was looking for a bass that would give me the full bodied sound 
the band got by multi tracking guitars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Jesselli heard what I
had in mind his face lit up, and he began to get a far away look in his eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Before any solid plans were made, he was already imagining a way to set
the three sets of tuning pegs required.<o:p>
</o:p>
<br>
<br>
The resulting instrument <span lang="en-us">is</span> a work of art that to this day stops even the most
jaded collector dead in his tracks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
solid body, with a shallow bowl sound chamber under the bridge, is hand carved
from book matched mahogany in a fluid, art nouveau style.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The oversized neck and headpiece were fashioned from a special piece of
fiddle back maple that Jesselli had been saving for a special occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Three sets of gold plated Grover tuning machines were used,
with the tuners for the second octave string set into the body cavity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bridge and tailpiece were fashioned by Jesselli from sand cast bronze
and ivory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The electronics are
simple, with a single volume and tone control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
<br>
<br>
The pickup was hand wound by Bill Bartolini.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The mother-of-pearl inlay on the ebony fingerboard is topped off with an
ivory nut and mother-of-pearl<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>truss
rod cover.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The headstock, already the largest one on any Jesselli
instrument was too crowded with tuning pegs to allow the standard Jesselli name,
so instead a large &quot;J&quot; was inlaid, also in mother-of-pearl.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The finish of the guitar is an antique white, with the mahogany grain
coming through in the body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
<br>
<br>
When Jesselli delivered this instrument to me, he insisted on looking me in the
eye when I saw it for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
told me that he could see the magical moment when a player bonds with his
instrument.<o:p> <span lang="en-us">&nbsp;</span></o:p>I know he wasn't disappointed.</font></p>

photo doesn't do the finish justice, it is a vibrant sea foam green. I probably could have
modified the photo to approximate the color but I thought it would be best to leave it
