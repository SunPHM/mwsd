      <div style="clear:both;"></div><strong>'HOME' AND COMFY</strong><br /><br /><br />I guess it's a normal thing, that whenever I come back from a trip, it would take it's toll on my blogsite. It takes a while for me to be able to update my site... well, for several reasons. If it's a trip from the Phils., I wouldn't be updating at once because it makes me sad to remember things too soon. If it's a trip from somewhere else, there would be other reasons, but always, always, one of them would be because I'd have to make the house habitable again after leaving it for a couple of weeks or so. Well this time, you can throw in jetlag and <a href="http://kwentongtambay.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_kwentongtambay_archive.html#107534033466569506">some other thing</a>.<br /><br />Right now though, it's a holiday Monday afternoon, a rainy one at that, and I've done most of the blog-restricting things I have to do, fafa Jay's sleeping in the room and I have the computer all to myself... it's what I would call a 'perfect time to blog.'<br /><br />Okay. So how do you guys like my new lay-out, huh? Pretty nifty, don't you think? And I told you it's sooo me... huh? Huh?... what with the color, which, on account of my being a capricorn, an earth sign, fits me to a T... the coffee cup which I simply can't do without, the donut which I love. It's like everything in this design has been put to make me really comfy. Of course, an ashtray with a burning cigarette might have been added. But you know what? Since I'm trying to quit now (operative word: trying), it's absence is so apt even. <br /><br />I'd like to thank <strong>Ate Sienna</strong>, my sister-friend, owner of <strong>Manilena</strong> and <strong>Pansitan.net</strong>, for designing my new skin, and also, for hosting my site. I don't know. I think, as far as the web is concerned, there is absolutely nothing that she's incapable of doing. In my book, she's a genius. I'd also like to thank my hubby, <strong>fafa Jay</strong>, for all the things he's added to the new look of my site. He has spent a lot of time on it and... what can I say except 'what in heaven's name will I do without you?'<br /><br />Well, with all that having been said, I guess it's time to talk about our trip. It's an 8-day trip and my first time in California, so don't ever make the mistake of thinking this is going to be a short blog. So sit back and be prepared to lose the haste.<br /><br />We arrived via Los Angeles on 17 Jan (no pictures at the airport, ok?). The immigration officer decided he had to take my fingerprints but my fingers were so dry they wouldn't leave a print on his machine. So guess what he asked me to do. First, he asked me to rub my pointing fingers on my forehead, nope... on the side of my nose?, won't work either. So then he asked me to rub them on fafa Jay's forehead and voila! Finger prints! I was shivering and fafa Jay was all sweaty... and let me just tell you that that is so typical... heh.<br /><br />On to our first stop... to my cousin Leslie's house in Flagstaff Lane, Huntington Beach.<br /><br />I haven't seen her for the last 17 years or so... she left just a bit after she graduated from highschool. Now she's a wife to a Japanese-American race car driver, a mother of two, a career-woman and a <strong>HOMEMAKER</strong>. Why the stress on 'homemaker'? Because when she was young and still living in the Phils., she was donya numero uno. You know what her dad said to her then-fiancee Richie when he asked for her hand in marriage? '<em>I don't even know why you'd want her for a wife. Don't you know that the only time her hands would get wet is when she washes them?</em>' But now she's doing it all and I was simply floored.<br /><br />Typically Filipino, when my cousin came out the door to meet us, we screamed each other's name, hugged for a long, long while and ended up in tears. We kept at it for so long and before we knew it, bot her kids were crying along with us. We had to explain to them that we haven't seen each other for so many years and were just so happy. It's only when they understood why that they stopped crying themselves.<br /><br />We had lunch, she made adobo and tuna casserole, and she introduced us to this japanese voodoo spice mix that you sprinkle on your rice and it tastes like heaven... heh. And we talked, and talked and talked and kept each other up to date. After lunch, we freshened up and went straightaway to...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pa2dcea70f12ae0c3742cd0d4cf947272/f9cdb23c.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="dream come true no. 1" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center><strong>DISNEYLAND!!!</strong></center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p2b655818f3950b4364df137a0a6915c5/f9cdb946.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="at the entrance" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Toni, moi, Leslie and baby Nikki at the entrance while cousin-in-law Richie queues up for tickets.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pcd8198c5940ec435309e3ba13e6f5c8c/f9cdb70d.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="the wonder and magic of Disney" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>It's an expensive way to keep the child in you but I think once in a lifetime, everyone should be given the chance to see this.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p24aee974ecc207bf397533f57698de31/f9cdb675.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="down on Main Street" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Toni, moi and fafa Jay down on Main Street... heh</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p0480203d08fb6b9616eb4d9b491cb907/f9cdb2d4.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="round and round and round on a circle lane" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>The best I ever had of this was in a jewelry box... until now.</center><br /><br />We saw the parade of the stars too but for some reason we failed to take some pictures. That's ok... it's not as if I will ever forget seeing something like that. It was all too fabulous and all the time I felt like walking into a dream. <br /><br /><strong>I saw Mickey!</strong><br /><br />We went home to a dinner of Jack in the Box and had my first taste of sourdough bread.<br /><br />The following morning, I woke up to my cousin wrestling with her kids. We talked a bit, showered, had breakfast, talked some more and headed off to Huntington Beach.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p70034f04c2440ec02d0fc3065749d53e/f9cdadd5.jpg " width="337" height="253" alt="not quite under the boardwalk? heh" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Richie, Leslie, Toni, moi and Nikki</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p351b91f6695f027a464d0a0575a2b1f6/f9cdacba.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="? the Duke Restaurant, dude? heh" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Moi, Leslie and Nikki waiting for the car in front of the Duke Restaurant.</center><br /><br />That afternoon, we were headed off to West Covina, where the much-anticipated first meeting with my <a href="http://atesienna.pansitan.net/">dear, dear friend</a> was waiting to happen... but not until after some more pictures were taken.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pe7342ad0438bf2e12777113a5d1fd321/f9cdac91.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="time to go" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>In front of my cousin's house.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p7dcdd45b01ce8b4d5ca0ca2807a4f136/f9cdabaa.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="goofing around" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>... and their neighborhood</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p20fa29e6d62f20bfcc4fe99c5f403848/f9cdaa90.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="how do you fit 17 years in one hug" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>For all the 17 years... till we meet again...</center><br /><br />On the road again. We arrived at Barranca Street, West Covina, a little before 7 pm. I couldn't help it... when I saw Ate Sienna, my tears just fell. We hugged each other, me in my jacket, over a sweater, over a shirt and with my gloves on, and she freshly bathed and in her shirt and a pair of shorts... I guess there was no mistaking who was visiting who... hehe.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p2c9194674b980700c15f80e2a2cc823d/f9cdaa18.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="dream come true no. 2" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Counterclockwise: Papa Andy, Ate Sienna, Maricel, moi and fafa Jay in Ate Sienna's Japanese-inspired apartment.</center><br /><br />A little while later, <a href="http://tagayan.pansitan.net/">Roger</a> (not in picture), one of Ate Sienna's pinoy friends, co-worker and a blogger hosted by pansitan.net as well, came and they prepared a fantastic Japanese meal for dinner... tonkatsu (is that what it's called? courtesy of Papa Roger), some noodle in soup dish with Japanese flavors that was reeeaally good, and Ate Sienna made a whole array of sushi. Still later, <a href="http://ngyawngyaw.pansitan.net/">Maricel</a>, another of Ate Sienna's pinoy friends, co-worker and blogger hosted by pansitan.net too, arrived. With that, we had dinner and a <strong>lot of laughs</strong>! These guys are sooo funny, sooo cool, sooo warm and accepting, sooo great... I can write down all the adjectives I could come up with but nothing would be enough to describe these guys accurately. They had me laughing all night, I didn't want it to end. Suffice it to say that I think these two guys are great friends and Ate Sienna sure is in great company and I'm glad that fafa Jay and I met them.<br /><br />They even bothered enough to get me cakes for my birthday. Really, you guys are sooo sweet.<br /><br />The following morning, guess where we went...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p005c1ffcd6d9ce5c22a874fd6f6a7765/f9cd9773.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="dream come true no. 3" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>ooohh la la...</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p18bc4d41ac40bfa2fd72ada0be37b18b/f9cda859.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="what?s showing at the theatre?" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Fafa Jay and I at the entrance of the Chinese Mann Theatre... did we get to watch anything?

So we went instead to...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p8223af9776da44596f3b98e9dab60e11/f9cd8f01.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="second best, I guess" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>the Santa Monica Beach</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pd846ccf109120f28767ed4c936c9b51d/f9cd8e98.jpg" width="253" height="337" alt="it?s easy to get romantic here" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Notice I was wearing gloves?

I love it!</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pf848355a66e5f10f66cc33b24b8543a5/f9cd8e40.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="beautiful?" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Now her space is a part of my life. And I find that it's a beautiful place.</center><br /><br />Papa Andy, bless his heart, had a nice pot roast ready for us when we got back. We feel so blessed to have so many good people in our lives.<br /><br />I knew in my heart that this trip would not have been complete without this visit to Ate Sienna. Everything I've known about her from our correspondences have been confirmed... her kindness and generosity, her warm and happy heart, how much she cares for her friends, how good she and Andy are together and how much I needed to see her and be with her, if only for a while. Ate Sienna, thank you very, very much for letting me be there.<br /><br />The following morning, we had to leave early for our long drive to Sacramento, where my family hub is. We took it in 6 hours and my cousins said that was pretty fast. Oh by the way, we had brunch with fafa Jay's colleagues (Ceci and Tom... Ceci even had a birthday gift for me... so many nice people really) first. We ate at Denny's and I had the biggest breakfast ever... I had the Lumberjack Slam and I finished it all by myself... heh. I think I like I-HOPS better, though.<br /><br />We arrived at Sacramento close to 7pm and proceeded to our host, my cousin Alma's (Leslie's sister) house in Eden View Drive. After a while, she took us to her mom's (Auntie Nemie) house and together with her brother Jon-jon's family, we went for dinner at Macaroni Grill. I guess the brunch I had was really big cause this time, I didn't finish my food. It was good though.<br /><br />The next morning, we met our cousin Emy at I-HOPS and I had the Tutti Frutti breakfast again. Then they took us to my uncles' graves (their Dads both) and I was finally able to pay my last respects, after so many years.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p532ad47479d5ecea39922059cf3bc056/f9cd8cc5.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="hello uncles?" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>moi, Emy and Alma... the grave with 2 hearts is Uncle Simo (Alma's Dad) and the other one is Uncle Tito (Emy's Dad).</center><br /><br />An impromptu reunion happened after that. We called up Layden (Emy's sister) and she asked us to proceed to their house. She was supposed to be at work that afternoon, but because we were there, she decided to call in sick... heh.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pc8e9625dcc6eeb51d128badb56946e7d/f9cd8a6a.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="so much family? how could we have missed all these for so many years?" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Alma, Emy, Layden, moi and fafa Jay at Layden't house. The two kids are Layden's.

It's really been a long time. We stayed a while and then proceeded to the house of their elder brother, Kuya Ken.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p4d1b6f7fe1c046c70070b8b4844371e3/f9cd89a8.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="more family?" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Meeting more family for the first time.

Emy, moi, Layden, Alma (Kuya Ken's wife... not the other Alma) and Auntie Mila.</center><br /><br />Alma prepared us a snack of pansit palabok... all in 15 minutes. Gosh, everything's really quick here... heh. Everything is made instant. But you know what? It tasted pretty good.<br /><br />For dinner, we all went back to the grand dame Auntie Nemie's house and had barbecue. As soon as we arrived, fafa Jay took his post at the grill. Well, barbecue is his thing anyway. We got so engrossed at grilling all the meat that alas, we forgot to take some pictures... heh.<br /><br />The following day, we were scheduled to drive to Modesto, were the hub of fafa Jay's family was. But not before this...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pb6f7a0fe283300f2ec372740ce0a3736/f9cd88f4.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="our hosts in Sacramento" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Cesar (Alma's hubby), Alma, moi and their daughter, Aubrey. This was an early morning picture and I haven't showered yet... heh. We had to take this before Aubrey went to school cause we thought we wouldn't be there anymore when she came back. Boy, were we wrong.</center><br /><br />A little trivia for you... Alma met her husband, Cesar, at our neighborhood in Jordan Heights back in the Philippines. I met fafa Jay at Alma's neighborhood in GSIS Village. And let me remind you that my sister Darlene's husband is fafa Jay's friend from the grades at Notre Dame. Makes me think... we seem to keep a pretty tight circle of friends that eventually become family.<br /><br />So we showered, packed our bags and after that, Alma and Cesar gave me a treat to...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pd5a95f730ca7a32d8feb4d2e0d2f0830/f9cd8706.jpg" width="253" height="337" alt="dream come true no. 4" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>3 boxes... they got me 3 boxes of donuts!</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pc68b0be257ca8968316ed4e4604f9736/f9cd8688.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="No... this is not an advertisement." align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Gosh, I am such a tourist... heh.</center><br /><br />Then we proceeded back to Emy's house where I was reunited with the only cousin I have yet to see again... Kuya Cesar... err, not Alma's hubby but Emy's 2nd brother... heh.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pa037f33a4170a39109daa55d7cb02ae3/f9cd8586.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="at Emy?s house" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>moi and Kuya Cesar...</center><br /><br />After Emy's house, we went to downown Sacramento where my cousins took me shopping at Macy's. We had lunch at Cesar's and Alma's favorite Japanese restaurant (forgot the name). I was so touched cause Layden, who had to go to work that afternoon again and couldn't join us, dropped by the restaurant on her way just to see me one last time. Why do these guys love to make me cry?<br /><br />After lunch, we picked up Emy's kids from school (so I got a glimpse of an all-American schoolyard too... heh) and dropped them off at their house, hugged our last and then went to pick up Aubrey from her school, went back to their house to get our bags and was treated to this for a parting memory...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pecc02c891e49671cd4191479760c898b/f9cd81c8.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="haiiyyaaaa!..." align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>You better watch it, dude... the kid's a green belter.</center><br /><br />I am so grateful for this chance to see my cousins again. I guess in the nitty gritty of our everyday lives, we've had to do without each other's company. We've grown old... taunted by life's twists and turns, had our own share of hurts, thrown off-balanced at times, and have gone crazy in fits of frustration. But we're still standing... everyone of us. Maybe that's the tie that binds us as a family... inspite of the distance, inspite of the years... we're made of sturdy stock.<br /><br />It was great seeing you again guys, and I miss you all already.<br /> <br />Inadvertently, we arrived at Modesto by dusk. We got a little lost cause we missed a turn and fafa Jay and I found ourselves driving along stretch after stretch of farmland. It was a bit eerie, for me at least, cause we were on unfamiliar ground and it was getting darker the farther we got. But of course, what's to be scared of huh? My knight was driving the chariot. Thanks <a href="http://87gentlestreet.pansitan.net/">Renee</a> for getting us back on track.<br /><br />That night, I met this side of fafa Jay's family for the first time. But it didn't feel like I was amongst strangers at all. Everybody was so warm and welcoming, the conversations went on like we just picked them up from where we left them the last time, I was never left by myself, and they really made us feel special. I mean... in a nutshell, these guys do know how to love family.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p821452893f0e7a8ef05f8f8dfdd7cfbd/f9cd809a.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="see what I mean?... heh" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Fafa Jay and perskasin Simon... you gotta love this guy. He really took good care of us.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pf44b80b33486396264e7d44e4843f895/f9cd8140.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="first time?... never felt like it" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>From the left, Sel, moi, Renee and Ana... cousins and wives all...</center><br /><br />Simon's wife, Baby, treated us to a dinner of really delicious barbecue and pansit palabok, complete with shredded tinapa. Really yummy! And then there was the gift from Simon of matching wrist watches for Papa and me. That night, it was all I could do not to blush. These guys are simply the best!<br /><br />We slept that night at <a href="http://www.onedayisangaraw.blogspot.com/">Jojo</a> and Renee's house. Renee, in her very pregnant state, stayed up until 7am, I believe, to spruce up a pot roast dish for brunch the following day. Can you believe the lengths these people would go just to make you feel as welcome as possible? I'm still awed.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p9e2287aff7847dc28a92774f108b461f/f9cd7c96.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="they even kept the Christmas tree up for us" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>moi, Renee and baby Troy... they even made the tree wait for us... awww</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p1186e24b72d57e2cabf1286432e1d3e9/f9cd7d74.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="still Christmas" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Jojo and Renee's eldest, Lance... still enjoying the Christmas feel of their home in late January</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/p4b8587e7fcd4024ad1eb85afd2090f9d/f9cd7b60.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="at Sel?s house" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Husband and wife, Simon and Baby... really nice couple.</center><br /><br />That afternoon, Simon and Baby fetched us and took us shopping, first at Macy's and then at Ross. I gotta tell ya, I LOVE Ross! I love the prices in that store and got myself some really nice goodies. I'd also like to mention how good Baby took care of me. Every little thing that caught my fancy, she'd search for the right size or the good match. And again, it leaves me in wonder, and makes me happy at the same time, how well we hit it off. Everything just seemed to fall in place.<br /><br />We had dinner that night at Sel's (the only girl in a brood of 6) house. We were supposed to sleep at Simon's house but to my dismay, I fell asleep right on the couch, amidst people singing, talking, eating and what have you. I must have been really poofed out.<br /><br />Sel... just like Baby, was so much like a godmother to fafa Jay and me. She really did her part in taking care of us. She went non-stop at offering me something to drink or eat... she made really good margarita, and she even made sago, pecan tarts, fried some nuts to go with the margarita, cooked binagoongan and guess what... she even surprised me with a birthday cake! Wow... I mean really, I couldn't thank you enough Sel. You just made me feel so special. And not the least of all the food prepared that night was Simon's famous grilled sea bass. <br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid101/pdc185d822d8c6234f2a6027c7d6719b7/f9cd79c0.jpg" width="337" height="253" alt="at Sel's house" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>Sel and moi... she's great in every way... great wife, great mother, great sister, great cousin, great friend and great cook.

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><strong>I'M OUTTA HERE</strong><br /><br /><br />Whew! What a week.<br /><br />Due to our slated trip this weekend, I've been cleaning every corner of the house to rid it of the dust it has accumulated during our 3-week absence. Now we're leaving it again, so I had to make room for new dust... heh. I don't know, some things can and will change but that's one thing that will not, ever. I can't live harmoniously with dust.<br /><br />Speaking of changes, a lot of it's coming up.<br /><br />When we get back from our trip, I'll be outta this lay-out. This has been the look of my site ever since I started blogging, all for 4 months short of two years. I have no real need to change my lay-out, but when I saw <a href="http://jetdavid.blogspot.com/">this design</a> (gotcha! what, you think I'd post a link to my site's new look and rob it of it's grand entrance?... hehehe) that my dear sister friend, <strong>Ate Sienna</strong>, made, I simply fell in love with it. It's just so me... the color, the design, the concept. Btw, if you're looking for new lay-outs for your sites, she'll be coming up with a design site soon, aptly called <strong>Manilena</strong>. Believe me, she's got really nice designs, some pensive and soothing, some clever and amusing, but all of them beautifully done and well-thought of.<br /><br />I'd like to thank <strong>fafa Jay</strong> for all the work he's done on this old lay-out. I love everything about it, especially the banner he made, and I know I will most probably miss it for a long while. If you've been visiting my site since a long while back, you know how much improvement has come to it over the year. He's the one who started and set-up this site for me and he has never stopped putting in bits of this and that to make it more attractive. I've loved it and I still do. Alas, it's time to move on, and I'm shedding this skin for a new one.<br /><br />Another change that's happening is, I am now going to have a host... uhm, let me correct that. I am now going to have a home, cause that's what it really feels like, in more ways than one. I am now going to be part of the <a href="http://www.pansitan.net/">pansitan community</a>! Woohoo!!! Again, through the remarkable, amazing, one-of-a-kind. exemplary and all-out generosity of Ate Sienna, my site now has a niche to be cozy in. The next time I blog, it will be at <strong>http://jetdavid.pansitan.net</strong>. So friends, please update your links. Don't go losing me now... heh.<br /><br />I have been friends with her for almost 2 years now, and although we have constantly kept in touch all these time, we have never met face to face. This weekend though, through the loving generosity of <a href="http://kwentongtambay.blogspot.com/">my husband</a>, I will see her in person, finally. It's really come a long way, this friendship we have, and I would just like to say how overwhelmed I am with the brand of friendship she has given me. <br /><br />I've known how it feels to be loved by family, as anybody else normally would. I've known how it feels to be truly loved by a man, with all the other extras that come with it, like respect, and kindness, and tenderness, and adoration, and generosity. But I have never known how it feels to be loved by a friend so much, it closely compares with all the love I've ever felt in my lifetime. I can tell you everything we've talked about, and shared and everything we've helped each other through, if only to make you see what I mean. Probably, words have never held such strength, such fervor, as those we've exchanged, in concretely cementing our hearts and our lives together. But the same words would fail me, in making you understand all the nuances that come into it. I am not capable of defining it. I can only savor the many sweet graces it brings to my being. <a href="http://atesienna.pansitan.net/index.html">Ate Sienna</a>, the miles I am going to cover pale in the enormity of joy I have in my heart at the prospect of being in your space, of seeing you before my eyes, of holding you close. Please, wait for me. <br /><br />And yes, as many of you know by now, it was my birthday yesterday. Not only did I gain a year, I've also ended another decade, on the road to a new one. I have no expectations, I've always thought my life has brought me more than I ever thought I deserved, more than I've ever exerted any effort for, more than I ever thought I wanted.<br /><br />I, too, have been young once, many years back. I have also aspired for greatness, garbed in all the gargantuan views a juvenile holds of it. But somewhere along the road, one finds that one will have to choose between greatness... and where one's heart belongs. I have chosen where my heart found its home. I have chosen my marriage. Looking back at the way things have fallen in place over the years, I think to myself that somehow I must have done something right. Let me just say that in general, I am happy and in particular, I feel loved. So I guess I could sit back and enjoy it all, this happy consequence of my life's major quid pro quo. And yet, it makes me think, who is to say that greatness only has one set of wardrobe? The way my life has evolved comes to mind whenever I think of these words by <a href="http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/Thackeray.html">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>:<br /><br /><em><center>To endure is greater than to dare; to tire out hostile fortune; to be daunted by no difficulty; to keep heart when all have lost it; to go through intrigue spotless; to forego even ambition when the end is gained - who can say this is not greatness?</center></em><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/paeb98cf6a092f409619240e07bcce88f/f9efb07c.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="my flowers" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>These are the flowers that fafa Jay greeted me with.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p7afd05bdc656d0c0c9f667916e7b868d/f9efaffa.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="my cake" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>This is the cake he surprised me with.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p2317b5be89d259a4c31924f923e646e6/f9efaf96.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="my friends" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>These are the friends who helped us celebrate.</center><br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p0fe3aacde5c8f3418ebafa77fcc87c32/f9efb019.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="my birthday" align="center"></center><br /><br /><center>And this is me... all aglow.</center><br /><br />I'd like to thank all who left birthday greetings and wishes for me on my site and fafa Jay's, your words have been too kind and I relish each one of them...

Antonia who got tied up with work, Rico who couldn't leave a critical patient in Manila, and <a href="http://www.upsaid.com/leah/">Leah</a> who is in Hanoi...<br /><br />God... the rock of my being, the source of my peace, who gifted me with my heart and all that it can hold...<br /><br />And fafa Jay, whose gift of love is the best gift I've ever had in my life, a gift I receive... every single day.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

So just to give you a picture of what I'm saying, here's, well... the pictures...<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p6a08f2fab8c89546b3e2fd4c4551584e/f9fa2175.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="ghost, moi, Jobert and Belle" align="center"></center><br /><br />That's Ghost, the blogless bloghound who I hope will soon catch the bug and come up with a site of her own, moi, <a href="http://organizedconfusion.com.ph/">Jobert the Famous</a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/belleloved/">Belle the Poet</a>. We met Dec. 17 at the Podium... making a full circle by meeting up at Starbucks, having dinner at some place on the topmost floor, and having coffee and discussion about a whole cornucopia of things back at Starbucks. We talked about movies, poems, our lives, specifically Jobert's... hehe, their jobs, books, politics, GRO's and would you believe, even the life of the Romanovs. We even exchanged gifts and they gave me such wonderful ones... a pretty handcrafted box from Belle, a really interesting and relevant book from ghost and a really nice carry-all from Jobert which came in handy on our trip back to Singapore. The conversation was so stimulating we had to force ourselves to call it quits when the wee hours of the morning still found us huddled together, trying to figure out exactly what the youngest Romanov's disease was called, as a last ditch effort to keep something so nice going and it sucked that time wasn't on our side. <br /><br /><strong>Addendum:</strong> Forgive me for my oversight and thank you, <strong>Belle</strong>, for pointing it out. <strong>Ghost</strong>, thank you for bringing the lone camera that night, or else we wouldn't have this picture to remember it by. And <a href="http://cbsmagic.blogspot.com/">cbs</a>, please don't take offence in my failure to mention that this convergence of wonderful people happened in your site. I do wish you were with us too. It's just so many things happening all at once and right now, I do not have my usual detail-endowed memory to aid me. My apologies.<br /><br />The <strong>Susmariosep</strong> group was slated to have an eb, which has been talked about <a href="http://susmariosep.dekarabaw.com/">on the site</a> for the longest time, but only materialized when <a href="http://www.anamelissa.de/">AnP</a> finally returned my calls. We scheduled it on the 19th, 2 days before Belle was to leave for the province. Sadly, AnP didn't make it, as she was stuck in traffic in Makati and had some other troubles she wasn't counting on that night. <a href="http://bopis.dekarabaw.com/">Dennis da Bopis</a> couldn't make it either because of some reason... well, problem and <a href="http://kulukoynimart.blogspot.com/">Mart da Kulugo</a> called me up a day too late. We did meet up... Belle, <a href="http://neilencio.blogspot.com/">Edward da Labo</a>, fafa Jay and myself, all the time hoping that AnP would eventually show up. We were kept hopeful cause AnP kept sending sms of her progress through Makati and so we sat back and waited leisurely, with Edward doing his stint to keep us entertained. <br /><br />As it went, we ended up getting so stuffed, our motley crew of 4 almost didn't fit in the car... heh. We started out at Cibo, beside Starbucks, at Megamall, having glass after glass of iced tea and coke, while waiting for those who we hoped would come. We also had 2 platters of toasted biscuits with the spinach spread that Edward loved so much, he finished it all, and that was just for starters. We had dinner at Pots and Noodles, and still hoping to meet AnP, we had coffee and cheesecakes at Cheesecakes Atbp. (or Cheesecakes et.al.... I forgot).<br /><br />A little past midnight, when we've lost all hope of AnP coming, we called it a night. Well, it was a pitty but I know Edward was happy, and we did have a lot of fun. Belle and Edward were the two bloggers I first met last May at Tia Maria's and it was a nice feeling, to know I'm meeting up with 'old friends' now. When we delivered Belle to her front door, we knew it was the last time we'd see each other for the year and we hugged tightly. <br /><br />Sorry, but no pictures this time.<br /><br /><CENTER><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p266b0472fb8f22566ec06826336c7f1c/f9fa3137.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="moi and Mec" align="CENTER"></CENTER><br /><br /><CENTER><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p091084a3c1870340a796d632a14a96d1/f9fa3120.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="Jojo and fafa Jay" align="CENTER"></CENTER><br /> <br />That's moi and <a href="http://delisyusness.blogspot.com/">Mec the Delisyus</a> on the left picture, and on the right is Jojo and fafa Jay. We met them on the 22nd, again, at Megamall. I was so humbled by Mec's efforts to make good her promise to meet me as she came all the way from work at Manila and had to commute through the Christmas rush to Ortigas that night. We stayed at Cibo again and had dinner there. After a while, her boyfriend, Jojo, whom she lovingly calls 'Baby' came and joined us. It was a night spent discussing jobs, relationships, families and Christmas traditions. I can't help but notice how sweet this couple was. You can readily see love and tenderness in the way they look, speak and touch each other... it's like seeing fafa Jay and myself right before our eyes.<br /><br />A week after we came back to Singapore, Mec emailed me some wonderful news. But it's not my story to tell so just feast on the pictures and keep your nosey mosey to yourselves.<br /><br /><CENTER><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p2a3cddf4c6dba1d0c4bf0864ccf28579/f9fa3068.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="Edward, Ayeza, Val and Aya" align="CENTER"></CENTER><br /><br /><CENTER><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/p9f7825b29fbab9b98aa62f4ca9d17661/f9fa3094.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="moi with the girls this time, instead of Edward" align="CENTER"></CENTER><br /><br />Dec. 29, Monday... what I would call the big EB day. The left picture shows Edward, Ayeza, Val and Aya. In the right picture, that's me with the girls, instead of Edward. We met in Kulinarya at the Powerplant, braving the roads inspite of some car trouble. Remember we hail all the way from Antipolo. But that's my fault, the restaurant was my choice, and only because I simply had to have their shrimp salad one more time.<br /><br />Papa and I weren't the only ones who braved it, I think everybody did. Edward came all the way from Pateros, <a href="http://www.balikbayanbox.blogspot.com/">Ayeza da Plawer</a> flew in that morning from Vancouver, <a href="http://gingerblue.blogspot.com/">Aya</a> and <a href="http://nothingfancy.blogspot.com/">Val</a> were on leave that day and didn't really have to be anywhere near Makati, but everybody came. Oh, we missed <a href="http://pseudochinai.blogdrive.com/">Clare</a> by the way but she did have to go to work.<br /><br />Edward kept mum this time cause Ayeza had the floor. This is one funny girl, I tell ya. And though she just arrived that morning, she had gifts prepared for everybody. Thoughtful, funny, charming... I knew I had to meet her. Val hit it off with fafa Jay cause they had a common interest, her place of work. And sitting next to Ayeza, who I would fondly say was all over the place, you can't help but notice how prim she just was. And Aya... I will never forget what I learned about you that day, something I probably would never have found out if I read your blog for a hundred years... that pretty little something on the second toe of your right foot.<br /><br />It was a crazy crew and I only wish we had more time. But Ayeza was meeting other friends after that and had to go, while Papa and I were off to another eb.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/pad72f5b8837b5c6176d1b7c9b26ce842/f9fa2f6c.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="Tanya and moi at Starbucks" align="center"></center><br /><br />We met <a href="http://www.tanyaloca.blogspot.com/">Tanya the Director</a> and friend <a href="http://www.jcsouldier.blogspot.com/">Nick</a> at Starbucks, a short distance away from the mall. There were four of us, yes, but it was like a one on one between the sexes, with fafa Jay and Nick hitting it off, and Tanya and I whispering lengthy tales to each other at the other end of the table... hehe. Whenever Nick would ask what we were talking about, we would duck the question and raise Tanya's phone to show him the pictures I feigned looking at. I would like to commend these guys cause they really found their way around the traffic and color coding restrictions just to meet us. They came from Pasig, had to park their car at Megamall cause they wouldn't make it to Makati before the 3pm curfew, took a cab to Makati and then rode with us back to Ortigas to get their car. I'd call that heroic.<br /><br />Sorry, but I can't tell you what Tanya and I talked about. A lot of it is girl's talk, and a lot of it is personal. Tanya and Nick, that was a great afternoon, guys. Thanks for coming through.<br /><br />And if you think we'd had enough, think again... we had another eb for dinner.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid99/pf34fb998ced6838b6ce9cbcbca0e8a71/f9fa2f04.jpg " width="360" height="270" alt="Yvette, moi and Teddy" align="center"></center><br /><br /><a href="http://jadedafrica.dekarabaw.com/">Yvette of Somaliland</a> and hubby Teddy with me in the picture. We met them that same night for dinner at Trellis in Quezon City. It was such a stimulating evening, filled with talks of their involvement with civic movements, their views on Philippine politics, their experiences in such matters and how these has all affected their lives, their loves and their family. There is so much to learn from this couple, whose whole lives have been dedicated working for causes beyond themselves and finding things to remember fondly and laugh about inspite of the danger, the difficulties and the tough, the dire and the unsure.<br /><br />After dinner, we proceeded to have a few drinks at a small bar called Conspiracy. The ambience provided the perfect nightcap for all the conversation that went on that evening, accompanied by the scintillating voice of Cookie Chua and the crowd that surrealistically layed down the common ground. What can I say? We even saw Dequiros there that night.<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.imagestation.com/picture/sraid97/p7df7d6a4cd253a3b4b75a049b1cbc2c1/fa0f481c.jpg" width="360" height="270" alt="where would I be if I haven?t met this guy? 15 years ago" align="center"></center><br /><br />Yes, that is fafa Jay and no, I didn't meet him just now, of course. But I couldn't thank him enough for making all these meetings happen easyily for me. You know about the traffic in Manila, you know how difficult it is to commute there, right? Well, all those things didn't touch me because I had Papa right there, driving me to all these places to meet all these people. And the enthusiasm he had for it was a dream, he was the perfect host, the perfect partner, the perfect <a href="http://kwentongtambay.blogspot.com/">'kuya Jay</a> to everyone...<br /><br />,,, and I just needed to say that, my love... needed you to know.<br /><br />To all you people who took the time out of your calamitous schedules, who had to come all the way down from the north, or up from the south to meet me, you have honored me deeply.<br /><br />My life will never be the same... now that I've met all of you.<br /><br />Thank you all. Sa uulitin!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><strong>NAIA PULLED ME OUTTA MY BLUES</strong><br /><br /><br />Sunrise? Check.<br /><br />Cool, clean air? Check.<br /><br />Voices of Papa and neighbors talking on the street below my bedroom window? Check.<br /><br />Joe Taruc and Deo Macalma on DZRH? Check.<br /><br />Datu barking and yelping alternately? Check.<br /><br />Tricycles roaring by? Check.<br /><br />Date? January 5, Monday<br /><br />Activity? Flying out.<br /><br />The minute that thought hit me, I cried. It was time to go and I wasn't ready. It's never enough. No matter how much time you spend visiting home, it's never long enough.<br /><br />I went to the bathroom and did my morning ritual, all the time dabbing at my eyes for the tears that seemed to have a mind of their own, falling no matter how much I try to repress them. Having done that, I went to the other room to see if my sister was awake... barely, but my nephew Lucas was already up and about, already into his non-stop scrutiny of everything around him. I sneaked in and exchanged 'good mornings' with Lucas, and then left them so they could start the day their way.<br /><br />Down the stairs, I was greeted by Datu with his usual tail-wagging, high-pitched yelping and non-stop jumping. He will keep at it until I pick him up and give him his good-morning hug, which I give him just to avoid getting scratched by his long nails. Anna asked me if I will already have my coffee, and the question brought tears to my eyes again. I put Datu down and hugged her. '<em>Yes Anna. Salamat.</em>'<br /><br />With my coffee-mug in one hand and my first cigarette in another, I went out the door to greet the neighbors gathered around Papa. We greet each other, exchange jokes, laugh, bicker... I do everything like it was an ordinary weekend morning when there wasn't much to do and there was all the time to hang around... and each minute that passed made each thing I did a lot paler than the one before. In a little while, Darlene, Lucas and Kuya Bong joined us and I had to turn back cause I couldn't hold on any longer. For another stretch, this isn't my world again, and the sooner I snapped out of it, the better for me.<br /><br />I went back to the house and called my parents. First, I spoke to my dad. I asked him to take care of himself, to be a good patient and follow his doctors' advise. I told him I wanted him to be in his best of health cause this year, I will do all that I can to save up for their trip to Singapore for his and my mom's birthdays (his, on Dec. 4 and hers, on Dec. 13), and then we'll all fly home together for Christmas. Then I spoke to my mom and asked her to take care of herself as well, to have a little more patience with my Dad. I told her my plans and asked her to help me pray that all goes well. 10 minutes tops, I can't take any more of it. My heart was bursting to pieces.<br /><br />Soon, we were taking turns in the bath. Soon, we were having breakfast. Soon, they were tossing the luggage in the car. Soon, we were off.<br /><br />The trip was nondescript, I even managed to doze off a bit. The minute the airport loomed before us, the tears came again and I hugged Darlene and Lucas so hard, Lucas almost cried out in pain. In the middle of this, I glanced out the window and I can't believe what I saw... a queue of people snaking in forward and back endlessly on both entrances. It was total chaos.<br /><br />First problem was the trolley, there was none in sight. I trudged the whole length of people queueing up, hoping to spot one neglected trolley but it was hopeless... although this was a feeling I couldn't afford because at the back of my mind, the image of 9 pieces of luggage kept creeping up. There was no way Papa and I could haul all of them into the airport barehanded. After making sure there was really no trolley available, I approached one of the airport police to ask for one. When it appeared that he was going to ask me to wait until they were brought out, I tried to look totally forlorn, my best rendition of a damsel in distress, replete with downcast eyes and quivering lips bitten between my teeth... and it worked. He asked me to follow him as he approached one of the entrance guards. Peeking in, he spotted one trolley just nearby, asked the guard to pull it out and both of them hoisted it up past the rails, after which, my hands grabbed at the handle bars like a clam closing up to protect it's pearl. I happily thanked the policeman and rolled my way back to the car. Apparently, Papa already got hold of one trolley. Where Papa had to give a whole leg and half an arm to get it, I only had to shed off my 'paawa' effect. Well... that's what women are made of, I think to mysel.<br /><br />Problem no. 2 was the travel tax queue... problem was there was no queue and the counter was plastered with people 4-breadth deep, a convolution of sweating, sticky bodies snuffing air out of existence. I sighed and ate my humble pie, and plunged myself into this sea of people... submitted my documents, paid my fees, and waited... and waited... and waited. In the end, I was awarded with my tax certificate, a stepped-on toe and a convergence of sweat on my skin.<br /><br />Problem no. 3 was luggage. Since Papa was a goldcard member at Krisflyer, we've never had to pay for extra luggage... now we did. What's funny is, I remember once, we flew with 90 kilos of luggage and we never had to pay a cent. I'm not sure how heavy our luggage was but they were now asking us to pay in excess of 70 kilos, which apparently was our luggage allowance. So much difference 14 kilos of butong pakwan and kornik makes, huh. Well, at least now we knew. Or maybe it's because the flight was so full, they really had no room to spare. This wouldn't have been a problem except... Papa and I were at our wits' ends, and so were our tempers. We needed a break, some time to breathe... which we barely had, cause we finished everything 10 minutes after boarding time.<br /><br />Still deciding we were going to have that break no matter what, we hoisted our 'heavy' hand-carry bag up the stairs to the 2nd floor restaurant where we had a coke, a quick smoke and 5 breaths. Having had that, we tugged at our bag again down the stairs, to boarding gate no. 5 and went straight to the plane.<br /><br />Now I'm here, back in Singapore, away from my family. I thank NAIA for all that it is, even the incompetence of its personnel because inspite of it, they are capable of pulling their act together to help a lady in need after all, if the situation called for it. I thank the crowd, the queue and some needless protocol because inspite of pissing me off, all of these things left me no time to cry and go sentimental about being away from my family again.<br /><br />And I thank the forces that be, because that night, after tearing myself away from my family, I still had a couple of loving arms to embrace me... I had Papa, cushioning me, protecting me.<br /><br />Three weeks... there is so much to share and share it I will. But like a love gone sour, it's simply too soon to talk about it... my heart's still aching and my eyes are still smarting with tears.<br /><br />Bear with me.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div><br />
