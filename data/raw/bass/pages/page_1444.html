<p align="center"> <font size="5"><b>2005 was an interesting year for PH. We played 
  many outdoor shows this year which is always fun when the weather cooperates,

<p align="center">12/31 Kelly's Pub, Tappan, NY. Our 9th gig at Kelly's and it 
  was New years EVE.We shared the stage with the great George Bragg Band, a rippin' 
  R7B band. 
<p align="center">2005 also was a good year for composing as we rehearsed 6 or 
  7 new original tunes as well as putting our spin on some classic B-side type 
  tunes from the age of Classic Rock.

<p align="center">Well,well,well, here it is FEBRUARY 2006 and I am finally able 
  and willing to start updating this site to a state where I feel it should be. 
<p align="center"> As previously predicted my job (which I love by the way) as 
  well as the on going trials and tribulations of being a member of a "Band". 
  Or as my late Father would say, "Combo" "How's the Combo coming along?" he would 
  ask. These gifts I shall call them have not come without some neglect to my 
  own personal direction in improvised music. Plans to record a 2nd solo CD have 
  been on hold for a while and the world will have to wait to hear any new music 
  from me, at least on CD. I will resume posting MP3's on the<a href="Music-main.html#DHK"> 
  Music page</A> of this site. 
<p align="center"> The big story is the "Band",<IMG height=248 src="graphics/TatooBandshot1.jpg" width=554 align=center ALT="Papa HooDoo at the Worlds Largest Tattoo Show, Secaucus, NJ. 2004." border=0> 
  Papa HooDoo Medicine Show. 
<p align="center"> Starting in February 2004 PH averaged 3 gigs a month in our 
  first year. This due to the efforts of our Friend, Fan and Shrink, Phil Nazzaro, 
  who went above and beyond to help this group of "diverse" musicians to keep 
  on searching to find our "own"! 
<p align="center"> After our first 2 gigs original member "Cousin Dave" moved 
  on to bigger things and we were also fortunate when ex-Stir Fried bassist Billy 
  Cristiani was able to join us "yesterday" as you could say! 
<p align="center"> Early on we were lucky enough to get some studio time at the 
  famous "Bennett" Studios in Englewood,NJ to record a Demo CD. 
<p align="center"> We also did some tracking/mixing at Music Machine Studios in 
  Hackensack,NJ for the demo CD. 
<p align="center"> Gigs worth mentioning, Mexicali Blues, Teaneck, NJ. Played 
  there a number of times. 
<p align="center"> Worlds Largest Tattoo Show, Meadowlands Expo Center, Secaucus, 
  NJ. Played 2 days, opening for the Marshall Tucker Band on the second day. 
<p align="center"> Our fan base was growing and 2005 was looking to be a good 
  year. I will add to my recollections of 2004 if and when they happen. 
<p align="center">Also of some interest has been my slow progress on the <a href="graphics/WJTABLA2.jpg"><FONT size=5>Tabla</FONT></a>, 
  a gift from good friend Jim Walck given to me in 2002. I have always loved this 
  instrument for its pure sound and incredible versatility. Since 2002 my time 
  practicing has been sporadic at best but I must admit that the last 2 years 
  or so I have made good progress. Technique and independence have come a long 
  way and I find that I break down barriers when my "conscious mind" is distracted 
  by something like watching the Simpsons. Theres also the wonderful feeling of 
  being "One" with the instrument and finding myself easily going into a "Zone". 
  To be honest, there have been times where I felt that this is the percussion 
  instrument I was truly born to play. 
<p align="center"> 
<p align="center"><font size="5">&#151; 2003 &#151;</font></p>
<p align="center">May - September, 2003. Having to get used to a 50 hour work 
  week again did put my plans to record my second and possibly third CD's on the 
  back burner but I did manage to spend the time finding some new avenues of exploration 
  on the DrumKAT and the Roland HPD-15 as well. The beginning of September saw 
  the start of a new band, The Papa Hoodoo Medicine Show, featuring Poor Bob (guitars/vocals), 
  Doc Lane (guitars/vocals), Jay "Jbird" Roosa (keyboards/harp/vocals), Billy 
  Cristiani (bass/vocals) and myself on Electronic Percussion. Gigs are forthcoming 
  so check the<A HREF="http://www.papahoodoo.com"> Papa Hoodoo Medicine Show</A>

<p align="center">Saturday, April 19,FRANK MESSINA &amp; SPOKEN MOTION'S 10th 
  ANNIVERSARY Blowout Party! We all had a fantastic time and the Bowery Poetry 
  Club is a great venue. Plenty of special guests and lots of music, two sets 
  of Frank and the band and the third set a jam session that last 'till the wee 
  hours. Pictured above is Larry McDonald, myself, Joe Isgro, Elliott Levin, and 
  Bob Sushko. Other pics and video clips of the gig can be seen on the Cool Links

<p align="center">December 31st, 2002, Ken Rubenstein and I had our third New 
  Years Jam here at my studio. Ken brought along his guitar and midi converter 
  so I was able to midi him up to some of my gear as well as an RC20 Loop pedal 
  to make him feel more at home. We tracked a few hours of improvizing and I will 
  be posting some of the better bits on my<a href="Music-main.html#DHK"> Music 
  page</A> as well as the IUMA site.</p>
<p align="center">November 2002, I started recording Electronic Drums for Chaz 
  Jones' next CD of originals, and I do believe I will be the only drummer featured 
  on this CD.</p>
<p align="center"><A NAME="VID"></a>October 8th 2002, I had a great time performing 
  with<a href="graphics/Frank2.jpg"> Frank Messina</A> and Spoken Motion at the 
  Ristra Lounge in Hoboken, NJ. A very hip venue with lots of atmosphere, we played 
  two sets to a very responsive audience. I not only got to groove with<a href="graphics/Job&Boe.jpg"> 
  Joe Isgro/Bass and Bob Sushko/Guitar</A>, and <a href="graphics/L&W1.jpg">"Roll 
  some Thunder" with percussionist Larry McDonald</A> (Gil Scott-Heron / Soulfly)

<p align="center">I drove to Iowa to visit and jam with my old friend Ken Rubenstein 
  during the week of July 4th 2002. We managed to record about 5 hours of music 
  which I will be featuring on my page at <a href="http://wesjensen.iuma.com">IUMA</A>. 
  Between Ken's Guitar Synth/Looping gear and my Electronic Percussion we are 
  able to generate a wide range of music, from song oriented Guitar/Drums duos 
  to "Shakti,like" jams to Orchestral suites. 
<p align="center">I spent the evening of June 8th 2002 performing with Spoken 
  Motion and Jamming with members of Stir Fried at Kelly's Pub in Tappan, NY to 
  celebrate the release of Frank Messina's new book of poetry, "Disorderly Conduct".
